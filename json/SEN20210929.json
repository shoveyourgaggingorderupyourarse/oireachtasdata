As we all know Fianna F&aacute;il has a very proud tradition in education.  Famously, and radically, in September 1966 Donogh O'Malley announced plans to introduce free second level education, something we take for granted now but at the time was very radical.  In 1996 our former colleague, Niamh Bhreathnach, introduced free third level fees, which was a game changer in regard to upskilling our workforce and attracting foreign investment.<\/p> <p>In 2005, our colleague on D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and former Minister, Mary Hanafin, introduced the DEIS programme, which is the subject of this Commencement matter and which was a life raft for many communities in parts of the city and country encountering social and economic deprivation.  The DEIS model, as we know it, was a game changer for our children.  Attainment rates to second and third level education soared but we cannot leave it there, we must still do more.<\/p> <p>Spending on education, as the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, will be aware, is money well spent, no matter how it is spent in our education system.  However, since the introduction of the DEIS programme, the application process and the selection criteria for DEIS is unfit.  Much of the criteria are performance based and just one of the indicators is socioeconomic thus the selection process is penalising some schools for performing well.  The DEIS identification process relies on data collected by the primary online database, POD, the post-primary online database, PPOD, and the Central Statistics Office, CSO, when measuring the level of disadvantage in an area.  The lack of transparency in the DEIS programme is something that I have previously highlighted.  Despite an anomaly as a result of the ongoing housing crisis, this data is still being used as a yardstick for allocating DEIS status to schools.<\/p> <p>In a survey I carried out in 2019, together with schools and principals in Dublin 8 and 12, it was clear that the proportion of pupils who were living in what has become known as hidden homelessness was rampant.  These are children who are sleeping on their grandparents' or aunts' sofas and not in emergency accommodation for the purposes of attending school.  Rather than leave the child in a vulnerable situation, their parents will disclose the address of the grandparent or aunt when asked by the school to provide a home address.   This information is then fed into the POD system and ultimately provides a distorted picture of the level of disadvantage in a particular area.  I know of three schools in Dublin South Central that were denied DEIS status.  Powerstown Education Together in Tyrrelstown is another such school.  These schools, including Our Lady of Good Counsel Girls' National School, the Assumption Girls' National School in Walkinstown, Drimnagh Castle Boys' National School and the Powerstown school are an island among DEIS schools in an area.  It is unfair that one might have a sister going to one national school and a brother going to another school which is a DEIS school.  Being included in the DEIS programme would have provided these schools with additional resources to support children, as it is shown to reduce drop out rates, increase attendance and improve results.<\/p> <p>In 2018 the Minister of State, Deputy Robert Troy, asked the then Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, about the status of the review and at that time he said the review was still under way and not yet complete.<\/p> <p>We all agree the DEIS model is a superb one.  The Department agrees the selection criteria is not ideal, which is why it is conducting a review.  When will the review be complete?  It was promised in 2005 and in 2018 the then Minister said it was under way.  We are three years on from 2018 so at what stage is it?<\/p> <p>It is a super programme and I want to acknowledge the Department's promised additional supports for DEIS schools in budget 2021.  This makes me more determined to fight for those schools that have been unfairly excluded from the DEIS programme.  We all agree DEIS is magnificent but could the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, let us know where we are with this review process which was promised? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#A00400","speaker":"1630"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I am delighted to see the new Seanad.

The DEIS plan sets out the vision for interventions in the critical area of educational disadvantage policy and is based on the findings of an extensive review of the DEIS programme, which involved consultations with all relevant stakeholders.<\/p><p>As the Senator will be aware, the programme for Government commits to completing \"the new DEIS identification model, ensuring the extension of DEIS status to schools that are identified as being suitable\".  A key part of the DEIS plan was the introduction of a new DEIS identification process based on an objective, statistics-based model to determine which schools merit inclusion in the programme.  The DEIS plan acknowledged that further work was required to refine the model.  For this reason, as part of the further extension of the DEIS programme to more schools, an extensive body of work has been undertaken to refine this model, based on the latest school enrolment data and data available from census 2016 under the HP deprivation index.  Senator Ardagh noted the key data sources - the primary online database and the post-primary online database and also the CSO data for the national census of population - taken into account when considering DEIS status.<\/p><p>A detailed quality analysis of the data has been carried out by members of the DEIS technical group, which includes representatives of the Department's statistics and social inclusion units, the inspectorate and the Educational Research Centre.  As Senator Ardagh correctly indicated, the Department has commenced a consultation process with education partners on the refinement of the model.  I understand work is now ongoing on final elements of the model.  It is envisaged that this will provide the basis for the development and application of a refined DEIS resource allocation model to ultimately match resources to identified need.<\/p><p>All schools will be considered for inclusion under the refined DEIS model.  I note the Senator mentioned some schools in her area that have not been included.  Until this work is complete, it is my understanding that it is not intended to extend the DEIS programme to any further schools.  I reassure the Senator that the Department is working to ensure that those most in need of support can be provided with the necessary resources to help them fulfil their potential in education.<\/p><p>Senator Ardagh will be aware that additional resources have been made available to DEIS schools in order to address educational disadvantage, such as an increase in the budget of the school completion programme, the expanded summer programme, which increased from &euro;20 million to &euro;40 million this year, and the reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio for DEIS band 1 schools.  This year, the Department will spend in the region of &euro;150 million on the DEIS programme and we will seek to increase investment in this area and continue exploration of new approaches to support students at risk of educational disadvantage.

It is a considerable number, but that is not to say that other schools should not be included.  We must support children from disadvantaged areas.  Senator Ardagh will also be aware of the multiplier effect in that even if a child is from a different socioeconomic background and attends a school where the majority of children are from a disadvantaged background, that will affect his or her academic outcome.

Phase 1 of the roadworks was completed nearly 30 years ago, so we have been waiting a long time for the completion of the road.  At this stage, it has been talked about for nearly a generation.  It is a major issue in terms of ensuring a town the size of Bandon can be fit for purpose.  Bandon is the biggest town in and the gateway to west Cork.  All traffic for west Cork goes through the town.<\/p> <p>In the review of the national development plan, we must ensure that projects such as phase 2 of the southern relief road are prioritised.  We are in the bizarre position that all heavy vehicles must go through Bandon because they cannot cope with the gradient of the previous bypass.  Anything from 9,000 to 14,000 vehicles pass my office in South Main Street every day.  Bandon has been smothered as a result.  Funding must be found and a timeline put in place to ensure the southern relief road is developed and Bandon gets a chance to become a beautiful town.<\/p> <p>There has been significant investment in Bandon in the past decade.  The main drainage scheme and the flood relief scheme have been prioritised.  This has resulted in major changes to the town.  We are now going through a major phase of public renewal and redevelopment, which will also change the urban landscape of Bandon.  A lot of good things are happening in the town but the key piece of the jigsaw, phase 2 of the southern relief road, is missing.  It was for this reason that I tabled this Commencement matter seeking an update from the Department on its plans for this important infrastructure.<\/p> <p>Will the Minister of State inform the House of the timelines and costings for the proposed phase 2 of the southern relief road?  I am very concerned about the costings.  I raised the issue in 2019 with the then Minister, the former Deputy Ross, who gave a costing of &euro;7.5 million.  I am very concerned about the level the costings will have reached by now given the inflation in the construction sector.  The sooner we get the project started and finished, the better because we will have better value for money for phase 2.

The N71 relief road around Bandon ties back into the existing road network via a steep downhill gradient and drivers also need to negotiate a number of roundabouts and priority junctions within the built-up area of Bandon, of which I am sure the Senator is acutely aware.  I understand when he says the town is smothered.  It is chock-a-block, which costs a lot of time and causes delays.  It does not help business trading in a town to have so many trucks on the main street.  Road safety is also a key issue when so many large vehicles are passing through a busy town.<\/p><p>The N71 experiences heavy traffic, with annual daily traffic of between 9,000 and 14,000 vehicles.  The proposed relief road extension would involve bridging over the R603 to remove the existing steep gradient and construction of approximately 2.5 km of new single-lane carriageway, tying back to the existing N71 just to the west of the town.  A feasibility study was completed by Cork County Council and Transport Infrastructure Ireland is reviewing the study.  The project assessment plan was approved by the Department in 2020 and work on early planning and design will continue in 2021, with a preferred route for the bypass extension yet to be identified.<\/p><p>As this project is in the early stages of planning, it is not possible to provide an accurate estimate of the total costs at this stage.  The Senator referred to an earlier figure, but that was a preliminary estimate at that stage.  The estimated cost cannot be finalised until the project reaches the business case stage of the process.  However, TII allocated &euro;100,000 to Cork County Council to progress the planning and design in this calendar year.  TII has informed the Department the approximate cost of progressing phase 2 would be an additional &euro;200,000.  This would fund works such as a ground investigation, water monitoring and some archaeological works.<\/p><p>Pending future funding availability, Cork County Council hopes to progress the scheme to planning permission stage in the coming years.  The timescale will be at least three years because water monitoring, archaeological works and identifying a preferred route take time.  The timeframe for delivery of any major or minor roads project that requires statutory approval, whether for an environmental impact assessment, a compulsory purchase order, CPO, or both, is normally between eight and 13 years.  That can mean from beginning to end.  Normally, the assessment takes 80% of the delivery time, whereas construction normally accounts for only 20% of the entire time of a project.<\/p><p>All projects, including those listed in the national development plan or the revised national plan, require statutory approval and compliance with the public spending code.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#B00800","speaker":"1590","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":21,"content":"<p>When we are doing the review of the national development plan, we must ensure that projects such phase 2 of the southern relief road in Bandon are included.

The same applies to projects throughout the country.  It is important that the Government focuses on ensuring we have a road programme that sorts out these issues.  When it comes to the Bandon southern relief road, time is money.  I am very concerned about where the costs will go on a project of this nature.

This Commencement matter is a practical way to update an existing and very important scheme, which is in line with our sustainable and carbon neutral ambition.  We should be cognisant of the huge cost to living with a disability.  I have been working with some of our &Oacute;gra Fianna F&aacute;il members on this proposal, notably Brian Crehan from Kildare North.<\/p> <p>Disabled persons have not been properly accommodated or encouraged by the green initiatives taken by the Government, in particular, on electric cars.  To provide equity among the most vulnerable in our society, special and extra arrangements should be made to facilitate those with mobility issues in the green transition.  We ask for a expansion of the tax relief and fuel allowances available under the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme.<\/p> <p>I ask the Minister to look at three areas.  First, I would like to expand the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme.  The scheme currently covers tax relief in the form of remission of vehicle registration tax, VRT, repayment of VAT on purchase of a vehicle and on the cost of adapting that vehicle.  We ask the Minister to expand the scheme to include electric and hybrid electric vehicles across the three areas of that tax relief, mainly the remission of VRT on electric and hybrid electric vehicles and repayment of VAT on the purchase of electric vehicles and the cost of adapting them.<\/p> <p>Second, I ask the Minister to increase the maximum rate of reimbursement in order to incentivise the green transition.  The maximum amounts available under the scheme are &euro;10,000 for disabled drivers and &euro;16,000 for disabled passengers.  There is a cap of &euro;16,000 on the amount available for specially adapted vehicles for drivers with severe disabilities and a cap of &euro;22,000 on extensively adapted vehicles.  We ask the Minister to increase the reimbursement figures by up to 50% to allow for the higher cost of purchase and adaption of electric vehicles.<\/p> <p>Third, I ask the Minister to look at the fuel allowance.  Disabled drivers who qualify under the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme are given a fuel allowance for up to 2,730 l per annum.  We ask the Minister to consider expanding this tax relief allowance to include electric charging to the maximum amount, which would possibly reach between 120 and 240 per 100 km.<\/p> <p>The most glaring and obvious challenge our citizens with disabilities face is mobility and essentially being trapped in their own homes or small community.  The statistics back that up, in that 24% of our people with disabilities do not have access to a car or van, compared with 12% of the general population.  If we could expand the scheme and assist, incentivise and empower people to make environmentally conscious choices, it could be a clear and definitive way of helping disabled persons to adapt their car and have a mode of transport and would incentivise them to make the green choice we all want to make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#C00400","speaker":"1671"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I thank Senator McGreehan for raising this matter.

In order to qualify for a primary medical certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled and satisfy one of the following conditions, as set out in the Finance Act 1989: be wholly or almost wholly without legs or the use of both legs; be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; be without both hands or without both arms; be without one or both legs; be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; or have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.  It is very narrow and specific.  As everyone will know, the issue relating to the primary medical certificate resulting from recent court decisions is under review.  A working group is currently working on that to update the conditions and make sure the scheme is consistent with the legislation.<\/p><p>The scheme represents a significant tax expenditure.  Between the vehicle registration tax, VRT, VAT foregone and the fuel grant, the scheme cost rose from &euro;50 million in 2015 to &euro;67 million in 2020.  This figure does not include the revenue foregone in respect of motor tax, which is paid directly by the people concerned.  The drivers and passengers with disabilities scheme provides for the remission or repayment of VRT up to certain limits.  The Finance Act 1992 further provides that a category A series production vehicle can avail of relief of up to &euro;5,000 on the VRT due.  Under the drivers and passengers with disabilities scheme, there is no differentiation between electric and other vehicles in terms of VRT or VAT refund.  The amount of VRT due or paid on a vehicle is remitted or repaid up to the maximum relief applicable, which is &euro;10,000 for VRT or VAT relief in most cases.  As there is a separate VRT relief for electric vehicles provided for by section 135C(3)(b) of the Finance Act 1992, the amount of VRT due or paid on an electric vehicle may be lower than the maximum relief permitted.  In such a case the VRT relief will equate to the actual VRT paid.  The VAT element of the refund is given regardless of whether it is an electric vehicle.  There is no distinction as to the category of the vehicle.<\/p><p>Members of the scheme may claim payment of a fuel grant based on a per litre rate of 61.9 cent for petrol, 51.5 cent for diesel and 11.8 cent for liquefied petroleum gas.  Outside of the disabled drivers and passengers scheme, full battery-electric vehicles can currently avail of a VRT relief of &euro;5,000.  Since 2008 VRT has been calculated according to a vehicle's CO2 emissions.  Budget 2021 introduced a new VRT charging rate for low-emission vehicles.  My time is up but I will provide further information in the second round.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#C00500","speaker":"1590","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":27,"content":"<p>As the Minister of State mentioned, the primary medical certificate is not perfect.

This, coupled with the relief, means that many electric vehicles end up paying no VRT at all.

This matter relates to the negative consequences of schedule changes for the registration of rights of way after 30 November.  What plans does the Government have to initiate or support legislative change to extend this deadline and prevent these changes?  What the timeline is there for that action and what further engagement will the Department have with civil society, Oireachtas Members and the Law Reform Commission?<\/p> <p>This is an issue I have been working on for over a year.  I engaged initially with the Minister of State with responsibility for heritage.  I did so from the perspective of heritage.  Then I engaged with the Minister responsible for planning and development.  I acknowledge that the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, wrote to the Department of Justice last June to say that while he could not accept my amendments on planning he believed they should be considered by the Department.  I also proposed and sought amendments to the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021 that came through from the Department of Justice before the summer.<\/p> <p>This is an issue that has been coming up and that has been flagged for over a year.  However, it seems that over the summer there has been a realisation of what the consequences could be, and I welcome that.  I do not need to go through all of the law as the Minister of State will be very familiar with it but effectively, the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 and the subsequent 2011 Act brought in a change whereby there was a transition period for the registration of a private right of way or easement.  Previously, one had to establish 20 years of continuous use.  Following these changes in 2009 and 2011, a transition period was set whereby people would have to have formally registered and that period is due to expire on 1 December next.  This trouble has been coming for a long time.  It has been exacerbated by Covid and the fact that public awareness of this issue has been limited.  It was signalled to the Government by the Law Society, which has stated that even if people lodged claims now, the likelihood of those claims being processed in time would be minimal.  It has also been highlighted by the Irish Farmers Association, IFA.  This issue is important in terms of the legal confusion that would be created but also because of the damage to accessibility, community, and connectivity.  At a time when we are promoting the permeability of the ten-minute town and the 15-minute city, we are in danger of closing off a lot of the points of connection for many families.  There is also that heritage component.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State will be aware that yesterday I introduced my own legislation to extend the deadline by five years.  This is in line with the Law Society's request for a six-year extension, while the IFA had looked for three years.  I would be open to both of those but I lodged my Bill with the Bills Office last July so I had to proceed with my suggestion of five years, which, I think, represents a very reasonable compromise and gives space for further public engagement on the issue.  Crucially, it will also allow the Law Reform Commission to look to the issue in more depth.  This is important from the perspective of the past, in terms of preserving rights of way that have been used for generations, but also for the future.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I have emphasised this at meetings of the climate committee.

It needs to be done urgently given the 30 November deadline.  I was disappointed when I saw the legislative calendar for the autumn term circulated yesterday that I did not see legislation on this from the Department of Justice.  I would like the Minister of State to clarify how and when this will be addressed.  I urge that it will be stand-alone legislation and is not tagged into other potentially more controversial legislation and then not getting through, when it is an issue that has extraordinarily wide support from rural and urban areas, from the IFA, the Law Society and from lots of community groups.

I know it is something she has been working on for some time.  It is a matter of concern for quite a number of people.<\/p> <p>This matter relates to a change in the law on prescriptive rights of way that was due to take effect on 30 November 2021.  A prescriptive right of way is one acquired by long use as of right by a property owner over a neighbour's land which is not recorded in any surviving title deed.  Common examples are rights to access a farm or dwelling house where the access laneway is privately owned by one or more neighbours.  Public rights of way are rights contained in written title deeds are not affected.<\/p> <p>As Senator Higgins rightly points out, the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009, as amended in 2011, introduced a new requirement for these rights based on long use to be verified by a court order or an uncontested application for registration and register with the Property Registration Authority, PRA.  Up to 30 November, this could be done based on existing legal rules on establishing long use.  After that the registration would still be possible but only under new legal rules.<\/p> <p>The Minister, Deputy Humphreys has consulted with a range of stakeholders, including the Law Society, Bar Council, Law Reform Commission and PRA, and listened carefully to the concerns raised.  It is clear that there remains legal uncertainty about how the new rules may be interpreted and that it has not yet been possible to register many important rights of way that appear to have been enjoyed for many years without dispute.  These problems are causing significant delays in conveyancing and in loan applications.<\/p> <p>The Minister is satisfied that, if not addressed, the deadline was likely to lead to unnecessary litigation between neighbours, causing needless stress and legal costs.  As an interim solution, on 21 September, the Minister secured Cabinet approval for a short amending Bill.  It will be a stand-alone measure to be enacted before the November deadline.  Consistent with the strong preference indicated by stakeholders, the Bill will remove the major changes to the law on prescriptive rights that were due to take effect after 30 November, thus removing and not extending the upcoming deadline.  This is also expected to greatly reduce current conveyancing blockages.  The reason that it is not on the priority legislation list is technical and relates to the fact that a Bill must be published before it can go onto the priority list.  However, I assure the Senator that it is an absolute priority.  It needs to be passed before the deadline.  It now has Cabinet approval and will be a stand alone Bill.  The Department of Justice is in ongoing consultation with stakeholders on this priority Bill.  The Minister has also obtained agreement to set up a time-bound review, to identify any further legal reforms required after 30 November, in this complex legal area.<\/p> <p>We need to grasp the nettle here.  There have been several extensions.  This matter is causing distress.  It causes worry for the individual rights owners and communities and is causing untold headaches for solicitors, barristers and legal representatives.  A decision must be made on whether it is removed altogether or on whether, perhaps, a different amendment needs to be brought in.  We need to establish the permanent solution to the problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#E00200","speaker":"1618"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":33,"content":"<p>The concern relates to instances where a person might have had a right of way that has been used for many generations.

We know that some have been moving blockages into place in certain rights of way and things have been set up for problems in anticipation of that.<\/p> <p>I welcome that the Department is removing the provisions.  I would appreciate engagement around that because I have my own legislation for extension and I need to see Government legislation before I remove it.  The crucial thing is that we take action before 30 November in order that we have the space to look at what the solutions might be.  I hope the Minister of State will indicate that he will engage with myself and others.

My office was contacted by people asking what they should do about registering rights of way.  Problems have arisen as Ireland has become more mobile.

I know of the case of a couple where the people who own the neighbouring land have dementia.  Those people are in a home and getting all this resolved is proving very challenging.  I 100% agree that we need to address the immediate problem and then come up with a final decision about what we are going to do here because we cannot simply keep extending it.  That only creates new stress for people further down the line.  I will certainly get the Department to engage with the Senator.  I acknowledge that she has been raising this matter for quite some time.  Under the Bill, the law applicable to prescriptive easements and profits will largely be reverted to judge-made law that was employed before the passing of the 2009 Act.  As the Senator said, the majority of legal people believe the clock set to zero.  There was some belief that equitable rights would still remain and that was creating confusion in the legal world.  It is absolutely right that we take this action.  We hope and expect that the urgent Bill will have cross-party support in both Houses.

That is the total of &euro;410.  The figure does not include the cost of legal fees associated with court attendance, etc.  To put that into perspective, that represents an extra &euro;8,200 per month in charges for a late-night venue that operates five nights per week in any of our cities across the country, so that it can open its doors late.<\/p> <p>As Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann will be aware, the Government has already signalled its intention to reform licensing laws and to abolish the current late-night fee system.  We are emerging from a pandemic that has hammered the hospitality sector.  Many of the businesses that will be seeking special exemption orders in the coming months will have been closed for almost 600 days before they reopen.

My issue around this is twofold.  We have ambitious plans about electric vehicles in this country.  We want to have 1 million electric vehicles on our roads by 2030.  At the same time, there are reports from the Department of Finance that new car prices intend to jump by &euro;1,300 for normal cars and, for electric vehicles, up to &euro;4,100 under budget proposals.  That is a result of the Department of Finance's tax strategy group last week, which put forward changes to the VRT system.  This will mean the tax rates on regular car emissions would increase by 2% and 5%.  The issue is that we want to reach our ambitious long-term climate action targets while at the same time, other arms of Government are coming out with proposals that will hinder and slow this down.  Many people in this country want to make the right choices when it comes to climate action and to play a role.  Even today, despite there being so many financial incentives and grants towards electric vehicles, they are still out of many people's price range.<\/p><p>When we look to Europe to some of countries that have taken up electric vehicles, Finland stands out as a country where it has increased hugely in the last three years.  Finland has swamped the market with financial incentives for electric vehicles.  There are so many financial incentives that it would be mad to not drive an electric vehicle in Finland.<\/p><p>In the last day or two, we have had many calls for Members of this House for a debate on transport.

I circulated to every Member of the House a story about the meat industry and the issues of concern that were published in <i>The Guardian<\/i>and which had huge traction both in the UK and in Ireland in the last 24 hours.  I suggested that when any of us tuck into our next chicken breast, we might consider the plight of the workers and the horrific stories in that article in regard to Ireland and people who have come into Ireland via various routes and through employment agencies to work in the sector here.  One woman described having to pull and pack 20,000 chicken breasts.  When she was ill and having her period, she asked to go to the bathroom and she was refused.  Various other things are described in this article.  The article goes on to attribute issues around the Workplace Relations Commission and to suggest &ldquo;the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), says it has no data in relation to the number of meat workers hired by agencies and sub-contractors&rdquo; in this country.  That surely has to be alarming.<\/p><p>It is an horrific story.  These are people who have come into this country with hope, ambition, excitement and the possibility of a new life.  These are the invisible migrant workers who are propping up Ireland's &euro;4 billion meat industry.  It cannot be allowed to happen and we should not stand by idly.  We should stand in solidarity with these people.  Some of these people have not been regularised.  In a documentary which I downloaded yesterday, some other people talk about how they were so ill that they were popping pills to reduce their temperature for fear they would show up in regard to Covid when coming into the workforce.  Some of these people are working 60 hours a week in our meat industry.<\/p><p>I say that as someone conscious of the concerns around agriculture.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I am elected on the agricultural panel of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I do not want to ruin this industry.  I want this to be a good, clean and honourable industry with integrity but, more importantly, I am concerned about the workforce that is producing chickens that we might very well consume and eat here in Leinster House, and we certainly consume and eat them in restaurants around this country.  We must stand in solidarity with these workers.<\/p><p>I am pleased to say I had an email the very first thing this morning, within minutes of circulating this, from Deputy Ivana Bacik, who has committed to raising it in the D&aacute;il.  My ask here today is that we all stand in solidarity with these workers.  I know the Leader would have a particular interest, knowledge and experience of issues around employment rights, being a Minister with responsibility in these areas in the past.  Let us all stand together in solidarity and fight for the equal rights of these workers and, equally, to protect our agriculture and agrifood sector, which is a really important industry for the Irish economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#H00300","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":47,"content":"<p>Over the last number of years, there have been improvements in the area of animal welfare but we still have a very long way to go in this country.  This week alone, anybody who was listening to the radio would have been horrified by the stories of animal abuse and torture.  Ireland still holds the reputation of being the puppy farm capital of Europe.<\/p> <p>Many of the animal welfare issues we have in this country could be easily addressed if the political will was there.  Take, for example, the online sale of pets.  The regulations on the online sale and supply of pets are in place for 20 months now and there is yet to be a single enforcement taken by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine - not a single case.  This is despite animal welfare organisations spending hours, every single day of the week, having to scan through the online platforms and reporting to the online platforms, and then waiting for the advert to go down, by which time the dog is already sold on and the mobile number is no longer active.  These are animal welfare volunteers who are spending their time doing this when they could be doing much more important work.<\/p> <p>Instead of taking on board their eminently sensible and cheap proposals, all we are asking the Minister to do is put in place a central database that brings together the information on the dog breeding establishments, where they are located and how many breeding bitches each dog breeding establishment has onsite, and also to bring together the information on the microchip number so it corresponds to the actual dog that the microchip is registered to.  We do this for cars, so it is not sophisticated software that is needed.  We could do it just as well for dogs and that would allow for pre-verification of the adverts.<\/p> <p>Currently, the position of the Government is to tell us to do our homework, to tell the person who is buying the dog to go and do their homework and to tell the online platforms that they have to do better.  However, they are not equipped with the tools to it.  A central database would allow them to do this.  We would also like the Minister to run a public awareness campaign telling people not to pay cash for animals, given the amount of tax that is being forgone by the Exchequer in this multi-million euro industry because we do not inform people why it is so wrong to pay cash for animals.<\/p> <p>Yesterday, the programme for the autumn legislative session included the Animal Health and Welfare (Amendment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021 to address fur farming.  That is great because we need to ban fur farming.  Unfortunately, I asked the Minister without success to extend its scope to take on board the legislation that I have ready to go, which would close down the loophole on smuggling and allow for any animals that are seized at the ports, puppies included, to be rehomed within five days, rather than having to wait for the court process to be completed, which takes anything up to 12 to 18 months.<\/p> <p>This House needs to have a debate on animal welfare and it would be an opportune moment now that we have those two pieces of legislation on the legislative programme.  I ask the Leader to consider having such a debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#H00400","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I want to raise the issue that we see in the media today, namely, the living wage technical group said we need a living wage of &euro;12.90, which is &euro;2.70 higher than the current minimum wage.  That is an increase of 60 cent on last year and it is mainly caused by the rising cost of rent.  It is calculated that people on the minimum wage are spending some 64% of their salary on rent, which is two times what is considered affordable, which is generally about a third of income.  This underlines the need for a three-year rent freeze in order to try to make rents more affordable for people who are living on the edge, the working poor who need a rent freeze.  The basics of life are increasing, in particular in regard to the right to a home and energy costs.<\/p> <p>I would like the Leader to schedule a debate on the issue of a living wage and how that fits into housing costs.  I recognise we are having a debate on Housing for All later but we have to focus on the issue of renters, the unaffordability of renting and those people who are on the edges of society and spending such a high proportion of their salary on rent, with no chance of ever owning their own home and no chance of their living costs or their rental costs going down.<\/p> <p>On a related matter, I see today that a circular has been issued to local authorities on student accommodation guidelines.  A little like the situation with investors, it is to be seen to be doing something without actually doing something.  The Government has said that the circular sent to local authorities leaves them in no doubt that student accommodation changes of use should not be done without a compelling reason.  The situation where 1,000 students beds in Dublin have been changed over to tourist accommodation also happened under the same guidance because it was contained in the development plans that there should not be a changeover and there should not be over-concentration in certain areas.  It needs to be stronger than simple guidance.  It is like writing a letter and asking for something to be done without having proper backup in legislative terms or having more compelling guidelines in order to be able to do it.

It was a powerful launch.  MEAI was formed in June 2020 as a result of the pandemic which decimated the entire industry.  Since then it has worked tirelessly, on a voluntary basis, to represent the industry to Government and help find solutions to reopen the industry.  I am privileged to be one of 11 Oireachtas Members involved with the MEAI committee, which was established in May 2021.  Thankfully many of its members were in attendance today to support the pre-budget submission.  The theme of the MEAI submission is invigorate, involve and inspire, which I thought was wonderful.  I believe its requests will help to rebuild and regrow the industry through the plans of invigoration and involvement.<\/p> <p>I wanted to highlight two requests in particular.  MEAI has requested an increase in funding for the independent live entertainment sector from &euro;50 million to &euro;75 million.  It suggested a number of schemes for this &euro;75 million which would create employment opportunities for workers in the sector.  This would be done through inclusion and interaction between the sector and children, people with disabilities and the elderly.  These schemes are directly targeted towards local authority schemes and bringing music and entertainment back into communities that have been starved of the experience for over 18 months.  <\/p> <p>MEAI has also requested a pilot scheme for artists with disabilities which seeks to remove the income threshold for artists in receipt of disability payments from the Department of Social Protection.  This scheme would empower those artists and promote self growth and development in their work and personal lives.  <\/p> <p>Other requests include: the implementation of universal basic income for artists; the application of reduced VAT rates for performers and bands in the sector; the creation of a Covid-19 insurance guarantee scheme for events; and a census of the music and entertainment industry in Ireland.  We all know and have experienced the joy of live music, as I did outside this morning.  It was lovely to hear music at the launch.  It was a reminder that we can never take music and entertainment for granted again and must protect and value it in the future.  I want to call on the Minister, Deputy Martin, and her colleagues in the Government to consider and act on the requests in the MEAI pre-budget submission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#J00200","speaker":"1632"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I endorse the remarks of Senator Black around the importance of music and the arts.

Things have been difficult and we need to support the sector as it reopens.<\/p> <p>I want to raise the question of pensions.  I am concerned by some of the very populist debate that is happening around pensions at the moment and that we are not thinking sufficiently long-term.  Those who will sit their leaving certificate next year will probably not retire until the late 2060s or early 2070s.  They will have a life expectancy of 90.  They will live a lot longer.  The big difference between now and 30 years' time is that at the moment there are five people working for every one person who has retired but within 30 years we will be in a situation where, on current projections, we will only have two workers for everybody over the age of 65.  I worry that this timebomb is something we are not addressing. <\/p> <p>When we are having a debate around what age people should retire at now, we are not looking at the bigger picture.  We continue to kick the can down the road.  Many of our fellow European countries, such as Italy, Germany and France, have failed to address this issue and that has now led to large-scale social unrest and disagreement between the generations.  I worry that because of our failure to address this long-term issue, and given some of the populist language being used during the pensions debate, those now aged in their teens, 20s and 30s will suffer far more because we are not having a realistic debate.  I ask for a comprehensive and real debate on the long-term implications of pensions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#J00300","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":52,"content":"<p>We all know the difficulties young people have faced in getting time to sit driving tests and the knock-on effect that has had on people who have to travel to or need to drive for work.  I welcome the work done by the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, to address the backlog and provide an opportunity for people who need licences to get tests early.<\/p> <p>However, I was contacted by a young woman in my area who requires an adaptation to drive her vehicle.  It seems there exists an extraordinary situation whereby persons who use an adapted vehicle for whatever reason are not subject to the same test as everybody else.  They need a special tester and test, and there is no waiting list available to them.  People who need adapted vehicles are arguably those who need their cars more than most, but they cannot get onto a cancellation list.  They have to wait longer and there is still a problem addressing the backlog for those vehicles.  <\/p> <p>I do not understand why every tester is not competent to test a person trying an adapted vehicle.  We should examine the situation with a view to having a driver testing regime that is available to everybody on an equal footing so that those who need a licence can do their tests and move on.  That should apply as much to people who require an adapted vehicle as it does to people who do not.  Can we have a debate on this issue?

I do not think many of us would have gotten involved if it was the case.<\/p> <p>However, a strange confusion seems to have arisen whereby commemorating something or marking it, one is somehow celebrating it.

I ask for the debate because people are extremely fearful and worried about price hikes and blackouts.<\/p> <p>It seems to me, and to a lot of people, that every time there is an interview on this whether it is on RT&Eacute;'s \"Drivetime\" or \"Morning Ireland\" that the narrative changes.  A number of days ago the narrative was that the Government was fully confident, next the situation is very tight, next was that no guarantees can be given and now the message is that EirGrid is at the pin of its collar.  The narrative is not going in a direction that generates confidence.  We need a serious debate in the Seanad about what is going to happen over the next number of months because when one speaks to people privately within the sector, one learns they feel there is an inevitability to blackouts in this country, which harks back to the 1970s.  When we are trying to explain to people how there is a potential for energy costs to rise by &euro;400 a year yet at the same time there will be blackouts then we need to put a plan in place.  Price hikes and blackouts are unacceptable.<\/p> <p>I appreciate that a number of things will be done, hopefully, in the budget to support the most vulnerable but all sectors will be hit.  Clearly, it is critical that we assist the most vulnerable but every single individual in this State will feel the impact.  Businesses also need certainty that there will be no blackouts, that there is capacity and that if blackouts take place, there are back-up plans.  I appreciate that we debated these matters yesterday but we must invite the Minister himself to the House for a debate as a matter of urgency. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#L00200","speaker":"1629"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising such an important issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#L00300","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":70,"content":"<p>We have a very proud tradition in this country of people volunteering, supporting, helping and setting up support organisations.  Throughout Covid we experienced a lot of that activity at community level.<\/p> <p>As recent events in the media suggest, and I will not refer to a specific case but from my own experience from working in criminal law, there are organisations that set up voluntarily to assist in drug rehabilitation.  These organisations may be faith-based and may assist young people who seek to rehabilitate themselves and we have heard about recent cases.  One issue in this regard pertains to an exception under the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act whereby anything that is on a loose or casual relationship basis does not require the people involved in such work to be Garda vetted.  I appreciate that the Minister for Justice has conducted over a number of months a comprehensive and thorough review of the Garda vetting system.  I have fed into the review on other issues.  I have written to the Minister that we need to address the definition of what is a vulnerable person because it is too narrow in the Act.  I also mentioned that we need to address the definition of what sort of activity requires the oversight of Garda vetting.  Otherwise, there is a risk that we assume people are vulnerable and caught within that definition but are not and are open to the possibility of being exploited for a variety of reasons.  I mean not merely alleged sexual abuse or otherwise but for a variety of other types of exploitation.  I know of one organisation that offered an alleged drug rehabilitation course to young people who were recovering from drug addiction yet within a couple of days had them collecting money on the streets for the organisation.  There is a whole array of organisations that we assume to be all right yet they are not.  I call for a debate in this House to be arranged on voluntary oversight and our definitions, and understanding, of same. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#L00400","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I join with Senator Boylan on the issue of animals.  My dog of 11 years died recently and I wanted to replace him.  As one cannot find pups in the various rescue centres at the moment, I decided to search online and discovered that puppies are being sold for up to &euro;3,000 each.  Let us think about the outrageous amount of money that can be earned from one litter of pups.  There also are puppy farms where female dogs are forced to quickly produce litter after litter of pups.  As the money that is involved in this game is astronomical, I fully what Senator Boylan is trying to do.<\/p> <p>Last night, the Minister for Defence came in here and I am delighted that he has accepted the word of the women in the Women of Honour group.  I am delighted to see that Major General Se&aacute;n Clancy, the new Chief of Staff, is taking a very robust line with respect to the discipline that is required of soldiers serving in the Defence Forces.<\/p> <p>There is an issue of corporate governance within the Defence Forces that must be addressed immediately.  There are as many as 600 vacant junior managerial posts, that is, corporals, sergeants and company sergeants, within the enlisted ranks.  We have had a dearth of commissioned officers run through the Curragh over the last number of years to try to build up the commissioned officers.  However, we still have situations where young commissioned officers are going into units and taking over platoons of up to 30 men in their first commission without any serious mentoring taking place.  When I served in the 1st Infantry Battalion in Galway, we had a parade every morning at 9 a.m.  That parade was taken by the colonel in charge of the battalion.  One had the adjutant and every company commander on parade.  One had every lieutenant on parade with their platoons.  One had every platoon sergeant and company sergeant.  We were all there and everybody knew where everybody stood.  The chain of command was perfectly clear with everybody.  If there was indiscipline, it was witnessed by the most junior ranks and dealt with immediately.  I do not suggest that not having these people in place is an excuse for what has happened.  What I am saying is that one minimises the opportunities if one has the people in place with responsibility to take over.  So I really think that we must deal with the unfilled vacancies for promotional posts in the Defence Forces as a matter of urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#L00500","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":72,"content":"<p>I welcome the announcement made today by the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, to expand the walks scheme.  This is a fantastic way to support rural and regional development.  Government investment in the regions is all part of our rural future.  As there is now funding for 31 new trails in 13 counties, there will be a lot more places all around Ireland for people to explore.  The Department is working with over 2,400 farmers and landowners.

That would be the Beara-Breifne Way, the whole way from Cork to Cavan and all the way up to Blacklion.  It is an amazing route going along by the River Suck in between Galway and Roscommon.  It is absolutely fantastic and I thank the volunteers who have worked on this within the Suck Valley Way and within the Lung-Lough Gara committee.  It is a great development.  It will bring more people and more footfall into areas around Castlerea and Ballaghadereen.  Ballaghadereen also has its new street enhancement fund, which comes from the rural regeneration and development fund.  This is crucial to bring more people into our area.<\/p><p>This Friday we have the launch of the new Technological University of the Shannon, TUS, in Athlone, about which the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Simon Harris has spoken much this year.  This will be an amazing development for the west.  We want to see more campuses.  It will bring more investment into our region, linking up industry with third level institutions, with academia and with excellence.  I want to see our campuses expand also.  This university is an amalgamation of Athlone and Limerick institutes of technology.  It will be a phenomenal base in the Shannon area to bring investment west.  I thank the Minister for that.  I look forward to the development under the realm of Professor Vincent Cunnane and Professor Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; Cath&aacute;in.

The expansion of the walks scheme this morning as announced by the Minister is very welcome, particularly in the past 18 months when plenty of Irish citizens took to walking and cycling as we did not really have an awful lot else to do.  Investment in the beautiful routes in rural Ireland is very welcome.<\/p> <p>On Senator Craughwell's point, it often astounds me as to who has &euro;3,000 to spend on a dog in the first place.  There is no doubt that prices for dogs have gone up in the past 18 months because people were at home and took to taking in pets.  Now, as people are returning to the office, the reports are that these pets are abandoned.  It is a real stain on the Irish character that people would do that and not welcome a pet into their homes for life and not just for a period of time.<\/p> <p>I am aware of how passionate Senator Craughwell is about the Defence Forces - and I say to him respectfully, I do not mean any criticism - but he said in his contribution this morning that he was not saying that vacant positions were an excuse for what has happened with regard to the \"Women of Honour\".  I do not believe that there is an excuse.  I believe there is a prevailing culture within our Defence Forces that is misogynistic and which believes that women are less equal than men.  I absolutely stamp that out.  This is not acceptable in any agency of the country.  I welcome the speed at which this is being taken seriously by the Minister, the new Secretary General in the Department of Defence, Ms Jacqui McCrum, and by the Chief of Staff Sean Clancy, who has just been appointed.<\/p> <p>I sometimes wonder about the way we refer to the issue.  I listened to Brian Dobson on RT&Eacute; 1 news yesterday when he discussed this particular issue and the meeting that was to take place between the Minister and the \"Women of Honour\", and he talked about them telling their stories.  Victims of sexual abuse, harassment, misogyny or workplace discrimination do not have \"stories\" to tell; they have experiences or allegations to put on the record.  The words around this kind of unacceptable behaviour really matter.  We have seen how, over the past couple of days, one of those women was so fearful that she had to come anonymously and raise her story.  Words matter and we must believe victims when they come forward and tell us their experiences or make allegations.  We absolutely have to respond accordingly.  I really welcome the Senator mentioning this here this morning. <\/p> <p>Senator Seery Kearney spoke about a similar topic.  We have had the experience in recent weeks of allegations that were made of the most extreme nature against a particular charity.  While I welcome the Garda Commissioner stating that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will need to review the definition of vulnerable people, I do not know why we have to wait until something as awful and horrendous was exposed to realise that people who are living on our streets who have no home, no security and no family support systems around them are vulnerable.  Surely to God they are some of the most vulnerable people in the State.  I do not find it acceptable that we are going to get another review that will probably take 18 months to find out the changes we need to make to some language definitions.  Even if we do have to wait for the changes to be made in legislation, the changes in practice could be happening between now and Friday.  I do not believe it is acceptable to kick that off into yet another report.<\/p> <p>Senator Ahearn asked for a very much needed debate around energy and price increases, and especially around the gaps in service.  I am happy to be in a position to say that the Minister will come to the House on 2 November to talk about that.  The matter will be on everybody's minds and it will certainly affect everybody's pockets in the months to come.  It is very topical.<\/p> <p>Senators Horkan and Ardagh brought to the notice of the Chamber the antisocial behaviour that has been ravaging the streets of Dublin for the past couple of weeks.  This morning I saw the video of the young man in Dublin city last night.  He seemed to be of Indian origin and he appeared to be on a bicycle delivering food and is therefore providing a service to Irish citizens and to people who live in the city.  The disgraceful way he was treated, and the equally disgraceful way that Irish people stood around and cheered the absolute tramps who mistreated that man last night, is an absolute shame and a scourge on all of us.  The Senators are correct to say that as an Oireachtas and a State agency, we have left places in Dublin city as absolutely free-for-all areas.  At a parliamentary party meeting last week one of my own colleagues mentioned that he walked down O'Connell Street at six o'clock of an evening during the summer with his young son.  There was one garda on the entire pedestrian area of O'Connell Street, and when he went over to speak to him the garda told them of how the garda&iacute; who are policing Dublin city are exhausted and how they are crying out for a new policing plan.  It is incumbent upon all of us to make sure that this happens sooner rather than later.  There absolutely should not be any no-go areas in Dublin's capital city, and it certainly should not be for the want of resources being put into the policing system. <\/p> <p>Senator Cassells talked about what I can only assume is yet another scaremongering tactic on behalf of some of the campaign groups around Navan, of rumours about the future of the accident and emergency department at Our Lady's Hospital, Navan.  The Senator is correct that I have not lived in Meath for as long as he has, but for 20 years we have been hearing scaremongering tactics on behalf of people who would like there to be an issue with regard to the future or the sustainability of that accident and emergency department.  The Navan hospital accident and emergency department has received hundreds of thousands of euro worth of investment in the last number of years and I am absolutely sure that there will be more to come.  In the past, when issues have arisen we have always received reassurances, not just from the Minister of the day and we have been through a number of Ministers for Health over the past ten years when most of these issues have been raised; we have also received assurances from the HSE that even if it wanted to do something, which it does not, there is no capacity anywhere else.  I can absolutely assure the Senator, as he well knows, that this capacity has not grown suddenly in the past years.  I am very happy to put this on the record of the House.  I will schedule a general debate on healthcare and there is one already being scheduled for Sl&aacute;intecare.<\/p> <p>Senator Mary Fitzpatrick spoke about the very unwelcome announcement and confirmation by the Minister for Transport yesterday that he hopes the MetroLink will be delivered by 2034.  I have requested a debate on this and hopefully that will happen in the next couple of weeks because this is certainly not acceptable.  We do not yet even know why the project has been pushed back.<\/p> <p>Senator Maria Byrne spoke on the welcome announcement on Shannon Group plc, which is very welcome.  P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh is a colleague of most people here and we all know and hold him in such high esteem.<\/p> <p>Senator Byrne also spoke about the fact that so many workers are not going to be working in our drinks and hospitality and entertainment industries, which is very worrying.<\/p> <p>Senator Ardagh acknowledged and put on the record of the House the passing of Eileen Rushe yesterday.  We extend our deepest sympathy and our condolences to her family.  She was an incredible woman.  One could not help but be charmed by her wonderful personality.  This is not the least to say the amount of work that she has done advocating on behalf of people who have been much ill treated by the system over the years.<\/p> <p>Senator Mullen spoke of what we consider to be celebrations.  I did not think that Senator Mullen was being critical of anybody.  I thought he was just making observations.  I do not know who I could even ask for a debate on the meaning of celebrations, but perhaps it is something that we just take as they come and maybe talk to the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media who was involved in the centenary commemorations.  Maybe I will put the request to her.<\/p> <p>Senator Barry Ward raised the continued waiting list for people with adapted cars.  I will write to the Minister on this.  If there is a list for people who have a more urgent need for the normal test then there should be a list also for the people who have an urgent need for the adapted test.<\/p> <p>Senator Malcolm Byrne asked for a debate on pensions.  I am absolutely sure that when the report from the commission on pensions goes to Cabinet we will absolutely have a debate on that.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Senator is probably right.  There will be a lot of populist talk but the stark reality is that it has to be paid for by somebody.  If we do not take it out of people's left pocket, we will take it out of their right pocket.  I welcome that debate, particularly as I was embroiled in it the last time we debated the issue about 18 months ago.  <\/p><p>Senator Black spoke about the Music and Entertainment Association of Ireland&rsquo;s pre-budget reflections.  I will bring them to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin.  That industry that has not even begun to start reopening properly.  Its members need all support we can give them until they are back up and running and entertaining us on a weekly basis, as they did pre-Covid.<\/p><p>Senator Moynihan raised the issue of a three-year rent freeze.  The living wage has increased so significantly as a result of price increases in rent.  A debate on the Housing for All plan will take place this afternoon.  I am sure the Minister will listen to the Senator's concerns about this issue.<\/p><p>Senator Ruane spoke about animal welfare and the sale of pets.  She has raised this issue on a number of occasions.  I will contact the Minister about it.  I am sure the ban on fur farming legislation is already drafted.  I do not know whether it is the legislation to deal with these amendments.  If it is, it would make sense for all of us to try to do what Senator Ruane has been trying to do for the past 12 months.  I will come back to the Senator on that.<\/p><p>I did not get a chance to reply to the email Senator Boyhan sent this morning.  What it set out is horrific and highlights the major gaps that arise when the employer who people work for is not responsible for the conditions in which they work.  Agency workers are a special group of people.  If most of the agency workers in Ireland were Europeans, they would be covered by frontier legislation with regard to the European Union.  The Senator and I know that most of the people who work in our meat industry are not Europeans.  That is why it is so easy for them to be so badly treated.  The Senator is right that it is up to us to make sure that stops.  I will contact the Minister with responsibility for employment affairs and the officials I used to work with to see if we can quickly draft legislation to give these employees equal status, as if they were employees of the companies for which they are doing the work and not of those that are paying them.  I will come back to the Senator on that.<\/p><p>Senator McGahon spoke about the jump in vehicle registration tax on electric vehicles.  We have all been around these Houses for many years.  The one thing we all know is that when we tax something more we get less of it.  If we want people to drive electric cars, it does not make sense to tax them more.  That is an issue we will have to discuss with the Minister for Finance when the Finance Bill comes before the House in the next few weeks.<\/p><p>Senator Crowe opened proceedings by seeking a special exemption from the &euro;410 per night fee payable by those in the entertainment industry.  The review of night-time licensing will probably take a year.  We should push for the introduction of a temporary measure in the budget.  If the entertainment, drinks and hospitality industries need the support they say they need, a new night-time licence would be a fast way for us to make a difference in the short term.  I will bring the Senator&rsquo;s suggestions to the attention of the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#M00200","speaker":"1653","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":76,"content":"<p>Senator Boyhan has proposed an amendment to the Order of Business, \"That No. 14 be taken before No. 1.\"  The Leader has indicated she is prepared to accept the amendment.

Its purpose is to strengthen Ireland's regime against the smuggling of persons, and to implement several important international instruments.  People smuggling is the facilitated, irregular movement of people across borders for financial or other benefit.  It is distinct from human trafficking in that smuggling occurs with the consent of the person, while trafficking involves the recruitment, transportation and exploitation of a victim.  However, smuggling is inevitably closely linked to trafficking and exploitation, often leaving those who are smuggled owing huge debts to the smugglers, and, of course, often placing those being smuggled in mortal danger.<\/p><p>The UN Office for Drugs and Crime estimates that 2.5 million people are smuggled each year.  Catastrophic loss of life is all too common, and everyone in the House will recall the horrific deaths of 39 Vietnamese men, women, and children in Essex two years ago.  Ireland has experienced the tragic consequences of people smuggling in the Wexford tragedy of December 2001, where eight people suffocated in a container while attempting clandestine entry into the United Kingdom.  People smuggling is a highly profitable criminal activity and one that is difficult to prosecute, given its inherently complex and cross-border nature.  A co-ordinated international response, including effective and dissuasive criminal sanctions, is vital, and this Bill will ensure Ireland plays its part in that response.<\/p><p>However, criminal sanctions are one part of a broader national response, particularly in respect of how we support those most at risk of exploitation.  I draw the House's attention to the approval by Government earlier this year to revise the national referral mechanism to make it easier for victims of trafficking to come forward, be identified and access advice, accommodation and support.  Other parts of the ongoing work on trafficking include the drafting of a new national action plan on human trafficking; the development of training, through NGOs, targeting front-line staff in industries such as hospitality, airline and shipping who may come into contact with trafficked persons; the work being undertaken to provide dedicated accommodation for female victims of sexual exploitation; and increased funding dedicated specifically to supporting victims of trafficking.<\/p><p>As Senators will be aware, people smuggling is already an offence in Ireland under section 2 of the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000.  The legislation before the House is motivated by two goals, namely, to extend those provisions in line with the relevant EU and UN instruments, ensuring that Ireland meets its shared international obligations; and to address the practical limitations of that Act, which have hampered successul prosecutions.  The Bill reflects the provisions of three international instruments.  First is the EU Council Directive 2002\/90\/EC defining the facilitation of unauthorised entry, transit and residenc;, second is the EU framework decision 2002\/946\/JHA on the strengthening of the penal framework to prevent the facilitation of unauthorised entry, transit and residence; and, third is the 2000 UN Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, which supplements the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.<\/p><p>The EU framework is composed of two instruments that were adopted together and are commonly referred to as the facilitators package.  Together, they set a baseline against people smuggling across the European Union, providing for the essential elements of offences and their geographic scope, minimum and maximum penalties, corporate liability, extra-territorial jurisdiction and inchoate offences.  These instruments were introduced in 2002, and at the time Ireland and the UK chose not to participate in them.  However, we have committed, in the context of closer links with the Schengen Area, and for the purpose of accessing the second generation Schengen information system, SIS II, to implement them by the end of this year.<\/p><p>The UN protocol was adopted by the General Assembly in 2000.  It was the first global instrument to contain an agreed definition of smuggling of migrants.  Countries that ratify this treaty must ensure that migrant smuggling is criminalised in accordance with the protocol's legal requirements.  Taken together, the EU and UN instruments require criminalisation of facilitating smuggling into any member state or state party to the protocol.  They also provide for the criminalisation of facilitating not only the act of unlawful entry into a state, but also that of facilitating unlawful presence.  The instruments also require the exercise of extra-territorial jurisdiction on a broader scale than is currently provided for.<\/p><p>As I noted, significant practical issues have arisen in respect of the offence under section 2 of the 2000 Act.  The most important of these is that it is an element of the existing offence that it must be proved that the smuggling was done for gain.  Investigations conducted to date have been largely intelligence led, and prior preliminary investigative actions will usually have been conducted in advance of an arrest.  The requirement to prove the &quot;for gain&quot; element of the offence places a difficult burden on investigators, particularly when an offence is discovered at the point of entry rather than through prior intelligence gathering.  This is a well-known issue in respect of these offences.  The European Commission, for example, in its analysis, stated: <\/p> <blockquote> \tIn this context, it is useful to recall that payments to migrant smugglers tend to occur in third countries of origin and transit.  These are often done in cash ... [or] through the use of intermediary brokers operating largely without a paper trail and often outside the law ... <\/blockquote> <p>While the offence under the 2000 Act has been successfully prosecuted, in practice it is often simply impossible to meet this burden of proving gain, even under circumstances where it is clear that no humanitarian purpose of any sort exists.  Accordingly, a reversed burden approach has been taken, which provides that it is a defence to prove on the balance of probabilities that the conduct was engaged in for the purpose of humanitarian assistance rather than for material benefit.  It also expressly includes in the scope of the defence those working on behalf of bona fide organisations giving assistance without charge to those seeking asylum.  A central provision of the international response to people smuggling is to avoid criminalisation of smuggled persons, and the Bill makes express provision to ensure that criminalisation of smuggled persons does not occur.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy James Browne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2443\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2443&amp;amp;pid=JamesBrowne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->A person does not commit an offence by virtue of being smuggled.  The primary offence under this section must be in respect of another person, while section 9(2) provides that a person does not commit an offence by aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring his or her own smuggling.  To avoid any doubt or chilling effect, the Bill also makes express provision in section 5(2) to ensure that those providing goods and services in the ordinary course of business, landlords, for example, are not captured under the definition of what constitutes assisting presence in the State.  <\/p><p>I will now briefly mention the specific provisions of the Bill.  Part 1 contains preliminary provisions, including the Short Title, commencement, expenses, repeals and definitions.  Part 2 forms the heart of this Bill and creates a new criminal offence.  <\/p><p>Section 6 provides for the offence of \"assisting unlawful entry into, transit across or presence in [the] State\".  The essential ingredients of the offence are that a person \"intentionally assists [...] entry into, transit across or presence in the State of another person, where the entry [...], transit [...] or presence\" of the other person is in breach of a specified provision of Irish immigration law and the perpetrator \"knows or has reasonable cause to believe that [the] entry into, transit across or presence\" of the other person \"is in breach of a specified provision\".  A person convicted of an offence under this section is liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for up to ten years.  <\/p><p>Section 7 provides for the offence of \"assisting unlawful entry into, transit across or presence in [a] designated state\".  The elements of the penalties applicable for this offence are similar to those of an offence in respect of the State under section 6(1), except that section 7 offences relate to the entry into, transit across or presence in the designated state, rather than Ireland.  The relevant immigration law is that of the designated state rather than that of Ireland.  More limited extraterritorial provision also applies in these cases.<\/p><p>Section 8 provides for an additional offence in respect of fraudulent documents used, or intended to be used, for people smuggling.  These provisions complement those of Part 4 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud) Offence Act 2001.  <\/p><p>As I already mentioned, section 9 provides a humanitarian assistance defence.  Section 10 provides for penalties.  Notably, it provides that the court shall \"treat as an aggravating factor any behaviour by the offender\" that endangers \"the life or safety of the person\" being smuggled or \"that resulted in the exploitation or inhuman or degrading treatment of the person to whom the offence related\".<\/p><p>Part 3 of the Bill deals with the enforcement measures, notably including powers in respect of ships at sea, and provides for the confiscation and forfeiture of vehicles and vessels used in the commission of smuggling offences.  <\/p><p>Part 4 deals with miscellaneous matters, including provisions for liability for corporate bodies.  Part 5 addresses incidental amendments arising to other enactments.<\/p><p>I am indebted to several organisations that made submissions in respect of the Oireachtas's scrutiny of the general scheme of this Bill.  These included Ruhama, the Migrant Rights Council Ireland, MRCI, the Bar Council and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC.  These submissions made concerning the general scheme have been considered in-depth during the drafting of the Bill and, where appropriate, are reflected in the Bill before the House.  Many details will merit debate and I look forward to working constructively with Members as the Bill progresses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#Q00700","speaker":"1618","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":94,"content":"<p>Looking around the Chamber, I note that the Minister of State is a barrister, as are four of my colleagues.  We are dealing with a justice matter, but this is technical legislation that we are bringing forward.  We are trying to transpose legislation and recommendations from the EU and the UN into Irish law.  Regarding research on this Bill, and the concept, I welcome the briefing note that we got from the Department last week.  We also have the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech today.  I thank the Oireachtas Library and Research Service as well for an excellent Bill digest with some useful information on this legislation.<\/p> <p>None of us can properly appreciate what it takes for people to get involved in this activity - I do not mean on the commercial side - and to subject themselves to being smuggled.  I refer to people who go to someone and say that they need to be smuggled because of the pressure they are under in the countries they would like to leave.  It is not generally because people feel like they would like to go to a certain country.  People are leaving countries such as Syria and I am sure Afghanistan now.  They cannot get out of those countries via the regular routes and into other countries.  People in those situations will do anything.  <\/p> <p>Other people are exploiting those vulnerable people.  Human trafficking is worse again.  Unless people are experts in this field, they may not appreciate the difference between people smuggling, which is where payment is made to be smuggled and people are then, in theory, free once they reach the far side, assuming that they manage to get to the far side.  The Minister of State alluded to those awful tragedies where people do not make it on these journeys.  Human trafficking then is where people are being smuggled and incarcerated at the far end.  The victims are then exploited for long-term or permanent economic gain by those people who have trafficked them.  <\/p> <p>Either way, these are people who have found themselves in situations where they feel that they have to get out of their own jurisdictions and countries.  They may have had to borrow or spend their life savings to do that.  They may have had to give those savings to some of these people smugglers, who are exploiting these fears and also putting their victims in enormous danger in many cases, such as in refrigerated lorries, etc.  They also transport people into countries where there is no guarantee that they will necessarily be safe, either on the journey or when they arrive.  The victims may not be free when they do reach their destination and they may even end up in a trafficking situation.  <\/p> <p>This Bill is welcome.  I note in the Bill digest that we are one of two countries in Europe that has the worst status.  I think it is tier 2 or under watch status, as it is called.  It is a survey from the United States.  We must ensure that we are not any less proactive in banning, discouraging and enforcing rules against people smuggling.  It is a vile, horrible and evil activity, which preys on the most vulnerable.  I happened to be in Budapest in the summer of 2015, I think it was, when many people arrived and were trying to get into Europe.  They were mainly trying to get to Germany.  People could be seen around train stations because they are warm, there is surveillance and they do not close at night.  However, those people were just so vulnerable.  One could see the fear in their eyes.  They were not aggressive.  They were just fleeing.  They were leaving behind their entire lives, existences, properties, families and any assets they may have had just to get out of where they were.  None of us can really appreciate that experience.  Our grandfathers and great-grandfathers might have emigrated from Ireland, for various reasons, but they would not have felt the need to be smuggled.  Therefore, we all feel for people in these types of situations, but we probably do not really appreciate the absolute pressure that they are under to escape possible arrest and killing in their own countries.  These people are trying to get out and they are doing anything they can to achieve that goal.  <\/p> <p>However, we must discourage the people smugglers.  I heard the Minister of State on the radio discussing this issue and stating that people from Afghanistan would be allowed in and would be able to bring family members with them into the country.  We all appreciate trying to provide refuge for people who are under pressure.  However, there are people who are making commercial gains from this situation and often putting the people they are gaining their money from into very dangerous situations.  It is vital, therefore, that this legislation is passed quickly.  I certainly do not wish to delay its passage.  I do not doubt that the entire Chamber will be in favour of this legislation.  It was useful that the Minister of State referred to having spoken to representatives from organisations such as Ruhama, the MRCI and IHREC and that he had, where possible and appropriate, taken on board their thoughts on this Bill.  From a Fianna F&aacute;il and a personal perspective, I welcome this legislation.  We must always be trying to ensure that we do not criminalise the people who are the victims in these situations.  It is the perpetrators, those making economic gain from exploiting vulnerable people, that we are targeting.  I appreciate the difficulty in apprehending those perpetrators.  The Minister of State alluded to some of the issues.  Cash is used and other countries are involved.  We must, however, make this a punitive regime where we can prove cases and make it as difficult as possible for people to engage in people smuggling.  It is a despicable activity.  No one in this House would say otherwise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#R00200","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I of course welcome this Bill.  It is of a technical nature, but it does some important things.  The Minister of State discussed the difficulty of obtaining prosecutions under section 2 of the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000.  There have been prosecutions in that regard, but the Minister of State's point was that it is often difficult to prove effectively that the trafficking or bringing of people into the State was for gain.  It can be very difficult to prove for the obvious reason that the payment would have been made in other places and in ways that are difficult to detect.  I refer to establishing a reverse burden of proof, in effect, and then providing a defence where people may be engaging in humanitarian assistance or giving aid to asylum seekers without levying a charge.  Those defences are necessary in that context of reversing the burden of proof and they are very welcome.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Those defences are very necessary in that context of reversing the burden of proof and they are very welcome.  I also welcome the avoidance of criminalisation of the smuggled persons in question.  We are all aware of the crisis in Afghanistan.  It must be in our minds when discussing legislation that touches on these types of issues.  I learned recently of the plight of female judges in Afghanistan, many of whom have fled to Greece and will need to be resettled.  It strikes me that they are a particularly vulnerable category of people given that they would be targeted for past decisions and so on.  I hope that the Irish Government would be generous and proactive in playing its part in assisting resettling female judges from Afghanistan at this particular time.<\/p><p>Senator Horkan mentioned the US Trafficking in Persons report. I too want to raise the issue of human trafficking.  I acknowledge the distinction that has been drawn between trafficking and smuggling where it is clearly a consensual activity.  It is fair to say that people smuggling is a subset of human trafficking.  There are many commonalities and the issues intersect.  We need to reflect on where Ireland stands in the international standings when it comes to combatting human trafficking.  I raised this issue in the Seanad prior to the summer recess when the Trafficking in Persons report was published by the US Department of State in July.  I remind the House that that report exposed devastating failings in our country's attitude to the trafficking and exploitation of poor and vulnerable people and of our status as a destination and source of people smuggling.  While this legislation is welcome in that it fulfils some of our international obligations and seeks to correct a loophole in our law in the area of people smuggling, we have a long way to go in terms of the wider issue of the part that we must play in combatting human trafficking.  The Trafficking in Persons report paints a picture of a basket case country which is in the same league as dictatorships and banana republics in terms of tackling this problem.  The US Department of State very helpfully produces a colour coded map of Europe.  Where we stand on that map should be a cause of profound shame and embarrassment to policymakers here and to all of us in the legislative process.  Countries are shaded in green, yellow, amber and red according to their performance in dealing with this crisis.  Ireland is shaded in amber, alongside Belarus and Azerbaijan.  The only country ranked worse than us is Russia, which is shaded in red.  What does that say about us as a country that increasingly likes to talk up its human rights credentials internationally and our supposed tolerance and respect for human rights.  The UK, which is increasingly a bogeyman for our entire political class, from Fine Gael on the one side to Sinn F&eacute;in on the other, ranks quite well in the Trafficking in Persons, TiP, report despite its supposedly porous borders and well publicised problems with illegal immigration.<\/p><p>The most shocking aspect of people smuggling in Ireland, and of trafficking in Ireland, is how common and every day it is.  We all unknowingly, probably, meet or interact with victims of such activities on a weekly basis.  I mentioned in July that I had been in touch with a religious sister who assists victims of trafficking and who made the truly chilling comment to me that there is not a town in Ireland that does not have victims of human trafficking working in it.  Sadly, that is borne out by the TiP report, which found that victims of smuggling are being exploited in Ireland in domestic work, the restaurant industry, nail salons, food processing, waste management, fishing and seasonal agriculture, and car washing services.  These are sectors we all interact with every week, if not every day.  Needless to say, victims are also being exploited in criminal enterprises such is the cultivation of cannabis.<\/p><p>We urgently need action to address this situation which is a direct result, or in part a direct result, of the failure of successive Irish Governments.  How else could we explain that we are in such a dreadful position compared with other European democracies?  Some 1,700 years ago St. Augustine reminded us that a country which measures itself by its own common interests only and not by the standards of justice is not structurally different from a well organised band of robbers.  Sadly, Irish foreign policy increasingly lacks a moral core.  Increasingly, we do what suits ourselves at the expense of justice.  We virtue-signal at home, strut the world stage and appoint special envoys without proper consultation, all to veneer that we are somehow on board with authentic human rights.  Simultaneously, our leaders are rubbing shoulders with members of the Chinese politburo and having tea with ministers from Iran, regimes that have no concept of human rights as we know them.  We need a reality check.  I understand the trade imperatives, but it cannot be a nod to human rights on one hand while winking for trade on the other.  We need to ask some serious questions in this country about how much we really care about human rights.  The sexy stuff that we can parade, that does not cost us anything, is a form of what Dietrich Bonhoeffer would have referred to as \"cheap grace\".  The hard stuff involves making sacrifices, facing up to the fact that as much as we value trade there are certain things to which we cannot close our eyes, one of which that I have been banging about incessantly, is the treatment by the Chinese authorities of the Uyghur minority in Xinjiang.  I add to that its deconstruction of democracy in human rights in Hong Kong, its oppression of people of many religious faiths and its utter denial of that dimension of human rights and dignity that is involved in people's spiritual and philosophical search.  Hardly anything is said about that.  We get reassured by our leaders that they raise it in the appropriate forum, but if one looks at all the former Government Ministers and leaders of this country who seem to be finding their way onto international boards that have to do with Chinese cultural and economic exchange, the political establishment, or the orientation of the political establishment, in this country is very clear.  That has to change.  We cannot claim that we are a little country that has been a big player on the human rights scene and at the same time turn our back on that heritage all in the interests of trade and economic advancement.  We have some serious questions to ask ourselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#R00300","speaker":"1673","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":97,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it agus gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis as ucht an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite aige.

In the course of this debate, there has been a lot of discussion about the differences between people smuggling and people trafficking.  They are not mutually exclusive.  We recognise that.  This Bill represents an extremely important modernisation of the law on people smuggling in Ireland.  It is a mark of progress that we would put in place legislation that is clear and identifies the level at which we must engage with people to ensure that it is feasible for the authorities in this jurisdiction to obtain convictions in regard to activities that all of us can agree are dangerous and regressive in all of their respects.<\/p> <p>The difference between people smuggling and people trafficking covers a whole spectrum of activities from giving a lift from Dublin to Belfast to a person who does not have a visa to enter the UK to the horrible tragedy that we saw in the Minister of State's constituency in terms of the deaths of people on arrival into Rosslare Port.  We know throughout the world that this happens on a scale that is disgusting and abhorrent.  We know also that the Irish Naval Service has been involved in fantastic activities in the Mediterranean in terms of rescuing people who in no uncertain terms are being trafficked, albeit dressed up as smuggling.  The spectrum involved there is not all the subject of the Bill.  <\/p> <p>I agree with much of what Senator Mullen said about the human rights difficulties that we face as a country, both diplomatically and politically.  He is correct.  We deal with China as we must on many spheres.  On the one hand we have many businesses that do well in conducting business with their Chinese counterparts and working through China.  I understand that.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Barry Ward:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->On the other hand, we see from China a spectrum of activity that belies the image of a member of the international community that respects the rule of law.  This includes the imposition on the leaving certificate course of the simplified characters used in Beijing and mainland China and the exclusion of the traditional characters used in places like Taiwan, for example.  It runs from that cultural side of the spectrum to the appalling behaviour of the Chinese Government towards Lithuania, our EU colleague and a country not dissimilar from ours with respect to population etc.  Lithuania, it seems, made the grave error of doing what Beijing perceives as a slight by recognising a Taiwan representational office in Vilnius rather than a Taipei representational office.  This has resulted in the recalling of the Chinese ambassador to Lithuania from Vilnius and the expulsion of the Lithuanian ambassador to China.  China is continuing to attack Lithuania in an ongoing online campaign.  I hope we as a country will stand up to that kind of behaviour because it will not be long before it will come knocking on our door.  As European colleagues, we must stand in solidarity with Lithuania in terms of the treatment it is receiving there.<\/p><p>As I said, that is not the subject of this Bill and probably is not for this debate but it is an important issue nonetheless and something we should all have in the back of our minds.  With respect to this Bill, and the people smuggling aspects of it, there is, as I said, a spectrum of activity covered by this Bill, from giving a lift over a border to somebody not entitled to cross it to the absolutely intentional and deliberate attempt to circumvent the laws of entry into this or any other country.  I notice the wide, transnational application of the Bill, which is welcome.  This is not something that exists only within the Republic of Ireland or the Irish jurisdiction.  It is appropriate that we should extend this to the protocol countries under the UN protocol, to our European neighbours and to the other countries defined in, I think, Part 3 of the Bill.  We must address this not because there are parts of that spectrum that might be perceived to be not particularly harmful to the person who is smuggled but to recognise that the overall effect of having an unchecked regime whereby people can be smuggled in and out of a country is massively dangerous.  It is dangerous to the countries involved and is certainly dangerous to the people being smuggled.  Very often these people are being smuggled at their express wish or choice but the problem is once they operate in that space, which is illegal, they are massively vulnerable to being exploited.  That is where you fall into that people-trafficking vein.<\/p><p>The danger is it is so easy to switch from being smuggled to being trafficked.  Senator Mullen has mentioned before somebody who has given him information and people who are working.  These are probably people we encounter in our daily lives and we are unaware of the plight they are facing.  It is entirely appropriate we address this issue head-on because it is so easy for people who might decide they want to come to Ireland or any other state to come here but find once they arrive it is not at all the way they imagined it would be and that more importantly, their personal position is not what they imagined it would be.  They might end up working off debts or being put in a place where they are simply not free and they do not avail of the rights they should have as people living in this country.  In that regard, I particularly acknowledge that the Bill specifically avoids the criminalisation of people who have been smuggled.  That is tremendously important, for a number of reasons.  First, the simple justice of the fact the person who has been smuggled is not the person we should be targeting from a prosecutorial view.  We should be looking at the people who are smuggling them.  These people are profiteering from the disadvantage, the misery, in some cases, and the real difficulty of those they smuggle.  Thus it is entirely appropriate we mark clearly that the latter are not the targets.  The other really important reason we do that is to let them know that when they come here, by whatever means, that they are free to report the fact they were smuggled to authorities here.  There should be no fear in any person who has been brought to this country illegally that he or she cannot go the authorities and report what has happened.  In tandem with not criminalising them, we must put in place a scheme that means they will not suffer through deportation or at least that they will get a very sympathetic hearing from the authorities here in relation to their ongoing status in this country, rather than the fear they might have that by reporting the smuggling activity, they will end up back where they started.  They may want to stay here and we should have a sympathetic ear for people in that position.<\/p><p>In that regard, I wish to address some of the definitions in the Bill and ask some questions which the Minister of State may have the opportunity to answer.  Section 6(1) refers to the intentional nature of smuggling a person and I understand that entirely.  However, section 6(1)(b) refers to a reasonable belief on the part of the person doing the smuggling.  Again, I do not have a difficulty with that.  I wonder whether there is room in that section for some reference to recklessness.  Is there a danger a person who does engage in this intentionally might be able to say it was not intentional?  Is there then a difficulty for the State in prosecutorial terms in establishing that intent and are we binding our hands by requiring the prosecution to establish intent rather than recklessness?  Recklessness is used in the Bill in section 14(8)(c)(i) in relation to statements made to enforcement officers.  Again, I have no difficulty with that but I wonder whether there a place for it in the offences provided for in section 6 as well, to ensure there is a clear identification of the fact that in a prosecution, the prosecution does not have to establish that intent, which can sometimes be difficult but to put before the court a clear demonstration that there is an issue in respect of whether they should have known.<\/p><p>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister of State on it.  I look forward to its passage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#S00200","speaker":"1685","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":99,"content":"<p>The timing of the Second Stage reading of this important legislation, which the Green Party is very pleased to support, is almost uncanny.  Within the last 24 hours, as we probably all know, two women were jailed over human trafficking and organising prostitution.  They became the first people convicted in Ireland of human trafficking for the prostitution ring they ran in the midlands.  That followed a six-week jury trial over the summer.  They were convicted by the jury and Judge Francis Comerford passed sentence yesterday, giving them both custodial sentences in excess of five years.  It is reported:<\/p> <blockquote> \tJudge Comerford said the offences did not relate to trafficking the women into Ireland but the control exercised over them once they arrived here when the victims had become &quot;indentured slaves.&quot;  &quot;They coerced the victims into a sustained and degrading period of prostitution which did great harm to all victims for financial gain,&quot; the judge remarked.  He said the two accused had taken advantage of vulnerable women who had no real alternative but to accept their exploitation before finally summoning enough courage to break free. <\/blockquote> <p>If ever we wanted a live, real example to show this is not theoretical or about getting in line with Europe, European instruments and transposing laws from Europe, this is it.  This is real, this happened and as Senator Mullen said, it is happening all the time.  Sometimes it is visible but more often it can be invisible.  We can comment on this because the sentencing process is complete.  As Judge Comerford said, the victims had no real alternative but they tragically accepted direct exploitation before summoning the courage to break free.  No doubt huge damage was done.  I hope there are sufficient counselling and support services in this country to support the victims on the receiving end of such horrendous crimes. I note &quot;breaking free&quot; is the phrase used by the trial judge in that matter and I welcome the recently-approved plans for the national referral mechanism, NRA, to make it easier for victims of human trafficking to come forward and be supported.  I look forward to seeing this put on a statutory footing.  It will hopefully enable more victims to come forward because coming forward in such instances must take huge courage, I can only imagine.  It can be a dark, lonely, isolating and nerve-wracking experience.<\/p><p>On Second Stage it is appropriate to flag matters.  Is the Minister of State satisfied concerns raised by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission are adequately addressed?<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Vincent P.

A number of months ago the IHREC chief commissioner, Ms Sin&eacute;ad Gibney, was reported as saying that Ireland is both a destination and source country for human trafficking, including people trafficked for sexual exploitation, domestic work, fishing, agriculture, the hospitality sector, waste management, and car washing services among others.<\/p><p>As other speakers said, this is not some invisible economy at work.  Perhaps prostitution is done in quiet places in the dark.  In the case of many of these services, such as catering and car washing, for all we know, we are in a sense inadvertently - I emphasise the word \"inadvertently\" - assisting part of this ring.  It is reassuring that the Oireachtas will tighten the grip but I am concerned by what Ms Gibney said.  IHREC's recommendation made it clear that a more robust, consistent, and thoroughly documented response system to the smuggling of persons in Ireland is required for us to be able to take on this scourge.<\/p><p>The IHREC also said that the proposed law needs to take a vital step in putting in place a system that is victim-centred, gender sensitive and takes into account the experiences, support needs and, above all, the devastating impact of any related exploitation and abuse on the lives of those affected.  We will have an opportunity on the later stages of the Bill to ensure that this legislation is tightened up and becomes more robust.  However, I would like to know if the Minister of State can assure us that he can meet those concerns head on.<\/p><p>In its submission, the IHREC advised that the offence of people smuggling as currently drafted in the Bill must be revised to ensure legal certainty.  Its positive, constructive proposal that aggravating factors, especially which come into play at a sentencing matter for a trial judge, should include a wide range of categories, including offences that involve children, women, or people with disabilities.  Overall, this Bill is a step in the right direction and we welcome it.<\/p><p>In the week that is in it, and to stay topical, I welcome the recent announcement that 500 extra places will soon be made available in this country for Afghan families.  As other speakers said, the Bill proposes to update the criminal justice aspects of the regime in respect of smuggling.  It reflects the provisions of three international instruments against people smuggling.  These are: the EU Council directive, the EU framework decision, and the United Nations protocol.

Whether these are people who are risking their lives and, in many cases dying, in the Mediterranean, or who are suffocated on the backs of lorries in Europe, or, indeed, being rescued subsequently he held in detention centres, their lives unfortunately are miserable.<\/p> <p>People do not place themselves, or in many cases their children, in such danger without good reason.  They are often fleeing their own countries for a better way of life, whether as political, or indeed economic, refugees.  Of course, rational and calm logic would tell those compelled to use the traffickers and smugglers that their lives in the hands of these criminals will generally speaking get much worse.  However, as we know only too well from the story of immigration in this country, calm reflection on the choices one has to make is in most cases an unaffordable luxury.  \"Needs must\", is what is driving these vulnerable people.<\/p> <p>This Bill designed to assist those caught up in the dangerous world of people smuggling and it will align the legislation in the state with EU legislation.  It also specifically allows for circumstances where a person is brought here by a designated organisation for the purpose of seeking asylum.  This is new and has the potential to be helpful.  The Bill will allow for designated organisations to bring asylum seekers to this State without fear of prosecution.  It is with the utmost importance, because we are dealing with people who are at risk, adults and children, that designated organisations are rigorously vetted to reduce any possible risk of exploitation. <\/p> <p>The Bill also allows for prosecution in cases where the offence did not take place in this State.  However, that is a matter for the Director for Public Prosecutions, DPP, as there must be a connection to this State, either in the commission of the offence or indeed after it.  While we discuss and, hopefully, ultimately get to a stage we can pass this legislation, there is need to reduce the time it takes to process asylum applications.  To assist in overcoming this time delay, the Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB, and the Irish National Immigration Service, INIS, should be given additional resources.<\/p> <p>Overall colleagues in the Chamber and my party are content with the aspirations of this Bill.  We, like others, will support it on Second Stage.  We have all heard some of the horrific and tragic stories, either through the media or through our privileged positions within this House.  It is important that we have the opportunity to discuss legislation such as this in the broadest sense.  Indeed, that is what Second Stage is for.  However, there is also a real onus on us to act and to pass laws that will make a difference - laws that will have an impact and that will ultimately support those who are most vulnerable and who are facing such horror and such difficulty.<\/p> <p>I, like other colleagues, not least Senator Vincent P. Martin, who spoke previously, support the Bill at this stage.  However, I reserve the right to work with colleagues in the House, with the Minister of State and with his officials with a shared hope and aspiration to refine, strengthen and improve this legislation where it is required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#U00300","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":103,"content":"<p>Our next contributor is Senator Mark Wall and he has eight minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#U00400","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I, too, want to welcome the Minister of State to the House.  The Labour Party welcomes this Bill.  It is described as technical in nature.  As was said, it proposes an updating of the criminal justice aspects of the regime in respect of the smuggling of persons.  It reflects the provisions of three international instruments against people smuggling.  Of course, the need for this legislation is to ensure our continued compliance with the EU directives, allowing for national border control, customs, and police authorities responsible for checks at the external Schengen area border, as well as within that area.  In order to circulate alerts about wanted or missing persons and objects, such as stolen vehicles and documents, we are told that compliance with these measures is required by 31 December 2021 and is a condition of continued access.<\/p> <p>It is important to acknowledge, as the Minister of State has done, the continued great work of the NGOs in this area in protecting and assisting those vulnerable, who often find themselves isolated in a foreign country and in need of urgent assistance.  It is also very important to distinguish between people smuggling and human trafficking, although as the Minister of State said, both are inevitably closely linked.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mark Wall:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarkWall&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is very important in that, as has been said, the people who are smuggled owe huge debts to their smugglers, which often places them in mortal danger, as we have seen in the past.<\/p><p>In 2019 alone, one of the organisations the Minister of State mentioned in his introduction, Ruhama, worked with 116 victims of trafficking from 30 different countries.  It does great work.  Ruhama states that it has seen at first hand the detrimental impact trafficking can have on individuals and it welcomes any strengthening of the legal provisions designed to combat trafficking or people smuggling on a national legislative footing.  Ruhama has worked with service users based in every county in the Republic of Ireland.  It also provides training for front-line workers and those in law enforcement centred on knowing the signs of human trafficking and identifying individuals who are potential victims of human trafficking.  Ruhama states that we must be under no illusion, as sex trafficking happens in every city, town and village across the country.  Ruhama and other NGOs have welcomed the implementation of the UN Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, which supplements the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime through this legislation.  The highly orchestrated and organised nature of the crimes associated with commercial people-smuggling cannot be overstated.  The NGOs further state that it is their experience on the front line of service provision, and it is widely documented, that the provision and pursuit of human traffickers can be very complex considering the international reach of these crimes.  It is vitally important to note that people who work in this area say that the operation of people smuggling is constantly changing. It is important that our legislation continues to keep pace with the vile attempts to smuggle people, which is what is before the House today.<\/p><p>In its 2020 report, Countering the Challenges of Human Trafficking in the Digital Era, Europol noted that information and communications technology have rapidly changed the criminal landscape, with traffickers adopting new methods and ways to recruit, control and exploit victims.  Covid-19 has played a role in the changing landscape of human trafficking.  Last year, the European Migrant Smuggling Centre reported that criminals are finding new ways to abuse the most vulnerable migrants wishing to travel or cross Europe and those financially struggling to be victimised into labour or sexual exploitation.  It is important, as Senator Martin indicated, that in recent days we saw two five-year sentences handed down for trafficking, the first of their kind in Ireland.  That is an important statement to be made by this country.<\/p><p>The front-line battle Ruhama and the other NGOs carry out on a daily basis must continue to receive our support, and the level of support must be increased.  It is very important to clearly state that the Bill does not target those who have been smuggled.  It is also important that we keep the lines of communication open with people who, unfortunately, find themselves in that situation.  We look forward to the continuation of the Bill through the House.  We support it on this Stage, and we look forward to further debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#U00500","speaker":"1684","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, to the House.  I also welcome the Bill.  However, I wish to highlight the importance of language in the Bill.  For example, when we use words such as \"smuggled\", \"trafficked\" or \"asylum seeker\", we can lose track of the people and the stories beneath these terms.  While I welcome many of the provisions within the Bill, some of the issues I have with it stem from a lack of precision in the language, which threatens to lose the complexity and struggle of each of the stories.  For that reason, when we are discussing the Bill it is important that we remember the individual people and the struggles which we are speaking about today.<\/p> <p>We have all watched with horror the pictures of migrants making the journey across the Mediterranean in search of safety.  Unfortunately, since the start of this year more than 1,300 people have died while making this journey.  It is important to keep these images at the front of our mind during any discussion on policy.  That must start by explicitly stating within the Bill that the person who is smuggled will not be liable to criminal prosecution.  The goal of the Bill, as I understand it, is to bring Ireland in line with our European and international counterparts.  In this sense, to add in a clear line protecting these vulnerable people from criminal prosecution would bring Ireland on par with the standard set in the UN protocol against the smuggling of migrants, on which the EU's two legal instruments, which this Bill seeks to implement, are based.<\/p> <p>In addition, it is essential that the Bill explicitly grants rights and protections to vulnerable smuggled persons.  These are people who have undertaken the most dangerous journeys.  While the State has the right to control the entry and residence status of anyone entering the country, the legislation must also make accommodation for their safety and protection.<\/p> <p>Our Constitution, as well as European and international law, offer several fundamental protections to everyone who reaches our shores, regardless of their migration status.  People who have been smuggled are entitled to these rights and that should be clearly stated within the Bill.  To do this would, again, not exceed the standard set by EU laws, which this Bill is looking to implement, but merely meet them.<\/p> <p>Making smuggled persons' rights and protections explicit within the Bill would bring it in line with the Court of Justice of the European Union.  In 2014 the court confirmed that personal rights afforded to European citizens and laid out in the European Convention on Human Rights Act, as well as the Charter of Fundamental Rights, are also afforded to those people who are smuggled.<\/p> <p>In order to ensure that these vulnerable people are offered the rights and protections to which they are entitled, we must first ensure that they are properly identified.  Currently, Ireland and Romania are the only two EU states that are placed on the tier 2 watchlist of the recently published Trafficking in Persons report.  The report, compiled by the United States Government to combat human trafficking, suggests with this ranking that the estimated number of victims of severe forms of trafficking in Ireland is either very significant or is significantly increasing.<\/p> <p>It is therefore essential that this Bill commits to the establishment of a proper identification process, which should tie in to clearly stated rights and entitlements laid out within the Bill.  However, without naming specific rights and protections or administrative processes, the most basic entitlement that these vulnerable people deserve, is to be treated with respect and dignity.  This starts with training.  The Council of Europe's Group of Experts on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings recently recommended that Irish authorities ensure that front-line staff involved in the identification of victims of trafficking should be provided with regular training and guidance on best practice.  By placing a provision in the Bill committing the State to regular training of officers and officials dealing with smuggling and trafficking, we offer these vulnerable people the best possible chance of being dealt with in a dignified and respectful manner.<\/p> <p>I wish to highlight the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission's recommendation that those who smuggle for humanitarian purposes should be entitled to use this as an exemption from criminal prosecution rather than a mere defence from it.  If the purpose of the Bill is to bring Ireland in line with the legal instruments for the prosecution of traffickers and smugglers, then to add such an exception to the Bill would only bring Ireland further in line with the 2002 European Council directive on smuggling.  The current provision within section 5 is cast as a defence, rather than an exemption or exclusion, which is not in line with this European provision.<\/p> <p>I call for the Bill to be more precise in its language to ensure that the vulnerable people who it deals with are treated fairly and with dignity.  I also call for the Bill to be explicit in its non-criminalisation of smuggled people, to be clear in the rights and protections given to them and that any humanitarian efforts will not be treated as a crime but as an exemption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#V00200","speaker":"1632"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, for coming to the House to introduce this legislation, which I very much support.  Immigration is one of the biggest challenges facing European nations, including this country.  It is important that we have legislation like this to tackle the smuggling of persons.  Interestingly, one of the first sentences for involvement in human trafficking was handed down in Mullingar criminal court yesterday.  The Minister of State has acknowledged the dedication of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in investigating these crimes and ensuring that they are prosecuted successfully.  They are harrowing crimes with victims at the centre of them.

The definition is important.  Trafficking is obviously without consent and is for exploitation reasons, whereas smuggling is with consent but is illegal and can turn into serious exploitation.  We hear anecdotally of cases where payments for smuggling were not made and exploitation ensued.  That happens a lot. <\/p><p>The Minister of State must be commended on his new legislation, which offers a once in a generation amnesty to undocumented migrants.  Inextricably linked to this legislation is the fact that he is giving a new chance to undocumented people, some of whom are here because of exploitation while others have been smuggled here.  The legislation will affect up to 17,000 women living in Ireland and have a positive impact on their lives. <\/p><p>Many of those who have been trafficked or smuggled here do not know this amnesty is available to them.  It would be great if a helpline could be put in place, perhaps through Ruhama or one of the other NGOs that do unbelievable work in this area, to let people know about it.  Some people are lucky to get the counsel and advice of these amazing NGOs but others, especially those with poor English, many of whom work in the sex industry or as domestic workers, do not know that these organisations and services are there to protect them.  We need to do a lot more on communication.  <\/p><p>I support the legislation and commend the Minister of State on his work on immigration generally.

The hard work that went into consultation in the lead-up to the Bill was excellent.  I appreciate the distinction being made between trafficking and smuggling.  However, in recent weeks, I have received emails from people living in Afghanistan who are desperate to get out and people living in Dublin who have family members, spouses and otherwise, in Afghanistan and are desperate to get them out.  It has given me the slightest sliver of insight into how desperate people must be to call upon the services of smugglers or if they find themselves being trafficked.  There is a possibility of coercion and a desperation in that.  It is very good, therefore, that at the heart of this Bill are provisions ensuring the individual is not criminalised.  It is good and humanitarian legislation and I appreciate that very much.<\/p> <p>Like others, I welcome the convictions for human trafficking secured this week.  They send an important signal.  I am glad the Government sent out press releases to ensure the case in Mullingar court was highlighted and nobody missed it.  There is a disbelief among ordinary people living in Ireland that they are encountering people daily who have been trafficked into the country.  Ordinary individuals can now employe people to provide domestic, gardening or hospitality services, especially via platforms.  If people need somebody to clean their house, they can book an hour or several hours on a platform, which provides ease of access.  Someone will be sent who may or may not speak English and the person will not know anything about the individual's legal status or anything else.  People are relying on the bona fides of the platform.  There is an increasing gap there, in which people in the hospitality industry and other areas may have encountered people who have been trafficked.  I was contacted over a year ago by a person who had someone in to clean their house and became suspicious because the individual was extremely nervous.  The person could have been suffering from some sort of nervous disorder, may have had a meek personality or may have been trafficked.  I connected the individual who contacted me with Ruhama which gave fantastic advice.  It is an amazing, fantastic organisation.  <\/p> <p>We need an information campaign on how we can recognise trafficking and identify if a person we encounter has been trafficked into the country.  The stereotypes we have in our heads are of sex workers in brothels and people who are being sexually exploited.  That image comes from movies and so on but there are also everyday services.  Given the demand and pressure on childcare services, people looking for childcare could come across trafficking more and more.  I say that recognising the distinction between the two.<\/p> <p>The national action plan on trafficking and the national referral mechanism to allow victims to come forward are excellent developments.  What is the status of the review of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 that began in September last year?  The 2017 legislation, which criminalised those who pay for sex and for sexual activities with trafficked persons, was a fantastic step forward but there is the unintended consequence that where two legitimate sex workers work together, they may find themselves liable for an offence.  I would appreciate a comment on that.  Obviously, I support the legislation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#W00400","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":112,"content":"<p>Like my colleague, Senator Seery Kearney, and others, I welcome this important legislation.

One of the most important parts of the Bill is the amnesty for those who are undocumented.  People who are undocumented may not realise the amnesty is available.  I echo the suggestion of having a campaign to make people aware of it, although any such campaign for the people in question would be tricky.  It would not be easy and would have to be done in a sensitive and different way.<\/p> <p>The organisations working in this area must be commended because they ensure that the issue of smuggling and trafficking is always on the political agenda and in the media and general discourse.  People have to wake up to the fact that, sadly, thousands of people in this country have been trafficked.  It is appalling.

There is, of course, an overlap but trafficking is quite a distinct matter, and one where Ireland has rightly taken some action and can strengthen its actions.  This relates to the smuggling of persons which is at their request.  It is, of course, an area which needs to be carefully addressed.  There are very serious concerns around the smuggling of persons illegally.  We need to place it in context.  The reality is that across the world we have conflicts, to which European countries have contributed.  In many cases, they have generated situations which, for example, apply to some of the provisions in this Bill such as not having correct legal documents.  We know that right now in the case of Afghanistan, for example,  people are not necessarily able to identify the documents they need to travel, and even though a person may be legitimately entitled to travel, they may not be able to travel under his or her own name or with a passport.  We have had situations such as that.<\/p> <p>We also know that Europe has, sadly, treated wars, like those in Syria and Afghanistan, as migration crises rather than what they are which is crises of conflict and humanitarian crises.  It was extraordinarily disappointing to see the EU interior ministers producing a statement in August, literally as we watched the crisis unfold in Afghanistan, in which they talked only about preventing illegal entry and what steps needed to be taken to ensure that we did not have a repeat of the situation during the conflict in Syria, a repeat that is of migration in Europe and visible migration in Europe's streets.<\/p> <p>It is important that we are honest about that context, which is that we have a European Union which has been remiss in offering legal safe passage routes which are adequate and offering family reunification models which allow people entry.  Nobody wants to take unsafe routes but where there should be legal routes, where there are better humanitarian programmes and where there are many ways for people to find a legal route and are not pushed into the hands of those who seek to commercially gain from desperation.<\/p> <p>I recognise that there are some provisions in this Bill which are designed to protect those who are being smuggled as opposed to those who are engaged in smuggling.  That is important and I know that is the intent here.  There is still, however, much ambiguity, and we are creating potential situations of jeopardy.<\/p> <p>I note that the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, made numerous recommendations in regard to this Bill at pre-legislative scrutiny stage, the majority of which were not included in the Bill.  One of the most crucial of those was that humanitarian aid should be an exemption under the law, and not a defence in a court case.  That is provided for under the UN convention, which allows that humanitarian aid can be an exemption.  We say it can be a defence, but we still have the situation where there is aggressive prosecution and aggressive litigation.  It is one thing to say you have something as a defence, but you may be waiting for trial for two years, in limbo, or facing the cost of a case, which we know is happening.  In 2018 we had a humanitarian volunteer from County Cork accused of human trafficking while volunteering in Lesbos, Greece.  In March we had Italian prosecutors charging dozens of rescuers from Save the Children and M&eacute;dicins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, accusing them of smuggling.  However long they may be able to defend themselves in those cases, the key point is it is creating a criminalisation of those who are seeking to step in and to engage in the kind of humanitarian search and rescue that our State once engaged in.  The Minister of State, Deputy Browne, very poignantly spoke about the terrible damage done by smugglers and those who gain economically and put people at risk.<\/p> <p>My final point is that the number of refugees assisted by our Naval Service fell from 8,500 in 2015 to 1,088 in 2018.  In 2018 there were 2,160 migrant deaths in the Mediterranean.  These are the realities of the dangerous situations which we create when we do not create safe passage and when states do not step up, and when individuals or NGOs are left in the position of having to do the humanitarian work which states should be doing.  I applaud the intent of the Bill but I would urge that that core point around humanitarian purposes and the issue of safe passage be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#X00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":115,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for their important contribution, general welcome for the Bill and making constructive comments and information.  Several Senators referenced submissions by IHREC and a number of other bodies in regard to the pre-legislative scrutiny.  There was significant criticism at the time.  In drafting the Bill versus the scheme, we tried to address as many of those as possible within the narrow confines of this Bill.  It is a relatively narrow Bill, particularly focused on the criminal element of the legislation in regard to smuggling.  We will have an opportunity again on Committee Stage to look at a number of matters in terms of what the Bill does or does not cover and deal with.<\/p> <p>A number of Senators raised important points.  Senator Horkan and others referred to the stresses and pressures on people who seek to be smuggled into this or any other country.  No one undertakes it lightly so we have been very clear within the Bill to ensure that the smuggled person cannot face any criminal charges under this legislation.  There are serious difficulties in getting prosecutions under the current law in regard to the for gain element and that is one of the key reasons for reversing the burden under this  legislation and instead creating defences, which was acknowledged by Senator Mullen.<\/p> <p>Senator Barry Ward recognised the important modernisation of this law in regard to smuggling, but he also raised an issue around section 1 and the issue of intent and whether there was room to bring in recklessness as well as intent.  I will certainly engage with Senator Ward on that matter prior to the Bill coming to Committee Stage.  That can be looked at in terms of whether it can be expanded to include the issue of recklessness.<\/p> <p>Senator Vincent P.

Hopefully, we will see many more prosecutions of those who are trafficking in human beings.<\/p> <p>Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile recognised that this would make a difference and that we must focus on legislation that will make a real difference to people in their lives.  Senator Mark Wall also welcomed this but highlighted, and he is correct, that we need to keep the lines open with those people being smuggled so that they can provide information and that they are protected.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy James Browne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2443\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2443&amp;amp;pid=JamesBrowne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We need to keep the lines open with those people who are being smuggled in order that they can provide information and to ensure that they are protected.<\/p><p>Senator Black again raised the issue of ensuring that smuggled persons are not committing an offence.  We are quite satisfied that this legislation is clear that those who are being smuggled are not committing an offence by virtue of being smuggled.  Senator Black also raised the issue of humanitarian efforts and that piece around the issue of it being a defence versus an exemption.  Senator Higgins also raised that issue.  It is certainly something we will examine more closely going into Committee Stage.<\/p><p>Senator Ardagh highlighted the issues around those first convictions in Mullingar yesterday under human trafficking.  I appreciate that trafficking and smuggling are different but there is much crossover and they can be closely related, especially where the smuggled person is a vulnerable person.  Senators Ardagh and Conway brought up the issue around the undocumented scheme.  I agree with the Senators that when the undocumented scheme is published, it will be very important that it is highlighted to those who can benefit from it.  We certainly want to ensure that everybody who cannot benefit under that scheme will be able to do so and we have been engaging with the NGOs quite extensively on this scheme to ensure that it is very simple and clear, a bit like the student scheme was a few years ago.  We will ensure that it is written in plain, simple language, that it is accessible and understandable and that it will be highlighted.  There will be no need for recourse for legal advice in terms of being able to apply for this scheme.  It will be simple, clear and straightforward. They were the various issues.  As I said, we will have an opportunity on Committee Stage to go through some of the concerns raised by Senators in more detail and try to address those where we can.<\/p><p>I am glad to bring this legislation before this House, in conjunction with other legislation on which we are working in the Department of Justice to really try to bring a victim-centred approach right across everything we are doing and all the legislation we are bringing in.  I look forward to further engagement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#X00300","speaker":"1618","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1632907800,"counter":117,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":118,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#Y00300","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":119,"content":"<p>Next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#Y00400","speaker":"1630"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":120,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Cathaoirleach.<\/p> <p>Right now, Ireland's housing system is not meeting the needs of enough of our people.  My colleagues in government and I are keenly aware of this.  We know that the impact of the housing crisis is felt in every family across our country, whether hard-pressed tenants stuck in a rent trap or those at the sharpest end of the housing crisis, who will spend tonight sleeping in emergency accommodation or, worse, on streets in our cities.  Housing for All, our new housing plan for Ireland, addresses these challenges head-on.  It is ambitious. It should be because it needs to be.<\/p> <p>The housing crisis is multifaceted and complex.  It is only by viewing it as a whole and taking measures across all aspects of our housing system that we can begin to improve upon the situation for all our citizens.  That is what this plan is all about.  It is a whole of-government approach that will get to grips with this crisis and will improve the lives of all our people.<\/p> <p>As Minister, I recognise the scale and depth of the crisis and the urgent need for action.  Housing for All is a plan that will give the squeezed middle the opportunity to buy their own home.  It is a plan that will help to protect renters.  It is a plan for people who are looking for a fresh start and for people who are looking for the opportunity to rightsize.  Housing for All is about providing people with real choice while ensuring we create the kind of society that helps those who need it.  The breadth of ambition in the plan will help to stop and reverse the decline in home ownership and break the rent trap that many are caught in.<\/p> <p>We need all hands on deck to get to grips with this crisis.  Refusing to fully mobilise the private sector of small and medium-sized builders would be taking on this fight with one hand tied behind our back.  The engagement from all stakeholders is key to our success.  At its simplest, the plan will dramatically expand direct State building of affordable and social homes, remove barriers and give support to allow the private sector to grow, and intervene where it fails to build.  We need to increase the capacity and efficiency of delivery in both public and private sectors.  We will also rely on continued collaborative engagement with the construction sector and other important stakeholders, who are pivotal to its success.<\/p> <p>Housing for All is the most ambitious housing plan in the history of the State.  It sets out a series of 213 bold actions that rise to the challenge, backed up by an unprecedented financial commitment in excess of &euro;4 billion per year.  It is the first time that any Government has published a multi-annual, multibillion funded plan.  More than 300,000 new homes will be built by the end of 2030, including a projected 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes and at least 18,000 cost-rental homes.  It is the largest State-led building programme in our history, surpassing the heydays of the 1940s and 1950s.<\/p> <p>At the heart of Housing for All is a dramatic expansion in the role of the State in providing affordable homes for purchase and rent, while building historic levels of new social housing.  I have always firmly believed in the State taking a role and leading by example.  The plan involves the public and private sector working in tandem to meet our housing requirements of an average of more than 33,000 new homes every year.  Housing for All is about pathways to a better future that draws this comprehensive approach together.  It will support homeownership and increase affordability.  It will eradicate homelessness, increasing social housing delivery and support social inclusion.  It will increase new housing supply across the board.  It will address vacancy and ensure the efficient use of existing stock.  It is the most significant intervention by the State in housing ever.  It is a fully funded, multi-annual, multibillion euro plan.<\/p> <p>The first pathway's vision is clear.  We will place the opportunity of homeownership back in the hands of ordinary working people.  The first home scheme will see people buy their homes with the help of Government by bridging the gap between the finance they have and the cost of the home that they want.  The local authority-led affordable purchase scheme will see homes at an average of &euro;250,000 be available across the country.  A reformed local authority mortgage scheme will see more single people eligible for State-backed mortgages.  I have already reduced the rate in that mortgage product by 0.25%.  The Planning and Development Act 2000 has been amended, meaning 20% of all developments will be set aside for affordable and social housing.<\/p> <p>The affordability measures provided for in this plan will set us on a path to reversing the current trend which has seen homeownership rates fall to historic lows in this country.  I believe in homeownership and this plan supports it.  The introduction of cost rental, a new tenure in Ireland, will be a game changer for those renting.  It will result in thousands of individuals and families renting safe and secure homes at rates at least 25% below the open market value.  We have cost-rental tenants already in place in their homes within 12 months of the formation of this Government.<\/p> <p>The second pathway puts forward the vision of eradicating homelessness and supporting social inclusion.  This will be achieved by delivering 90,000 social homes by 2030, by expanding the Housing First programme and ensuring the provision of necessary health and mental health supports.  We are targeting 1,200 Housing First tenancies over the next five years.  This has been an incredible success, with tenancy retention rates of over 90%.  We will continue its expansion.  The second pathway will also be achieved by focusing on the construction and acquisition of one and two-bed homes.  This will increase the housing options available to people with complex needs, those who are looking for a fresh start, people who want to rightsize and older individuals to allow them to age in place with dignity and independence.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Darragh O'Brien:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2178\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The third pathway is all about increasing housing supply.  We must act decisively to increase the supply of private, affordable and social houses to meet the needs of people in a wide variety of circumstances.  We will do this by significantly increasing funding, with an average of &euro;4 billion each year for the next five years to give the sector the certainty and the stability it needs.  We will provide more State land to the Land Development Agency for social home construction and will provide increased funding for local authorities for land acquisition.  We will overhaul and simplify the planning system to ensure certainty and stability.  The plan also includes modern Kenny report-style powers to ensure the State gets a fairer share of the increase in the value of land resulting from rezoning decisions and that the community benefits as well.  This will have the effect of reducing the speculative value of land in time.<\/p><p>We are empowering local authorities to get back building again and with our affordable housing body, AHB, partners, we will deliver an average of 10,000 new social home builds each year.  Major planning decisions will be returned to local authorities and will be subject to strict timeframes, while judicial reviews are and will be overhauled to unblock obstacles to development.  Rural communities will be given greater certainty over building homes in their areas.  These measures are targeted and radical but are necessary to respond to the challenges we face.  These will all create the environment we need to supply of 300,000 new homes for our people by 2030.<\/p><p>At a time of such housing need, we have to ensure that the housing stock we already have is being fully used.  I am introducing a number of initiatives in our fourth pathway to directly address this.  These include establishing and funding a town centre first policy, making our towns and villages vibrant to meet, live and work in; tackling any remaining unfinished estates; and launching a new compulsory purchase order, CPO, programme to allow local authorities to acquire up to 2,500 vacant properties over the next four years and present them to the open market for sale, as well as better understanding the levels of vacant properties in residential property with a view to introducing a vacant property tax.<\/p><p>Despite the pandemic, Government has been focused on progressing major reforms that will accelerate and increase the supply of public, affordable and private housing.  We got to work straight away last year, while at the same time developing Housing for All.  We passed the first ever comprehensive affordable housing Act and reformed the Land Development Agency, giving it a legislative backing and adding to its powers.  Just recently, we opened Ireland's first cost rental homes comprising 25 units in Balbriggan, County Dublin.  It is a start.  We signed the Lisbon Declaration, thereby committing to ending homelessness by 2030; increased grant funding to assist older people and people with a disability; extended rent pressure zones and limited rent increases to general inflation.  We introduced five separate items of tenancy legislation to protect renters through the pandemic, brought 3,600 vacant social homes back into productive use, increased Irish Water funding by more &euro;100 million and banned co-living.<\/p><p>These actions demonstrate the Government's commitment to fixing our housing system.  Housing for All takes that commitment a step further and it is a step on the pathway to a sustainable housing system by clearly setting out how we plan to address the serious short-, medium- and long-term challenges to 2030.  The housing system is complex.  There is no magic fix.  I cannot tell Members it will be resolved overnight and they all know that.  We have the solutions, ability, drive and capability and now we have a plan to make a real impact, which is backed by real money.  This plan will make a real difference for real people.  Together, the Government is determined to make it work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#CC00700","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming in to discuss this very important new housing policy.  In election 2020, voters went out to vote and the vast majority of them voted for change.  They voted for change on a number of issues but on one issue in particular, namely, housing.  The Minister and I heard it, as did members of my party and members in all parties in government, and they understood the change voters were demanding.  They wanted a change from the failed housing policies of the previous decade and we will deliver that in Housing for All.<\/p> <p>The new Government faced many challenges, such as the immediate one of Covid-19 and the objective of protecting lives and livelihoods and it is recognised and credit is due to every front-line worker and everybody in our State who worked together to defeat the pandemic.  Thankfully, we are coming out the far side of that.  Climate action is a huge challenge facing us, not just on our island but globally, and the Government is also committed to working on that.  Today, however, we are talking about housing.<\/p> <p>In that regard, the Minister has not wasted the last year.  I commend him because, he was firefighting a decade of undersupply of housing, the legacy of the co-living and the market-led approach, which has short-changed many people, especially young people, the pressures on people to pay rent to secure a home and the threat of homelessness.  The Minister really understands all of those threats and has not only brought forward a plan which will bring us over the coming four years and the next decade but has also started to address those concerns in the immediate.  He has already mentioned the protections and supports he put in place for renters during the pandemic.  They were vital.  Others would criticise them, but they made a real difference to people's lives by protecting them from becoming homeless.<\/p> <p>The Minister secured record and historic budgets, not just in the past year, but with Housing for All.  The big difference and change in this plan is there will be multi-annual funding.  It is a State-led, as opposed to a market-led, approach to solving the housing crisis.  It is all underpinned, not by fanciful electioneering leaflets or videos, but by legislation and Government policy.  It says to all of government, not just the Department of Housing, Heritage and Local Government, at a national and local level, that this Government is absolutely committed to addressing the housing crisis, eradicating homelessness and ensuring everybody in our society has access to a secure and affordable home.<\/p> <p>We will do that by increasing supply and ensuring affordability, by using the State's assets, the most valuable of which are our land and our human resources, available to us in our local authorities.  The Minister's affordable housing legislation was the most comprehensive housing Bill.  There are those who like to talk about a narrow section of that Act, which is a vital financial support to people who are paying more for rent than they can, would or should do, to own their own home through a mortgage.  The big game changer in the Affordable Housing Act is the fact we are empowering local authorities.  Affordable housing that was abolished back in 2011 will now be provided by local authorities and approved housing bodies, not just in the city, but in every county.<\/p> <p>It is hugely important and it is by supporting and resourcing the local authorities and approved housing bodies that we will achieve the Minister's targets of 300,000 new homes; 54,000 affordable homes and 90,000 new social homes.  That will be an average of 33,000 homes per year by the time we get to 2024.  It will all only be achieved because the legislation and policies will underpin it and the funding will be there.  I commend the Minister.  I know he has his detractors but he should be encouraged to know that serious organisations dedicated to help those at the most acute end of our housing crisis, such as the Simon Community and the social housing and approved housing bodies have commended him and backed his plan because they know it differs from previous plans and has the legislation and multi-annual funding to deliver.<\/p> <p>I was talking to somebody earlier about a few areas of the plan and while it now sets the direction and tone and will ensure the State's resources are all going in the right direction, as the Minister is aware there are a number of areas that we want to see progressed and on which we are already working through the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Some of them will fall to the Minister for Finance and they will be budgetary issues.  I will run through a few of them.  There was an historic homeless budget of &euro;220 million last year and the fact Housing for All will be a housing-first approach, with the continuation and resourcing of preventions for homelessness by increasing the housing supply through delivering 90,000 new social homes, is really important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#DD00200","speaker":"1656"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1632907800,"counter":132,"content":"<p>Additional debate to follow.<\/p>"}]
