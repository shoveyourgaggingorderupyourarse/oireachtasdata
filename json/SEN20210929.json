As we all know Fianna F&aacute;il has a very proud tradition in education.  Famously, and radically, in September 1966 Donogh O'Malley announced plans to introduce free second level education, something we take for granted now but at the time was very radical.  In 1996 our former colleague, Niamh Bhreathnach, introduced free third level fees, which was a game changer in regard to upskilling our workforce and attracting foreign investment.<\/p> <p>In 2005, our colleague on D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and former Minister, Mary Hanafin, introduced the DEIS programme, which is the subject of this Commencement matter and which was a life raft for many communities in parts of the city and country encountering social and economic deprivation.  The DEIS model, as we know it, was a game changer for our children.  Attainment rates to second and third level education soared but we cannot leave it there, we must still do more.<\/p> <p>Spending on education, as the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, will be aware, is money well spent, no matter how it is spent in our education system.  However, since the introduction of the DEIS programme, the application process and the selection criteria for DEIS is unfit.  Much of the criteria are performance based and just one of the indicators is socioeconomic thus the selection process is penalising some schools for performing well.  The DEIS identification process relies on data collected by the primary online database, POD, the post-primary online database, PPOD, and the Central Statistics Office, CSO, when measuring the level of disadvantage in an area.  The lack of transparency in the DEIS programme is something that I have previously highlighted.  Despite an anomaly as a result of the ongoing housing crisis, this data is still being used as a yardstick for allocating DEIS status to schools.<\/p> <p>In a survey I carried out in 2019, together with schools and principals in Dublin 8 and 12, it was clear that the proportion of pupils who were living in what has become known as hidden homelessness was rampant.  These are children who are sleeping on their grandparents' or aunts' sofas and not in emergency accommodation for the purposes of attending school.  Rather than leave the child in a vulnerable situation, their parents will disclose the address of the grandparent or aunt when asked by the school to provide a home address.   This information is then fed into the POD system and ultimately provides a distorted picture of the level of disadvantage in a particular area.  I know of three schools in Dublin South Central that were denied DEIS status.  Powerstown Education Together in Tyrrelstown is another such school.  These schools, including Our Lady of Good Counsel Girls' National School, the Assumption Girls' National School in Walkinstown, Drimnagh Castle Boys' National School and the Powerstown school are an island among DEIS schools in an area.  It is unfair that one might have a sister going to one national school and a brother going to another school which is a DEIS school.  Being included in the DEIS programme would have provided these schools with additional resources to support children, as it is shown to reduce drop out rates, increase attendance and improve results.<\/p> <p>In 2018 the Minister of State, Deputy Robert Troy, asked the then Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, about the status of the review and at that time he said the review was still under way and not yet complete.<\/p> <p>We all agree the DEIS model is a superb one.  The Department agrees the selection criteria is not ideal, which is why it is conducting a review.  When will the review be complete?  It was promised in 2005 and in 2018 the then Minister said it was under way.  We are three years on from 2018 so at what stage is it?<\/p> <p>It is a super programme and I want to acknowledge the Department's promised additional supports for DEIS schools in budget 2021.  This makes me more determined to fight for those schools that have been unfairly excluded from the DEIS programme.  We all agree DEIS is magnificent but could the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, let us know where we are with this review process which was promised? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#A00400","speaker":"1630"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I am delighted to see the new Seanad.

The DEIS plan sets out the vision for interventions in the critical area of educational disadvantage policy and is based on the findings of an extensive review of the DEIS programme, which involved consultations with all relevant stakeholders.<\/p><p>As the Senator will be aware, the programme for Government commits to completing \"the new DEIS identification model, ensuring the extension of DEIS status to schools that are identified as being suitable\".  A key part of the DEIS plan was the introduction of a new DEIS identification process based on an objective, statistics-based model to determine which schools merit inclusion in the programme.  The DEIS plan acknowledged that further work was required to refine the model.  For this reason, as part of the further extension of the DEIS programme to more schools, an extensive body of work has been undertaken to refine this model, based on the latest school enrolment data and data available from census 2016 under the HP deprivation index.  Senator Ardagh noted the key data sources - the primary online database and the post-primary online database and also the CSO data for the national census of population - taken into account when considering DEIS status.<\/p><p>A detailed quality analysis of the data has been carried out by members of the DEIS technical group, which includes representatives of the Department's statistics and social inclusion units, the inspectorate and the Educational Research Centre.  As Senator Ardagh correctly indicated, the Department has commenced a consultation process with education partners on the refinement of the model.  I understand work is now ongoing on final elements of the model.  It is envisaged that this will provide the basis for the development and application of a refined DEIS resource allocation model to ultimately match resources to identified need.<\/p><p>All schools will be considered for inclusion under the refined DEIS model.  I note the Senator mentioned some schools in her area that have not been included.  Until this work is complete, it is my understanding that it is not intended to extend the DEIS programme to any further schools.  I reassure the Senator that the Department is working to ensure that those most in need of support can be provided with the necessary resources to help them fulfil their potential in education.<\/p><p>Senator Ardagh will be aware that additional resources have been made available to DEIS schools in order to address educational disadvantage, such as an increase in the budget of the school completion programme, the expanded summer programme, which increased from &euro;20 million to &euro;40 million this year, and the reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio for DEIS band 1 schools.  This year, the Department will spend in the region of &euro;150 million on the DEIS programme and we will seek to increase investment in this area and continue exploration of new approaches to support students at risk of educational disadvantage.

It is a considerable number, but that is not to say that other schools should not be included.  We must support children from disadvantaged areas.  Senator Ardagh will also be aware of the multiplier effect in that even if a child is from a different socioeconomic background and attends a school where the majority of children are from a disadvantaged background, that will affect his or her academic outcome.

Phase 1 of the roadworks was completed nearly 30 years ago, so we have been waiting a long time for the completion of the road.  At this stage, it has been talked about for nearly a generation.  It is a major issue in terms of ensuring a town the size of Bandon can be fit for purpose.  Bandon is the biggest town in and the gateway to west Cork.  All traffic for west Cork goes through the town.<\/p> <p>In the review of the national development plan, we must ensure that projects such as phase 2 of the southern relief road are prioritised.  We are in the bizarre position that all heavy vehicles must go through Bandon because they cannot cope with the gradient of the previous bypass.  Anything from 9,000 to 14,000 vehicles pass my office in South Main Street every day.  Bandon has been smothered as a result.  Funding must be found and a timeline put in place to ensure the southern relief road is developed and Bandon gets a chance to become a beautiful town.<\/p> <p>There has been significant investment in Bandon in the past decade.  The main drainage scheme and the flood relief scheme have been prioritised.  This has resulted in major changes to the town.  We are now going through a major phase of public renewal and redevelopment, which will also change the urban landscape of Bandon.  A lot of good things are happening in the town but the key piece of the jigsaw, phase 2 of the southern relief road, is missing.  It was for this reason that I tabled this Commencement matter seeking an update from the Department on its plans for this important infrastructure.<\/p> <p>Will the Minister of State inform the House of the timelines and costings for the proposed phase 2 of the southern relief road?  I am very concerned about the costings.  I raised the issue in 2019 with the then Minister, the former Deputy Ross, who gave a costing of &euro;7.5 million.  I am very concerned about the level the costings will have reached by now given the inflation in the construction sector.  The sooner we get the project started and finished, the better because we will have better value for money for phase 2.

The N71 relief road around Bandon ties back into the existing road network via a steep downhill gradient and drivers also need to negotiate a number of roundabouts and priority junctions within the built-up area of Bandon, of which I am sure the Senator is acutely aware.  I understand when he says the town is smothered.  It is chock-a-block, which costs a lot of time and causes delays.  It does not help business trading in a town to have so many trucks on the main street.  Road safety is also a key issue when so many large vehicles are passing through a busy town.<\/p><p>The N71 experiences heavy traffic, with annual daily traffic of between 9,000 and 14,000 vehicles.  The proposed relief road extension would involve bridging over the R603 to remove the existing steep gradient and construction of approximately 2.5 km of new single-lane carriageway, tying back to the existing N71 just to the west of the town.  A feasibility study was completed by Cork County Council and Transport Infrastructure Ireland is reviewing the study.  The project assessment plan was approved by the Department in 2020 and work on early planning and design will continue in 2021, with a preferred route for the bypass extension yet to be identified.<\/p><p>As this project is in the early stages of planning, it is not possible to provide an accurate estimate of the total costs at this stage.  The Senator referred to an earlier figure, but that was a preliminary estimate at that stage.  The estimated cost cannot be finalised until the project reaches the business case stage of the process.  However, TII allocated &euro;100,000 to Cork County Council to progress the planning and design in this calendar year.  TII has informed the Department the approximate cost of progressing phase 2 would be an additional &euro;200,000.  This would fund works such as a ground investigation, water monitoring and some archaeological works.<\/p><p>Pending future funding availability, Cork County Council hopes to progress the scheme to planning permission stage in the coming years.  The timescale will be at least three years because water monitoring, archaeological works and identifying a preferred route take time.  The timeframe for delivery of any major or minor roads project that requires statutory approval, whether for an environmental impact assessment, a compulsory purchase order, CPO, or both, is normally between eight and 13 years.  That can mean from beginning to end.  Normally, the assessment takes 80% of the delivery time, whereas construction normally accounts for only 20% of the entire time of a project.<\/p><p>All projects, including those listed in the national development plan or the revised national plan, require statutory approval and compliance with the public spending code.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#B00800","speaker":"1590","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":21,"content":"<p>When we are doing the review of the national development plan, we must ensure that projects such phase 2 of the southern relief road in Bandon are included.

The same applies to projects throughout the country.  It is important that the Government focuses on ensuring we have a road programme that sorts out these issues.  When it comes to the Bandon southern relief road, time is money.  I am very concerned about where the costs will go on a project of this nature.

This Commencement matter is a practical way to update an existing and very important scheme, which is in line with our sustainable and carbon neutral ambition.  We should be cognisant of the huge cost to living with a disability.  I have been working with some of our &Oacute;gra Fianna F&aacute;il members on this proposal, notably Brian Crehan from Kildare North.<\/p> <p>Disabled persons have not been properly accommodated or encouraged by the green initiatives taken by the Government, in particular, on electric cars.  To provide equity among the most vulnerable in our society, special and extra arrangements should be made to facilitate those with mobility issues in the green transition.  We ask for a expansion of the tax relief and fuel allowances available under the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme.<\/p> <p>I ask the Minister to look at three areas.  First, I would like to expand the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme.  The scheme currently covers tax relief in the form of remission of vehicle registration tax, VRT, repayment of VAT on purchase of a vehicle and on the cost of adapting that vehicle.  We ask the Minister to expand the scheme to include electric and hybrid electric vehicles across the three areas of that tax relief, mainly the remission of VRT on electric and hybrid electric vehicles and repayment of VAT on the purchase of electric vehicles and the cost of adapting them.<\/p> <p>Second, I ask the Minister to increase the maximum rate of reimbursement in order to incentivise the green transition.  The maximum amounts available under the scheme are &euro;10,000 for disabled drivers and &euro;16,000 for disabled passengers.  There is a cap of &euro;16,000 on the amount available for specially adapted vehicles for drivers with severe disabilities and a cap of &euro;22,000 on extensively adapted vehicles.  We ask the Minister to increase the reimbursement figures by up to 50% to allow for the higher cost of purchase and adaption of electric vehicles.<\/p> <p>Third, I ask the Minister to look at the fuel allowance.  Disabled drivers who qualify under the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme are given a fuel allowance for up to 2,730 l per annum.  We ask the Minister to consider expanding this tax relief allowance to include electric charging to the maximum amount, which would possibly reach between 120 and 240 per 100 km.<\/p> <p>The most glaring and obvious challenge our citizens with disabilities face is mobility and essentially being trapped in their own homes or small community.  The statistics back that up, in that 24% of our people with disabilities do not have access to a car or van, compared with 12% of the general population.  If we could expand the scheme and assist, incentivise and empower people to make environmentally conscious choices, it could be a clear and definitive way of helping disabled persons to adapt their car and have a mode of transport and would incentivise them to make the green choice we all want to make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#C00400","speaker":"1671"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I thank Senator McGreehan for raising this matter.

In order to qualify for a primary medical certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled and satisfy one of the following conditions, as set out in the Finance Act 1989: be wholly or almost wholly without legs or the use of both legs; be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; be without both hands or without both arms; be without one or both legs; be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; or have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.  It is very narrow and specific.  As everyone will know, the issue relating to the primary medical certificate resulting from recent court decisions is under review.  A working group is currently working on that to update the conditions and make sure the scheme is consistent with the legislation.<\/p><p>The scheme represents a significant tax expenditure.  Between the vehicle registration tax, VRT, VAT foregone and the fuel grant, the scheme cost rose from &euro;50 million in 2015 to &euro;67 million in 2020.  This figure does not include the revenue foregone in respect of motor tax, which is paid directly by the people concerned.  The drivers and passengers with disabilities scheme provides for the remission or repayment of VRT up to certain limits.  The Finance Act 1992 further provides that a category A series production vehicle can avail of relief of up to &euro;5,000 on the VRT due.  Under the drivers and passengers with disabilities scheme, there is no differentiation between electric and other vehicles in terms of VRT or VAT refund.  The amount of VRT due or paid on a vehicle is remitted or repaid up to the maximum relief applicable, which is &euro;10,000 for VRT or VAT relief in most cases.  As there is a separate VRT relief for electric vehicles provided for by section 135C(3)(b) of the Finance Act 1992, the amount of VRT due or paid on an electric vehicle may be lower than the maximum relief permitted.  In such a case the VRT relief will equate to the actual VRT paid.  The VAT element of the refund is given regardless of whether it is an electric vehicle.  There is no distinction as to the category of the vehicle.<\/p><p>Members of the scheme may claim payment of a fuel grant based on a per litre rate of 61.9 cent for petrol, 51.5 cent for diesel and 11.8 cent for liquefied petroleum gas.  Outside of the disabled drivers and passengers scheme, full battery-electric vehicles can currently avail of a VRT relief of &euro;5,000.  Since 2008 VRT has been calculated according to a vehicle's CO2 emissions.  Budget 2021 introduced a new VRT charging rate for low-emission vehicles.  My time is up but I will provide further information in the second round.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#C00500","speaker":"1590","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":27,"content":"<p>As the Minister of State mentioned, the primary medical certificate is not perfect.

This, coupled with the relief, means that many electric vehicles end up paying no VRT at all.

This matter relates to the negative consequences of schedule changes for the registration of rights of way after 30 November.  What plans does the Government have to initiate or support legislative change to extend this deadline and prevent these changes?  What the timeline is there for that action and what further engagement will the Department have with civil society, Oireachtas Members and the Law Reform Commission?<\/p> <p>This is an issue I have been working on for over a year.  I engaged initially with the Minister of State with responsibility for heritage.  I did so from the perspective of heritage.  Then I engaged with the Minister responsible for planning and development.  I acknowledge that the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, wrote to the Department of Justice last June to say that while he could not accept my amendments on planning he believed they should be considered by the Department.  I also proposed and sought amendments to the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021 that came through from the Department of Justice before the summer.<\/p> <p>This is an issue that has been coming up and that has been flagged for over a year.  However, it seems that over the summer there has been a realisation of what the consequences could be, and I welcome that.  I do not need to go through all of the law as the Minister of State will be very familiar with it but effectively, the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 and the subsequent 2011 Act brought in a change whereby there was a transition period for the registration of a private right of way or easement.  Previously, one had to establish 20 years of continuous use.  Following these changes in 2009 and 2011, a transition period was set whereby people would have to have formally registered and that period is due to expire on 1 December next.  This trouble has been coming for a long time.  It has been exacerbated by Covid and the fact that public awareness of this issue has been limited.  It was signalled to the Government by the Law Society, which has stated that even if people lodged claims now, the likelihood of those claims being processed in time would be minimal.  It has also been highlighted by the Irish Farmers Association, IFA.  This issue is important in terms of the legal confusion that would be created but also because of the damage to accessibility, community, and connectivity.  At a time when we are promoting the permeability of the ten-minute town and the 15-minute city, we are in danger of closing off a lot of the points of connection for many families.  There is also that heritage component.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State will be aware that yesterday I introduced my own legislation to extend the deadline by five years.  This is in line with the Law Society's request for a six-year extension, while the IFA had looked for three years.  I would be open to both of those but I lodged my Bill with the Bills Office last July so I had to proceed with my suggestion of five years, which, I think, represents a very reasonable compromise and gives space for further public engagement on the issue.  Crucially, it will also allow the Law Reform Commission to look to the issue in more depth.  This is important from the perspective of the past, in terms of preserving rights of way that have been used for generations, but also for the future.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I have emphasised this at meetings of the climate committee.

It needs to be done urgently given the 30 November deadline.  I was disappointed when I saw the legislative calendar for the autumn term circulated yesterday that I did not see legislation on this from the Department of Justice.  I would like the Minister of State to clarify how and when this will be addressed.  I urge that it will be stand-alone legislation and is not tagged into other potentially more controversial legislation and then not getting through, when it is an issue that has extraordinarily wide support from rural and urban areas, from the IFA, the Law Society and from lots of community groups.

I know it is something she has been working on for some time.  It is a matter of concern for quite a number of people.<\/p> <p>This matter relates to a change in the law on prescriptive rights of way that was due to take effect on 30 November 2021.  A prescriptive right of way is one acquired by long use as of right by a property owner over a neighbour's land which is not recorded in any surviving title deed.  Common examples are rights to access a farm or dwelling house where the access laneway is privately owned by one or more neighbours.  Public rights of way are rights contained in written title deeds are not affected.<\/p> <p>As Senator Higgins rightly points out, the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009, as amended in 2011, introduced a new requirement for these rights based on long use to be verified by a court order or an uncontested application for registration and register with the Property Registration Authority, PRA.  Up to 30 November, this could be done based on existing legal rules on establishing long use.  After that the registration would still be possible but only under new legal rules.<\/p> <p>The Minister, Deputy Humphreys has consulted with a range of stakeholders, including the Law Society, Bar Council, Law Reform Commission and PRA, and listened carefully to the concerns raised.  It is clear that there remains legal uncertainty about how the new rules may be interpreted and that it has not yet been possible to register many important rights of way that appear to have been enjoyed for many years without dispute.  These problems are causing significant delays in conveyancing and in loan applications.<\/p> <p>The Minister is satisfied that, if not addressed, the deadline was likely to lead to unnecessary litigation between neighbours, causing needless stress and legal costs.  As an interim solution, on 21 September, the Minister secured Cabinet approval for a short amending Bill.  It will be a stand-alone measure to be enacted before the November deadline.  Consistent with the strong preference indicated by stakeholders, the Bill will remove the major changes to the law on prescriptive rights that were due to take effect after 30 November, thus removing and not extending the upcoming deadline.  This is also expected to greatly reduce current conveyancing blockages.  The reason that it is not on the priority legislation list is technical and relates to the fact that a Bill must be published before it can go onto the priority list.  However, I assure the Senator that it is an absolute priority.  It needs to be passed before the deadline.  It now has Cabinet approval and will be a stand alone Bill.  The Department of Justice is in ongoing consultation with stakeholders on this priority Bill.  The Minister has also obtained agreement to set up a time-bound review, to identify any further legal reforms required after 30 November, in this complex legal area.<\/p> <p>We need to grasp the nettle here.  There have been several extensions.  This matter is causing distress.  It causes worry for the individual rights owners and communities and is causing untold headaches for solicitors, barristers and legal representatives.  A decision must be made on whether it is removed altogether or on whether, perhaps, a different amendment needs to be brought in.  We need to establish the permanent solution to the problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#E00200","speaker":"1618"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":33,"content":"<p>The concern relates to instances where a person might have had a right of way that has been used for many generations.

We know that some have been moving blockages into place in certain rights of way and things have been set up for problems in anticipation of that.<\/p> <p>I welcome that the Department is removing the provisions.  I would appreciate engagement around that because I have my own legislation for extension and I need to see Government legislation before I remove it.  The crucial thing is that we take action before 30 November in order that we have the space to look at what the solutions might be.  I hope the Minister of State will indicate that he will engage with myself and others.

My office was contacted by people asking what they should do about registering rights of way.  Problems have arisen as Ireland has become more mobile.

I know of the case of a couple where the people who own the neighbouring land have dementia.  Those people are in a home and getting all this resolved is proving very challenging.  I 100% agree that we need to address the immediate problem and then come up with a final decision about what we are going to do here because we cannot simply keep extending it.  That only creates new stress for people further down the line.  I will certainly get the Department to engage with the Senator.  I acknowledge that she has been raising this matter for quite some time.  Under the Bill, the law applicable to prescriptive easements and profits will largely be reverted to judge-made law that was employed before the passing of the 2009 Act.  As the Senator said, the majority of legal people believe the clock set to zero.  There was some belief that equitable rights would still remain and that was creating confusion in the legal world.  It is absolutely right that we take this action.  We hope and expect that the urgent Bill will have cross-party support in both Houses.

That is the total of &euro;410.  The figure does not include the cost of legal fees associated with court attendance, etc.  To put that into perspective, that represents an extra &euro;8,200 per month in charges for a late-night venue that operates five nights per week in any of our cities across the country, so that it can open its doors late.<\/p> <p>As Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann will be aware, the Government has already signalled its intention to reform licensing laws and to abolish the current late-night fee system.  We are emerging from a pandemic that has hammered the hospitality sector.  Many of the businesses that will be seeking special exemption orders in the coming months will have been closed for almost 600 days before they reopen.

My issue around this is twofold.  We have ambitious plans about electric vehicles in this country.  We want to have 1 million electric vehicles on our roads by 2030.  At the same time, there are reports from the Department of Finance that new car prices intend to jump by &euro;1,300 for normal cars and, for electric vehicles, up to &euro;4,100 under budget proposals.  That is a result of the Department of Finance's tax strategy group last week, which put forward changes to the VRT system.  This will mean the tax rates on regular car emissions would increase by 2% and 5%.  The issue is that we want to reach our ambitious long-term climate action targets while at the same time, other arms of Government are coming out with proposals that will hinder and slow this down.  Many people in this country want to make the right choices when it comes to climate action and to play a role.  Even today, despite there being so many financial incentives and grants towards electric vehicles, they are still out of many people's price range.<\/p><p>When we look to Europe to some of countries that have taken up electric vehicles, Finland stands out as a country where it has increased hugely in the last three years.  Finland has swamped the market with financial incentives for electric vehicles.  There are so many financial incentives that it would be mad to not drive an electric vehicle in Finland.<\/p><p>In the last day or two, we have had many calls for Members of this House for a debate on transport.

I circulated to every Member of the House a story about the meat industry and the issues of concern that were published in <i>The Guardian<\/i>and which had huge traction both in the UK and in Ireland in the last 24 hours.  I suggested that when any of us tuck into our next chicken breast, we might consider the plight of the workers and the horrific stories in that article in regard to Ireland and people who have come into Ireland via various routes and through employment agencies to work in the sector here.  One woman described having to pull and pack 20,000 chicken breasts.  When she was ill and having her period, she asked to go to the bathroom and she was refused.  Various other things are described in this article.  The article goes on to attribute issues around the Workplace Relations Commission and to suggest &ldquo;the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), says it has no data in relation to the number of meat workers hired by agencies and sub-contractors&rdquo; in this country.  That surely has to be alarming.<\/p><p>It is an horrific story.  These are people who have come into this country with hope, ambition, excitement and the possibility of a new life.  These are the invisible migrant workers who are propping up Ireland's &euro;4 billion meat industry.  It cannot be allowed to happen and we should not stand by idly.  We should stand in solidarity with these people.  Some of these people have not been regularised.  In a documentary which I downloaded yesterday, some other people talk about how they were so ill that they were popping pills to reduce their temperature for fear they would show up in regard to Covid when coming into the workforce.  Some of these people are working 60 hours a week in our meat industry.<\/p><p>I say that as someone conscious of the concerns around agriculture.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I am elected on the agricultural panel of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I do not want to ruin this industry.  I want this to be a good, clean and honourable industry with integrity but, more importantly, I am concerned about the workforce that is producing chickens that we might very well consume and eat here in Leinster House, and we certainly consume and eat them in restaurants around this country.  We must stand in solidarity with these workers.<\/p><p>I am pleased to say I had an email the very first thing this morning, within minutes of circulating this, from Deputy Ivana Bacik, who has committed to raising it in the D&aacute;il.  My ask here today is that we all stand in solidarity with these workers.  I know the Leader would have a particular interest, knowledge and experience of issues around employment rights, being a Minister with responsibility in these areas in the past.  Let us all stand together in solidarity and fight for the equal rights of these workers and, equally, to protect our agriculture and agrifood sector, which is a really important industry for the Irish economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#H00300","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":47,"content":"<p>Over the last number of years, there have been improvements in the area of animal welfare but we still have a very long way to go in this country.  This week alone, anybody who was listening to the radio would have been horrified by the stories of animal abuse and torture.  Ireland still holds the reputation of being the puppy farm capital of Europe.<\/p> <p>Many of the animal welfare issues we have in this country could be easily addressed if the political will was there.  Take, for example, the online sale of pets.  The regulations on the online sale and supply of pets are in place for 20 months now and there is yet to be a single enforcement taken by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine - not a single case.  This is despite animal welfare organisations spending hours, every single day of the week, having to scan through the online platforms and reporting to the online platforms, and then waiting for the advert to go down, by which time the dog is already sold on and the mobile number is no longer active.  These are animal welfare volunteers who are spending their time doing this when they could be doing much more important work.<\/p> <p>Instead of taking on board their eminently sensible and cheap proposals, all we are asking the Minister to do is put in place a central database that brings together the information on the dog breeding establishments, where they are located and how many breeding bitches each dog breeding establishment has onsite, and also to bring together the information on the microchip number so it corresponds to the actual dog that the microchip is registered to.  We do this for cars, so it is not sophisticated software that is needed.  We could do it just as well for dogs and that would allow for pre-verification of the adverts.<\/p> <p>Currently, the position of the Government is to tell us to do our homework, to tell the person who is buying the dog to go and do their homework and to tell the online platforms that they have to do better.  However, they are not equipped with the tools to it.  A central database would allow them to do this.  We would also like the Minister to run a public awareness campaign telling people not to pay cash for animals, given the amount of tax that is being forgone by the Exchequer in this multi-million euro industry because we do not inform people why it is so wrong to pay cash for animals.<\/p> <p>Yesterday, the programme for the autumn legislative session included the Animal Health and Welfare (Amendment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021 to address fur farming.  That is great because we need to ban fur farming.  Unfortunately, I asked the Minister without success to extend its scope to take on board the legislation that I have ready to go, which would close down the loophole on smuggling and allow for any animals that are seized at the ports, puppies included, to be rehomed within five days, rather than having to wait for the court process to be completed, which takes anything up to 12 to 18 months.<\/p> <p>This House needs to have a debate on animal welfare and it would be an opportune moment now that we have those two pieces of legislation on the legislative programme.  I ask the Leader to consider having such a debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#H00400","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I want to raise the issue that we see in the media today, namely, the living wage technical group said we need a living wage of &euro;12.90, which is &euro;2.70 higher than the current minimum wage.  That is an increase of 60 cent on last year and it is mainly caused by the rising cost of rent.  It is calculated that people on the minimum wage are spending some 64% of their salary on rent, which is two times what is considered affordable, which is generally about a third of income.  This underlines the need for a three-year rent freeze in order to try to make rents more affordable for people who are living on the edge, the working poor who need a rent freeze.  The basics of life are increasing, in particular in regard to the right to a home and energy costs.<\/p> <p>I would like the Leader to schedule a debate on the issue of a living wage and how that fits into housing costs.  I recognise we are having a debate on Housing for All later but we have to focus on the issue of renters, the unaffordability of renting and those people who are on the edges of society and spending such a high proportion of their salary on rent, with no chance of ever owning their own home and no chance of their living costs or their rental costs going down.<\/p> <p>On a related matter, I see today that a circular has been issued to local authorities on student accommodation guidelines.  A little like the situation with investors, it is to be seen to be doing something without actually doing something.  The Government has said that the circular sent to local authorities leaves them in no doubt that student accommodation changes of use should not be done without a compelling reason.  The situation where 1,000 students beds in Dublin have been changed over to tourist accommodation also happened under the same guidance because it was contained in the development plans that there should not be a changeover and there should not be over-concentration in certain areas.  It needs to be stronger than simple guidance.  It is like writing a letter and asking for something to be done without having proper backup in legislative terms or having more compelling guidelines in order to be able to do it.

It was a powerful launch.  MEAI was formed in June 2020 as a result of the pandemic which decimated the entire industry.  Since then it has worked tirelessly, on a voluntary basis, to represent the industry to Government and help find solutions to reopen the industry.  I am privileged to be one of 11 Oireachtas Members involved with the MEAI committee, which was established in May 2021.  Thankfully many of its members were in attendance today to support the pre-budget submission.  The theme of the MEAI submission is invigorate, involve and inspire, which I thought was wonderful.  I believe its requests will help to rebuild and regrow the industry through the plans of invigoration and involvement.<\/p> <p>I wanted to highlight two requests in particular.  MEAI has requested an increase in funding for the independent live entertainment sector from &euro;50 million to &euro;75 million.  It suggested a number of schemes for this &euro;75 million which would create employment opportunities for workers in the sector.  This would be done through inclusion and interaction between the sector and children, people with disabilities and the elderly.  These schemes are directly targeted towards local authority schemes and bringing music and entertainment back into communities that have been starved of the experience for over 18 months.  <\/p> <p>MEAI has also requested a pilot scheme for artists with disabilities which seeks to remove the income threshold for artists in receipt of disability payments from the Department of Social Protection.  This scheme would empower those artists and promote self growth and development in their work and personal lives.  <\/p> <p>Other requests include: the implementation of universal basic income for artists; the application of reduced VAT rates for performers and bands in the sector; the creation of a Covid-19 insurance guarantee scheme for events; and a census of the music and entertainment industry in Ireland.  We all know and have experienced the joy of live music, as I did outside this morning.  It was lovely to hear music at the launch.  It was a reminder that we can never take music and entertainment for granted again and must protect and value it in the future.  I want to call on the Minister, Deputy Martin, and her colleagues in the Government to consider and act on the requests in the MEAI pre-budget submission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#J00200","speaker":"1632"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I endorse the remarks of Senator Black around the importance of music and the arts.

Things have been difficult and we need to support the sector as it reopens.<\/p> <p>I want to raise the question of pensions.  I am concerned by some of the very populist debate that is happening around pensions at the moment and that we are not thinking sufficiently long-term.  Those who will sit their leaving certificate next year will probably not retire until the late 2060s or early 2070s.  They will have a life expectancy of 90.  They will live a lot longer.  The big difference between now and 30 years' time is that at the moment there are five people working for every one person who has retired but within 30 years we will be in a situation where, on current projections, we will only have two workers for everybody over the age of 65.  I worry that this timebomb is something we are not addressing. <\/p> <p>When we are having a debate around what age people should retire at now, we are not looking at the bigger picture.  We continue to kick the can down the road.  Many of our fellow European countries, such as Italy, Germany and France, have failed to address this issue and that has now led to large-scale social unrest and disagreement between the generations.  I worry that because of our failure to address this long-term issue, and given some of the populist language being used during the pensions debate, those now aged in their teens, 20s and 30s will suffer far more because we are not having a realistic debate.  I ask for a comprehensive and real debate on the long-term implications of pensions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#J00300","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":52,"content":"<p>We all know the difficulties young people have faced in getting time to sit driving tests and the knock-on effect that has had on people who have to travel to or need to drive for work.  I welcome the work done by the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, to address the backlog and provide an opportunity for people who need licences to get tests early.<\/p> <p>However, I was contacted by a young woman in my area who requires an adaptation to drive her vehicle.  It seems there exists an extraordinary situation whereby persons who use an adapted vehicle for whatever reason are not subject to the same test as everybody else.  They need a special tester and test, and there is no waiting list available to them.  People who need adapted vehicles are arguably those who need their cars more than most, but they cannot get onto a cancellation list.  They have to wait longer and there is still a problem addressing the backlog for those vehicles.  <\/p> <p>I do not understand why every tester is not competent to test a person trying an adapted vehicle.  We should examine the situation with a view to having a driver testing regime that is available to everybody on an equal footing so that those who need a licence can do their tests and move on.  That should apply as much to people who require an adapted vehicle as it does to people who do not.  Can we have a debate on this issue?

I do not think many of us would have gotten involved if it was the case.<\/p> <p>However, a strange confusion seems to have arisen whereby commemorating something or marking it, one is somehow celebrating it.

I ask for the debate because people are extremely fearful and worried about price hikes and blackouts.<\/p> <p>It seems to me, and to a lot of people, that every time there is an interview on this whether it is on RT&Eacute;'s \"Drivetime\" or \"Morning Ireland\" that the narrative changes.  A number of days ago the narrative was that the Government was fully confident, next the situation is very tight, next was that no guarantees can be given and now the message is that EirGrid is at the pin of its collar.  The narrative is not going in a direction that generates confidence.  We need a serious debate in the Seanad about what is going to happen over the next number of months because when one speaks to people privately within the sector, one learns they feel there is an inevitability to blackouts in this country, which harks back to the 1970s.  When we are trying to explain to people how there is a potential for energy costs to rise by &euro;400 a year yet at the same time there will be blackouts then we need to put a plan in place.  Price hikes and blackouts are unacceptable.<\/p> <p>I appreciate that a number of things will be done, hopefully, in the budget to support the most vulnerable but all sectors will be hit.  Clearly, it is critical that we assist the most vulnerable but every single individual in this State will feel the impact.  Businesses also need certainty that there will be no blackouts, that there is capacity and that if blackouts take place, there are back-up plans.  I appreciate that we debated these matters yesterday but we must invite the Minister himself to the House for a debate as a matter of urgency. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#L00200","speaker":"1629"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising such an important issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#L00300","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":70,"content":"<p>We have a very proud tradition in this country of people volunteering, supporting, helping and setting up support organisations.  Throughout Covid we experienced a lot of that activity at community level.<\/p> <p>As recent events in the media suggest, and I will not refer to a specific case but from my own experience from working in criminal law, there are organisations that set up voluntarily to assist in drug rehabilitation.  These organisations may be faith-based and may assist young people who seek to rehabilitate themselves and we have heard about recent cases.  One issue in this regard pertains to an exception under the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act whereby anything that is on a loose or casual relationship basis does not require the people involved in such work to be Garda vetted.  I appreciate that the Minister for Justice has conducted over a number of months a comprehensive and thorough review of the Garda vetting system.  I have fed into the review on other issues.  I have written to the Minister that we need to address the definition of what is a vulnerable person because it is too narrow in the Act.  I also mentioned that we need to address the definition of what sort of activity requires the oversight of Garda vetting.  Otherwise, there is a risk that we assume people are vulnerable and caught within that definition but are not and are open to the possibility of being exploited for a variety of reasons.  I mean not merely alleged sexual abuse or otherwise but for a variety of other types of exploitation.  I know of one organisation that offered an alleged drug rehabilitation course to young people who were recovering from drug addiction yet within a couple of days had them collecting money on the streets for the organisation.  There is a whole array of organisations that we assume to be all right yet they are not.  I call for a debate in this House to be arranged on voluntary oversight and our definitions, and understanding, of same. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#L00400","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I join with Senator Boylan on the issue of animals.  My dog of 11 years died recently and I wanted to replace him.  As one cannot find pups in the various rescue centres at the moment, I decided to search online and discovered that puppies are being sold for up to &euro;3,000 each.  Let us think about the outrageous amount of money that can be earned from one litter of pups.  There also are puppy farms where female dogs are forced to quickly produce litter after litter of pups.  As the money that is involved in this game is astronomical, I fully what Senator Boylan is trying to do.<\/p> <p>Last night, the Minister for Defence came in here and I am delighted that he has accepted the word of the women in the Women of Honour group.  I am delighted to see that Major General Se&aacute;n Clancy, the new Chief of Staff, is taking a very robust line with respect to the discipline that is required of soldiers serving in the Defence Forces.<\/p> <p>There is an issue of corporate governance within the Defence Forces that must be addressed immediately.  There are as many as 600 vacant junior managerial posts, that is, corporals, sergeants and company sergeants, within the enlisted ranks.  We have had a dearth of commissioned officers run through the Curragh over the last number of years to try to build up the commissioned officers.  However, we still have situations where young commissioned officers are going into units and taking over platoons of up to 30 men in their first commission without any serious mentoring taking place.  When I served in the 1st Infantry Battalion in Galway, we had a parade every morning at 9 a.m.  That parade was taken by the colonel in charge of the battalion.  One had the adjutant and every company commander on parade.  One had every lieutenant on parade with their platoons.  One had every platoon sergeant and company sergeant.  We were all there and everybody knew where everybody stood.  The chain of command was perfectly clear with everybody.  If there was indiscipline, it was witnessed by the most junior ranks and dealt with immediately.  I do not suggest that not having these people in place is an excuse for what has happened.  What I am saying is that one minimises the opportunities if one has the people in place with responsibility to take over.  So I really think that we must deal with the unfilled vacancies for promotional posts in the Defence Forces as a matter of urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#L00500","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":72,"content":"<p>I welcome the announcement made today by the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, to expand the walks scheme.  This is a fantastic way to support rural and regional development.  Government investment in the regions is all part of our rural future.  As there is now funding for 31 new trails in 13 counties, there will be a lot more places all around Ireland for people to explore.  The Department is working with over 2,400 farmers and landowners.

That would be the Beara-Breifne Way, the whole way from Cork to Cavan and all the way up to Blacklion.  It is an amazing route going along by the River Suck in between Galway and Roscommon.  It is absolutely fantastic and I thank the volunteers who have worked on this within the Suck Valley Way and within the Lung-Lough Gara committee.  It is a great development.  It will bring more people and more footfall into areas around Castlerea and Ballaghadereen.  Ballaghadereen also has its new street enhancement fund, which comes from the rural regeneration and development fund.  This is crucial to bring more people into our area.<\/p><p>This Friday we have the launch of the new Technological University of the Shannon, TUS, in Athlone, about which the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Simon Harris has spoken much this year.  This will be an amazing development for the west.  We want to see more campuses.  It will bring more investment into our region, linking up industry with third level institutions, with academia and with excellence.  I want to see our campuses expand also.  This university is an amalgamation of Athlone and Limerick institutes of technology.  It will be a phenomenal base in the Shannon area to bring investment west.  I thank the Minister for that.  I look forward to the development under the realm of Professor Vincent Cunnane and Professor Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; Cath&aacute;in.

The expansion of the walks scheme this morning as announced by the Minister is very welcome, particularly in the past 18 months when plenty of Irish citizens took to walking and cycling as we did not really have an awful lot else to do.  Investment in the beautiful routes in rural Ireland is very welcome.<\/p> <p>On Senator Craughwell's point, it often astounds me as to who has &euro;3,000 to spend on a dog in the first place.  There is no doubt that prices for dogs have gone up in the past 18 months because people were at home and took to taking in pets.  Now, as people are returning to the office, the reports are that these pets are abandoned.  It is a real stain on the Irish character that people would do that and not welcome a pet into their homes for life and not just for a period of time.<\/p> <p>I am aware of how passionate Senator Craughwell is about the Defence Forces - and I say to him respectfully, I do not mean any criticism - but he said in his contribution this morning that he was not saying that vacant positions were an excuse for what has happened with regard to the \"Women of Honour\".  I do not believe that there is an excuse.  I believe there is a prevailing culture within our Defence Forces that is misogynistic and which believes that women are less equal than men.  I absolutely stamp that out.  This is not acceptable in any agency of the country.  I welcome the speed at which this is being taken seriously by the Minister, the new Secretary General in the Department of Defence, Ms Jacqui McCrum, and by the Chief of Staff Sean Clancy, who has just been appointed.<\/p> <p>I sometimes wonder about the way we refer to the issue.  I listened to Brian Dobson on RT&Eacute; 1 news yesterday when he discussed this particular issue and the meeting that was to take place between the Minister and the \"Women of Honour\", and he talked about them telling their stories.  Victims of sexual abuse, harassment, misogyny or workplace discrimination do not have \"stories\" to tell; they have experiences or allegations to put on the record.  The words around this kind of unacceptable behaviour really matter.  We have seen how, over the past couple of days, one of those women was so fearful that she had to come anonymously and raise her story.  Words matter and we must believe victims when they come forward and tell us their experiences or make allegations.  We absolutely have to respond accordingly.  I really welcome the Senator mentioning this here this morning. <\/p> <p>Senator Seery Kearney spoke about a similar topic.  We have had the experience in recent weeks of allegations that were made of the most extreme nature against a particular charity.  While I welcome the Garda Commissioner stating that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will need to review the definition of vulnerable people, I do not know why we have to wait until something as awful and horrendous was exposed to realise that people who are living on our streets who have no home, no security and no family support systems around them are vulnerable.  Surely to God they are some of the most vulnerable people in the State.  I do not find it acceptable that we are going to get another review that will probably take 18 months to find out the changes we need to make to some language definitions.  Even if we do have to wait for the changes to be made in legislation, the changes in practice could be happening between now and Friday.  I do not believe it is acceptable to kick that off into yet another report.<\/p> <p>Senator Ahearn asked for a very much needed debate around energy and price increases, and especially around the gaps in service.  I am happy to be in a position to say that the Minister will come to the House on 2 November to talk about that.  The matter will be on everybody's minds and it will certainly affect everybody's pockets in the months to come.  It is very topical.<\/p> <p>Senators Horkan and Ardagh brought to the notice of the Chamber the antisocial behaviour that has been ravaging the streets of Dublin for the past couple of weeks.  This morning I saw the video of the young man in Dublin city last night.  He seemed to be of Indian origin and he appeared to be on a bicycle delivering food and is therefore providing a service to Irish citizens and to people who live in the city.  The disgraceful way he was treated, and the equally disgraceful way that Irish people stood around and cheered the absolute tramps who mistreated that man last night, is an absolute shame and a scourge on all of us.  The Senators are correct to say that as an Oireachtas and a State agency, we have left places in Dublin city as absolutely free-for-all areas.  At a parliamentary party meeting last week one of my own colleagues mentioned that he walked down O'Connell Street at six o'clock of an evening during the summer with his young son.  There was one garda on the entire pedestrian area of O'Connell Street, and when he went over to speak to him the garda told them of how the garda&iacute; who are policing Dublin city are exhausted and how they are crying out for a new policing plan.  It is incumbent upon all of us to make sure that this happens sooner rather than later.  There absolutely should not be any no-go areas in Dublin's capital city, and it certainly should not be for the want of resources being put into the policing system. <\/p> <p>Senator Cassells talked about what I can only assume is yet another scaremongering tactic on behalf of some of the campaign groups around Navan, of rumours about the future of the accident and emergency department at Our Lady's Hospital, Navan.  The Senator is correct that I have not lived in Meath for as long as he has, but for 20 years we have been hearing scaremongering tactics on behalf of people who would like there to be an issue with regard to the future or the sustainability of that accident and emergency department.  The Navan hospital accident and emergency department has received hundreds of thousands of euro worth of investment in the last number of years and I am absolutely sure that there will be more to come.  In the past, when issues have arisen we have always received reassurances, not just from the Minister of the day and we have been through a number of Ministers for Health over the past ten years when most of these issues have been raised; we have also received assurances from the HSE that even if it wanted to do something, which it does not, there is no capacity anywhere else.  I can absolutely assure the Senator, as he well knows, that this capacity has not grown suddenly in the past years.  I am very happy to put this on the record of the House.  I will schedule a general debate on healthcare and there is one already being scheduled for Sl&aacute;intecare.<\/p> <p>Senator Mary Fitzpatrick spoke about the very unwelcome announcement and confirmation by the Minister for Transport yesterday that he hopes the MetroLink will be delivered by 2034.  I have requested a debate on this and hopefully that will happen in the next couple of weeks because this is certainly not acceptable.  We do not yet even know why the project has been pushed back.<\/p> <p>Senator Maria Byrne spoke on the welcome announcement on Shannon Group plc, which is very welcome.  P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh is a colleague of most people here and we all know and hold him in such high esteem.<\/p> <p>Senator Byrne also spoke about the fact that so many workers are not going to be working in our drinks and hospitality and entertainment industries, which is very worrying.<\/p> <p>Senator Ardagh acknowledged and put on the record of the House the passing of Eileen Rushe yesterday.  We extend our deepest sympathy and our condolences to her family.  She was an incredible woman.  One could not help but be charmed by her wonderful personality.  This is not the least to say the amount of work that she has done advocating on behalf of people who have been much ill treated by the system over the years.<\/p> <p>Senator Mullen spoke of what we consider to be celebrations.  I did not think that Senator Mullen was being critical of anybody.  I thought he was just making observations.  I do not know who I could even ask for a debate on the meaning of celebrations, but perhaps it is something that we just take as they come and maybe talk to the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media who was involved in the centenary commemorations.  Maybe I will put the request to her.<\/p> <p>Senator Barry Ward raised the continued waiting list for people with adapted cars.  I will write to the Minister on this.  If there is a list for people who have a more urgent need for the normal test then there should be a list also for the people who have an urgent need for the adapted test.<\/p> <p>Senator Malcolm Byrne asked for a debate on pensions.  I am absolutely sure that when the report from the commission on pensions goes to Cabinet we will absolutely have a debate on that.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Senator is probably right.  There will be a lot of populist talk but the stark reality is that it has to be paid for by somebody.  If we do not take it out of people's left pocket, we will take it out of their right pocket.  I welcome that debate, particularly as I was embroiled in it the last time we debated the issue about 18 months ago.  <\/p><p>Senator Black spoke about the Music and Entertainment Association of Ireland&rsquo;s pre-budget reflections.  I will bring them to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin.  That industry that has not even begun to start reopening properly.  Its members need all support we can give them until they are back up and running and entertaining us on a weekly basis, as they did pre-Covid.<\/p><p>Senator Moynihan raised the issue of a three-year rent freeze.  The living wage has increased so significantly as a result of price increases in rent.  A debate on the Housing for All plan will take place this afternoon.  I am sure the Minister will listen to the Senator's concerns about this issue.<\/p><p>Senator Ruane spoke about animal welfare and the sale of pets.  She has raised this issue on a number of occasions.  I will contact the Minister about it.  I am sure the ban on fur farming legislation is already drafted.  I do not know whether it is the legislation to deal with these amendments.  If it is, it would make sense for all of us to try to do what Senator Ruane has been trying to do for the past 12 months.  I will come back to the Senator on that.<\/p><p>I did not get a chance to reply to the email Senator Boyhan sent this morning.  What it set out is horrific and highlights the major gaps that arise when the employer who people work for is not responsible for the conditions in which they work.  Agency workers are a special group of people.  If most of the agency workers in Ireland were Europeans, they would be covered by frontier legislation with regard to the European Union.  The Senator and I know that most of the people who work in our meat industry are not Europeans.  That is why it is so easy for them to be so badly treated.  The Senator is right that it is up to us to make sure that stops.  I will contact the Minister with responsibility for employment affairs and the officials I used to work with to see if we can quickly draft legislation to give these employees equal status, as if they were employees of the companies for which they are doing the work and not of those that are paying them.  I will come back to the Senator on that.<\/p><p>Senator McGahon spoke about the jump in vehicle registration tax on electric vehicles.  We have all been around these Houses for many years.  The one thing we all know is that when we tax something more we get less of it.  If we want people to drive electric cars, it does not make sense to tax them more.  That is an issue we will have to discuss with the Minister for Finance when the Finance Bill comes before the House in the next few weeks.<\/p><p>Senator Crowe opened proceedings by seeking a special exemption from the &euro;410 per night fee payable by those in the entertainment industry.  The review of night-time licensing will probably take a year.  We should push for the introduction of a temporary measure in the budget.  If the entertainment, drinks and hospitality industries need the support they say they need, a new night-time licence would be a fast way for us to make a difference in the short term.  I will bring the Senator&rsquo;s suggestions to the attention of the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#M00200","speaker":"1653","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":76,"content":"<p>Senator Boyhan has proposed an amendment to the Order of Business, \"That No. 14 be taken before No. 1.\"  The Leader has indicated she is prepared to accept the amendment.

Its purpose is to strengthen Ireland's regime against the smuggling of persons, and to implement several important international instruments.  People smuggling is the facilitated, irregular movement of people across borders for financial or other benefit.  It is distinct from human trafficking in that smuggling occurs with the consent of the person, while trafficking involves the recruitment, transportation and exploitation of a victim.  However, smuggling is inevitably closely linked to trafficking and exploitation, often leaving those who are smuggled owing huge debts to the smugglers, and, of course, often placing those being smuggled in mortal danger.<\/p><p>The UN Office for Drugs and Crime estimates that 2.5 million people are smuggled each year.  Catastrophic loss of life is all too common, and everyone in the House will recall the horrific deaths of 39 Vietnamese men, women, and children in Essex two years ago.  Ireland has experienced the tragic consequences of people smuggling in the Wexford tragedy of December 2001, where eight people suffocated in a container while attempting clandestine entry into the United Kingdom.  People smuggling is a highly profitable criminal activity and one that is difficult to prosecute, given its inherently complex and cross-border nature.  A co-ordinated international response, including effective and dissuasive criminal sanctions, is vital, and this Bill will ensure Ireland plays its part in that response.<\/p><p>However, criminal sanctions are one part of a broader national response, particularly in respect of how we support those most at risk of exploitation.  I draw the House's attention to the approval by Government earlier this year to revise the national referral mechanism to make it easier for victims of trafficking to come forward, be identified and access advice, accommodation and support.  Other parts of the ongoing work on trafficking include the drafting of a new national action plan on human trafficking; the development of training, through NGOs, targeting front-line staff in industries such as hospitality, airline and shipping who may come into contact with trafficked persons; the work being undertaken to provide dedicated accommodation for female victims of sexual exploitation; and increased funding dedicated specifically to supporting victims of trafficking.<\/p><p>As Senators will be aware, people smuggling is already an offence in Ireland under section 2 of the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000.  The legislation before the House is motivated by two goals, namely, to extend those provisions in line with the relevant EU and UN instruments, ensuring that Ireland meets its shared international obligations; and to address the practical limitations of that Act, which have hampered successul prosecutions.  The Bill reflects the provisions of three international instruments.  First is the EU Council Directive 2002\/90\/EC defining the facilitation of unauthorised entry, transit and residenc;, second is the EU framework decision 2002\/946\/JHA on the strengthening of the penal framework to prevent the facilitation of unauthorised entry, transit and residence; and, third is the 2000 UN Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, which supplements the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.<\/p><p>The EU framework is composed of two instruments that were adopted together and are commonly referred to as the facilitators package.  Together, they set a baseline against people smuggling across the European Union, providing for the essential elements of offences and their geographic scope, minimum and maximum penalties, corporate liability, extra-territorial jurisdiction and inchoate offences.  These instruments were introduced in 2002, and at the time Ireland and the UK chose not to participate in them.  However, we have committed, in the context of closer links with the Schengen Area, and for the purpose of accessing the second generation Schengen information system, SIS II, to implement them by the end of this year.<\/p><p>The UN protocol was adopted by the General Assembly in 2000.  It was the first global instrument to contain an agreed definition of smuggling of migrants.  Countries that ratify this treaty must ensure that migrant smuggling is criminalised in accordance with the protocol's legal requirements.  Taken together, the EU and UN instruments require criminalisation of facilitating smuggling into any member state or state party to the protocol.  They also provide for the criminalisation of facilitating not only the act of unlawful entry into a state, but also that of facilitating unlawful presence.  The instruments also require the exercise of extra-territorial jurisdiction on a broader scale than is currently provided for.<\/p><p>As I noted, significant practical issues have arisen in respect of the offence under section 2 of the 2000 Act.  The most important of these is that it is an element of the existing offence that it must be proved that the smuggling was done for gain.  Investigations conducted to date have been largely intelligence led, and prior preliminary investigative actions will usually have been conducted in advance of an arrest.  The requirement to prove the &quot;for gain&quot; element of the offence places a difficult burden on investigators, particularly when an offence is discovered at the point of entry rather than through prior intelligence gathering.  This is a well-known issue in respect of these offences.  The European Commission, for example, in its analysis, stated: <\/p> <blockquote> \tIn this context, it is useful to recall that payments to migrant smugglers tend to occur in third countries of origin and transit.  These are often done in cash ... [or] through the use of intermediary brokers operating largely without a paper trail and often outside the law ... <\/blockquote> <p>While the offence under the 2000 Act has been successfully prosecuted, in practice it is often simply impossible to meet this burden of proving gain, even under circumstances where it is clear that no humanitarian purpose of any sort exists.  Accordingly, a reversed burden approach has been taken, which provides that it is a defence to prove on the balance of probabilities that the conduct was engaged in for the purpose of humanitarian assistance rather than for material benefit.  It also expressly includes in the scope of the defence those working on behalf of bona fide organisations giving assistance without charge to those seeking asylum.  A central provision of the international response to people smuggling is to avoid criminalisation of smuggled persons, and the Bill makes express provision to ensure that criminalisation of smuggled persons does not occur.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy James Browne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2443\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2443&amp;amp;pid=JamesBrowne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->A person does not commit an offence by virtue of being smuggled.  The primary offence under this section must be in respect of another person, while section 9(2) provides that a person does not commit an offence by aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring his or her own smuggling.  To avoid any doubt or chilling effect, the Bill also makes express provision in section 5(2) to ensure that those providing goods and services in the ordinary course of business, landlords, for example, are not captured under the definition of what constitutes assisting presence in the State.  <\/p><p>I will now briefly mention the specific provisions of the Bill.  Part 1 contains preliminary provisions, including the Short Title, commencement, expenses, repeals and definitions.  Part 2 forms the heart of this Bill and creates a new criminal offence.  <\/p><p>Section 6 provides for the offence of \"assisting unlawful entry into, transit across or presence in [the] State\".  The essential ingredients of the offence are that a person \"intentionally assists [...] entry into, transit across or presence in the State of another person, where the entry [...], transit [...] or presence\" of the other person is in breach of a specified provision of Irish immigration law and the perpetrator \"knows or has reasonable cause to believe that [the] entry into, transit across or presence\" of the other person \"is in breach of a specified provision\".  A person convicted of an offence under this section is liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for up to ten years.  <\/p><p>Section 7 provides for the offence of \"assisting unlawful entry into, transit across or presence in [a] designated state\".  The elements of the penalties applicable for this offence are similar to those of an offence in respect of the State under section 6(1), except that section 7 offences relate to the entry into, transit across or presence in the designated state, rather than Ireland.  The relevant immigration law is that of the designated state rather than that of Ireland.  More limited extraterritorial provision also applies in these cases.<\/p><p>Section 8 provides for an additional offence in respect of fraudulent documents used, or intended to be used, for people smuggling.  These provisions complement those of Part 4 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud) Offence Act 2001.  <\/p><p>As I already mentioned, section 9 provides a humanitarian assistance defence.  Section 10 provides for penalties.  Notably, it provides that the court shall \"treat as an aggravating factor any behaviour by the offender\" that endangers \"the life or safety of the person\" being smuggled or \"that resulted in the exploitation or inhuman or degrading treatment of the person to whom the offence related\".<\/p><p>Part 3 of the Bill deals with the enforcement measures, notably including powers in respect of ships at sea, and provides for the confiscation and forfeiture of vehicles and vessels used in the commission of smuggling offences.  <\/p><p>Part 4 deals with miscellaneous matters, including provisions for liability for corporate bodies.  Part 5 addresses incidental amendments arising to other enactments.<\/p><p>I am indebted to several organisations that made submissions in respect of the Oireachtas's scrutiny of the general scheme of this Bill.  These included Ruhama, the Migrant Rights Council Ireland, MRCI, the Bar Council and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC.  These submissions made concerning the general scheme have been considered in-depth during the drafting of the Bill and, where appropriate, are reflected in the Bill before the House.  Many details will merit debate and I look forward to working constructively with Members as the Bill progresses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#Q00700","speaker":"1618","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":94,"content":"<p>Looking around the Chamber, I note that the Minister of State is a barrister, as are four of my colleagues.  We are dealing with a justice matter, but this is technical legislation that we are bringing forward.  We are trying to transpose legislation and recommendations from the EU and the UN into Irish law.  Regarding research on this Bill, and the concept, I welcome the briefing note that we got from the Department last week.  We also have the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech today.  I thank the Oireachtas Library and Research Service as well for an excellent Bill digest with some useful information on this legislation.<\/p> <p>None of us can properly appreciate what it takes for people to get involved in this activity - I do not mean on the commercial side - and to subject themselves to being smuggled.  I refer to people who go to someone and say that they need to be smuggled because of the pressure they are under in the countries they would like to leave.  It is not generally because people feel like they would like to go to a certain country.  People are leaving countries such as Syria and I am sure Afghanistan now.  They cannot get out of those countries via the regular routes and into other countries.  People in those situations will do anything.  <\/p> <p>Other people are exploiting those vulnerable people.  Human trafficking is worse again.  Unless people are experts in this field, they may not appreciate the difference between people smuggling, which is where payment is made to be smuggled and people are then, in theory, free once they reach the far side, assuming that they manage to get to the far side.  The Minister of State alluded to those awful tragedies where people do not make it on these journeys.  Human trafficking then is where people are being smuggled and incarcerated at the far end.  The victims are then exploited for long-term or permanent economic gain by those people who have trafficked them.  <\/p> <p>Either way, these are people who have found themselves in situations where they feel that they have to get out of their own jurisdictions and countries.  They may have had to borrow or spend their life savings to do that.  They may have had to give those savings to some of these people smugglers, who are exploiting these fears and also putting their victims in enormous danger in many cases, such as in refrigerated lorries, etc.  They also transport people into countries where there is no guarantee that they will necessarily be safe, either on the journey or when they arrive.  The victims may not be free when they do reach their destination and they may even end up in a trafficking situation.  <\/p> <p>This Bill is welcome.  I note in the Bill digest that we are one of two countries in Europe that has the worst status.  I think it is tier 2 or under watch status, as it is called.  It is a survey from the United States.  We must ensure that we are not any less proactive in banning, discouraging and enforcing rules against people smuggling.  It is a vile, horrible and evil activity, which preys on the most vulnerable.  I happened to be in Budapest in the summer of 2015, I think it was, when many people arrived and were trying to get into Europe.  They were mainly trying to get to Germany.  People could be seen around train stations because they are warm, there is surveillance and they do not close at night.  However, those people were just so vulnerable.  One could see the fear in their eyes.  They were not aggressive.  They were just fleeing.  They were leaving behind their entire lives, existences, properties, families and any assets they may have had just to get out of where they were.  None of us can really appreciate that experience.  Our grandfathers and great-grandfathers might have emigrated from Ireland, for various reasons, but they would not have felt the need to be smuggled.  Therefore, we all feel for people in these types of situations, but we probably do not really appreciate the absolute pressure that they are under to escape possible arrest and killing in their own countries.  These people are trying to get out and they are doing anything they can to achieve that goal.  <\/p> <p>However, we must discourage the people smugglers.  I heard the Minister of State on the radio discussing this issue and stating that people from Afghanistan would be allowed in and would be able to bring family members with them into the country.  We all appreciate trying to provide refuge for people who are under pressure.  However, there are people who are making commercial gains from this situation and often putting the people they are gaining their money from into very dangerous situations.  It is vital, therefore, that this legislation is passed quickly.  I certainly do not wish to delay its passage.  I do not doubt that the entire Chamber will be in favour of this legislation.  It was useful that the Minister of State referred to having spoken to representatives from organisations such as Ruhama, the MRCI and IHREC and that he had, where possible and appropriate, taken on board their thoughts on this Bill.  From a Fianna F&aacute;il and a personal perspective, I welcome this legislation.  We must always be trying to ensure that we do not criminalise the people who are the victims in these situations.  It is the perpetrators, those making economic gain from exploiting vulnerable people, that we are targeting.  I appreciate the difficulty in apprehending those perpetrators.  The Minister of State alluded to some of the issues.  Cash is used and other countries are involved.  We must, however, make this a punitive regime where we can prove cases and make it as difficult as possible for people to engage in people smuggling.  It is a despicable activity.  No one in this House would say otherwise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#R00200","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I of course welcome this Bill.  It is of a technical nature, but it does some important things.  The Minister of State discussed the difficulty of obtaining prosecutions under section 2 of the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000.  There have been prosecutions in that regard, but the Minister of State's point was that it is often difficult to prove effectively that the trafficking or bringing of people into the State was for gain.  It can be very difficult to prove for the obvious reason that the payment would have been made in other places and in ways that are difficult to detect.  I refer to establishing a reverse burden of proof, in effect, and then providing a defence where people may be engaging in humanitarian assistance or giving aid to asylum seekers without levying a charge.  Those defences are necessary in that context of reversing the burden of proof and they are very welcome.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Those defences are very necessary in that context of reversing the burden of proof and they are very welcome.  I also welcome the avoidance of criminalisation of the smuggled persons in question.  We are all aware of the crisis in Afghanistan.  It must be in our minds when discussing legislation that touches on these types of issues.  I learned recently of the plight of female judges in Afghanistan, many of whom have fled to Greece and will need to be resettled.  It strikes me that they are a particularly vulnerable category of people given that they would be targeted for past decisions and so on.  I hope that the Irish Government would be generous and proactive in playing its part in assisting resettling female judges from Afghanistan at this particular time.<\/p><p>Senator Horkan mentioned the US Trafficking in Persons report. I too want to raise the issue of human trafficking.  I acknowledge the distinction that has been drawn between trafficking and smuggling where it is clearly a consensual activity.  It is fair to say that people smuggling is a subset of human trafficking.  There are many commonalities and the issues intersect.  We need to reflect on where Ireland stands in the international standings when it comes to combatting human trafficking.  I raised this issue in the Seanad prior to the summer recess when the Trafficking in Persons report was published by the US Department of State in July.  I remind the House that that report exposed devastating failings in our country's attitude to the trafficking and exploitation of poor and vulnerable people and of our status as a destination and source of people smuggling.  While this legislation is welcome in that it fulfils some of our international obligations and seeks to correct a loophole in our law in the area of people smuggling, we have a long way to go in terms of the wider issue of the part that we must play in combatting human trafficking.  The Trafficking in Persons report paints a picture of a basket case country which is in the same league as dictatorships and banana republics in terms of tackling this problem.  The US Department of State very helpfully produces a colour coded map of Europe.  Where we stand on that map should be a cause of profound shame and embarrassment to policymakers here and to all of us in the legislative process.  Countries are shaded in green, yellow, amber and red according to their performance in dealing with this crisis.  Ireland is shaded in amber, alongside Belarus and Azerbaijan.  The only country ranked worse than us is Russia, which is shaded in red.  What does that say about us as a country that increasingly likes to talk up its human rights credentials internationally and our supposed tolerance and respect for human rights.  The UK, which is increasingly a bogeyman for our entire political class, from Fine Gael on the one side to Sinn F&eacute;in on the other, ranks quite well in the Trafficking in Persons, TiP, report despite its supposedly porous borders and well publicised problems with illegal immigration.<\/p><p>The most shocking aspect of people smuggling in Ireland, and of trafficking in Ireland, is how common and every day it is.  We all unknowingly, probably, meet or interact with victims of such activities on a weekly basis.  I mentioned in July that I had been in touch with a religious sister who assists victims of trafficking and who made the truly chilling comment to me that there is not a town in Ireland that does not have victims of human trafficking working in it.  Sadly, that is borne out by the TiP report, which found that victims of smuggling are being exploited in Ireland in domestic work, the restaurant industry, nail salons, food processing, waste management, fishing and seasonal agriculture, and car washing services.  These are sectors we all interact with every week, if not every day.  Needless to say, victims are also being exploited in criminal enterprises such is the cultivation of cannabis.<\/p><p>We urgently need action to address this situation which is a direct result, or in part a direct result, of the failure of successive Irish Governments.  How else could we explain that we are in such a dreadful position compared with other European democracies?  Some 1,700 years ago St. Augustine reminded us that a country which measures itself by its own common interests only and not by the standards of justice is not structurally different from a well organised band of robbers.  Sadly, Irish foreign policy increasingly lacks a moral core.  Increasingly, we do what suits ourselves at the expense of justice.  We virtue-signal at home, strut the world stage and appoint special envoys without proper consultation, all to veneer that we are somehow on board with authentic human rights.  Simultaneously, our leaders are rubbing shoulders with members of the Chinese politburo and having tea with ministers from Iran, regimes that have no concept of human rights as we know them.  We need a reality check.  I understand the trade imperatives, but it cannot be a nod to human rights on one hand while winking for trade on the other.  We need to ask some serious questions in this country about how much we really care about human rights.  The sexy stuff that we can parade, that does not cost us anything, is a form of what Dietrich Bonhoeffer would have referred to as \"cheap grace\".  The hard stuff involves making sacrifices, facing up to the fact that as much as we value trade there are certain things to which we cannot close our eyes, one of which that I have been banging about incessantly, is the treatment by the Chinese authorities of the Uyghur minority in Xinjiang.  I add to that its deconstruction of democracy in human rights in Hong Kong, its oppression of people of many religious faiths and its utter denial of that dimension of human rights and dignity that is involved in people's spiritual and philosophical search.  Hardly anything is said about that.  We get reassured by our leaders that they raise it in the appropriate forum, but if one looks at all the former Government Ministers and leaders of this country who seem to be finding their way onto international boards that have to do with Chinese cultural and economic exchange, the political establishment, or the orientation of the political establishment, in this country is very clear.  That has to change.  We cannot claim that we are a little country that has been a big player on the human rights scene and at the same time turn our back on that heritage all in the interests of trade and economic advancement.  We have some serious questions to ask ourselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#R00300","speaker":"1673","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":97,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it agus gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis as ucht an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite aige.

In the course of this debate, there has been a lot of discussion about the differences between people smuggling and people trafficking.  They are not mutually exclusive.  We recognise that.  This Bill represents an extremely important modernisation of the law on people smuggling in Ireland.  It is a mark of progress that we would put in place legislation that is clear and identifies the level at which we must engage with people to ensure that it is feasible for the authorities in this jurisdiction to obtain convictions in regard to activities that all of us can agree are dangerous and regressive in all of their respects.<\/p> <p>The difference between people smuggling and people trafficking covers a whole spectrum of activities from giving a lift from Dublin to Belfast to a person who does not have a visa to enter the UK to the horrible tragedy that we saw in the Minister of State's constituency in terms of the deaths of people on arrival into Rosslare Port.  We know throughout the world that this happens on a scale that is disgusting and abhorrent.  We know also that the Irish Naval Service has been involved in fantastic activities in the Mediterranean in terms of rescuing people who in no uncertain terms are being trafficked, albeit dressed up as smuggling.  The spectrum involved there is not all the subject of the Bill.  <\/p> <p>I agree with much of what Senator Mullen said about the human rights difficulties that we face as a country, both diplomatically and politically.  He is correct.  We deal with China as we must on many spheres.  On the one hand we have many businesses that do well in conducting business with their Chinese counterparts and working through China.  I understand that.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Barry Ward:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->On the other hand, we see from China a spectrum of activity that belies the image of a member of the international community that respects the rule of law.  This includes the imposition on the leaving certificate course of the simplified characters used in Beijing and mainland China and the exclusion of the traditional characters used in places like Taiwan, for example.  It runs from that cultural side of the spectrum to the appalling behaviour of the Chinese Government towards Lithuania, our EU colleague and a country not dissimilar from ours with respect to population etc.  Lithuania, it seems, made the grave error of doing what Beijing perceives as a slight by recognising a Taiwan representational office in Vilnius rather than a Taipei representational office.  This has resulted in the recalling of the Chinese ambassador to Lithuania from Vilnius and the expulsion of the Lithuanian ambassador to China.  China is continuing to attack Lithuania in an ongoing online campaign.  I hope we as a country will stand up to that kind of behaviour because it will not be long before it will come knocking on our door.  As European colleagues, we must stand in solidarity with Lithuania in terms of the treatment it is receiving there.<\/p><p>As I said, that is not the subject of this Bill and probably is not for this debate but it is an important issue nonetheless and something we should all have in the back of our minds.  With respect to this Bill, and the people smuggling aspects of it, there is, as I said, a spectrum of activity covered by this Bill, from giving a lift over a border to somebody not entitled to cross it to the absolutely intentional and deliberate attempt to circumvent the laws of entry into this or any other country.  I notice the wide, transnational application of the Bill, which is welcome.  This is not something that exists only within the Republic of Ireland or the Irish jurisdiction.  It is appropriate that we should extend this to the protocol countries under the UN protocol, to our European neighbours and to the other countries defined in, I think, Part 3 of the Bill.  We must address this not because there are parts of that spectrum that might be perceived to be not particularly harmful to the person who is smuggled but to recognise that the overall effect of having an unchecked regime whereby people can be smuggled in and out of a country is massively dangerous.  It is dangerous to the countries involved and is certainly dangerous to the people being smuggled.  Very often these people are being smuggled at their express wish or choice but the problem is once they operate in that space, which is illegal, they are massively vulnerable to being exploited.  That is where you fall into that people-trafficking vein.<\/p><p>The danger is it is so easy to switch from being smuggled to being trafficked.  Senator Mullen has mentioned before somebody who has given him information and people who are working.  These are probably people we encounter in our daily lives and we are unaware of the plight they are facing.  It is entirely appropriate we address this issue head-on because it is so easy for people who might decide they want to come to Ireland or any other state to come here but find once they arrive it is not at all the way they imagined it would be and that more importantly, their personal position is not what they imagined it would be.  They might end up working off debts or being put in a place where they are simply not free and they do not avail of the rights they should have as people living in this country.  In that regard, I particularly acknowledge that the Bill specifically avoids the criminalisation of people who have been smuggled.  That is tremendously important, for a number of reasons.  First, the simple justice of the fact the person who has been smuggled is not the person we should be targeting from a prosecutorial view.  We should be looking at the people who are smuggling them.  These people are profiteering from the disadvantage, the misery, in some cases, and the real difficulty of those they smuggle.  Thus it is entirely appropriate we mark clearly that the latter are not the targets.  The other really important reason we do that is to let them know that when they come here, by whatever means, that they are free to report the fact they were smuggled to authorities here.  There should be no fear in any person who has been brought to this country illegally that he or she cannot go the authorities and report what has happened.  In tandem with not criminalising them, we must put in place a scheme that means they will not suffer through deportation or at least that they will get a very sympathetic hearing from the authorities here in relation to their ongoing status in this country, rather than the fear they might have that by reporting the smuggling activity, they will end up back where they started.  They may want to stay here and we should have a sympathetic ear for people in that position.<\/p><p>In that regard, I wish to address some of the definitions in the Bill and ask some questions which the Minister of State may have the opportunity to answer.  Section 6(1) refers to the intentional nature of smuggling a person and I understand that entirely.  However, section 6(1)(b) refers to a reasonable belief on the part of the person doing the smuggling.  Again, I do not have a difficulty with that.  I wonder whether there is room in that section for some reference to recklessness.  Is there a danger a person who does engage in this intentionally might be able to say it was not intentional?  Is there then a difficulty for the State in prosecutorial terms in establishing that intent and are we binding our hands by requiring the prosecution to establish intent rather than recklessness?  Recklessness is used in the Bill in section 14(8)(c)(i) in relation to statements made to enforcement officers.  Again, I have no difficulty with that but I wonder whether there a place for it in the offences provided for in section 6 as well, to ensure there is a clear identification of the fact that in a prosecution, the prosecution does not have to establish that intent, which can sometimes be difficult but to put before the court a clear demonstration that there is an issue in respect of whether they should have known.<\/p><p>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister of State on it.  I look forward to its passage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#S00200","speaker":"1685","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":99,"content":"<p>The timing of the Second Stage reading of this important legislation, which the Green Party is very pleased to support, is almost uncanny.  Within the last 24 hours, as we probably all know, two women were jailed over human trafficking and organising prostitution.  They became the first people convicted in Ireland of human trafficking for the prostitution ring they ran in the midlands.  That followed a six-week jury trial over the summer.  They were convicted by the jury and Judge Francis Comerford passed sentence yesterday, giving them both custodial sentences in excess of five years.  It is reported:<\/p> <blockquote> \tJudge Comerford said the offences did not relate to trafficking the women into Ireland but the control exercised over them once they arrived here when the victims had become &quot;indentured slaves.&quot;  &quot;They coerced the victims into a sustained and degrading period of prostitution which did great harm to all victims for financial gain,&quot; the judge remarked.  He said the two accused had taken advantage of vulnerable women who had no real alternative but to accept their exploitation before finally summoning enough courage to break free. <\/blockquote> <p>If ever we wanted a live, real example to show this is not theoretical or about getting in line with Europe, European instruments and transposing laws from Europe, this is it.  This is real, this happened and as Senator Mullen said, it is happening all the time.  Sometimes it is visible but more often it can be invisible.  We can comment on this because the sentencing process is complete.  As Judge Comerford said, the victims had no real alternative but they tragically accepted direct exploitation before summoning the courage to break free.  No doubt huge damage was done.  I hope there are sufficient counselling and support services in this country to support the victims on the receiving end of such horrendous crimes. I note &quot;breaking free&quot; is the phrase used by the trial judge in that matter and I welcome the recently-approved plans for the national referral mechanism, NRA, to make it easier for victims of human trafficking to come forward and be supported.  I look forward to seeing this put on a statutory footing.  It will hopefully enable more victims to come forward because coming forward in such instances must take huge courage, I can only imagine.  It can be a dark, lonely, isolating and nerve-wracking experience.<\/p><p>On Second Stage it is appropriate to flag matters.  Is the Minister of State satisfied concerns raised by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission are adequately addressed?<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Vincent P.

A number of months ago the IHREC chief commissioner, Ms Sin&eacute;ad Gibney, was reported as saying that Ireland is both a destination and source country for human trafficking, including people trafficked for sexual exploitation, domestic work, fishing, agriculture, the hospitality sector, waste management, and car washing services among others.<\/p><p>As other speakers said, this is not some invisible economy at work.  Perhaps prostitution is done in quiet places in the dark.  In the case of many of these services, such as catering and car washing, for all we know, we are in a sense inadvertently - I emphasise the word \"inadvertently\" - assisting part of this ring.  It is reassuring that the Oireachtas will tighten the grip but I am concerned by what Ms Gibney said.  IHREC's recommendation made it clear that a more robust, consistent, and thoroughly documented response system to the smuggling of persons in Ireland is required for us to be able to take on this scourge.<\/p><p>The IHREC also said that the proposed law needs to take a vital step in putting in place a system that is victim-centred, gender sensitive and takes into account the experiences, support needs and, above all, the devastating impact of any related exploitation and abuse on the lives of those affected.  We will have an opportunity on the later stages of the Bill to ensure that this legislation is tightened up and becomes more robust.  However, I would like to know if the Minister of State can assure us that he can meet those concerns head on.<\/p><p>In its submission, the IHREC advised that the offence of people smuggling as currently drafted in the Bill must be revised to ensure legal certainty.  Its positive, constructive proposal that aggravating factors, especially which come into play at a sentencing matter for a trial judge, should include a wide range of categories, including offences that involve children, women, or people with disabilities.  Overall, this Bill is a step in the right direction and we welcome it.<\/p><p>In the week that is in it, and to stay topical, I welcome the recent announcement that 500 extra places will soon be made available in this country for Afghan families.  As other speakers said, the Bill proposes to update the criminal justice aspects of the regime in respect of smuggling.  It reflects the provisions of three international instruments against people smuggling.  These are: the EU Council directive, the EU framework decision, and the United Nations protocol.

Whether these are people who are risking their lives and, in many cases dying, in the Mediterranean, or who are suffocated on the backs of lorries in Europe, or, indeed, being rescued subsequently he held in detention centres, their lives unfortunately are miserable.<\/p> <p>People do not place themselves, or in many cases their children, in such danger without good reason.  They are often fleeing their own countries for a better way of life, whether as political, or indeed economic, refugees.  Of course, rational and calm logic would tell those compelled to use the traffickers and smugglers that their lives in the hands of these criminals will generally speaking get much worse.  However, as we know only too well from the story of immigration in this country, calm reflection on the choices one has to make is in most cases an unaffordable luxury.  \"Needs must\", is what is driving these vulnerable people.<\/p> <p>This Bill designed to assist those caught up in the dangerous world of people smuggling and it will align the legislation in the state with EU legislation.  It also specifically allows for circumstances where a person is brought here by a designated organisation for the purpose of seeking asylum.  This is new and has the potential to be helpful.  The Bill will allow for designated organisations to bring asylum seekers to this State without fear of prosecution.  It is with the utmost importance, because we are dealing with people who are at risk, adults and children, that designated organisations are rigorously vetted to reduce any possible risk of exploitation. <\/p> <p>The Bill also allows for prosecution in cases where the offence did not take place in this State.  However, that is a matter for the Director for Public Prosecutions, DPP, as there must be a connection to this State, either in the commission of the offence or indeed after it.  While we discuss and, hopefully, ultimately get to a stage we can pass this legislation, there is need to reduce the time it takes to process asylum applications.  To assist in overcoming this time delay, the Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB, and the Irish National Immigration Service, INIS, should be given additional resources.<\/p> <p>Overall colleagues in the Chamber and my party are content with the aspirations of this Bill.  We, like others, will support it on Second Stage.  We have all heard some of the horrific and tragic stories, either through the media or through our privileged positions within this House.  It is important that we have the opportunity to discuss legislation such as this in the broadest sense.  Indeed, that is what Second Stage is for.  However, there is also a real onus on us to act and to pass laws that will make a difference - laws that will have an impact and that will ultimately support those who are most vulnerable and who are facing such horror and such difficulty.<\/p> <p>I, like other colleagues, not least Senator Vincent P. Martin, who spoke previously, support the Bill at this stage.  However, I reserve the right to work with colleagues in the House, with the Minister of State and with his officials with a shared hope and aspiration to refine, strengthen and improve this legislation where it is required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#U00300","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":103,"content":"<p>Our next contributor is Senator Mark Wall and he has eight minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#U00400","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I, too, want to welcome the Minister of State to the House.  The Labour Party welcomes this Bill.  It is described as technical in nature.  As was said, it proposes an updating of the criminal justice aspects of the regime in respect of the smuggling of persons.  It reflects the provisions of three international instruments against people smuggling.  Of course, the need for this legislation is to ensure our continued compliance with the EU directives, allowing for national border control, customs, and police authorities responsible for checks at the external Schengen area border, as well as within that area.  In order to circulate alerts about wanted or missing persons and objects, such as stolen vehicles and documents, we are told that compliance with these measures is required by 31 December 2021 and is a condition of continued access.<\/p> <p>It is important to acknowledge, as the Minister of State has done, the continued great work of the NGOs in this area in protecting and assisting those vulnerable, who often find themselves isolated in a foreign country and in need of urgent assistance.  It is also very important to distinguish between people smuggling and human trafficking, although as the Minister of State said, both are inevitably closely linked.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mark Wall:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarkWall&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is very important in that, as has been said, the people who are smuggled owe huge debts to their smugglers, which often places them in mortal danger, as we have seen in the past.<\/p><p>In 2019 alone, one of the organisations the Minister of State mentioned in his introduction, Ruhama, worked with 116 victims of trafficking from 30 different countries.  It does great work.  Ruhama states that it has seen at first hand the detrimental impact trafficking can have on individuals and it welcomes any strengthening of the legal provisions designed to combat trafficking or people smuggling on a national legislative footing.  Ruhama has worked with service users based in every county in the Republic of Ireland.  It also provides training for front-line workers and those in law enforcement centred on knowing the signs of human trafficking and identifying individuals who are potential victims of human trafficking.  Ruhama states that we must be under no illusion, as sex trafficking happens in every city, town and village across the country.  Ruhama and other NGOs have welcomed the implementation of the UN Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, which supplements the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime through this legislation.  The highly orchestrated and organised nature of the crimes associated with commercial people-smuggling cannot be overstated.  The NGOs further state that it is their experience on the front line of service provision, and it is widely documented, that the provision and pursuit of human traffickers can be very complex considering the international reach of these crimes.  It is vitally important to note that people who work in this area say that the operation of people smuggling is constantly changing. It is important that our legislation continues to keep pace with the vile attempts to smuggle people, which is what is before the House today.<\/p><p>In its 2020 report, Countering the Challenges of Human Trafficking in the Digital Era, Europol noted that information and communications technology have rapidly changed the criminal landscape, with traffickers adopting new methods and ways to recruit, control and exploit victims.  Covid-19 has played a role in the changing landscape of human trafficking.  Last year, the European Migrant Smuggling Centre reported that criminals are finding new ways to abuse the most vulnerable migrants wishing to travel or cross Europe and those financially struggling to be victimised into labour or sexual exploitation.  It is important, as Senator Martin indicated, that in recent days we saw two five-year sentences handed down for trafficking, the first of their kind in Ireland.  That is an important statement to be made by this country.<\/p><p>The front-line battle Ruhama and the other NGOs carry out on a daily basis must continue to receive our support, and the level of support must be increased.  It is very important to clearly state that the Bill does not target those who have been smuggled.  It is also important that we keep the lines of communication open with people who, unfortunately, find themselves in that situation.  We look forward to the continuation of the Bill through the House.  We support it on this Stage, and we look forward to further debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#U00500","speaker":"1684","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, to the House.  I also welcome the Bill.  However, I wish to highlight the importance of language in the Bill.  For example, when we use words such as \"smuggled\", \"trafficked\" or \"asylum seeker\", we can lose track of the people and the stories beneath these terms.  While I welcome many of the provisions within the Bill, some of the issues I have with it stem from a lack of precision in the language, which threatens to lose the complexity and struggle of each of the stories.  For that reason, when we are discussing the Bill it is important that we remember the individual people and the struggles which we are speaking about today.<\/p> <p>We have all watched with horror the pictures of migrants making the journey across the Mediterranean in search of safety.  Unfortunately, since the start of this year more than 1,300 people have died while making this journey.  It is important to keep these images at the front of our mind during any discussion on policy.  That must start by explicitly stating within the Bill that the person who is smuggled will not be liable to criminal prosecution.  The goal of the Bill, as I understand it, is to bring Ireland in line with our European and international counterparts.  In this sense, to add in a clear line protecting these vulnerable people from criminal prosecution would bring Ireland on par with the standard set in the UN protocol against the smuggling of migrants, on which the EU's two legal instruments, which this Bill seeks to implement, are based.<\/p> <p>In addition, it is essential that the Bill explicitly grants rights and protections to vulnerable smuggled persons.  These are people who have undertaken the most dangerous journeys.  While the State has the right to control the entry and residence status of anyone entering the country, the legislation must also make accommodation for their safety and protection.<\/p> <p>Our Constitution, as well as European and international law, offer several fundamental protections to everyone who reaches our shores, regardless of their migration status.  People who have been smuggled are entitled to these rights and that should be clearly stated within the Bill.  To do this would, again, not exceed the standard set by EU laws, which this Bill is looking to implement, but merely meet them.<\/p> <p>Making smuggled persons' rights and protections explicit within the Bill would bring it in line with the Court of Justice of the European Union.  In 2014 the court confirmed that personal rights afforded to European citizens and laid out in the European Convention on Human Rights Act, as well as the Charter of Fundamental Rights, are also afforded to those people who are smuggled.<\/p> <p>In order to ensure that these vulnerable people are offered the rights and protections to which they are entitled, we must first ensure that they are properly identified.  Currently, Ireland and Romania are the only two EU states that are placed on the tier 2 watchlist of the recently published Trafficking in Persons report.  The report, compiled by the United States Government to combat human trafficking, suggests with this ranking that the estimated number of victims of severe forms of trafficking in Ireland is either very significant or is significantly increasing.<\/p> <p>It is therefore essential that this Bill commits to the establishment of a proper identification process, which should tie in to clearly stated rights and entitlements laid out within the Bill.  However, without naming specific rights and protections or administrative processes, the most basic entitlement that these vulnerable people deserve, is to be treated with respect and dignity.  This starts with training.  The Council of Europe's Group of Experts on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings recently recommended that Irish authorities ensure that front-line staff involved in the identification of victims of trafficking should be provided with regular training and guidance on best practice.  By placing a provision in the Bill committing the State to regular training of officers and officials dealing with smuggling and trafficking, we offer these vulnerable people the best possible chance of being dealt with in a dignified and respectful manner.<\/p> <p>I wish to highlight the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission's recommendation that those who smuggle for humanitarian purposes should be entitled to use this as an exemption from criminal prosecution rather than a mere defence from it.  If the purpose of the Bill is to bring Ireland in line with the legal instruments for the prosecution of traffickers and smugglers, then to add such an exception to the Bill would only bring Ireland further in line with the 2002 European Council directive on smuggling.  The current provision within section 5 is cast as a defence, rather than an exemption or exclusion, which is not in line with this European provision.<\/p> <p>I call for the Bill to be more precise in its language to ensure that the vulnerable people who it deals with are treated fairly and with dignity.  I also call for the Bill to be explicit in its non-criminalisation of smuggled people, to be clear in the rights and protections given to them and that any humanitarian efforts will not be treated as a crime but as an exemption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#V00200","speaker":"1632"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, for coming to the House to introduce this legislation, which I very much support.  Immigration is one of the biggest challenges facing European nations, including this country.  It is important that we have legislation like this to tackle the smuggling of persons.  Interestingly, one of the first sentences for involvement in human trafficking was handed down in Mullingar criminal court yesterday.  The Minister of State has acknowledged the dedication of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in investigating these crimes and ensuring that they are prosecuted successfully.  They are harrowing crimes with victims at the centre of them.

The definition is important.  Trafficking is obviously without consent and is for exploitation reasons, whereas smuggling is with consent but is illegal and can turn into serious exploitation.  We hear anecdotally of cases where payments for smuggling were not made and exploitation ensued.  That happens a lot. <\/p><p>The Minister of State must be commended on his new legislation, which offers a once in a generation amnesty to undocumented migrants.  Inextricably linked to this legislation is the fact that he is giving a new chance to undocumented people, some of whom are here because of exploitation while others have been smuggled here.  The legislation will affect up to 17,000 women living in Ireland and have a positive impact on their lives. <\/p><p>Many of those who have been trafficked or smuggled here do not know this amnesty is available to them.  It would be great if a helpline could be put in place, perhaps through Ruhama or one of the other NGOs that do unbelievable work in this area, to let people know about it.  Some people are lucky to get the counsel and advice of these amazing NGOs but others, especially those with poor English, many of whom work in the sex industry or as domestic workers, do not know that these organisations and services are there to protect them.  We need to do a lot more on communication.  <\/p><p>I support the legislation and commend the Minister of State on his work on immigration generally.

The hard work that went into consultation in the lead-up to the Bill was excellent.  I appreciate the distinction being made between trafficking and smuggling.  However, in recent weeks, I have received emails from people living in Afghanistan who are desperate to get out and people living in Dublin who have family members, spouses and otherwise, in Afghanistan and are desperate to get them out.  It has given me the slightest sliver of insight into how desperate people must be to call upon the services of smugglers or if they find themselves being trafficked.  There is a possibility of coercion and a desperation in that.  It is very good, therefore, that at the heart of this Bill are provisions ensuring the individual is not criminalised.  It is good and humanitarian legislation and I appreciate that very much.<\/p> <p>Like others, I welcome the convictions for human trafficking secured this week.  They send an important signal.  I am glad the Government sent out press releases to ensure the case in Mullingar court was highlighted and nobody missed it.  There is a disbelief among ordinary people living in Ireland that they are encountering people daily who have been trafficked into the country.  Ordinary individuals can now employe people to provide domestic, gardening or hospitality services, especially via platforms.  If people need somebody to clean their house, they can book an hour or several hours on a platform, which provides ease of access.  Someone will be sent who may or may not speak English and the person will not know anything about the individual's legal status or anything else.  People are relying on the bona fides of the platform.  There is an increasing gap there, in which people in the hospitality industry and other areas may have encountered people who have been trafficked.  I was contacted over a year ago by a person who had someone in to clean their house and became suspicious because the individual was extremely nervous.  The person could have been suffering from some sort of nervous disorder, may have had a meek personality or may have been trafficked.  I connected the individual who contacted me with Ruhama which gave fantastic advice.  It is an amazing, fantastic organisation.  <\/p> <p>We need an information campaign on how we can recognise trafficking and identify if a person we encounter has been trafficked into the country.  The stereotypes we have in our heads are of sex workers in brothels and people who are being sexually exploited.  That image comes from movies and so on but there are also everyday services.  Given the demand and pressure on childcare services, people looking for childcare could come across trafficking more and more.  I say that recognising the distinction between the two.<\/p> <p>The national action plan on trafficking and the national referral mechanism to allow victims to come forward are excellent developments.  What is the status of the review of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 that began in September last year?  The 2017 legislation, which criminalised those who pay for sex and for sexual activities with trafficked persons, was a fantastic step forward but there is the unintended consequence that where two legitimate sex workers work together, they may find themselves liable for an offence.  I would appreciate a comment on that.  Obviously, I support the legislation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#W00400","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":112,"content":"<p>Like my colleague, Senator Seery Kearney, and others, I welcome this important legislation.

One of the most important parts of the Bill is the amnesty for those who are undocumented.  People who are undocumented may not realise the amnesty is available.  I echo the suggestion of having a campaign to make people aware of it, although any such campaign for the people in question would be tricky.  It would not be easy and would have to be done in a sensitive and different way.<\/p> <p>The organisations working in this area must be commended because they ensure that the issue of smuggling and trafficking is always on the political agenda and in the media and general discourse.  People have to wake up to the fact that, sadly, thousands of people in this country have been trafficked.  It is appalling.

There is, of course, an overlap but trafficking is quite a distinct matter, and one where Ireland has rightly taken some action and can strengthen its actions.  This relates to the smuggling of persons which is at their request.  It is, of course, an area which needs to be carefully addressed.  There are very serious concerns around the smuggling of persons illegally.  We need to place it in context.  The reality is that across the world we have conflicts, to which European countries have contributed.  In many cases, they have generated situations which, for example, apply to some of the provisions in this Bill such as not having correct legal documents.  We know that right now in the case of Afghanistan, for example,  people are not necessarily able to identify the documents they need to travel, and even though a person may be legitimately entitled to travel, they may not be able to travel under his or her own name or with a passport.  We have had situations such as that.<\/p> <p>We also know that Europe has, sadly, treated wars, like those in Syria and Afghanistan, as migration crises rather than what they are which is crises of conflict and humanitarian crises.  It was extraordinarily disappointing to see the EU interior ministers producing a statement in August, literally as we watched the crisis unfold in Afghanistan, in which they talked only about preventing illegal entry and what steps needed to be taken to ensure that we did not have a repeat of the situation during the conflict in Syria, a repeat that is of migration in Europe and visible migration in Europe's streets.<\/p> <p>It is important that we are honest about that context, which is that we have a European Union which has been remiss in offering legal safe passage routes which are adequate and offering family reunification models which allow people entry.  Nobody wants to take unsafe routes but where there should be legal routes, where there are better humanitarian programmes and where there are many ways for people to find a legal route and are not pushed into the hands of those who seek to commercially gain from desperation.<\/p> <p>I recognise that there are some provisions in this Bill which are designed to protect those who are being smuggled as opposed to those who are engaged in smuggling.  That is important and I know that is the intent here.  There is still, however, much ambiguity, and we are creating potential situations of jeopardy.<\/p> <p>I note that the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, made numerous recommendations in regard to this Bill at pre-legislative scrutiny stage, the majority of which were not included in the Bill.  One of the most crucial of those was that humanitarian aid should be an exemption under the law, and not a defence in a court case.  That is provided for under the UN convention, which allows that humanitarian aid can be an exemption.  We say it can be a defence, but we still have the situation where there is aggressive prosecution and aggressive litigation.  It is one thing to say you have something as a defence, but you may be waiting for trial for two years, in limbo, or facing the cost of a case, which we know is happening.  In 2018 we had a humanitarian volunteer from County Cork accused of human trafficking while volunteering in Lesbos, Greece.  In March we had Italian prosecutors charging dozens of rescuers from Save the Children and M&eacute;dicins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, accusing them of smuggling.  However long they may be able to defend themselves in those cases, the key point is it is creating a criminalisation of those who are seeking to step in and to engage in the kind of humanitarian search and rescue that our State once engaged in.  The Minister of State, Deputy Browne, very poignantly spoke about the terrible damage done by smugglers and those who gain economically and put people at risk.<\/p> <p>My final point is that the number of refugees assisted by our Naval Service fell from 8,500 in 2015 to 1,088 in 2018.  In 2018 there were 2,160 migrant deaths in the Mediterranean.  These are the realities of the dangerous situations which we create when we do not create safe passage and when states do not step up, and when individuals or NGOs are left in the position of having to do the humanitarian work which states should be doing.  I applaud the intent of the Bill but I would urge that that core point around humanitarian purposes and the issue of safe passage be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#X00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":115,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for their important contribution, general welcome for the Bill and making constructive comments and information.  Several Senators referenced submissions by IHREC and a number of other bodies in regard to the pre-legislative scrutiny.  There was significant criticism at the time.  In drafting the Bill versus the scheme, we tried to address as many of those as possible within the narrow confines of this Bill.  It is a relatively narrow Bill, particularly focused on the criminal element of the legislation in regard to smuggling.  We will have an opportunity again on Committee Stage to look at a number of matters in terms of what the Bill does or does not cover and deal with.<\/p> <p>A number of Senators raised important points.  Senator Horkan and others referred to the stresses and pressures on people who seek to be smuggled into this or any other country.  No one undertakes it lightly so we have been very clear within the Bill to ensure that the smuggled person cannot face any criminal charges under this legislation.  There are serious difficulties in getting prosecutions under the current law in regard to the for gain element and that is one of the key reasons for reversing the burden under this  legislation and instead creating defences, which was acknowledged by Senator Mullen.<\/p> <p>Senator Barry Ward recognised the important modernisation of this law in regard to smuggling, but he also raised an issue around section 1 and the issue of intent and whether there was room to bring in recklessness as well as intent.  I will certainly engage with Senator Ward on that matter prior to the Bill coming to Committee Stage.  That can be looked at in terms of whether it can be expanded to include the issue of recklessness.<\/p> <p>Senator Vincent P.

Hopefully, we will see many more prosecutions of those who are trafficking in human beings.<\/p> <p>Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile recognised that this would make a difference and that we must focus on legislation that will make a real difference to people in their lives.  Senator Mark Wall also welcomed this but highlighted, and he is correct, that we need to keep the lines open with those people being smuggled so that they can provide information and that they are protected.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy James Browne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2443\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2443&amp;amp;pid=JamesBrowne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We need to keep the lines open with those people who are being smuggled in order that they can provide information and to ensure that they are protected.<\/p><p>Senator Black again raised the issue of ensuring that smuggled persons are not committing an offence.  We are quite satisfied that this legislation is clear that those who are being smuggled are not committing an offence by virtue of being smuggled.  Senator Black also raised the issue of humanitarian efforts and that piece around the issue of it being a defence versus an exemption.  Senator Higgins also raised that issue.  It is certainly something we will examine more closely going into Committee Stage.<\/p><p>Senator Ardagh highlighted the issues around those first convictions in Mullingar yesterday under human trafficking.  I appreciate that trafficking and smuggling are different but there is much crossover and they can be closely related, especially where the smuggled person is a vulnerable person.  Senators Ardagh and Conway brought up the issue around the undocumented scheme.  I agree with the Senators that when the undocumented scheme is published, it will be very important that it is highlighted to those who can benefit from it.  We certainly want to ensure that everybody who cannot benefit under that scheme will be able to do so and we have been engaging with the NGOs quite extensively on this scheme to ensure that it is very simple and clear, a bit like the student scheme was a few years ago.  We will ensure that it is written in plain, simple language, that it is accessible and understandable and that it will be highlighted.  There will be no need for recourse for legal advice in terms of being able to apply for this scheme.  It will be simple, clear and straightforward. They were the various issues.  As I said, we will have an opportunity on Committee Stage to go through some of the concerns raised by Senators in more detail and try to address those where we can.<\/p><p>I am glad to bring this legislation before this House, in conjunction with other legislation on which we are working in the Department of Justice to really try to bring a victim-centred approach right across everything we are doing and all the legislation we are bringing in.  I look forward to further engagement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#X00300","speaker":"1618","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1632907800,"counter":117,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":118,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#Y00300","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":119,"content":"<p>Next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#Y00400","speaker":"1630"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":120,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Cathaoirleach.<\/p> <p>Right now, Ireland's housing system is not meeting the needs of enough of our people.  My colleagues in government and I are keenly aware of this.  We know that the impact of the housing crisis is felt in every family across our country, whether hard-pressed tenants stuck in a rent trap or those at the sharpest end of the housing crisis, who will spend tonight sleeping in emergency accommodation or, worse, on streets in our cities.  Housing for All, our new housing plan for Ireland, addresses these challenges head-on.  It is ambitious. It should be because it needs to be.<\/p> <p>The housing crisis is multifaceted and complex.  It is only by viewing it as a whole and taking measures across all aspects of our housing system that we can begin to improve upon the situation for all our citizens.  That is what this plan is all about.  It is a whole of-government approach that will get to grips with this crisis and will improve the lives of all our people.<\/p> <p>As Minister, I recognise the scale and depth of the crisis and the urgent need for action.  Housing for All is a plan that will give the squeezed middle the opportunity to buy their own home.  It is a plan that will help to protect renters.  It is a plan for people who are looking for a fresh start and for people who are looking for the opportunity to rightsize.  Housing for All is about providing people with real choice while ensuring we create the kind of society that helps those who need it.  The breadth of ambition in the plan will help to stop and reverse the decline in home ownership and break the rent trap that many are caught in.<\/p> <p>We need all hands on deck to get to grips with this crisis.  Refusing to fully mobilise the private sector of small and medium-sized builders would be taking on this fight with one hand tied behind our back.  The engagement from all stakeholders is key to our success.  At its simplest, the plan will dramatically expand direct State building of affordable and social homes, remove barriers and give support to allow the private sector to grow, and intervene where it fails to build.  We need to increase the capacity and efficiency of delivery in both public and private sectors.  We will also rely on continued collaborative engagement with the construction sector and other important stakeholders, who are pivotal to its success.<\/p> <p>Housing for All is the most ambitious housing plan in the history of the State.  It sets out a series of 213 bold actions that rise to the challenge, backed up by an unprecedented financial commitment in excess of &euro;4 billion per year.  It is the first time that any Government has published a multi-annual, multibillion funded plan.  More than 300,000 new homes will be built by the end of 2030, including a projected 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes and at least 18,000 cost-rental homes.  It is the largest State-led building programme in our history, surpassing the heydays of the 1940s and 1950s.<\/p> <p>At the heart of Housing for All is a dramatic expansion in the role of the State in providing affordable homes for purchase and rent, while building historic levels of new social housing.  I have always firmly believed in the State taking a role and leading by example.  The plan involves the public and private sector working in tandem to meet our housing requirements of an average of more than 33,000 new homes every year.  Housing for All is about pathways to a better future that draws this comprehensive approach together.  It will support homeownership and increase affordability.  It will eradicate homelessness, increasing social housing delivery and support social inclusion.  It will increase new housing supply across the board.  It will address vacancy and ensure the efficient use of existing stock.  It is the most significant intervention by the State in housing ever.  It is a fully funded, multi-annual, multibillion euro plan.<\/p> <p>The first pathway's vision is clear.  We will place the opportunity of homeownership back in the hands of ordinary working people.  The first home scheme will see people buy their homes with the help of Government by bridging the gap between the finance they have and the cost of the home that they want.  The local authority-led affordable purchase scheme will see homes at an average of &euro;250,000 be available across the country.  A reformed local authority mortgage scheme will see more single people eligible for State-backed mortgages.  I have already reduced the rate in that mortgage product by 0.25%.  The Planning and Development Act 2000 has been amended, meaning 20% of all developments will be set aside for affordable and social housing.<\/p> <p>The affordability measures provided for in this plan will set us on a path to reversing the current trend which has seen homeownership rates fall to historic lows in this country.  I believe in homeownership and this plan supports it.  The introduction of cost rental, a new tenure in Ireland, will be a game changer for those renting.  It will result in thousands of individuals and families renting safe and secure homes at rates at least 25% below the open market value.  We have cost-rental tenants already in place in their homes within 12 months of the formation of this Government.<\/p> <p>The second pathway puts forward the vision of eradicating homelessness and supporting social inclusion.  This will be achieved by delivering 90,000 social homes by 2030, by expanding the Housing First programme and ensuring the provision of necessary health and mental health supports.  We are targeting 1,200 Housing First tenancies over the next five years.  This has been an incredible success, with tenancy retention rates of over 90%.  We will continue its expansion.  The second pathway will also be achieved by focusing on the construction and acquisition of one and two-bed homes.  This will increase the housing options available to people with complex needs, those who are looking for a fresh start, people who want to rightsize and older individuals to allow them to age in place with dignity and independence.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Darragh O'Brien:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2178\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The third pathway is all about increasing housing supply.  We must act decisively to increase the supply of private, affordable and social houses to meet the needs of people in a wide variety of circumstances.  We will do this by significantly increasing funding, with an average of &euro;4 billion each year for the next five years to give the sector the certainty and the stability it needs.  We will provide more State land to the Land Development Agency for social home construction and will provide increased funding for local authorities for land acquisition.  We will overhaul and simplify the planning system to ensure certainty and stability.  The plan also includes modern Kenny report-style powers to ensure the State gets a fairer share of the increase in the value of land resulting from rezoning decisions and that the community benefits as well.  This will have the effect of reducing the speculative value of land in time.<\/p><p>We are empowering local authorities to get back building again and with our affordable housing body, AHB, partners, we will deliver an average of 10,000 new social home builds each year.  Major planning decisions will be returned to local authorities and will be subject to strict timeframes, while judicial reviews are and will be overhauled to unblock obstacles to development.  Rural communities will be given greater certainty over building homes in their areas.  These measures are targeted and radical but are necessary to respond to the challenges we face.  These will all create the environment we need to supply of 300,000 new homes for our people by 2030.<\/p><p>At a time of such housing need, we have to ensure that the housing stock we already have is being fully used.  I am introducing a number of initiatives in our fourth pathway to directly address this.  These include establishing and funding a town centre first policy, making our towns and villages vibrant to meet, live and work in; tackling any remaining unfinished estates; and launching a new compulsory purchase order, CPO, programme to allow local authorities to acquire up to 2,500 vacant properties over the next four years and present them to the open market for sale, as well as better understanding the levels of vacant properties in residential property with a view to introducing a vacant property tax.<\/p><p>Despite the pandemic, Government has been focused on progressing major reforms that will accelerate and increase the supply of public, affordable and private housing.  We got to work straight away last year, while at the same time developing Housing for All.  We passed the first ever comprehensive affordable housing Act and reformed the Land Development Agency, giving it a legislative backing and adding to its powers.  Just recently, we opened Ireland's first cost rental homes comprising 25 units in Balbriggan, County Dublin.  It is a start.  We signed the Lisbon Declaration, thereby committing to ending homelessness by 2030; increased grant funding to assist older people and people with a disability; extended rent pressure zones and limited rent increases to general inflation.  We introduced five separate items of tenancy legislation to protect renters through the pandemic, brought 3,600 vacant social homes back into productive use, increased Irish Water funding by more &euro;100 million and banned co-living.<\/p><p>These actions demonstrate the Government's commitment to fixing our housing system.  Housing for All takes that commitment a step further and it is a step on the pathway to a sustainable housing system by clearly setting out how we plan to address the serious short-, medium- and long-term challenges to 2030.  The housing system is complex.  There is no magic fix.  I cannot tell Members it will be resolved overnight and they all know that.  We have the solutions, ability, drive and capability and now we have a plan to make a real impact, which is backed by real money.  This plan will make a real difference for real people.  Together, the Government is determined to make it work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#CC00700","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming in to discuss this very important new housing policy.  In election 2020, voters went out to vote and the vast majority of them voted for change.  They voted for change on a number of issues but on one issue in particular, namely, housing.  The Minister and I heard it, as did members of my party and members in all parties in government, and they understood the change voters were demanding.  They wanted a change from the failed housing policies of the previous decade and we will deliver that in Housing for All.<\/p> <p>The new Government faced many challenges, such as the immediate one of Covid-19 and the objective of protecting lives and livelihoods and it is recognised and credit is due to every front-line worker and everybody in our State who worked together to defeat the pandemic.  Thankfully, we are coming out the far side of that.  Climate action is a huge challenge facing us, not just on our island but globally, and the Government is also committed to working on that.  Today, however, we are talking about housing.<\/p> <p>In that regard, the Minister has not wasted the last year.  I commend him because, he was firefighting a decade of undersupply of housing, the legacy of the co-living and the market-led approach, which has short-changed many people, especially young people, the pressures on people to pay rent to secure a home and the threat of homelessness.  The Minister really understands all of those threats and has not only brought forward a plan which will bring us over the coming four years and the next decade but has also started to address those concerns in the immediate.  He has already mentioned the protections and supports he put in place for renters during the pandemic.  They were vital.  Others would criticise them, but they made a real difference to people's lives by protecting them from becoming homeless.<\/p> <p>The Minister secured record and historic budgets, not just in the past year, but with Housing for All.  The big difference and change in this plan is there will be multi-annual funding.  It is a State-led, as opposed to a market-led, approach to solving the housing crisis.  It is all underpinned, not by fanciful electioneering leaflets or videos, but by legislation and Government policy.  It says to all of government, not just the Department of Housing, Heritage and Local Government, at a national and local level, that this Government is absolutely committed to addressing the housing crisis, eradicating homelessness and ensuring everybody in our society has access to a secure and affordable home.<\/p> <p>We will do that by increasing supply and ensuring affordability, by using the State's assets, the most valuable of which are our land and our human resources, available to us in our local authorities.  The Minister's affordable housing legislation was the most comprehensive housing Bill.  There are those who like to talk about a narrow section of that Act, which is a vital financial support to people who are paying more for rent than they can, would or should do, to own their own home through a mortgage.  The big game changer in the Affordable Housing Act is the fact we are empowering local authorities.  Affordable housing that was abolished back in 2011 will now be provided by local authorities and approved housing bodies, not just in the city, but in every county.<\/p> <p>It is hugely important and it is by supporting and resourcing the local authorities and approved housing bodies that we will achieve the Minister's targets of 300,000 new homes; 54,000 affordable homes and 90,000 new social homes.  That will be an average of 33,000 homes per year by the time we get to 2024.  It will all only be achieved because the legislation and policies will underpin it and the funding will be there.  I commend the Minister.  I know he has his detractors but he should be encouraged to know that serious organisations dedicated to help those at the most acute end of our housing crisis, such as the Simon Community and the social housing and approved housing bodies have commended him and backed his plan because they know it differs from previous plans and has the legislation and multi-annual funding to deliver.<\/p> <p>I was talking to somebody earlier about a few areas of the plan and while it now sets the direction and tone and will ensure the State's resources are all going in the right direction, as the Minister is aware there are a number of areas that we want to see progressed and on which we are already working through the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Some of them will fall to the Minister for Finance and they will be budgetary issues.  I will run through a few of them.  There was an historic homeless budget of &euro;220 million last year and the fact Housing for All will be a housing-first approach, with the continuation and resourcing of preventions for homelessness by increasing the housing supply through delivering 90,000 new social homes, is really important.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mary Fitzpatrick:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MaryFitzpatrick&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In the short term, as we did in Dublin, an increase in the homeless housing assistance payment facility, HAP, which is an operational and an annual budget issue, could be extended to other local authorities.  We have raised this at the Oireachtas joint committee.  The lease and repair scheme, which is funded by the Minister's Department, is very powerful in taking vacant housing stock, having it repaired and then leased for social housing.  There is no faster way to increase the housing stock than to address the dereliction and the vacancy.  The Minister knows this.  As well as the lease and repair scheme, the Minister's Department funds local authorities to purchase homes that are going to be sold.  That is very important.<\/p><p>The Minister's ban on co-living schemes sent a very strong message that we believe that people deserve an adequate form of housing and that this Government is absolutely committed to ensuring that.  The Minister has also capped rents at inflation and this gives a lot of reassurance to renters.  We are actually going to deliver affordable cost rental, which the Government has already started and the first tenants have moved in.  By legislating for that, creating a scheme for it, and funding it, affordable cost rental is now a game changer for people.<\/p><p>On the student accommodation crisis that is being spoken about, the Minister has directed local authorities not to change the planning permissions where they have been granted for student accommodation.  I put it to the Minister that there is also a financial way to stop that behaviour.  It is not within the Minister's remit but I urge him to take it up with the Minister for Finance.  Any purpose-built student accommodation that was built received a tax break based on the fact that it would provide accommodation to students from named educational institutions.  If any of those operators now wish to change from being student accommodation providers they need to be aware that the tax treatment they enjoyed will not apply and will not travel.  That is a matter for the Minister for Finance and for Revenue.  I urge the Minister to take this up with them.<\/p><p>On the planning process, the ending of the strategic housing development plans and the introduction of the Minister's large-scale residential development planning application permissions is a really important game changer because it restores the democratic process at a local level.<\/p><p>The Cathaoirleach is being very generous with the time and I appreciate it.  This House and all members of the Government parties are absolutely committed to realising the change and the vision that is being projected in the Minister's Housing for All plan.  We need to make this change for generations to come and the Minister has our full support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#DD00200","speaker":"1656","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Darragh O 'Brien, to the House.

It is important that for a few moments we take a look back at Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness from July 2016.  At the time I spoke in favour of it and I thought how brave the then Minister, Deputy Coveney, was in setting it all out.  When one sets out objectives, deadlines and timelines it really puts it up, and that was a brave move on his part.  I will quote extracts from Enda Kenny in the forward to the Rebuilding Ireland action plan document of July 2016:<\/p> <blockquote> \t  \tEnding rough sleeping and the use of unsuitable long-term emergency accommodation, including hotels and B&amp;amp;Bs, for homeless families, are key priorities [of the Government] [...]  In order to ensure its success, the key targets of this Action Plan will be subject to regular Cabinet review [and monitoring].  The Cabinet Committee on Housing which I chair, will actively oversee its implementation [...] I am committed to ensuring a [...] critical national ambition of ensuring that all of our people have access to quality and affordable housing, either through their own endeavours or with the support of the State. [...] None of us can fail to be moved by the plight of people who are homeless, especially families and children living in hotels, and people who are sleeping on our streets.   <\/blockquote> <p>In the same document, the then Minister, Deputy Coveney, said, &quot;A key priority is addressing the unacceptable level of homeless families and long-term homeless people in emergency accommodation, by providing rapid housing delivery, alongside measures to support those at risk of losing their homes.&quot; <\/p><p>I have a lot of time for Deputy Coveney, but we must deal with some facts here when we talk about the history.  We must remember that it was a Government that was supported by the current Minister's party.  The policies were pursued by the Government.  It was a confidence and supply arrangement and I appreciate the complexities around that.  This week, however, we all received an email confirming the latest figures showing the number of people who are homeless in Ireland is now at 8,200.  I accept that historically this is a drop and that it is going in the right direction, but it is really very disappointing, and 2,189 of those are children.<\/p><p>This is the context for the plans, where one had a plan and set out to have a Cabinet and a Taoiseach overseeing it and it still did not deliver.  To be fair, I acknowledge that it did deliver in some areas, but it did not deliver in many others.  It is very important that we address this issue.  It ties up with this Cabinet sub-committee and the oversight and delivery of the Minister's plan.  This is an important point that needs to be made.  This is the Minister's plan and the plan of the Government.  The time for debate and elongated discussions is over.  I accept that this is the plan.  It is a serious attempt and it has been through dialogue.  We must accept the reality that this is a major Government majority, this is their plan and this is their vision.  That is their prerogative and that is their right.  The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, is the Minister and he is going to pursue it.<\/p><p>As the Minister is aware we had engagements on the Affordable Housing Bill.  We did not always agree.  We had a lot of engagement with the Land Development Agency Bill.  We did not always agree across this House.  In fact, there was not a willingness to take on many of those amendments but, again, that is the Minister's call and prerogative, and I respect that.  We had a debate about the definition of &quot;affordability&quot;.  Somehow, we never really grasped or put into words what one defines as terms of affordability, be it to rent or to purchase.  Affordability generally is defined as one third of one's income.  I am not saying the Minister has said this, but others have suggested that a house for &euro;420,000 or &euro;450,000 in south County Dublin is affordable, which is nonsense.<\/p><p>We still have the challenges around homelessness.  We still have the challenges around vulnerable people who are homeless, and do I need to say anything more about that?  This is an area we need to focus on, and I believe the Minister is committed to doing that.  We have issues around rural housing and I am aware that people in the Government are committed to developing that and giving certainty to rural families and people living across this country who wish to establish homes close to their families, and rightly so, subject to proper conditions and planning.  We still have the urge of local councillors, city and county, who want to see their local authorities deliver housing.  I acknowledge that the Minister is supportive of this and the document is supportive of this.  We have the issue of student accommodation.  This week we heard that people were now queueing up at soup kitchens for food and staying in cars.  We heard other students this week talking about not being able to go to university and perhaps cancelling out.  This is a serious challenge.  How we condition planning around student accommodation is about the serious delivery of the targets.<\/p><p>As I said earlier to the Minister, this is his plan and the Government's plan.  There are 30 overarching policy objectives in this 160-page document, so it is easy to track and it is easy to follow, which I believe is good.  We all know what has to be done, and the Minister more than anyone knows what has to be done.  The Government will be spending unprecedented levels of Exchequer funding, which the Minister has said in his statement today.  This policy document seeks and will pursue State lands that will be released for the construction of housing.  Quite frankly, I do not give a damn where the sites are coming from and I do not give a damn who is building them once we are building houses and making sites available for affordable homes.<\/p><p>This plan is expected to deliver at least 33,000 new homes per year over the next decade.  I genuinely wish to Minister well in this.  It is ambitious.  I believe the Minister is determined and if left in the job I believe that he will pursue that and get it over the line.  There must be a strong focus on the implementation of the plan and for it to be overseen by Cabinet.  Perhaps at some future time, if not today, the Minister might elaborate just how he will monitor and drive the objectives so that it will actually happen.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I say respectfully, as a member of the Opposition, that I will be constructive and supportive, as will my colleagues on the Independent benches, in the ongoing debates on the housing challenges that face the Government.

I am delighted to be in the privileged position of being a member of a Government party and of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, which had the opportunity to make an input into the plan over the past 12 months.  I thank the Minister and his officials for taking on board many of the suggestions made by both Government and Opposition parties.<\/p> <p>As public representatives, we all know that the impact of the housing crisis is felt by every family in the country.  Housing for All is a radical, realistic and costed plan underpinned by record State investment which will help citizens to have access to affordable, high standard housing to purchase or rent in the right places.  It includes actions to increase the housing supply of all types in the short term and measures to ensure we have a sustainable housing system in the long term.<\/p> <p>Ultimately, this plan will be judged on delivery.  Everyone in government is acutely conscious that we must use every tool at our disposal to deliver for individuals and families.  We will not do that by using catchy sound bites or advocating the abolition of schemes that support people to get their foot on the property ladder.  We will not do it by objecting to housing schemes or limiting the many and varied mechanisms by which housing can be delivered.  As I have said time and again, my party, Fine Gael, and this Government are not hung up on ideology.  We do not care who builds homes, whether it is approved housing bodies, local councils, the Land Development Agency, co-operative housing trusts, public private partnerships or the private sector.  We do not mind who builds the homes; we just want them delivered.  Unfortunately, there are some on the Opposition benches who have the utopian view that housing must be of a certain type and be delivered in a certain way for it to be considered worthy.  The reality is that every housing unit that is delivered has a positive impact on supply. <\/p> <p>Over the past 12 months, the Government has been working to address the challenges we face, while at the same time developing the Housing for All plan.  The new plan builds on the solid foundations laid by Rebuilding Ireland across many strands.  While some initiatives have been more successful than others, the resolve of this Government and previous Governments to address the supply issues facing the country and our people remains resolute.<\/p> <p>The facts are that housing output increased from 4,575 units in 2013 to 20,584 in 2020 despite Covid-19 closures, and 39,524 social homes were delivered between 2016 and the end of 2020.  It should be noted that the main Opposition party, in its 2015 housing policy, promised to deliver a combined total of 36,500 social and affordable homes between 2016 and the end of 2021.  The Government has, therefore, exceeded the Opposition's target with one year to spare and we hope to reach 50,000 social units by the end of this year.  Yet, my party and this Government are constantly ridiculed and criticised for under-delivery despite outstripping the Opposition's targets with 12 months to spare.<\/p> <p>The Minister outlined some of the key items that have been delivered by the Government over the past 12 months.  They include the largest housing budget on record; passing the first comprehensive Affordable Housing Act; reforming the Land Development Agency and placing it on a statutory footing; banning co-living; passing five separate tenant protection Acts; extending the relief in the help-to-buy scheme to &euro;30,000; opening the first ever cost-rental units in the history of the State; investing in Irish Water and focusing on the development of a specific fund for towns and villages; limiting deposits and extending protections for student renters; extending rent pressure zones; legislating to protect traditional family homes from bulk purchases; bringing 3,600 vacant social homes back into use, which we will do again this year; and allocating &euro;1.3 billion from the urban regeneration fund which is already having a positive impact, while also streamlining the buy and renew scheme and extending the repair and lease scheme.<\/p> <p>While much progress has been made, we are acutely aware of the issues that persist in the area of homelessness, which will continue to be a focus of the Government.  There have been some positive measures such as the introduction of housing action teams and integrated homes service teams, including one in Waterford city.  However, homelessness remains a huge concern.  Schemes such as the repair and lease scheme have been used exceptionally well in places such as County Waterford.  Unfortunately, other local authority areas have not stepped up to the plate in using the schemes that are available.  In Waterford, we have eradicated the use of bed and breakfast accommodation and hostels because we focused, through the scheme, on delivering one and two-bedroom units.  It should not be the case that 50% of all repair and lease units in the State have been delivered in Waterford.  I reiterate my call on the Minister to set specific targets for local authorities to deliver under the repair and lease scheme.<\/p> <p>Housing for All commits to the delivery of 300,000 homes over the lifetime of the plan, consisting of 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes, 18,000 cost-rental units and 156,000 private homes for sale or rent.  These are ambitious targets that we can deliver.  The first home scheme, the affordable purchase scheme and the reformed local authority mortgage scheme are critical in providing homes and giving hope to families and individuals in the middle whose incomes are too high to allow them to qualify for social housing and who cannot get their foot on the property ladder.<\/p> <p>I ask for the extension of the help-to-buy scheme at the 10% rate in the upcoming budget for 2022.  The scheme, which has been very successful, is essential for first-time buyers and anyone buying their first home.  The latest figures available from Revenue show that 28,300 claims have been made under the scheme.  This means 28,000 individuals and families now have their first home as a result of the help-to-buy scheme.  While some members of the Opposition want to abolish the scheme, I believe its retention, at least in the short term, as a measure that will boost supply and help people to get their foot on the property ladder is essential.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator John Cummins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnCummins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Finally, I reiterate what others have said in terms of our support here on the Government benches for the Housing for All plan, for the Minister and for his officials.

Instead, this is a plan that is wedded to the <i>status quo<\/i>.  It is lined with figures that are disingenuous and projections that are meaningless.  It is disingenuous to claim that &euro;4 billion will be spent annually by the Government.  This is a fiction because the real figure is &euro;2.5 billion of voted capital expenditure.<\/p><p>The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, says that this cannot be solved overnight.  I should say that promises of housing delivery in a decade will do nothing for struggling renters, those desperate to buy and those waiting on housing waiting lists.  It is clear that there will be little, if any, increase in direct capital investment in social and affordable homes between now and 2025 above what is already in the pipeline.  This means that rents and house prices will continue to rise and that supply will lag behind.<\/p><p>I want to focus in the few minutes that I have on those struggling to rent at the moment.  A quarter of Dublin's population are renters.  For them, this policy will be a massive disappointment.  There is no commitment to ban rent increases.  Frankly, it is incredible that one year into a Government term a policy could be published that includes nothing to ban rent increases and that it would talk about tenancies of indefinite duration - something that tenants are crying out for - when we know that this Government will not change the law when it comes to stopping evictions on the grounds of sale of property or use by a family member, both of which amount to 70% of all notices to quit.  The test of whether renters will be protected by this Government is whether rent increases are banned, whether renters are given a tax break to the tune of one month's rent put back in their pockets because, God knows, real estate investment trusts get enough of a tax break as it is, and whether we remove section 34 grounds, as I mentioned, on use of property by a family member, the sale of property or the renovation of the property, that would ensure tenancies of indefinite duration.<\/p><p>There is nothing here for renters because other interests win out, and no ideas on the part of the Government, only more of the same that created this mess in the first place.  We need to ban rent increases for three years and reduce rents with a tax credit that puts one month's rent back in the pocket of every renter in the State, we need stronger legal protections to prevent renters being evicted into homelessness and we also need a date for the referendum to enshrine the right to housing in the Constitution.  We need this referendum in 2022.<\/p><p>It is incredible that a plan could be published that fails to give certainty to tenants who are paying, in Dublin, the fifth highest rents in Europe, after London, Zurich, Geneva, and Moscow.<\/p><p>Deputy Darragh O'Brien expects us to believe that the same policies that have got us into this crisis will solve this crisis.

According to the latest figures from EUROSTAT, we are at the top of the housing cost table.  It is no wonder people are crying out for more affordable homes.<\/p> <p>We are in this mess because of the failed policies of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael that have created the housing crisis and yet the Minister and the Government expect us to believe that the people who caused the crisis are somehow the same people we should entrust to fix it.  It is clear from their plan that the Government will not deliver what is necessary to deliver affordable homes.  For one thing, their figures just do not add up.  The Government is saying that it will deliver 4,000 affordable homes this year, 5,000 the year after and 6,500 the year after that, but that is just not true.  The Government should be honest with people because 2,000 of those homes annually are unaffordable homes priced on the open market that will be purchased with the shared equity loan scheme.  That means affordable housing provision next year will, at best, be 2,100 units.  It might go up to 3,000 the year after and somewhere close to 4,000 the year after that, if the Government meets its targets.  The number of affordable homes to be delivered through the cost rental equity loan and affordable housing fund this year is so low that I do not see how the Government will deliver 2,000 affordable homes through those schemes next year.<\/p> <p>It is clear from reading this plan that the Government is out of touch and out of ideas.  It is becoming more and more apparent to the public.  Again and again, the Government sides with the interests of big developers, large landowners and international institutional investors over the needs of ordinary workers and families.<\/p> <p>The Government does not have the mettle to stand up and do what is necessary to address the housing crisis, and a great example of this is the Part V provision.  The Housing Agency released a good report that gave a variety of options to reform it.  Needless to say, the Minister chose the most pro-developer option available, which is that any landowner who has not secured planning permission has until 2026, and only the 10% applies.  That is not reform.  That is giving the developers everything they have asked for on a plate to the detriment of delivery of affordable homes for working people.<\/p> <p>The approach to housing policy shows how blinkered the Minister is because he believes the private sector can meet the overwhelming majority of social and affordable housing need.  We are not seeing the fundamental change that is necessary to undo the damage of decades of failed Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael policy.  We need a doubling of direct capital investment by the Government in public housing on public land.  We need 20,000 social and affordable homes every year delivered by local authorities, approved housing bodies, AHBs, and community housing trusts.  That is the sort of fundamental change that is required to address this problem.  Instead, we have a housing Minister who is out of touch and out of ideas.  He will ensure that the housing crisis will roll on for years and years while big developers and investments will be laughing the whole way to the bank.  Only a Sinn F&eacute;in Government and a Sinn F&eacute;in housing Minister will make the kind of change in housing that is needed to end the Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael housing crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#GG00300","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I thank the Cathaoirleach and thank the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, for again coming into this House to discuss it.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss Housing for All, which is a comprehensive policy document which will form the basis for our housing policy for years to come.  We have, however, seen other comprehensive policy documents in that regard such as the Rebuilding Ireland policy of 2016.  We have stated previously that we want the Government to succeed on housing and that we will, where allowed, be constructive but it is also the job of the Opposition to challenge and over time, hold the Government to account in terms of delivery because, as we saw from Rebuilding Ireland previously, Governments can be big on ambition and on targets and not directly address it.  Indeed, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, who was present previously, was the one who over time put in parliamentary questions to show that the previous Fine Gael-led Government was not delivering on the targets that it itself had set in Rebuilding Ireland.<\/p> <p>Housing for All is big on ambition in terms of certain parts of the sector but it is very short on specifics.  It also does not address some of the key issues and stakeholders in the housing debate.  First, I want to address the issue of renters and the lack of real commitment to or acknowledgment of them in the policy document.  Housing for All commits to bringing forward legislation with provisions to address long-term security of tenure.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has said that it would be dependent on the legal advice that is received from the Attorney General and the Department, and it is hard to describe this as a firm commitment to delivering real security of tenure for renters.<\/p> <p>Renters do not need security of tenure to be \"addressed\".  They need it to be comprehensively enshrined in law.  They need long-term security of tenure to be a feature of the rental market in Ireland rather than an exception, which is what it was.  Most importantly, renters - families, single people, young, old or whatever their situation - need somewhere to be able to call a home.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Rebecca Moynihan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RebeccaMoynihan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This month, it was reported that the figures for August show that a further 23 families were made homeless, taking the total numbers without a secure home to 593.  The number of children entering homelessness increased in August by 60 to 2,189.  This is the direct result of the lifting of the eviction ban which the Opposition had warned about.  We know from the statistics that the main reasons for termination of a tenancy are the sale of property, at 51%, and the use of a home for a wide range of relatives, at 24%.  Last week, the Labour Party brought before the D&aacute;il a Bill that would restrict these practices and ensure that people living in rental accommodation are protected.  We cannot do that without enshrining in law long-term security of tenure.  The Minister needs to give us specifics on how his housing policy will do that.  Housing for All does not address that issue.<\/p><p>There is an imbalance in favour of landlords.  There are sections of government that believe paying off a mortgage is more important than keeping children out of homelessness.  There is need for a rebalancing.  A person's home is more important that another person's or entity's investment.  I am unequivocal in saying that.  I urge the Minister to implement indefinite duration tenancies and secure tenancies to bring us in line with other European countries.  All renters deserve certainty of tenancy and affordability.  The patchwork effort of the Government does not help renters.  It highlights the Government's continued failure to address the twin central issues of soaring rents and lack of secure tenancy.  We must change the dynamic in the rental sector if it is to become a sustainable option for the people who need it.  The Minister says he supports home ownership.  That is fine and a legitimate aspiration.  There is a right to purchase in regard to local authority housing.  Why not be radical in the Housing for All policy and provide for a rent to purchase for tenants in the private rental sector as well?  Other jurisdictions in the European Union, such as France, allow that.  To be truly radical and shake up the rental market, a commitment in that regard is key.  Renters are not transient.  Security of tenure is the bedrock of key protections and rights which they deserve, as well as a rent-freeze on the basis of rising rents and where they stand regarding the living wage.  We also need a ban on eviction to try to stop families and children entering homelessness.  <\/p><p>Moving to student accommodation, it is important this area is addressed in light of the guidelines issued today.  The guidelines are non-specific and they provide get-out clauses for developers.  Developers already had get-out clauses under the development plans.  We need to legislate against the repurposing of student accommodation and to ensure such accommodation is not rented at the type of rents currently being charged.  Landlords should be required to either drop rents in order that students can afford them or we need to stop granting approvals for an oversupply of student accommodation in specific areas.  Issuing guidelines with non-Covid get-out clauses is simply not good enough.  It is similar to the approach taken regarding investors being able to buy homes under the noses of first-time buyers in that it pays only lip-service to that practice and does not ban the bulk purchase of apartments or build-to-rent developments.  <\/p><p>Another area where Housing for All fails is in regard to a vacant property tax.  We understand that this is a complicated area and that there are issues with probate and the fair deal scheme, but we all know of properties up and down the country that have been lying idle for years and are of no consequence to the people who own them and of properties within the build-to-rent sector that are allowed to remain idle to keep rents high.  The effect of the Housing for All policy is such that these sectors will dominate for years to come.  Can we allow them to develop a semi-monopoly and to restrict supply of housing?  What is contained in this measure in terms of a vacant property tax is not good enough.<\/p><p>Fundamentally, the Minister says that we cannot tackle the housing crisis with one hand tied behind our backs.  We also cannot tackle the housing crisis when one sector refuses to build quality housing for all.  The construction sector is building, but it is focused on purpose-built student accommodation, which it is then turning into hotels, and on the build-to-rent market.  It is not building housing which will still be in use in 100 years' time.  The private sector has a fundamentally different objective when it comes to the provision of housing.  We cannot control what that sector is doing in terms of building homes.  Housing for All gives enormous power to the private sector regarding delivering the aspirations of the Government.  On that basis, I fear this Government is bound to fail in terms of delivery and meeting the targets.  There is a need for a radical rethink of housing policy in this country.  This is a missed opportunity on the part of the Government to put State direct build back at the heart of our housing policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#GG00400","speaker":"1672","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan.  As I sat listening to the debate, I realised the Ministers with responsibility for housing are the Ministers we see most in this House.  As stated by Senator Fitzpatrick, that is an acknowledgement that the Government recognises that at every door we go to, housing is an issue.  We are determined to fix this problem.  The Green Party stepped up to the plate and entered into government on the key issues of housing and climate change because we want to make a difference in people's lives.<\/p> <p>On Housing for All, it is sometimes difficult for people to get their heads around a plan.  It is great to have a Twitter line to go out, but this plan sets out 213 concrete steps and that can sometimes be difficult to articulate.  There is a different housing need in almost every household canvassed.  This plan looks at all of the housing needs and it provides a comprehensive way forward for tackling each need.  The plan is comprehensive.  It includes targets for all types of housing and, critically, it is funded.  It contains a raft of innovative policy measures from the ending of the SHD process to the introduction of a tax on land, tackling Airbnbs, a town centre first type approach under Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe and a centre of excellence for innovation.  It is important that a plan has incentives and disincentives, or a carrot and stick approach.  This plan has both because that is what is required to get the policy outcomes we need.  <\/p> <p>The plan recognises that this is not just about building houses.  I use the word \"just\" because while building houses is critical, at the heart of any plan must also be the development of sustainable communities.  The plan recognises that housing must be in the right place, with the right services, for a community to flourish.  Several amendments were made to other Bills that came before this House on that issue.  I too encourage the Minister to insert the wording around sustainable communities in this Bill.  The plan is underpinned by two major legislative innovations which came before this House prior to the summer recess, that is, the Affordable Housing Act 2021, which we discussed at length, and the Land Development Agency Act 2021, both of which work hand-in-hand.  The actions are clear and timelined and there is a responsible party tasked with oversight of their implementation.  <\/p> <p>This plan recognises the scale of the crisis and has within it the means of solution.  However, as mentioned, having a plan is in some ways the easy part.  There have been other plans.  This plan will only be a success if all arms of government are behind it and if every local authority and semi-State body in the areas of transport, energy, water and communications, approved housing bodies and co-operatives, not-for-profit agencies and, importantly, every community in Ireland, plays its part in achieving housing for all.  This is a national crisis, ongoing now for a decade or more.  It is not solely a matter for the Government, but Government is showing by way of this plan that it is playing its part.  It will, however, be up to every county and city councillor to play their part.  There is no government when it comes to county or city councils.  There is an obligation on Government but so too there is an obligation on the Opposition.  I take on board Senator Moynihan's point that it is the place of Opposition to hold Government to account, but in this particular instance it is also the place of councillors from Opposition parties to play their part in voting through housing proposals that come before their councils.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Pauline O'Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=PaulineOreilly&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is not only about voting through housing proposals and having enough houses but also having them in the right places for the people who are most vulnerable.  That means providing housing for Travellers, building social housing, adopting a Housing First approach to homelessness and ending emergency accommodation.  Crucially, it will be up to members of the public in every area to understand that if somebody is homeless in their area, it reflects on all of us.  It is up to all of us to ensure we play our part.  I was pleased to note that a survey in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>found that the majority of people agree with that view and are in favour of having social housing in their areas.  City and county councillors need to take that on board.  It is the view of the majority.  It is not just about listening to the loud voices we sometimes hear.<br\/><br\/>I will speak about some of the issues that are important to the Green Party.  Some of the measures we are passionate about are included in this plan.  As I have said many times, the Green Party has long championed the Vienna model of cost-rental housing.  This approach was placed on a statutory footing here for the first time under the Affordable Housing Act and the Land Development Agency Act and there are now national targets in place for it.  The State plans to build 2,000 cost-rental units every year during the lifetime of this plan.  That may not be as much as I would like but there will be a review midway through the lifetime of the plan.  I believe the Minister will see that this proof of concept has been successful and we will see an increase in the number of cost-rental units.  Cost rental is not only about the people who live in this housing.  If we build at scale, the cost-rental model can calm the market overall.<br\/><br\/>Cost-rental housing has been incredibly popular so far, which gives reason to hope we may come to see it as a very successful proof of concept.  On the Enniskerry Road cost-rental homes were recently completed by the Respond and Tuath approved housing bodies in conjunction with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  The council invited members of the public to apply to rent two-bedroom apartments at prices that are 40% lower than average rents in the area.  Within the first 24 hours, it received 500 applications.  Couples with an annual combined income of &euro;82,000 or less and single people with an annual income of &euro;53,000 or less can avail of cost-rental homes at rents averaging &euro;1,155 for a two-bed apartment.  The model is extremely popular and we would like to see it expanded.<br\/><br\/>I am a member of the Joint Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community.  It is important to mention that 50% of Travellers die before their 39th birthday.  That is a shocking statistic.  This country has failed Travellers and it has been called out on this issue for decades.  The European Commission against Racism and Intolerance expressed shock at the amount of money for Traveller accommodation returned over many years unspent by local authorities, including my local authority, Galway City Council.  Last year was the first time the council drew down all the money for Traveller accommodation.  We need to see more than that.  There needs to be a stepping-up of ambition.  We do not even know how many Traveller families there are.  It has been recommended that people have the option of including their ethnicity on applications for social housing in order that we can see the true scale of what we are dealing with.  The degree of racism against Travellers is probably under-reported.<br\/><br\/>One of the big successes in this plan and the reason many NGOs have come on board with it is the emphasis on the Housing First approach to ending homelessness.  More than 8,000 people are in emergency accommodation, 2,000 of whom are children.  This plan aims to end all of that by 2030.  I believe we can do it.  I also believe the Government truly wants to do that and that it prioritises housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#HH00200","speaker":"1693","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":145,"content":"<p>We have engaged extensively with the Minister of State and the other Ministers in the Department on the detail of the issues involved.  Unfortunately, a number of concerns we flagged when dealing with the legislation before the House prior to the summer recess still remain with regard to the Housing for All plan.  I acknowledge there are positive components in the plan.  I note the investment in the Housing First approach.  That could be increased further.  We know that approach has worked in other countries.  I suggest it should be bolstered by an increase in the number of tenancy sustainment officers, of which there are ten currently.  These officers play an important role in helping people, particularly vulnerable persons, to stay in housing.  That is an important element in ensuring those who face the most difficulties are able to access housing and sustain it.<\/p> <p>The core concern we had, namely, the reliance on, trust in and hope that the market will deliver and respond, remains with respect to Housing for All.  The plan leads with the goal of home ownership, which should be a goal of course, but many of its measures around home ownership have been identified as inflating prices and contributing to the core problem, which is the property market.  Rather than constraining the property market, we are simply helping people to get into it or to navigate it.  That is the problem.  Senator Moynihan put it very eloquently.  The fact is the market and investment companies have a different set of priorities.  Their priorities are the maximising of profit and return.  That is their key concern and focus and that is what they will do.  It is up to us not to appeal to them or play their game but to ask that they fit within our laws, which supersede them because they are the laws of the State based on the representation of the people.<\/p> <p>The right balance and the strength we need to show are still not fully there.  It is evident in the issues relating to the shared equity scheme.  I do not need to rehash that.  Even the Central Bank commented on it.   We have been warned time and again that the scheme will have a potential inflationary impact.  There are also questions about local authority loans.  The rent pressure zone protections are in place but they are linked to the harmonised index of consumer prices.  It comes back to the question of affordability, which we discussed at length when we dealt with the legislation.  Affordability in the classic sense does not begin with the cost factor but with what people can afford as a starting point.  We need to do better in that regard.  I am concerned about that.  There will be a review and we will consider it but we have seen rental prices increase.<\/p> <p>In terms of rental protections, I am concerned that the private rental market will play such a key role.  While we have a cost-rental model, the concern we highlighted is that the model of cost rental the State has chosen to introduce includes private actors who will make an equity return.  We are adding an unnecessary cost to the costs of the cost-rental model.  We are adding returns for shareholders into the rental prices.  That is a concern as is the fact that the cost of financing is included in the cost.  We know about private financing.  There is a whole section in the plan on the private financing that investment companies get.  This is different from the financing the State can draw on at European level.  Ultimately, an additional cost that could have been avoided is being imposed on renters.<\/p> <p>I welcome the move away from the leasing model but we are getting mixed signals on that.  We have been told we are moving away from leasing by local authorities, a practice I have opposed for a long time, and giving them the capacity to build directly and so forth, which is welcome.  However, we are still giving an exemption to investment funds that buy up properties when they lease to local authorities.  We are creating a situation where local authorities that may wish to buy for direct build housing are competing with investment funds that may want to lease housing back to the local authorities.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We are still creating a situation in which local authorities that might want to directly buy or build are competing with investment funds that may want to rent or lease back to them.  We are creating an unnecessary distortion and an unnecessary property market speculative competition around something as basic as social housing provision, especially at a point when a huge amount of housing has to be provided in a short period.  Many local authorities might not be in position not to take that kind of leasing arrangement, which is a concern.<\/p><p>I have highlighted that there is still a core gap.  I will highlight one or two of the specific issues which have not been touched on as much today.  I am sure we will be teasing out all of these issues over the period ahead.  There is a small part in the plan on disability, but it is not really placed and given the focus it needs.  There are more than 5,000 people with a disability on the housing list, many of them for five to ten years and a huge cohort of people with a disability who are considered housed, but are not appropriately housed in the manner of their choice.  While there was a general decrease in housing lists from 9% last year, there was only a 4.9% decrease for those with a disability.<\/p><p>While there is a certain allocation of special funding for special housing, I was disappointed by Part M or universal design and that kind of bigger picture.  If we are building a whole new set of standards or facilitating or funding others to build, let us raise the standards widely.  The Minister will be aware I have put forward legislation on public procurement.  One of the requirements I have is that where we are looking at major capital expenditure, and much of the provision in this plan will require significant capital procurement, we should be looking at 50% quality criteria, at least.  I put this legislation forward in the last Government and have again put it forward in this Government.  When we look at mica, pyrite and all of those issues, the importance of quality criteria, raising the standards and aiming high in building is so clear.<\/p><p>My final concern is about the urban development zones and the judicial review.  Let us be clear on planning.  More than half of the strategic housing developments which were given planning permission were not built.  We need to knock on the head the idea that somehow objections or criticisms are delaying housing, which we were told was the problem local authorities had the last time.  They got their fast track planning permission and then sat on those properties.  Let us not have that happen again or have the urban development zones be misused, as the strategic development zones were, for a pile of empty commercial office blocks, when what we need is housing for communities in the inner cities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#JJ00200","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":147,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming in to take this issue.  The crucial question around Housing for All and the document the Government has published is not the reaction in these Houses, it is the reaction on the ground.  Since it has been published, I get asked to explain the scheme, how it will work, whether one will be able to qualify for an affordable home in one's position and how the shared equity scheme operates.  It is essential that we start to roll those out.  The big difference now is that local authorities have the resources and the power to be able to deliver.  We need to start to draw up league tables around local authorities' performances.  No matter what local authority one is in, one will be able to compare the performance of one's local authority on building social and affordable houses within the area.  It should be accessible to the councillors throughout the country in order that they can hold to account the chief executives and those members of staff who are charged with delivering the plan.<\/p> <p>The crucial aspect of this will be in a couple of years' time.  It is not the ideology, it is the number of people who have keys to homes in their hand and are turning those keys into their houses.  That will be the crucial test.  I agree with Senator Pauline O'Reilly's point on how it is also about building communities.  This has to be around a whole-of-government approach and that is why, as a domestic issue, this Government has made clear it will tackle the housing issue.  The big difference between those of us in government and some in opposition is we want to solve the problem.  There are those in opposition who want this plan to fail and would much rather this plan would fail in order that they can trot out the same lines they have been trotting out, without any offer of any new plan.<\/p> <p>One of the challenges in Housing for All is the estimate that we will need approximately another 17,500 staff operating in the construction sector.  Some of those will be coming through the apprenticeship model, which SOLAS oversees.  We will see Irish workers coming home.  I have some concern there may be distorting impacts on other aspects of the labour market if we have a big rush into construction.  It is an area we need to continue to watch and we need to look at visa requirements for specialist international workers, to ensure it is as easy as possible for builders who need to employ international workers with specialisations to come into this country.<\/p> <p>The key issue about An Bord Plean&aacute;la is the decision-making process is taking too long.  What most builders will tell one is it is not whether they get approval, it is the fact it takes far too long.  We need to move to a situation whereby the board is giving quick decisions in order that developments can be allowed to move on.<\/p> <p>The final area is the question of Irish Water, which is the bigger area.  We have talked about this.  Irish Water is not fit for purpose.  It needs additional resourcing.  We are moving towards a single utility, but until we address many of the water and wastewater challenges, we will continue to have some of the problems we see in home building throughout the country.  We have to be radical in our approach.<\/p> <p>My party has a long and proud tradition of house and home building.  Part of the reason we chose to go into government is that we wanted to solve the housing crisis.  Unlike Sinn F&eacute;in and some of the others, we make no apologies for supporting somebody's aspiration to home ownership.  We think somebody who works hard should be allowed to aspire to own his or her own home.  There are those who hold a different political view, but the position of Fianna F&aacute;il and this Government is that if one wants to own one's own home, one should and should be supported by the State in doing so.  Sinn F&eacute;in keeps going on about this anti-developer line.  Who are developers?  Developers are small builders in all of our communities who are employing bricklayers, electricians, plumbers and plasterers.  If that means I am pro-developer by supporting my local builder, plumber or plasterer, then so I am, because, if we do not support them, we will not get the necessary houses built.<\/p> <p>If we want to look at Sinn F&eacute;in's record, let us look at its record in the North where there is a Sinn F&eacute;in housing minister and where, only yesterday, the figures were that 3,596 children are homeless.  That is a 48% increase since January 2019.  I am tired of Sinn F&eacute;in, which has no solutions, coming in here and trotting out the same old line and wanting this Government's policy to fail.  However, where it is in charge of housing policy in the North, it is very clear it has failed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#KK00200","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":148,"content":"<p>I am delighted to be able to speak on and welcome the Housing for All policy.  I have to pick up on one point from the start of the debate.  There was a mention of a lost decade in housing.  I do not want to go over a history lesson on the decade previous to that, for two reasons, in that it is a long time ago and we are in government together now, but if the Minister responds, can he acknowledge the work the former Ministers, Eoghan Murphy and Deputy Coveney, did in reaching the targets they set themselves at a very difficult time?  It is important to acknowledge that, but I recognise the drive and the passion the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has in delivering this plan.  That is key.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Garret Ahearn:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=GarretAhearn&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> I would like to talk about many aspects of this, but I will only address two matters in the short time available.  One is a suggestion and the other is a worry.  I refer to vacant homes.  We must do something to support people who have owned vacant homes for a long time to do them up and to sell them.  Possibly, we should give an incentive to sell such houses to first-time buyers, a little bit like we do with the help-to-buy scheme.  There are more than 30 vacant homes along the main street in Clonmel.  They have been vacant for a long time.  Nothing is being done about that situation.  It is the same in a very small village in north Tipperary, Templetuohy, which has 14 vacant homes.  That is in a tiny village and those homes have been like that for a long time.  We could undertake simple initiatives.  I spoke to people who own these buildings and they want to do them up.  They are waiting, however, for an incentive from the Government to do it.  They are asking me if there is anything that can be done to help them and if there is anything that they can get to help them to start doing up those properties.  That is a priority.<\/p><p>The worry I have, and I have spoken about this before and the Minister will be aware of it, concerns Irish Water.  This matter was also raised by Senator Malcolm Byrne.  Many developments across the country have been approved for planning permission, subject to having a connection to Irish Water.  Approximately 2,000 houses in Midleton have been waiting for years for a connection to Irish Water.  The company will not connect them until 2026.  That is going to happen in every rural county over the next year.  We must tackle this problem.  I disagree with Senator Malcolm Byrne in respect of needing to provide more funding for Irish Water.  I question some of the spending now being undertaken by the company and its uses.  Irish Water must be reined in concerning how it is spending its money.  A serious issue exists with water connections and water supply in respect of meeting the demands that we have set ourselves in the Housing for All strategy.  We must focus on this aspect a great deal more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#KK00300","speaker":"1629","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for being here.  This is an important topic that we are all committed to in the context of delivery.  Following on from what Senator Ahearn said, and paying tribute to the two previous Ministers with responsibility in this area, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, and former Deputy Eoghan Murphy, 85,000 private homes and 24,000 social homes were delivered.  The Opposition spokespeople referred to there having been no delivery and targets not being met.  That is not the case and it is important to put those figures on record.<\/p> <p>Turning to the future, the Minister was in Limerick recently at the launch of the land development plan.  Most of the eight areas concerned are on my doorstep.  I represented those areas as a councillor for 17 years.  I also live close by.  This is a fantastic plan.  I fully support it.  I worry about one thing, though, and this question was posed on the day of the launch.  It will be four or five years before we see a brick laid on the site.  That is my one fear.  I welcome the fact that local authorities have been given extra funding for the refurbishment of vacant homes.  Some council properties have been lying vacant for a long time and we end up with many such sites in urban areas.  We must look at this aspect.<\/p> <p>While there is an emphasis in this plan in that regard, we must also look at more stringent ways of delivering faster in this respect.  I state that because some properties I have seen have been vacant for a long time and they are still not renovated.  I do not know if there is some kind of glitch in communications between the council and the Department, but this is an aspect that should be looked at in greater detail.  I welcome the plan and specifically the emphasis on affordable homes.  That is something many people are striving to work towards.  Some 2,100 homes had delivered so far under the auspices of the help-to-buy scheme.  It would be great if we could increase that figure.  It is a good scheme and it has helped many people who cannot afford to buy their own home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#LL00200","speaker":"1384"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to make a statement on the Housing for All strategy.  I thank the Minister for being present and for his Ministers of State filling in as well.  I thank them all for the momentous work done on this document.  I refer to putting together the policies that have made it the great document it is.  It well deserves the praise it is getting.  Everybody agrees that the housing situation is simply not where it needs to be.  It was stated in the past that Fianna F&aacute;il was a party closely linked with housing.  Some would also say that we are close to developers.  Unashamedly, I say that we are close to developers.  That is the case for one very good reason.  It is because we seem to realise what is necessary in this country in respect of the provision of homes.  We are able to recognise what is needed to pull policy together and to make things happen when it comes to homeownership and the provision of homes.  That is exactly what this plan is about.<\/p> <p>Having said that, the major and most pertinent issue for me, and I am not going to speak at length about this today, when it comes to housing is mica.  It would be remiss of me not to mention this issue given that these are an important few days in the development of this scheme.  The next 24 to 48 hours will be important for the Department and for the working group that was set up.  I commend all those who have worked on that group so far.  I emphasise strongly that we have an opportunity to try to address the concerns of many genuine people who have been left in an awful situation.  I ask that these people be given the provisions as others across the country were given in the past.<\/p> <p>The increase in the costs of building houses should also be recognised.  I refer to tendering costs, etc., in this regard.  They have increased by approximately 40% to 50% in the past nine months alone.  Any review of the mica redress scheme must be cognisant of that.  In addition, it must recognise that people need guarantees.  People who partake of such a scheme, after it is reviewed, must have assurances that they will be able to get insurance for their houses in future and that they will be able to draw down mortgages.  Therefore, certain mechanisms and guarantees must be included as part of this review.  I ask the Minister to relay this message to his officials and ensure that it forms part of the review.  Many other areas and aspects remain to be addressed.  We may get another opportunity to discuss this matter further with the Minister and his officials before the scheme is finalised.<\/p> <p>Like many colleagues, I fully support the Housing for All strategy.  Also like many others, however, I have some fears.  As has been said, every council in the country is cognisant of difficulties with Irish Water.  It is an issue in towns and villages everywhere.  I fear that this is the one area that will cause difficulties for the Housing for All strategy down the road, if it is not tackled now.  Like Senator Ahearn, I also question some of the spending by Irish Water.  It is one of the organisations in the State that is not approachable.  It is also somewhat undemocratic.  Those who represent people in local areas do not get the access to that organisation that public representatives are able to avail of in the context of other public bodies.  The result is that Irish Water does not have the same accountability.  It is impossible to question some of the actions the company is taking in respect of scheme upgrades in towns and villages.  This is causing great difficulty.  Overall, however, I welcome this Housing for All strategy.  I am behind it fully and I look forward to its implementation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#LL00300","speaker":"1633"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan.  I compliment him and his colleagues, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, and the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, for all their work on this Housing for All policy.  Before I go any further, I will comment on Senator Fitzpatrick&rsquo;s contribution.  I think she talked about a \"lost decade\".  I entered the other House in 2011.  When we were talking about housing then, it was in the context of developers having gone bust, ghost estates, negative equity and, of course, the overarching matter of the International Monetary Fund overlords being in the country.  The result was that we had to do many things before we were able to get to building houses in those years.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->By 2040, an additional 1 million people are expected to live in this country.  That might seem a long way away today but it will come very first.  The demand for housing will be with us throughout that period.  We talk about the potential benefits of remote working, how it could be a game changer and how it could allow those who work in offices not to be tied to an office.  Thousands upon thousands of people do not work in offices.  Some work in the trades or are drivers or self-employed.  Others run small businesses or work in retail across the country.  Remote working will take pressure off some of our cities, such as Dublin, and that is good for people in those areas as it may make more accommodation available for them.  That is important.  <\/p><p>We need to supply all types of housing.  I do not subscribe to the view that either the private market alone or the public sector alone should provide housing; we need all types of housing.  We need private, public and affordable housing and we need sheltered housing for the elderly and housing provided by approved housing bodies.  Each home built is a plus.  Each home will allow a family to leave their parents' house, to move out of rented accommodation or to move from a smaller house or apartment to another house, freeing up that smaller unit for somebody else.  <\/p><p>When I initially looked at the Housing for All policy, I went to the sections on the supply of housing.  That is the most crucial issue.  Supply is key and you start with zoned land.  I was a councillor when the Celtic tiger was at its height and directors of service valiantly tried to stop the excessive rezoning in town plans and so on in Galway.  We have gone from that extreme, where we may have been zoning too much, to a situation in which local authorities decide, based on national policy, that the need for a given number of houses translates to a given number of hectares zoned.  They may give a little bit of leeway but that is it.  That does not take account of the fact that, in some cases, the land that is zoned, even though it might be very central, might just be farmed by a family or owned by an elderly bachelor, meaning that it is not available to the market.  The situation is the same in respect of serviced land.  If there is serviced land that does not come on the market, that investment is foregone, certainly in the short term.  The concept of \"use it or lose it\" is important in that regard.<\/p><p>Planning permission has been talked about but, on the serviced lands issue, I will comment on wastewater.  Over successive governments, there has been a good deal of positive developments in respect of wastewater treatment plants in my own area.  I refer to the plants at Clifden, Oughterard, Claregalway, Milltown, Headford and Clonbur.  Work is also starting in An Spid&eacute;al and there is a compulsory purchase order under way in Roundstone.  There are positive developments but there are other areas, such as Carna and Cill Chiar&aacute;in, in which there is a demand for housing, including social housing, but where there are no wastewater treatment plants.  Land is relatively cheap in these areas when compared with areas closer to Galway city and that presents an opportunity.  Assisting Irish Water, which has done a lot of work on pollution issues targeted by the Environmental Protection Agency, is important.  Additional investment is needed in that regard.<\/p><p>There are mixed views on judicial reviews in the planning process but I believe they have been an impediment.  Believe it or believe it not, there are votes to be got by objecting to housing.  That is what I see.  I see it all over the place.  There are people objecting to social housing, to private housing and to student accommodation.  I have never objected to anything in my life.  I want to put that on the record.  I hope to continue in that vein but that is what is happening up and down our country.  There are people who genuinely object because there may not be enough amenities in a town, for example.  In many cases, these issues are valid.  <\/p><p>I welcome the initiative in respect of affordable housing.  It is not good for families or for society that due to financial pressure and the cost of housing, people have been excluded from owning their own homes.  That is absolutely positive and I welcome that initiative.  <\/p><p>Overall, as a member of a Government party, I hope this policy will work for people across our country, in our cities, in our county towns and in areas in rural Ireland.  We should not forget the importance of being able to build in your own local community, subject to all the different regulations relating to housing need and the treatment of effluent.  Those regulations are important but people should have the right to live in rural areas.  That will be an important component in solving the housing crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#LL00400","speaker":"1665","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":154,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is very welcome.  A lot has been said in the Chamber this afternoon, simultaneously in the D&aacute;il Chamber and in the media about the Housing for All plan but, as the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, said here earlier, we have had the discussion; it is now about delivery.  As Senator Malcolm Byrne said, the reaction from outside of the Houses from the main stakeholders has been very positive.  Senator Boyhan was right when he commented earlier and talked about the Government owning this plan.  He was 100% right because it is a big statement on the major issue of our day.  The plan aims to address the issue in a range of different ways.  The Minister, when speaking in the Chamber earlier, said that it was all about getting all hands on deck.  That really is his mantra.  That is the very essence of this.  We need all hands on deck from the private sector to the public sector, including our local authorities that obviously will be a key component, as well as the small and medium-sized builders.  I agree with Senator Malcolm Byrne on that point as well.  We need to be encouraging small and medium-sized builders back into the development of housing in our communities.  We need the large developers as well.  At the boom time, we were seeing 80,000 units built per annum.  This must all be done with the goal of increasing capacity.  There are many different layers to that.  The fact that so many people can now see a role for themselves in this process is very positive.  We need to see the property market functioning properly again in order that we can address the issues before us.<\/p> <p>The statistics the Minister laid out in his speech are very impressive.  He talked about 300,000 new homes by the end of 2030, including 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost-rental units.  However, statistics can sometimes go over people's heads.  They see these huge numbers and they do not mean something tangible but this week, I saw on the ground in my own constituency what Housing for All really means.  The Minister came down and met with me in the county town of Navan on Monday.  We were examining a project that is benefiting from both urban regeneration funding and, it is to be hoped, funding through Housing for All.  I am talking about a whole area of the town that was suffering from massive dereliction, going back to when properties were bought up by speculators that then went bust leaving properties standing idle for years.  Through funding from the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, the council has now acquired these lands and has set out a draft master plan for the area.  There is &euro;8 million in URDF funding.  The plan will see the total regeneration of a derelict area in the heart of Navan.  That goes to the essence of what we are doing.  We are regenerating a town centre and coupling that with good housing and good apartments in the middle of that town centre.  That goes to the very essence of what is good about this plan.<\/p> <p>On the flip side and on a smaller thing, the Minister announced &euro;1 million at the weekend for just five age-friendly dwellings in Oldcastle, County Meath, again to be built on derelict land, so this is having an impact on the ground.  People can be sceptical of big plans or when they hear the phrase \"Housing for All\" but it is important to put on the record that tangible things like this are happening.  The URDF funding, in conjunction with Housing for All, is going to make a big difference.<\/p> <p>Another thing that is going to make a big difference is the forward funding which will now be forthcoming from the Department.  The essential element required for this process is land.  I have said it for years in these debates.  When people are talking about housing development, we must note that, if you do not have the basic essential element, land, you cannot build anything.  The situation in respect of land banks in a number of councils across the country is not very good.  It is very bleak.  During the boom times, many councils got themselves into a hell of a lot of trouble.  We had to create a bad bank just to bail out councils as a result of some of the deals they did under the land aggregation scheme.  I am glad to see the forward funding being put in place for councils by the Department.  It is a big advancement.  In Meath, we have seen &euro;6 million in forward funding to allow for the early payment of site costs and to get strategic housing projects through the design, planning and procurement stages.  The council can get ahead and actually start to build what is required.  That is also a key component.  I really welcome that advancement.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Shane Cassells:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2448\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2448&amp;amp;pid=ShaneCassells&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I wish the Minister and the team in the Custom House well.

I am a member of the joint Oireachtas committee and have valued having an input into this plan and the journey that the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, in particular, has travelled along with us over the past year in the work that we have done on that.<\/p> <p>I, too, take offence at Senator Fitzpatrick's reference to a lost decade.  It is a disingenuous comment that is completely unnecessary.  Maybe a history lesson is required.  Fine Gael has held the Ministry for housing since 2016.  From then until now we have outstripped any Opposition ambitions when it has come to the building of social housing, and that was done under a Fine Gael Minister.<\/p> <p>The Land Development Agency is the backbone of many of the provisions and plans here.  There is a fantastic chart on page 87 of Housing for All that lays out the list of State lands planned to be transferred to the Land Development Agency.  Most of the newly acquired agency land appears in my home constituency of Dublin South-Central and it is fantastic.  Again, that was an initiative that began under the former Minister, Eoghan Murphy.<\/p> <p>There is no doubt all parties came into coalition with a determination to build on the excellent foundations that were laid down in Rebuilding Ireland and to enhance them.  Thanks to the co-operation of our three parties, the ideas and the commitment and determination, we have a fantastic, well-resourced and well-thought out plan that covers the provision of housing in a variety of ways, including for renters and for first-time buyers and for right sizing properties in terms of older people who would perhaps like to trade down and move but do not want to leave their communities.  There is a plan to start exploring what we can do in communities to ensure we have elder-friendly provisions.<\/p> <p>There are to be 2,000 cost-rental properties per year, the first of which was launched by the former Minister, Eoghan Murphy, in my home constituency, in the former St. Michael's estate, and hopefully we will see that soon.  Some 20% of all new homes are going to be social and affordable housing, so that first-time buyers get that opportunity.  The shared equity scheme, as much as it is criticised, is a fantastic initiative.  I bought my first home on the back of the shared ownership scheme a long time ago, just off James Street.  It gave people who would never have had an opportunity to get a mortgage at the values of properties at the time an opportunity get on the property ladder and I value that scheme coming back in.  The right sizing provision is really necessary.<\/p> <p>We need to hold local authorities to account, ensuring that they know how to implement the affordable housing provisions and to access that, and to work with whoever wants to work with them in their areas, ensuring that this provision is met and that we keep driving affordable housing.  It is right to support and promote home ownership as the ultimate goal.  At the end of our careers, we will have pensions and reduced income.  It would be nice at that point for a huge cohort to have home ownership and security of tenure.  Having indefinite duration tenancies, looking at variations of that, which are constitutionally permissible, and examining and exploring that is very good.  All of that is within the Housing for All.<\/p> <p>The remote working provisions being promoted by the T&aacute;naiste's Department bring back the possibility of living in our towns and villages, so the Town Centres First is a really good provision in that regard.<\/p> <p>One of the legacies of the previous building boom in the noughties is that we have many defective apartments.  We have complexes which have fire problems.  Yesterday I received a frightening statistic regarding Dublin South-Central and that was that there are 10,000 known apartments in that area, which are likely to be affected by the fire defects.  That is something the Minister's Department needs to drive forward.  We really need fairness here.  Institutional landlords, who have to rectify defects, can write that off against tax, but individuals cannot.  We need fairness and justice for homeowners who are affected through no fault of their own.  We have heard about mica and pyrite and the campaigns there are extremely good and worthy.  However, there is another campaign and the working group's terms of reference are too narrow and we need action on it urgently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#NN00200","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I would like to make a couple of legitimate points on housing based on my experience of what is happening in Dundalk, County Louth.  On one hand we have all these ambitions plans to hit all these targets of housing that we need to build every year, which is great, while on the other hand we have a Planning Regulator who is giving advice to local authorities and council executives saying they should dezone land.  This is dezoning residential land where any developer can put a planning application in tomorrow.  It is dezoning that land from strategic 1 to strategic 2, which means nothing will be built on those lands for the next five years.  As a Government, we are saying we want to built a certain number of houses every year, and I have no doubt we will do that.  However, at the same time, and I am not saying the Planning Regulator is another arm of Government, we have another unit within the bureaucracy of this country that is instigating ideas and providing advice to local authorities that is detrimental to the targets that we want to set by building houses.  How can we, in a county like Louth, say that we want to build a certain number of houses while at the same time county development plans have dezoned any legitimate land?  I do not know how that gets resolved.  It is a bit like closing the stable door after the horse has bolted, but parts of the 2018 national planning framework, which was designed before Covid-19, need to be re-examined in light of the Covid-19 pandemic and how much the world has changed since then.  I cannot square the circle where we want to build a certain number of houses and yet we have a Planning Regulator telling local authorities to dezone land.  I am not saying it is happening everywhere - I hope it is not - but this is my experience of my own home town and what is happening there.<\/p> <p>I have said before, and I think Senator Byrne mentioned it earlier, that we have to be able to hold local authorities to account.  There can be no excuse for a local authority not leading the way in the building of houses.  There can be no excuse for a local authority, such as Louth County Council,  punching well above its targets and doing very well while another local authority of a similar size is not living up to what is required of it, and I am talking about those outside the big cities.  Chief executives should be held accountable to, and appear before, the Oireachtas committee a couple of times a year to answer.  Why is Louth County Council doing really well at this compared to Leitrim County Council or another local authority?  The chief executives, whether we like it or not, are answerable to no one.  We need to make sure they are answerable to the Oireachtas when it comes to house building, in particular, because otherwise it will be case of local authorities saying in a couple of years' time that they tried their best while the Government will have set all these really important targets that we want to hit but that will not be hit.  We need to make sure we are policing that in the local authorities and chief executives are accountable to the Oireachtas for many things but they definitely should be accountable to the Oireachtas housing committee for housing.<\/p> <p>My final point on local authorities, and this is to add a positive point, I was really pleased to read about the CPO programme to allow local authorities to acquire vacant properties in the Minister's speech.  We in Louth have already been doing this since 2015 because we had a really good director of services for housing and a really good chief executive, who are still there but in different positions.  They were able to CPO 130 vacant houses in the town of Dundalk and turn them into social housing with people living in them.  Some 130 houses is more than a housing estate.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator John McGahon:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnMcGahon&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->What the council is doing removes vacant and derelict houses that could be causing problems with antisocial behaviour.  A dilapidated house may have damp and all sorts of stuff coming into it.  There was one local authority house in which the person in question had no resource whatsoever because he or she would not know who owned it or its history.  It gets worse and worse.  It becomes more expensive for the State to come in to try to do up a property.  However, Louth County Council has been a forerunner in doing what I describe.  It has been doing so on its own initiative.  If the Government is to launch a CPO programme, it should go to a local authority that knows how to do it.  Such a local authority is Louth County Council because it was doing this five or six years ago, before it was even a strategy of the Government.  I have seen the benefits.  A counsellor can go along to the council and point out a vacant home that is causing issues in an area.  Within 12 to 15 months, there will be a family of three or four living in it.  It is absolutely superb.  It should be a flagship priority of the Government to use the CPO process to put vacant houses back into the housing stock.  I would love to see an energetic programme of this kind implemented across every local authority area in the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#NN00300","speaker":"1670","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":159,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; go l&eacute;ir.  I have taken note of their comments.  We are deeply grateful to all the officials in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage who did such incredible work on this.  There has been a high level of dedication to Housing for All, led by the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien.  The Department has a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister and two Minister of States from Fine Gael and the Green Party.  They are united in this common cause.  It is not just about the Ministers; it is also about the partners, the NGOs, approved housing bodies and the local authorities, in addition to the Opposition parties, which have contributed in this House and the D&aacute;il.  It needs to be acknowledged that we have all contributed.  We should have collective ownership of the initiative over the coming years rather than dividing on it.  It is important that we try to work collaboratively to achieve the objectives in Housing for All.<\/p> <p>I have a couple of comments.  Irish Water has been mentioned several times.  I ticked a box every time it was mentioned.  I hope that once we move towards a single public utility, the associated issues can be resolved.  That will certainly help with our ambition in this regard.<\/p> <p>The performance of local authorities was mentioned.  Bringing the chief executive officers of local authorities before a committee is certainly worth considering.  There are targets set for each county in respect of social housing and delivery.  That is to be noted also. <\/p> <p>On vacant homes, those on the heritage side inputted quite a lot into the town centres first policy, which the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, will be introducing shortly.  There is great potential in this regard.  It was debated last night here and in the D&aacute;il.  I have sat through quite a lot of the debate as a whole.  It is quite interesting to see the turnaround from a decade ago in that talk about town centres has now become mainstream.  Let us try to deliver on that.<\/p> <p>Disability was also mentioned.  There are some very good examples of initiatives in this regard across the country, one of which is in my county, Kilkenny.  It concerns independent co-housing in Callan.  There is a genuine opportunity associated with integrated housing and life-cycle housing.  It is important that we deliver on that.<\/p> <p>A point was made on the development of sustainable communities.  It is not just about delivering units; it is also about delivering sustainable communities.  That entails mobility and transport, access to public transport and creating vibrant town centres.<\/p> <p>The point was made that this is a radical, realistic and costed plan.  It is.  We are very determined to deliver on it.  Points were made about renters and security of tenure, which will also be addressed.<\/p> <p>I thank all the Senators present.  It is fantastic to be back in this House to address them.  I appreciated the level of debate this afternoon.<\/p> <p>Our central goal in Housing for All, as set out in the programme for Government, is that everyone in the State should have access to a home to purchase or to rent at an affordable price, built to a high standard and at the right place, and offering a high quality of life.  Everyone should have access to sustainable good-quality housing that is located close to services that are essential for healthy and happy living.  Housing for All achieves this.  Every player, be it a State body or otherwise, has a part to play in solving the housing problem.  Any long-term solution needs to have the entire system pulling in the same direction to a common goal, namely, more and better houses and apartments at affordable prices to buy or to rent.  There is no quick fix, as stated by the Minister, as anyone with a genuine interest in housing knows.  Right now, there are not enough houses to buy or rent in the private sector.  We need to build more social housing.  Housing has become increasingly unaffordable for the squeezed middle.  Too many people are experiencing homelessness or are unable to access appropriate housing.  The cost of building houses is too high.  Too much vacant stock remains unused.  Our housing stock needs to be more environmentally friendly.<\/p> <p>Tackling the housing problem is not an overnight process.  The solutions to the problems are not all to be found within the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  There are many problems to be solved.  Our job is to increase the capacity in both the private and public construction sectors and to create the environment needed to enable the sector to get back to building houses on scale.  We are aware that we must provide many more homes for our growing population over the next decade at prices and rents that people can afford.  We will spend unprecedented amounts of Exchequer money to provide social and affordable housing, introduce new incentives to encourage homebuilding in suitable locations, introduce taxes to galvanise the greater use of zoned land and vacant properties, and release State-owned land for residential construction.<\/p> <p>We must also ensure that housing stock is fully utilised.  That is why Housing for All introduces incentives and measures to bring vacant and derelict properties back into residential use.  This policy has the potential to rejuvenate our villages, towns and cities and breathe new life into once-loved buildings.  These and other measures will support the ambition of the forthcoming climate action plan.<\/p> <p>We need to consider the most vulnerable.  Preventing homelessness, protecting tenants and supporting social inclusion are all critical to the success of Housing for All.  We will continue to support vulnerable households.  We will increase the levels of new housing stock.  It fills me with immense pride to be involved in a plan that will work towards the eradication of homelessness.  Signing up to the Lisbon Declaration signals our commitment in this regard.  This plan supports our commitment to end homelessness by 2030.  Housing for All is not just about delivering the necessary homes for private, social and affordable housing; it is also about setting out a pathway to economic, societal and environmental sustainability in the delivery of housing.  Our measures relating to the construction sector, including on costs, will help to make the delivery of housing more economically sustainable in the longer term.  This plan will ensure that we achieve a more sustainable housing system, with a planning system that is fit for purpose and that will create long-term, vibrant communities with the necessary supporting infrastructure.<\/p> <p>The implementation of this plan is now of the utmost importance.  Oversight will be provided by the Cabinet committee on housing.  Actions will be continually monitored and updated annually to account for the latest analysis, performance against our targets and any new or corrective actions that may be necessary to stay on track in meeting our targets.  By working together to implement this plan, the Government will make every effort to accelerate the delivery of housing for all and work towards a long-term sustainable housing system for this and future generations.<\/p> <p>While preparing Housing for All over the past 12 months, the Government has taken up the fight to address the housing crisis head-on.  It has already introduced some ambitious actions, and that ambition is evident for all to see in Housing for All.  This year saw the largest housing budget on record.  The Government passed the first-ever comprehensive affordable housing Act and reformed the Land Development Agency's remit, while placing it on a statutory footing.  Both steps are aimed at increasing affordability.<\/p> <p>The help-to-buy incentive was extended.  Ireland's first-ever cost rental homes were opened.  To assist older people and people with a disability, we have increased funding for housing adaptation grants for older people and people with a disability.  We have also increased funding under the disabled person's grant and the improvement works in lieu of local authority housing scheme.<\/p> <p>For renters, the Government extended the rent pressure zones and limited rent increases to general inflation.  It also limited deposits and extended protections for student renters.  Co-living has been banned and five separate legislative measures have strengthened tenant protections.  We also legislated to protect traditional family homes from bulk purchases.<\/p> <p>To combat vacancy, we brought over 3,600 vacant social homes back into use, streamlined the buy and renew scheme and extended the repair and lease scheme, the grant now being &euro;60,000.  To stimulate more housing, we invested in an Irish Water stimulus package and slashing red tape associated with developing new social housing by increasing the single-stage approval process figure to &euro;6 million.  The regeneration of our cities and towns has been underlined by an additional investment of &euro;1.3 billion under the urban regeneration and development fund.<\/p> <p>It is clear from the action taken by the Government over the past year that all are intent on and committed to fixing our housing system.  Housing for All takes that commitment a step further and on a pathway to a sustainable housing system by clearly setting out how we plan to address the serious short-, medium- and long-term challenges ahead.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Housing for All takes that commitment a step further on the pathway to a sustainable housing system by clearly setting out how we plan to address the serious short, medium and long-term challenges ahead.  Ireland needs a long-term plan that addresses the fundamentals of our housing system.  The Government has a key role to play in enabling the delivery of housing, ensuring that best use is made of existing stock and delivering strong sustainable communities.  Through Housing for All there is an unprecedented level of collaboration across government and with key stakeholders backed up by historic levels of funding.  Working with and enabling the private sector to deliver on housing is also central to the plan.<\/p><p>The national planning framework outlines the need for an average of 33,000 additional homes to be constructed per annum until 2030.  These homes need to be affordable, built in the right place to the right standard and in support of climate action.  They need to satisfy demand for housing across four tenures, namely, affordable, social, private rental and private ownership.  They need to be advanced through the planning process and to be built within the context of specific development targets for five cities and major towns and the complementary objectives of the town centres first policy and rural housing.  The four pathways in Housing for All contain a comprehensive suite of actions to achieve housing policy objectives.  Housing for All has the largest housing budget in the history of the State to support these pathways, with an excess of &euro;20 billion in funding through the Exchequer, the Land Development Agency and the Housing Finance Agency over the next five years.<\/p><p>This plan will work.  I am sure the 213 actions are the right ones to solve the crisis.  I have every confidence in the team throughout the entirety of government and beyond tasked with implementing them.  The investment the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has explained, along with all of the measures discussed here and in the document, will broaden home ownership to a wider circle of citizens while eradicating homelessness and addressing social housing needs.  It will improve the lives of all families and the long-term health of our communities.  Housing for All will give the squeezed middle a real chance to buy their homes.  It will help those struggling to make ends meet.  It will help to breathe fresh life into our towns, villages, rural communities and cities.  Most importantly, it will get the country back to building homes.  It will take perseverance, focus, determination and resolve but Housing for All will meet the housing needs of a generation.  Housing for All will work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#OO00200","speaker":"1512","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1632907800,"counter":161,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 5.03 p.m. and resumed at 5.15 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"National Lottery (Amendment) Bill 2021: Second Stage","time":1632907800,"counter":162,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#QQ00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":163,"content":"<p>The combined opening speeches of the proposer and seconder shall not exceed 16 minutes.

I am delighted to see the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth.  He was my neighbour and colleague for a long time on the council in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  It is great to see him taking the Bill on behalf of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p> <p>In essence, the Bill seeks to prohibit the use of commercial or private gambling or betting operations on the infrastructure put in place by the national lottery, predominantly the lotto and there are other games with which people around the country are familiar.  I will outline why we want to do this.  I will also address some of the issues that have been raised by various people who have contacted me with concerns about jobs.<\/p> <p>The national lottery operates in this country under a licence that is granted by the Government.  In doing so it operates in a very privileged position.  It has a monopoly on this type of activity in this country.  It does so in the interests of the public and the State.  The way it works is that it takes money in as part of its operations but much of this money, or a significant portion of it, come back to the country in good causes.  Between 28 cent and 30 cent in every &euro;1 spent on the national lottery in Ireland comes back to the State and, therefore, to the people as part of the good causes fund.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Barry Ward:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I call that the social dividend that comes from the national lottery because we can all recognise the dangers associated with gambling.  In this House, we have had many conversations about what those dangers are and where the risks lie, particularly for people who are susceptible to addiction and dangerous gambling habits.  None of us wants to see that happen.  I am not here to promote the national lottery in any way but the reality is when people in Ireland spend money on lotto products, or whatever it might be with the national lottery, there is a social dividend that comes back to us.  The good causes money comes back to communities, villages, towns and areas throughout the country through sports capital grants and all kinds of other grants that are given for activities at local level.  That has to be recognised as a good thing.<br\/><br\/>At the moment, many private commercial gambling companies, betting companies and bookmakers operate a system whereby they allow people to bet smaller sums on the outcome of the lotto.  In doing so, people spend less money but also win a sum of money because the odds are different and all that kind of thing.  It is not to pass any judgment on that, but the reality is when people spend money in a bookies rather than their local shop or wherever it might be, it is money that is diverted from the national lottery and put into the hands of private interests in this country.  These companies essentially make a profit off public infrastructure.  We should be in no doubt that the establishment of the national lottery, and the infrastructure it puts in place to run the lotto with which we are all familiar, costs money to establish and to run on a weekly basis.  All the checks and safeguards that go with that are important to make sure that people can have confidence in the correctness, fairness, impartiality and appropriateness of the way in which the lotto runs.  It is inappropriate that private interests are allowed to piggyback on that infrastructure, take what is paid for, in essence, by the public purse - the licence is granted to one company - and then use that to make profit for their own gain.<br\/><br\/>I am not here to say that bookmakers should not be allowed to make profits or to say they should not be able to make money.  Of course, they should.  I recognise a large number of people in this country are employed by various bookmakers and betting companies, many of whom have been in contact with me.  I understand they might fear for the future of their jobs but I do not believe that what is proposed in this Bill will in any way impact in real terms on jobs in the betting industry.  I have heard from various sources the amounts of money that might be involved in this and I take all those figures with a grain of salt.  I do not know, and I do not think anyone knows definitively, how much money this might cost bookmakers or might profit the national lottery or <i>vice versa<\/i>.  The reality is a very significant amount of money is being spent by Irish people in bookmakers who are betting on national lottery products.  Every penny they spend in a bookmaker rather than in their local newsagent, grocery shop or lotto agent, is money that is diverted from the national lottery and, therefore, diverted from the good causes I spoke about.  A third of that money goes back into local communities, which is why this is a bad thing.  I am not saying there should not be betting or gambling.  I am saying we should not allow private interests to profit from the infrastructure the national lottery has put in place. <br\/><br\/>If we imagine a person going into a bookmaker to spend money on betting on the national lottery other than putting it through lotto, there are two effects.  First, the money they spend on that bet is money they do not spend on a lotto ticket.  I do not think for a moment that somebody who spends a smaller sum at a bookie is now going to buy a lottery ticket if they did not before, but some people undoubtedly will or they might irregularly or less regularly buy a lottery ticket.  There is, therefore, a profit or a sum of money that could be identified that does not go into good causes.  More than that, all over this country, newsagents, small shops, groceries and local shops provide a service to communities and are the lotto agents that sell the tickets.  Every time somebody goes into a bookmaker to bet on the lotto rather than going into their local shop, they do not buy a pint of milk, newspaper, loaf of bread or whatever it is while they are in there.  That is another important part of what this Bill will do.  It will preserve the footfall into small shops the length and breadth of this country, which are the lotto agents that provide a valuable service above and beyond what the lotto does.  That is an important aspect of this as well.<br\/><br\/>The Bill amends section 46 of the National Lottery Act 2013, which is the underpinning legislation.  Essentially, leaving aside all the definitions, it does three important things and amends that Act in three respects.  It makes it an offence for any private bookmaker or betting company to use the national lottery infrastructure to sell a betting offer or to create a bet; it increases the penalties because there are already penalties in place in that Act for abusing national lottery infrastructure or whatever it might be; and, importantly, it also creates a corporate offence.  This is not about penalising individuals.  The reality is what we are talking about here is often done at a corporate level by the large bookmaking companies we are all familiar with.  It is not about an individual person in a shop who might run this but penalising the company if it breaks the law.  In fairness, given these are all legitimate operations, I suspect that if this Bill was to become law there will not be any need for these penalties.  The point of the Bill is that it criminalises or outlaws the use of national lottery infrastructure.  I have gone into some detail on why we are proposing this change.<br\/><br\/>It is important to say this is not anti-bookmaker legislation.  The proposal is not to do down legitimate and responsible bookmaking organisations, which are companies we are all familiar with because they are household names.  It is to divert money currently going to those private interests back into the national infrastructure to provide for a situation whereby the citizen gets the social dividend I spoke about.  The more money that goes into the lotto, the more money that comes back.  I say that not by way of promoting the national lottery but in recognition of the fact the licence is designed in a way to maximise the benefit for society and the citizen through the good causes fund that goes through the Department and is redirected into communities through things such as sports capital grants.  It is extremely important we make sure the national lottery is viable and makes a profit.  As I said, I do not speak on behalf of the national lottery and there are some people who will say that the national lottery holds a unique position.  That is undoubtedly the case but it has that position with a view to, ultimately, benefiting the entirety of society to allow it to benefit from the good causes fund.  <br\/><br\/>I hope the Government will accept this proposal.  It is something that is measured and makes sense.  It also recognises the fact that, and my colleague, Senator Carrigy, will speak a little about this, the national lottery operates other strictures on its activities that are built-in protections for citizens who might be susceptible to gambling addictions.  I am not saying the bookmakers do not provide that, but they are much less restricted in what they can and cannot do.  This is a sensible, measured and conservative proposal to allow a situation where the citizen of Ireland gets the most he or she possibly can from its national lottery through the good causes fund.  I hope the Government will support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#QQ00300","speaker":"1685","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":166,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is very welcome.  I am delighted to support this Bill.  It is important to state that I am a national lottery agent.  I will put that on the record.  I speak on behalf of the 5,500 retailers who have licences throughout the country.  As I said, I am one of them.  Emails were recently sent by another organisation claiming that lobbying took place with regard to putting this Bill forward.  That is not the case.  Senator Ward has made it perfectly clear why this legislation needs to be put in place.<\/p> <p>This is about outlawing the use of private operators of national lottery activities to profit, or otherwise, from making further betting offers.  In short, they are using the drawn numbers on a Wednesday or Saturday night to sell odds.  That is the reality of it.  It is important to note this change in legislation only affects bookmakers and not the large number of community fundraising bonus number draws that take place in every single town and village throughout the country.  You may ask, why introduce the Bill?  The national lottery was set up and granted a licence to provide a lottery for the people of Ireland but, more important, approximately 30 cent in every &euro;1 earned is given back to the people through funding for good causes projects and schemes that benefit communities throughout the country. <\/p> <p>It is also important to note there are a large number of restrictions to safeguard customers by limiting the number of sales, a strict age policy and an end-of-day time of 10 p.m.  I will share with Senators what we, as agents, go through.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Miche&aacute;l Carrigy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MichealCarrigy&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Twice this year a mystery shopper has come to my business.  Every single staff member must be certified to comply with the legal and regulatory obligations that relate to the promotion of lottery products.  A mystery regulatory shopper visits premises to assess whether we have adhered to the strict rules.  If one sells too many tickets or sells them to an underage person on more than one occasion then there is a strong risk that one will lose the licence.  There is strict compliance and a licence is at stake for every licence holder.  For me, as one of the 5,500 agents, the national lottery regularly conducts checks.  Agents must also go through a yearly online certification process on the national lottery's rules and regulations.<\/p><p>Last August, the sports capital and equipment programme awarded &euro;16.6 million in funding for projects with significant further capital projects due to be announced next November.  My local GAA club is one of those clubs that awaits the announcement in order to erect floodlights.  Over the years my club has received grants to develop a pitch, dressing rooms and funding went towards an extension for a meeting room and gym.  Would we have been able to carry out these works without the support of the sports capital programme?  No.  I have given the example of the funding given to one small village in Longford and such provision is replicated throughout the country.  The programme has been expanded to fund other good causes; not just sports.  One only has to look at my local area where the national lottery has a access for all scheme that allows boats to be hired so people with disabilities can go on the Shannon.<\/p><p>I am not anti-gambling and enjoy a flutter on the horses now and again but the bookmaking industry needs to change.  For example, we should ban the publication of free bets in newspapers every time there is racing at Aintree, Cheltenham and Galway.  I accept that the Irish Bookmakers Association has put forward a number of proposals, which is an extremely positive move.  This legislation does not stop the association from continuing to carry out the draws that its members do but stops them from using the national lottery numbers, which is only fair.<\/p><p>As Senator Ward has stated, the funds and profits generated by the national lottery are spent on good causes in every single town and village in the country.  People will contend that the proposed change will affect jobs.  However, as things stand, the jobs in 5,500 businesses are already affected so I just hope that the Government will support this legislation.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#RR00200","speaker":"1639","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I fully support the general thrust of this Bill to limit gambling.  As Senator Carrigy has said, they have not canvassed anybody and certainly have not talked to me about this matter heretofore.<\/p> <p>The argument that the lottery has a monopoly, which is the case in Ireland, has passed me by somewhat.  On altering certain freedoms concerning gambling and the lottery in Ireland, I would say it is a given that more people are addicted to the lotto and scratch cards than to gambling on lotto numbers.  I would have no problem in respect of other forms of gambling, such as gambling on horses, online gambling and everything else.<\/p> <p>The minimum cost of a lotto ticket is &euro;4 and I am sure that most people spend &euro;6 on the lotto plus ticket, for which Senator Carrigy might have the figures.  The small man who cannot afford to spend &euro;6 on the lotto a couple of times a week or whatever might like to spend 10 cent, 50 cent, &euro;1 or whatever and pick two numbers in order to have a chance of winning a few bob, as alluded to by Senators.<\/p> <p>The programme for Government is full of ways to open up monopolies be it Bord G&aacute;is, Bus &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus or the ESB, which is heavily in the news at present due to the issues with power and whatever.  There are more monopolies in this country.  I am surprised with the timing of this legislation as a regulator for the gambling industry is due to be appointed.  The appointment has been talked about for a while and is mentioned in the programme for Government.<\/p> <p>Lastly, I am quite disturbed by some of the national lottery advertisements.  I am seriously concerned with the advertisements broadcast on television because they try to manipulate by looking like children's entertainment.  One advertisement shows a water slide on the side of an apartment block in Dublin city centre.  Do these advertisements seek to manipulate the next generation into gambling?  I am uncomfortable with the advertisement and am very disappointed with the national lottery.<\/p> <p>I am delighted to be able to say all that in this forum.  I am not anti-gambling but if I had my way, I would ban Internet gambling.  I am certainly not overly pro-gambling either.  To me, the advertisement showing a massive water slide coming out of an apartment block in Dublin is what children would see as entertainment and the advertisement is shown during the daytime as part of mainstream media.  To me, the advertisement is wrong.  The management of the national lottery should hang their heads in shame for running such an advertisement.  I have explained how I feel about these matters and hope that the Senators, and the Minister, will take them on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#SS00200","speaker":"1652"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":169,"content":"<p>We are all aware of the difficulties that are faced by people who are addicted to gambling.  We all know that every day gambling can and has ruined lives.  Gambling charities have called for stronger regulation and legislation for years.  In 2017, I held a high-level conference in Dublin that included international academics to speak on the issue of how gambling and gambling advertisements have an impact on children.<\/p> <p>The Government has promised to bring legislation to include imposing spending limits on customers, having a stronger age verification for mobile gambling, curbing advertising, and especially a ban on advertisements aimed at returning customers to gambling.  We were promised this legislation by the end of quarter 3.  Unless the Government plans to publish the legislation tomorrow morning, it looks like it will have reneged on its commitment.<\/p> <p>We need a strong and flexible regulator.  A commitment to provide a regulator is contained in the programme for Government and was supposed to be delivered at the end of this year.  At the rate the Government is going, I will not hold my breath for that either.<\/p> <p>Realistically, and I do not mean any disrespect to the people who brought forward this Bill, if we had a proper regulator there would be no reason for this legislation.  What we need is a proper gambling control Bill with a proper regulator.  Fine Gael has promised legislation to tackle gambling issues as far back as 2011.  The heads of a gambling Bill were published in 2013 and more legislation was developed by Fianna F&aacute;il in 2018.  Considering a gambling control Bill has essentially been written already, it should not have taken this long for us to discuss that legislation.  Yet here we are, over a year into the lifetime of the Government, and we are left waiting.<\/p> <p>Given all of the can-kicking that has happened, it is disappointing that this legislation before us has been framed as a support for problem gambling.  I say that because the Bill has been framed in a way that will not address the issues that we have been told it will address because, using the Paddy Power website, one can still place bets on the lottos in the UK, Spain and New York.  From my reading of the Bill, it seems to just cover the Irish national lottery.  If there is such concern that people will fall victim to problem gambling or that money will be diverted away from the social dividend of the national lottery through betting and gambling shops, why does the legislation not cover all lottos?  I agree that there will be people who will not have &euro;6 to play the lotto.  My dad is one of the people who likes to place a small bet on the lotto in a bookies shop.  He will not be happy with this legislation but he probably will simply move to doing the UK lottery instead.<\/p> <p>No charity or NGO that I have ever engaged with that worked on gambling has called for more to be done to tackle this particular issue and I have met them at length.

They are well-made and funny advertisements but they are clearly showing you that if you win the lotto, your life is going to significantly improve.<\/p><p>Another issue around the national lottery that was brought to my attention by those who work at the coalface of problem gambling is the fact that it interrupts the family film at the weekend.  Family time is interrupted by the drawing of the national lottery numbers.<\/p><p>People are trying to do their best.  I would much rather we were debating actual legislation that would put in place a gambling regulator or legislation relating to advertising that targets vulnerable people.  I know that my colleague, Deputy Gould, has brought significant legislation that would ban the use of credit cards, which would protect vulnerable people.  As I said, we will support the Bill moving to Committee Stage.

It is independently regulated.  It should have an ethos of care that goes above and beyond.  It should be a more controlled environment.  Thirty cent from every euro collected goes to good causes and that dividend, on which the national lottery is based, is not going where it should go when a ticket is purchased in the bookies.<\/p> <p>I am very much of the opinion that we should be separating the national lottery and good causes, low-odds draws and community lotteries, on one hand, from gambling, on the other.  We have two items of legislation that govern those two areas but we must do everything we can around that ethos of care because the consumer does not make the distinction.<\/p> <p>I read what the Irish Bookmakers Association sent.  I am not a hypocrite.  I enjoy a flutter at Punchestown or Fairyhouse but I have opted into those events as an adult introduced to gambling in a lesson-based way in an environment that was much more controlled.  That is very important because the blur between gambling and entertainment has gone too far and it does bleed into family entertainment.  Gambling is very accessible.  Looking at the Irish Bookmakers Association's reasons for retaining the situation as it stands, it is not the controlled environment that my colleague, Senator Carrigy, has outlined relating to the local retailer.  That five cent that might be used to buy a lottery ticket or to put down a bet is upselling and that is not what this is supposed to be.<\/p> <p>I believe player protections are there in terms of not using credit cards.  Acquiring or purchasing a ticket for the lotto through the bookies definitely displaces money for good causes whereas there are transaction limits, ID verification and time restrictions elsewhere, even for the lotto's online presence.  There is a responsibility to pursue best practice there.  That needs to continue and be taken seriously.<\/p> <p>Organisations have benefited through the sports capital grant, even in my own area.  It is a phenomenal amount of money.  Some &euro;6 billion has been paid out since the start of the grant.  I will welcome it when we see gambling regulation.<\/p> <p>I agree that we need to do a lot of work on advertising.  Bookmakers have rebranded over the past ten years.  Bookies used to be smoke-filled places that only men over a certain age would have gone into.  They rebranded and repositioned themselves ten years ago and completely changed their market, not just online but also physically.  That has had a big impact.  We need to take control of that.  I do not see the national lottery in that guise but we need to protect that, commit ourselves to that and make the ethos of care a priority.  We must make sure the social dividend is going where it should go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#TT00200","speaker":"1648"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":172,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill and congratulate my colleagues for bringing it forward.  I know the hard work and thought that went into it, particularly on the part of Senator Ward.  I appreciate that and commend him for it.<\/p> <p>I need to declare that I am anti-gambling for many reasons.  I have counselled families who have had an individual gamble away the home from over their heads.  Because of the experiences I have had in seeing the absolute devastation coming from gambling, I come with a particular bias that I find hard to shift.  I appreciate the horse industry and all the employment that goes with it.  We certainly received a formidable email from the Irish Bookmakers Association reminding us of all of those things in the context of this legislation.  That notwithstanding, nothing takes away from sitting down and hearing somebody talk about these matters.  At least if someone drinks, they will eventually fall down.  If they are on drugs, they will eventually pass out.  However, somebody could be gambling away food and the roof over the head of someone else.<\/p> <p>I appreciate and value the social dividend from the national lottery.  I have been involved in an organisation that was a recipient of the sports capital grant and very grateful for it.  I appreciate all of that and the role it plays, but I wonder about the State's role in gambling of any type.  That said, it was heartening to hear Senator Carrigy's experience of how the industry is regulated.<\/p> <p>I concur with Senator Davitt's views regarding the national lottery.  Its advertisements are absolutely outrageous and are intended to attract a younger audience.  The breaking up of the family movie at that time on a Saturday evening is appalling.  Allowing any advertising before the watershed is appalling.  The same thing applies to the large, well-known brands of bookmakers.  Their advertisements are intended to look attractive and to attract a whole generation and to attract women.  In the context of the statements around regulation, my then five-year-old child thought that one of these brands and its colours are great.  I had to sit my child down and tell them, with my particular bias, that this is not a happy thing.  These advertisements mask significantly unhappy families.  From that point of view, I will welcome the regulator and the full force of the law and the oversight coming into the industry.  I support any step in that direction in this Bill, anything that reduces those effects.  It is described in the correspondence we received from the Irish Bookmakers Association as consumer choice.

It really is a reminder to public representatives of the reason this Bill is so great.  The lottery breaks up the family movie on a Saturday and has inappropriate advertising.

This Bill is well-intentioned and I support its spirit.  The regulation of betting must be carefully managed.  Betting cannot be allowed to get out of hand.  I have some concerns that I wish to express on behalf of a colleague, Senator Crowe, who cannot be here today.  I told him I would pass his wishes to the House.  He has fears around some of the matters that are being conflated without a thorough examination.  It is his understanding that the product offered by bookmakers on lottery betting is separate and distinct from that which the national lottery operates, with consumers having the option to bet anything from one number to five numbers emerging from a draw.  It is to allow people to enjoy the option to bet on fewer numbers as this clearly increases their chances of winning.  This is not a facility provided by the national lottery.<\/p> <p>There also seems to be a separation in the target market between those who buy national lottery tickets and those who make bets on the outcomes through external bookmakers.  Bets are placed in licensed premises, which only adults can enter.  That is as opposed to the lottery being accessible in shops and petrol stations, which may be frequented by minors.  Bets can also be placed at a lower amount than the minimum stipulated by the national lottery.<\/p> <p>The national lottery licence was sold in 2013 for a period of 20 years under the market conditions of the time.  Since then, it has moved from 45 to 47 numbers, further reducing the chances of winning.  The jackpot is now at the second-highest figure ever recorded.  When it was sold, bookmakers offered these markets, as they had done for decades, allowing for more chances to win for those who wished to participate in the betting market.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge that the national lottery generated &euro;245 million in funding for good causes throughout Ireland last year, with that contribution amounting to more than &euro;6 billion since 1997.  However, it seems concerning that the landscape could be altered for private operators who provide gambling products and, in effect, a monopoly could be created in favour of one operator.  This is especially true where the operator caters to different target markets.  It is worth noting that the bookmakers support thousands of jobs across the country and paid approximately &euro;100 million in betting duty in 2019.  Removing the private betting market would, in all likelihood, not have a significant effect on the income of the national lottery, as there are no guarantees that those who would be prevented from betting on the national lottery in bookmakers would switch to buying lottery tickets.<\/p> <p>When this matter first arose in 2019, the then Government opposed this proposal on the advice of the Attorney General.  The then Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton, indicated that it could lead to further demands on the national lottery, perhaps at the expense of local lotteries that support sports clubs and community organisations.  One could argue they are in direct competition with the national lottery.  There is no certainty the national lottery would make further demands or prohibitions on local lotteries but we must consider unintended potential pitfalls and examine the precedent we set when questions like these come up for debate.<\/p> <p>The Bill is well-intentioned but it attempts to make a direct link between those who spend their money buying national lottery tickets and those who bet on the outcome in external markets.  I find these to be two different practices with varying methods of betting.  Limiting the ability of one group to bet on the outcome will not necessarily divert the money being spent to the other.  Of course, there is overlap between the two groups but this Bill addresses some of those concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#UU00200","speaker":"1633"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and thank Senator Ward for bringing forward this legislation.

The issue is not just with those who bet but the families who see an impact through losses in money brought home or even the loss of the roof over their heads.  There is also the question of quality of life, which everybody should have.<\/p><p>I was listening earlier, although I could not attend the Chamber at the start of the debate.  Many valuable points were raised about advertising for the national lottery.  I know this as somebody who has children.  The nature of gambling has changed.  It is at our fingertips now more than ever.  The advertisements for the national lottery are also advertising, in a way, the online betting mentioned by Senator Boylan.  It is more accessible to those who may not have the funds to fork out &euro;6.  It is much easier on a phone to send a couple of euro.  I have a young teenage boy and it is shocking that the rate of gambling among male teenagers in Ireland has more than doubled in the past four or five years.  That is a shocking rate and we must do something about it.  Gambling is another epidemic affecting our children.<\/p><p>Let us commend the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, on bringing forward the Gaming and Lotteries (Amendment) Act 2019, which addressed some of the concerns, particularly in trying to protect those under 18.  It has not resolved everything and there is much more to do.  In particular, a gambling regulator is required before the end of the year.  That is in the programme for Government and there is an obligation on all of us to ensure we support that and bring it forward as soon as possible.  Our children cannot wait.  They have been affected by Covid-19 and the rates have probably increased during that period because our kids were at home looking at these advertisements before the watershed or the family movie.  I would like to know the current rates because the figure showing they had doubled in the past four or five years is slightly out of date.  We do not know what they have been over the past few months.<\/p><p>As a Green Party Senator, I have spoken before about how betting duty receipts go to the horse racing and greyhound industries.  When people are playing the national lottery, there may be an understanding that some of the money goes towards a social dividend.  I found out recently that only 30% goes to projects.  I thought the amount was much higher.  I was contacted by RED C as well but at the end of the conversation I was less likely to support the national lottery, which was probably not what the caller expected.

The national lottery supports good causes.  Over 30 cent in each &euro;1 is put towards good causes.  Recently, I checked what the good causes were.  One with which I was very familiar is the wonderful Lough Ree Lanesborough Angling Hub where the Lough Ree disability boat was funded.  This is one of the first in the country and will allow people in wheelchairs or who have mobility access problems to take up sport.  It is a phenomenal investment.  What is even better is that it is in rural Ireland - places where one might not get the funds.  Imagine having funding to develop a boat such as this, which is extremely popular and has a social enterprise behind it.  Some of the other funding involves health, well-being, sport, heritage, arts and culture, youth and community.  It is funding vulnerable groups such as people with special needs.  There is an awful lot to be said about the funds coming from the national lottery because it is a lottery for the people of Ireland.<\/p> <p>As has been pointed out, in this Bill, Senator Ward and colleagues have taken up the fight to say that private operators should not benefit from a fund that is there to support good causes.

It brings a bit of joy into someone's life.  I know it sounds crazy but in the past year and a half, he nearly jumped out of his seat when he won &euro;20 on one of the tickets.  I know it must be balanced but with the national lottery, there are limits.  It is not available after 10 p.m. and I believe only &euro;90 can be spent per day on the national lottery.  It brings a bit of enjoyment - like the Galway Races - and it is for good causes.  The measures in this Bill have been implemented in many other European states and we have perhaps lagged behind.  Hopefully, we can rectify that now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#VV00200","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":178,"content":"<p>I support the Bill.  The project that has been mentioned most in this debate is Lough Ree Lanesborough Angling Hub.  I invite the Minister of State to visit it some time.  I am a huge promoter and supporter of it and was involved in it from day one.  Senators Dolan and Carrigy would be well aware of it as well.<\/p> <p>There is no question that the national lottery is a very good system.  I acknowledge that it is a form of gambling.  We cannot stop a person buying 20 lotto tickets in the shop and I see it happening at times and the same people doing it.  In general, the fact that so much of the money goes back into really good causes and rural Ireland must be acknowledged.  I was asked to answer a few questions over a period of time in a number of surveys regarding the national lottery.  One thinks one knows everything about it but one does not.  That is a story for another day.  <\/p> <p>I will support the Bill.  I could be wrong but I am not so sure there is a massive issue regarding people going into bookies and spending a lot of money on the national lottery, where they can only win limited money.  I acknowledge it exists but I wonder whether it is as widespread as we think.  Where I do agree with Senator Ward is the fact that when one does support the national lottery, quite a percentage of that money goes back into the system for the good causes all over the country for which we all lobby and which we are all very proud to see the money coming to.  That is very important.  To be honest, the Irish people have a good respect for the national lottery.  I have never had anybody lobbying me and giving out about the national lottery or the fact that it involves a bit of gambling.  Yes, as with other Members, people contact me constantly about online gambling, which is the biggest problem with which we must deal.  It is good to see some of the people in the bookmaking business getting very concerned about that and acknowledging that there is a big problem.  I will support the Bill.  It is a very good discussion to have.  I reiterate that I do not think it is a massive problem but I acknowledge that it is there.  We must always look at the good done by the national lottery and support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#VV00300","speaker":"1674"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":179,"content":"<p>I begin by commending Senator Ward for his work on this Bill and for bringing it to the floor of the House.  It is an important Bill.  Not just now but on successive Stages, we should look at it in the context of what we are trying to achieve.  There has been a great deal of movement by the Irish Bookmakers Association.  Senator Carrigy referred to the national lottery and regulation.<\/p> <p>It is important that our approach has consistency and honesty.  All of us in this House must galvanise our work to put gambling harm minimisation and the protection of people at the heart of what we do.  I say this because each of us knows the profound impact gambling has had and continues to have on many families in each of our constituencies and communities.  I accept that there will be a lot of pressure and commentary from the Irish Bookmakers Association.  As many of my colleagues have said, none of us want to see jobs lost because we understand fully that there have been profits and revenue.  However, this new regulatory framework is the flagship of what we are doing as a Government.  I use the word \"consistency\".  Members from all political parties and none must be consistent in their approach.  When I hear Members from Sinn F&eacute;in coming in here and criticising, I recall how the former Ministers for Justice - Alan Shatter, Frances Fitzgerald and Deputy Flanagan - and the former Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, brought forward changes and produced significant initiatives and efforts to amend our betting regime.  <\/p> <p>I will not go into the full thing since it began in 1845 or 1856 but I admire the former Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, and reflect on the gargantuan change we have made.  When we go back to what Donal Creed did in establishing the national lottery in the 1980s, we can see that our world has changed completely.  The most significant thing for me is that in respect of good causes, the national lottery  generated &euro;254 million last year and has generated over &euro;6 billion since 1987.  Many of us who play the national lottery do so in the knowledge that we are giving back as well.  We speak about advertising today - I think it is the biggest national lottery prize ever - but &euro;6 billion has been generated so 30 cent in every &euro;1 goes back.  I am involved in my local GAA club and my community and see the benefits of the national lottery through the sports capital programme.  We forget one thing.  The national lottery has a regulator.  As Senator Carrigy rightly said, there are spot checks and walk-in inspections.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Player protection must be at the forefront of all we do.  We have changed the watershed for the advertising of different products, such as alcohol, cigarettes and other things.  We have made changes and I am sure we will take similar action in respect of the lottery.  It is tightly controlled and independently regulated.  We are an outlier in the European context in permitting bookmakers to accept bets on draws operated by the national lottery.<\/p><p>It is important that we are having this debate.  I am conscious of the fact that we changed the organisation responsible for running the national lottery, but that is a different debate.  The debate we are having today is positive in nature.  In fairness to Senator Ward, the Bill is one that we should support.  It is also one that the entire Government supports.  It is significant that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, has also remarked on lottery betting in the context of avoiding the main national lottery draw being undermined.<\/p><p>We need regulation, a gambling commission and a gambling authority.  We are moving in that direction.  The Minister of State, Deputy Browne, has continued with the reform work.  However, today's debate is important.  I conclude by commending Senator Ward on his work.  I look forward to Committee Stage, when we can tease the issues out further and place gambling harm minimisation at the core of what we do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#VV00400","speaker":"1637","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this Private Members' Bill.  Like other Members, I wish to compliment my colleague, Senator Ward, on bringing forward the Bill for consideration.  I should say at the outset that I have no vested interest in this discussion.  I am not anti-gambling.  I play the lotto.  I also place the odd bet on football or horse racing at the bookmakers.  Some of what I say in the next few minutes may be perceived as being supportive of the national lottery and some of it, not so much.<\/p> <p>There is no doubt that it is an amazing coincidence that we are debating this Private Members' Bill on an evening when there is a record jackpot of &euro;19 million on offer from the national lottery.  I am sure it is a pure coincidence.  As others have said, one third of the cost of every ticket sold for tonight's draw, and every draw throughout the year, goes the good causes fund.  Last year, it generated &euro;254 million, and, as Senator Buttimer stated, since 1987 it has contributed more than &euro;6 billion to help communities and sporting and voluntary organisations in every town, village and city throughout the country.  It is also true that, as mentioned by previous speakers, the lotto supports many thousands of jobs in newsagents.  It is regulated and controlled, with tickets only being sold during certain hours of the day.<\/p> <p>I am acutely aware of the challenges that are faced by individuals and families that are affected by gambling.  While some people that can place the odd bet here and there and some people play the lotto when the jackpot is large, there are many people that are not able to do that and just place the odd bet.  They struggle and run up debts.  All of the consequences that follow are very well documented.  I believe that we do need to address the wider issue of gambling addiction within this country.  Senator Ward is attempting to address one element of that with his Bill.  I look forward to many other elements being teased out as the Bill moves to Committee Stage.  There are valuable and valid arguments on all sides.  We need to be mindful of jobs and displacement, but we also need to be very mindful of those who are challenged with gambling addiction.<\/p> <p>There is one issue that I would like to highlight.  If it is not to be included in this Bill, perhaps it can be addressed through regulation.  I have been contacted by a number of constituents who believe that the sale of scratch cards should be regulated in the same way as the sale of cigarettes in newsagents or retail stores.  They believe that scratch cards should be kept in an unbranded cabinet and not displayed in full view of the customer.  I tend to agree with them.  There is no doubt that it promotes last-minute purchases and entices customers, often the most vulnerable in society, to purchase scratch cards.  I have heard advocates in the past cite examples of people who go into multiple newsagents and spend all of their money on stratch cards.  I am not saying that putting the cards in an unbranded cabinet will stop that behaviour tomorrow morning.  However, if it reduces the number of people who become addicted to that element of the national lottery, I believe that it would be a good day's work.  It may not be for this Bill, but it is one of many other issues that need to be addressed in the wider debate on gambling addiction.  I commend my colleague, Senator Ward, on his work and thank the Minister of State for coming to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#WW00200","speaker":"1647"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":182,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for being here.  I also wish to thank my colleagues, Senators Ward, Carrigy and Currie, for bringing forward this Private Members' Bill.  From the outset, I wish to state that I was an agent of the national lottery in the past and also a member of the Retail Grocery Dairy &amp;amp; Allied Trades Association, RGDATA, which is very firmly behind this Bill.  While I am no longer involved in the industry, I am speaking as a Senator and on behalf of people who have contacted me in respect of concerns around gambling.<\/p> <p>Many colleagues have commented on the contribution of the national lottery to good causes and the many community groups and sporting organisations that are dependent on funding from the lottery.  While I do not believe in any way that any of us want to close down bookmakers, as has been suggested by some, the difference is that the lottery is regulated.  When people buy their lottery ticket, it is in a regulated environment.  When I was in business, I was subject to the spot checks, so I can confirm that it is closely regulated.  The mystery shopper comes into the shop and you get a letter afterwards telling you that you complied or whatever.  It should also be borne in mind that only those aged over 18 can purchase a lottery ticket.  The sale of lottery tickets is regulated and contributes to good causes.  Therefore, this is an opportune time for this Bill to be brought forward.<\/p> <p>I am aware that other states and countries have banned the sale of lottery tickets through bookmakers.  Therefore, we will not be the only country to take such an action if this Bill progresses.  I am here to support the Bill.  It is the right thing to do.  Otherwise, many organisations will lose out on funding down the road.  The Bill is about supporting retailers, the national lottery and the community and sporting organisations that are so dependent on the funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#WW00300","speaker":"1384"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I wish to thank all the contributors to the debate, particularly those who are sponsoring the Bill, namely, Senators Carrigy, Ward and Currie.<\/p> <p>I wish to note a few points that were made.  Senator Ward made the central point that there is a social dividend that is being diverted away from good causes towards the private income of bookmakers.  He also made the point that there is a loss of footfall in local shops, which is a genuine concern at this time.<\/p> <p>Senator Carrigy pointed out that he is a national lottery agent himself.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Ossian Smyth:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OssianSmyth&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As such, he knows the detail of the compliance, such as mystery shoppers going into shops to check that all the rules are being complied with.  Those rules simply do not apply to bookmakers, which are governed by a different set of rules.  We lose that oversight.  The Senator pointed out that the sports capital programme is funded by the national lottery and that people around the country enjoy the use of facilities funded as a result of the national lottery.  It is not an abstract thing or just money going into a pot.<br\/><br\/>I refer to the comments of Senators Boyhan and Maria Byrne.  I am delighted to see Senator Byrne again and offer her congratulations on her return to the Seanad.  The points made were that bookmakers' shops are not a controlled environment in the way that the national lottery is and are not subject to the same time rules or the rules in respect of the volume of tickets sold to people, which may tie into the issue of problem gambling.  Bookmakers could choose to introduce equivalent safeguards, such as curfews, spending limits and abolishing promotional teasers.  Perhaps it is time for bookmakers to reflect on what they could do in that regard rather than just doing what they are able to do within the law.<br\/><br\/>I note that the Bill proposes to amend section 46 of the National Lottery Act 2013 so as to prohibit unauthorised persons from offering bets that make use of the national lottery or its name.  The principal target of the legislation appears to be gambling service providers who offer bets on the outcome of national lottery draws or, in other words, lottery betting.  The National Lottery Act provides for the operation and regulation of the national lottery.  I understand the national lottery regulator has a significant oversight role that seeks to ensure the national lottery is run with due propriety, the interests of participants in the games are protected, the long-term sustainability of the national lottery is safeguarded and revenues generated for good causes are maximised.<br\/><br\/>Bookmakers can employ promotional strategies such as discounting, loyalty schemes and offering free bets.  These are sales and marketing strategies that the national lottery regulatory model prohibits and, as such, it is not a level playing field.  The national lottery games are subject to curfews and spending limits that, as I stated, do not apply to lottery betting at a bookmaker's.  It seems counter-intuitive that an individual can place a bet on the outcome of a national lottery draw at a time and in an amount that would not be permitted if the person wished to play the national lottery itself.  It seems even more illogical that individuals are offered incentives or teasers to place such bets which the national lottery is strictly prohibited from offering.  That is the current situation.<br\/><br\/>I understand there is concern regarding the potential for consumers to be misled by products that are offered by bookmakers under names that are similar to or the same as the national lottery and Euromillions draws.  Again, bookmakers have the power to stop marketing their products in that way and perhaps it is time they do so.<br\/><br\/>Senator Boylan raised concerns regarding the regulation of gambling.  Work is under way in the Department of Justice to introduce a significant suite of reforms of the models for licensing and regulating gambling.  It is important to ensure the regulatory model that has been established for the national lottery is not undermined by lottery betting.  The future gambling regulator may wish to consider these issues.  The regulation of gambling is primarily a matter for the Department of Justice.<br\/><br\/>As regards funding, 65% of gross gaming revenues or, in effect, almost 30 cents out of every euro spent on lottery games, is returned to the Exchequer for use by good cause projects each year.  This helps to fund a diverse range of important projects in areas such as youth organisations, Irish language support schemes, housing grants, sports and recreational facilities and the arts.  It is feared that the type of betting addressed by the Bill may be diverting funding of between &euro;40 million and &euro;60 million a year from good causes.  Although I note that approximately &euro;97 million was raised by betting duty last year, it is set at 2% of turnover for bookmakers and 25% of commissions for remote betting intermediaries.  However, the return for good causes is far higher, at approximately 30 cent of every euro spent, and raised a total of &euro;254 million last year.  Senators can see the difference between the 2% betting levy for bookmakers and what is, effectively, nearly a 30% rate for the national lottery.<br\/><br\/>In addition to the importance of the annual good causes funding, thousands of jobs in retailers that earn commissions for selling tickets and organisations that receive grant funding are directly supported by the national lottery.  That said, I know that representatives of the bookmaking industry will provide a counter-argument regarding the benefits of consumer choice and the number of jobs that may be lost if lottery betting is outlawed.  These are views that must be heard and respected.  The representatives have probably taken the opportunity to contact Senators to make their views known.  It is clear this is a multifaceted issue that will require careful consideration.  There may be several ways to address it to the mutual satisfaction of the relevant stakeholders.  Perhaps this debate can help to draw out further approaches and perspectives that could be considered.<br\/><br\/>There are concerns regarding the compatibility of the Bill with EU law.  The prohibition contemplated in the Bill may restrict the freedom to provide certain gambling services pursuant to Articles 49 and 56 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  Such restrictions may be incompatible with EU law unless there are overriding reasons that justify them as a non-discriminatory and proportionate means of achieving legitimate objectives in the public interest.  I look forward to hearing views on that issue.  <br\/><br\/>The Bill is well drafted, but there is a concern in respect of the drafting of the proposed amendment to section 46(1) of the 2013 Act, which currently prohibits lottery providers from passing off their lottery as being affiliated with the national lottery.  In its current form, section 46(1) provides:<\/p><blockquote>\tA person, other than the Minister, the Regulator, the operator or a licensee or a person authorised to do so by any of them, shall not, for the purposes of a lottery game other than the National Lottery, make use of the names &ldquo;Irish National Lottery&rdquo; or &ldquo;National Lottery&rdquo; or of their equivalents in the Irish language or of any name so closely resembling either of those names or either of their equivalents in the Irish language as to be reasonably capable of leading to the belief that either of those names or either of those equivalents is being referred to. <\/blockquote><p>The Bill proposes to substitute that section with the following:  <\/p><blockquote>\tA person, other than the Minister, the Regulator, the operator or a licensee, or a person authorised to do so by any of them, shall not, for the purposes of a betting offer&mdash;  \t(a) make use of the National Lottery, or<br \/><br \/>(b) make use of&mdash; <blockquote>\t(i) the name &lsquo;Irish National Lottery&rsquo;, its equivalent in the Irish language, or any equivalent thereof,<br \/><br \/>(ii) the name &lsquo;National Lottery&rsquo;, <i>&lsquo;An Crannchur N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta&rsquo;<\/i>, or any equivalent thereof, or<br \/><br \/>(iii) any name so closely resembling either of those names in subparagraphs (i) or (ii) as to be reasonably capable of leading to the belief that any of those names or equivalents is being referred to. <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote><p>By replacing the words &quot;lottery game&quot; with &quot;betting offer&quot;, the Bill appears to remove the existing prohibition on lottery providers making use of the national lottery.  &quot;Lottery game&quot; is defined in section 2 of the 2013 Act as &quot;any game, competition or other procedure ... in which or whereby prizes ... are distributed by lot or chance among persons participating&quot;.  The definition of &quot;betting offer&quot; in the Bill is &quot;a bet offered by a bookmaker&quot;.  The proposed version of section 46(1) applies to betting offers rather than lottery games, leaving lottery providers apparently free to make use of the national lottery and its name.  It is not clear if the Bill is intended to have this effect.<br\/><br\/>To summarise, this is a complex issue.  I welcome the debate.  I take the points regarding problem gambling and the possibility that graphic and enticing advertising appears to be very attractive to children.  That is an issue of concern.  Like every Member of this House, I am aware that problem gambling devastates lives and can lead to destruction beyond that caused by alcohol and drug addiction.  I thank the proposers of the Bill for bringing it forward and I am glad to say that the Government will allow it to proceed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#WW00400","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":185,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his time and his comprehensive response on the various issues that were raised.  I am very grateful to Members who took the time to read, consider and speak on the Bill.  I am in no way an apologist for the national lottery and I have no skin in the game.

Equally, the suggestion by Senator Blaney that minors routinely play the lotto when they are not allowed is also unfounded.  We heard from Senators Carrigy and Maria Byrne about the checks and restrictions in place in the various lotto games.  It is very important to acknowledge they are there.  Senator Boylan indicated she felt the Bill does not address problem gambling and she is absolutely right about that.  She is quite correct in saying there is a major problem with problem gambling.  As the Minister of State said, it can result in the devastation of families.  Everybody in the House acknowledges this.  We have had debates on it and we look forward to the gambling regulatory Bill that is coming.  We will all welcome it.<\/p><p>Everybody would like to see greater restriction on the way in person and online gambling operate in our society.  However, this is not what the Bill is trying to do.  The Bill has a different purpose.  I acknowledge the issues raised, by Senator Davitt for example, in respect of advertising and the point Senator Boylan made about the interruption of the Saturday evening film by the lotto.  They are legitimate points.  They are absolutely things that should be and can be addressed.<\/p><p>In the context of regulation, it is important to remember that, as the Minister of State said, bookies are not the subject of a proper regulatory regime at present but the national lottery is.  The type of regulation we see with the national lottery has changed the field over recent years.  For example, people cannot spend more than &euro;90 per day on national lottery products.  They cannot bet on the national lottery after 10 p.m. in person or online.  People cannot even check their tickets after 10 p.m.  There is no engagement with national lottery services after 10 p.m.  People cannot buy more than ten scratch cards.  Restrictions have been put in place as part of the regulation of the national lottery.<\/p><p>As I said at the very outset of the debate, there can be no doubt the national lottery occupies an incredibly privileged position by virtue of the fact it has a de facto monopoly.  This is not denied.  Part of what I have called the social dividend and payback that comes from this is that money comes back to citizens of the country through the good causes fund.  It is tremendously important to recognise this.  It is the basis on which we bring forward the Bill to deal with the fact that moneys diverted into gambling and bookies take away from the good causes fund.<\/p><p>Senator Murphy suggested that this is not as big an issue as we think it is.  In fact, depending on who we talk to, gambling on the national lottery outside the national lottery is worth between &euro;20 million and &euro;400 million a year.  This varies between what the national lottery or various bookie organisations would say.  The Minister of State has cited figures to suggest that between &euro;40 million and &euro;60 million is being diverted away from the national lottery and away from the good causes fund.  When consider this, I think about various organisations in my area that have profited or benefited from the good causes fund.  With regard to the sports capital grants alone there is Avoca Hockey Club, Monkstown Hockey Club,  Dublin Bay Sailing Club, Sailing in Dublin, the Irish National Sailing and Powerboat School, Crosscare, Dalkey rowing club, St. Michael's Rowing Club in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Dalkey Devils Volleyball Club, Trojan Swim Club and 12th Port Sandycove Canoeing Club.  I will not list them all because the Minister of State, who comes from the same area, knows how many local organisations benefit from the fund.  The Bill is about safeguarding this funding for our communities and local organisations and the bodies that survive on the basis of this funding.<\/p><p>I thank all Members who spoke on the Bill.  In his closing remarks, the Minister of State spoke about problems with the drafting.  This is Second Stage of a long journey for the Bill.  I look forward to working with the Minister of State's officials in dealing with the issues.  The Minister of State specifically addressed the issue of my proposed section 46(1) replacement and he has identified a legitimate issue.  I look forward to amendments being tabled on Committee Stage to address gaps I may have left in the drafting of the Bill.  There is work to be done.  We can make progress.  We can safeguard those moneys.  We can protect the social dividend that comes from the national lottery.  We can make sure we take a step in this direction by passing the Bill.  In this regard I am grateful to the Minister of State, Members and the Cathaoirleach for the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#XX00200","speaker":"1685","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1632907800,"counter":187,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":188,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#YY00300","speaker":"1670"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":189,"content":"<p>D&eacute; M&aacute;irt seo chugainn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092900002#YY00400","speaker":"1685"},{"type":"speech","time":1632907800,"counter":190,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?
