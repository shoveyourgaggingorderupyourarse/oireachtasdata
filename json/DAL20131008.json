If it was true that funding alone and the reduction of funding was the dominant factor in falling rankings for universities, then all our universities would have fallen.  One cannot rationalise that assertion with the fact that some universities have gone up and others have fallen.  That is not to say that we have a financial problem with our universities and third level institutions.  This is why, rather than what might appear to Deputy McConalogue to be the case, the sustainability study is being undertaken by the HEA.  We are obliging all third level institutions to enter into a serious reconfiguration of their structure and landscape.  Deputy McConalogue will be familiar with this.

In such a scenario, an account resolution process, so to speak, would be carried out at the end of the calendar year.  While that has not yet been finalised, that is the process.  Although we are unsure as to what will be the likely take-up, it is another part of the barrier on this island that should be reduced and then people are free to make a decision themselves as to what they want to do.<\/p><p> The position at third level is more complicated because access to institutions in the South is through the Cental Applications Office, CAO, system, based on the best points from six subjects, as the Deputy will be aware, whereas the new GCSE system in the North is different where there are two or perhaps three subjects that get A stars and the others are at a lower level.  There is an ongoing debate between the chambers of commerce and enterprise co-operation, North and South, on the equivalent value of six subjects in the South to the A stars.  We do not control that as it is is a matter for the Irish Universities Association.  There are disputes over the approximate or relevant qualification and the discussions are ongoing.

A number of cases have been taken.  A high-profile case taken by a member of the Traveller community was initially upheld by the Equality Tribunal before unfortunately being overturned by the High Court.  There are some concerns about the operation in practice of the rule that gives one an automatic right to attend a school if one's father or mother attended that school.  Under the regulations being considered, no more than 25% of places can be allocated in such a manner.  The number of all-Irish post-primary schools in my constituency that can be accessed by students who wish to be educated through the medium of Irish is limited.  If up to 25% of places in a school are reserved for students whose parents have previously attended that school, it could indirectly lead to discrimination against students who may wish to be educated through the medium of Irish.  I look forward to discussing the heads of the Bill mentioned by the Minister.  I hope he will take on board the concerns I have expressed, particularly as they relate to schools in built-up urban areas where access and choices could be very limited for students.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800017#P00700","speaker":"984"},{"type":"speech","time":1381243200,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I welcome the Deputy's comments and I share some of his concerns.  Our present system works very well for 80% of the 4,000 schools.  In 20% of cases, parents simply cannot get their children into primary or post-primary schools unless they put their names down soon after birth.  The Deputy is aware of this problem in his constituency and other urban areas.  The proposals were drafted in the Department.  That process was commenced in the Department in 2009 in response to the Department's experience of section 29 appeals to what was happening.  I published the proposals in draft form for discussion in June 2011.  They were the subject of lengthy consultation.  We considered the responses of the many people who got involved in that process.  We received legal advice on the type of primary legislation we would have to enact before we could specify the regulations.  I would like the joint committee to have a full, frank and open debate on this matter.  I look forward to the committee taking submissions from the various stakeholders and consequently making recommendations to the Department.  The Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, and I are open to change.  We want to see whether we need to change some of the provisions of the draft legislation.  We are open to the committee making a case for tweaking what we have published - it could be changed by adding to it or subtracting from it - and we will proceed with the legislation thereafter.  We need to introduce legislation in this area.

It is a fact that Ireland is committed along with the European Commission to the achievement of compliance by the end of 2014.  Targets for implementation here were not met by previous Ministers, including Deputy Martin.  The Minister for Health is determined to end this and to have it implemented in full by the end of next year, ending 14 years of inactivity.<\/p><p>  Yesterday, I met a number of patients whose operations and treatments were cancelled today.  There is much anger out there about this.  It is very regrettable and will clearly result in a reduction in planned patient treatments.  I understand that cancellations will arise in about 7,000 outpatient appointments, 500 day case and 200 inpatient cases.  What is all this about?  It is about the range of sanctions people want imposed on hospitals.<\/p><p>  I understand there is great range of disagreement about what is involved here.  Proposals have been tabled in this regard by both the HSE and the IMO.  As with any industrial relations dispute, negotiations between the two sides are always the way to achieve a proper resolution.  I call on the IMO to re-engage with the LRC process, which is the way to do this, and to desist from any further disruption to services, which is a cause of great distress to patients today.<\/p><p>  It is absolutely desirable that doctors enjoy reasonable and proper working conditions.  I assure the IMO and junior doctors in hospital that this Government, unlike previous Governments, remains fully committed to and has made serious progress in achieving compliance with the working time directive.  In the first half of 2013, 35% of all NCHDs were compliant with the 48-hour week, particularly in specialist areas.  I am informed that virtually all non-consultant hospital doctors in radiology, pathology, emergency medicine and psychiatry are fully compliant.  The specialities in which compliance has still to be achieved are generally obstetrics, paediatrics, anaesthesiology, surgery and medicine.  Average weekly working hours for all NCHDs were 52.4 hours as of July 2013.  The Minister and the HSE are now focused on reducing this figure to 48 hours in compliance with the directive.  We hope to have that achieved fully by the end of 2014.  As the Deputy can see, significant progress has been made here.<\/p><p>  Before I sit down, I again appeal to the IMO.  The way to resolve this is through the Labour Relations Commission.  There are two sets of issues tabled here and that is where the process should end.  I appeal to the doctors to go back to the LRC and sort this out in the interests of acquiring proper working conditions but even more in the interests of their patients today, tomorrow and every other day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800019#R00400","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1381244400,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I am delighted that the Taoiseach has our budget proposals.

I understand that the number of NCHDs working shifts in excess of 24 hours decreased from 58% in March 2013 to 34% in August.  That is progress but we must implement the directive in full by the end of next year.<\/p><p>  The establishment of the hospital groups will also empower hospitals to co-operate and share NCHDs when scarcities arise and that will further reduce NCHD hours.  In addition, the Minister set up a group chaired by the president of DCU to carry out a strategic review of the medical training and career structures of NCHDs with a view to retention of the number of graduates in the public health system.  An interim report on that will be produced in November 2013.<\/p><p>  I mentioned the scale of reductions in terms of patient services because of this.  It is already Government policy that those waiting longest should be prioritised and the IMO has confirmed, as the Deputy is aware, that same level of staffing as is normally provided on Sundays will be in place.  Following discussions at the LRC over recent weeks, a joint IMO-HSE verification and implementation process has been proposed.  This has already begun and will continue through October.  Actions to change rosters and revise work practices identified during that process will be implemented in November.  Implementation and achievement of a maximum 24-hour shift would then be jointly verified by the HSE and the IMO.<\/p><p>  After 14 years of doing nothing, the Minister has brought this to a point where, on average, working hours are 52.4 and where we hope that by the end of next year, the working time directive will be implemented in all hospitals.

This morning on my way to the D&aacute;il I stopped by St. Vincent's hospital to speak to some of the non-consultant doctors who are currently on strike.  They told much the same story as I was told 20 years ago.  We all know they do not want more money.  They told me that if their proposal to shorten their working week is accepted, their overall pay will fall.  When I asked them what kind of duties they might perform after spending 36 hours working flat out in a hospital, they said they may have to perform a lumbar puncture or resuscitate patients in the emergency department.  They told me about colleagues who had fallen asleep in operating theatres.  I do not know if the Taoiseach ever worked 36 hours in a row, although I imagine he has.  Having worked that long myself, I know I am not fit to change a light bulb after 36 hours.  Several months ago there was consternation when we sat in the D&aacute;il until 5 a.m.  Somebody pointed out that at 5 a.m., when everybody was blind with tiredness, we were only halfway through the shift of a non-consultant hospital doctor.  Two of the doctors' colleagues tragically committed suicide in the last year.  More than half of our newly qualified non-consultant hospital doctors are leaving the country.  Those who remained have finally mobilised, for which I say \"fair play\".<\/p><p> The crisis was not created by this Government but it presents it with an opportunity to get this right.  Does the Taoiseach accept the need not only to limit the working shift to a maximum of 24 hours but also to impose binding sanctions on the HSE?  The doctors believe there is a lack of credibility, accountability and trust on the part of the HSE.  There has been a breakdown in trust and, therefore, they want binding sanctions.

It may be due to medical procedural reasons of which I am not aware but it is an interesting question because it brings to the attention of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann the fact that while today's strike is nominally about whether sanctions should be applied - personally I think they should - it is also symptomatic of a malaise in the HSE.  The HSE appears to be an organisation with little transparency and huge inconsistencies in how medical professionals and patients are treated.  We all know it is not subject to meaningful parliamentary oversight and it is immune from parliamentary questions.  There is a significant cultural issue which the Government could begin to address.  However, this will require root and branch reform which opens up professional bureaucrats, some of whom are excellent and others are not so excellent, makes what they do transparent and, critically, makes them ultimately accountable to this House.  Does the Taoiseach agree that we have a major issue and, ideally, an opportunity in regard to increasing transparency and accountability in the HSE?<\/p><p>  On today's strike, does the Taoiseach agree with the thrust of the demand for binding sanctions?  Essentially the doctors are agreeing to negotiate but they no longer trust the HSE.  If the deal on the table is a promise by the HSE that it will not make them work longer than 24 hours, does he accept it is reasonable that the doctors no longer accept that promise and, therefore, will he support their call for some form of binding sanction?

Since they cover a range of issues, I was going to tell the Taoiseach that he needed to answer them in a more definitive way.  When he stated that he would take Questions Nos. 1, 6, 16 and 19 together, I was pleased for him until I got his answer.<\/p><p>  The sub-committee on mortgage arrears, no matter how often it has met, is not grasping the fact that the personal insolvency service is deeply flawed and not fit for purpose and that many families in mortgage distress will be barred from using it.  I am delighted that the Taoiseach quoted Sinn F&eacute;in's alternative budget two or three times.  He may have noted that we provided for 100 extra publicly funded personal insolvency practitioners.  They are necessary, as there are 185,201 residential mortgages in distress.  Under the Taoiseach's governance, the number of families in distress has doubled.<\/p><p>  I raised a matter with the Taoiseach last week.  Grant Thornton Debt Solutions, one of the largest personal insolvency practitioners, carried out a study of 1,057 cases of mortgage distress.  It concluded that only one in seven, some 14%, would avail of a personal insolvency arrangement and that 43% of families earned less than the level of reasonable living expenses set by the Insolvency Service of Ireland.  Those families have nothing left with which to pay down their mortgage debts.  Does the Taoiseach accept that, according to the analysis done by Grant Thornton Debt Solutions, this number of people have nothing left?  If they have nothing left, how can they be expected to come out of mortgage distress?<\/p><p>  The main problem is that the banks have been given a veto.  I suggest that the Government should consider having an independent mortgage restructuring panel, one that has teeth, is appointed by the Minister and has the statutory power to agree and impose agreements on lending institutions where it believes that such agreements would enable mortgage holders to remain in their family homes.  I commend this idea to the Taoiseach and ask him to respond positively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800021#T01700","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1381245600,"counter":221,"content":"<p>Deputy Adams is aware that the Government has put in place a whole range of things for mortgages that are in distress.

Out of those, 97,874 were in arrears of more than 90 days.<\/p><p>  What is the position here?  Clearly, the first point of engagement is between the borrower and the lender.  They will not be sorted out unless there is that kind of engagement across a range of options.  That is something that should be taken up by everybody.<\/p><p>  The Deputy talked about having a sort of independent mortgage restructuring operation.  Eighty thousand mortgages have been restructured already.  That is an agreement between the lender and the borrower.  Eighty thousand of them have been restructured.

I understand the Central Bank has to audit all of these figures that have been submitted by the banks to the Central Bank, which is their licensor, if the Deputy knows what I mean.  The indications are that 76%, almost 77%, of those restructured mortgages are actually paying their way and are sustainable, as agreed between the lender and the borrower.

While the banks can disagree with an option that is set out by a practitioner, clearly the last option open is one of bankruptcy, where the banks have no option at all and obviously would lose very heavily.  It is in banks' and lenders' interests to be able to sit down with the borrowers, discuss their circumstances, discuss the situation in which they find themselves and work out a solution.<\/p><p>  Eighty thousand of these have been restructured.  Having spoken recently to the Governor of the Central Bank, the Central Bank must verify and audit the figures that have been submitted by the banks, as I said last week to Deputy Martin.  Nobody can be happy with a situation where this is not happening as quickly as one would like.  I trust that the pressure that is on here now will see that this happens.<\/p><p>  The banks have 4,500 split mortgages, either in trial operations or on offer to customers.  One of the banks the other day made its decision in respect of a reduction in an interest rate on a portion of a mortgage that might be warehoused.  There is a trial going on at the moment.  The split mortgages will be listed in the Central Bank's statistics when they have been operated successfully for a six month period.<\/p><p>  When the Deputy speaks of the bank veto - we dealt with this before - the reality is that it is in the best interests of the debtors and the creditors to seek to conclude an acceptable and workable bilateral arrangement under the personal insolvency legislation, be it by debt settlement arrangement or personal insolvency arrangement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800021#T02200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1381245600,"counter":226,"content":"<p>Why is the Taoiseach against independent adjudication?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800021#T02300","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1381245600,"counter":227,"content":"<p>At the end of the day, the person who borrowed borrowed from a lender.

It is therefore in the interests of lenders to work out an acceptable and agreed sustainable solution.  By that I do not just mean putting it on interest free for another few years.  That is not sustainable in the longer term.  It is necessary to give the insolvency agency a period to see how effective it is.  It has worked well in other jurisdictions and there is no reason why it should not work well here.

The Taoiseach has set his face against any independent mortgage arrears resolution office or household debt resolution office, which we proposed over two years ago.  All the evidence points to the error of the Taoiseach's ways.  He seems to think that lenders will ultimately do what is in the best interests of the person in arrears, but I do not share the Taoiseach's view.  The anecdotal evidence is that the banks, and lenders generally, are moving more towards repossession and surrender of property as the first resort rather than the last.  The Cabinet sub-committee on mortgage arrears has got it fundamentally wrong in terms of its overall strategy.  It has not met often enough.  Does the sub-committee think that is satisfactory?

In that way, every possibility of having a sustainable solution to the problem - and, as the Deputy is aware, all the circumstances are different - can be put on the table.<\/p><p>  The Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, is completely independent.  He has been strong in saying he wants the banks to do more and we all share that view.  The Cabinet sub-committee on mortgage arrears was established to engage, through the Department of Finance, with the banks and the Central Bank so that everybody understands all the options that are on the table and how they can be processed.  It would be great if another 20,000 or 25,000 arrangements were made in addition to the 80,000 already agreed.  <\/p><p>  It is important to wait to see the analysis and audit by the Central Bank of the figures submitted by the banks.

The residents are considering those proposals and I will not transgress on that matter.  They are the type of solutions that some of us suggested two years ago when this scandal came to light.  Yet for two years suffering has been imposed on people while the Government dragged its feet.<\/p><p>  Can the Taoiseach not learn the lesson of the mortgage arrears crisis?  There have already been years of agony for many home-owners who were forced to buy their homes at blackmail prices, in that era of speculators, profiteers and bondholders, as well as governments under their sway.  There were years of agony as the crash inevitably happened.  They have been left with massive negative equity and unsustainable monthly mortgages.  On numerous occasions, I have called for an overall solution, that is, the wiping out of negative equity, calibrating down to the real value of those properties for their owner-occupiers, and calibrating down monthly repayments.  That is the solution which would end the suffering.  It would make the lives of so many people so much better.  In addition, it would release huge new amounts of liquidity funds into the real economy providing jobs and services because people would not be shackled to the banks 24 hours a day, all year round.<\/p><p>  Although, admittedly, there will then probably be a new face in the Taoiseach's position, rather than Deputy Kenny's, will we be back here in two, three or five years with the same suffering?

A number of weeks ago, we looked at this matter seriously.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, made some comments yesterday.  The residents now have the opportunity to discuss the detail of that and make their decision.  I hope that we will not be back here in a few years with the same proposition.<\/p><p>  Reports indicate that the property situation in Dublin and the greater Dublin area is beginning to improve.  I hear of people queuing to see houses or apartments on offer.  I have reports of extensive requirements for public housing in different areas.<\/p><p>That situation is not replicated everywhere in the country but there are some signs of movement.  Negative equity is not an issue for people who do not have a job.  Those who were working and have lost their jobs find themselves in a position of distress.  It is hoped that banks and other lenders will engage constructively in the process of cutting a deal that is sustainable for borrowers and them.  The point made by the Deputy has been made here on many other occasions.  The committee on mortgage arrears is not oblivious to that.  We all want to see a situation whereby solutions are worked out so that people can know with some degree of certainty that they can meet their mortgage repayment requirements while at the same time being able to live their lives.  Nobody wants to go back to the situation to which the Deputy quite rightly referred.<\/p><p> The Deputy can take it that the Cabinet sub-committee dealing with this issue will continue to focus on ensuring that the suite of options put in place are followed through quickly, diligently and fairly so that sustainable solutions to particular problems are found.  This is, and will continue to be, the remit of the Cabinet sub-committee.  It is hoped that when the Governor is in a position to report on the audit of figures submitted by the banks, the targets set out will have been achieved, which targets are rising by each quarter.  I genuinely hope that we get to a point as quickly as possible whereby sustainable solutions will have been put in place for the majority of people, with banks continuing to focus on finding sustainable solutions in the remainder of cases.  <\/p><p> I do not disagree with the principle of the Deputy's point.

Regardless of how many times these warnings are issued, be it by political representatives or ordinary people, they are ignored, the Government permits this activity to continue and nobody is ever held accountable.  I will give an example.  When the Priory Hall issue arose and I heard the name Tom McFeely I knew I had heard it before.  I then recalled that approximately ten years ago when a developer was trying to evict an 84 year old woman and three other residents from a block of flats in Charlemont Street so that he could build an apartment block, myself and a few others gathered with the residents and Charlemont Street community and mounted a 24-hour six week long protest to prevent those evictions and calling on Dublin City Council to, rather than permit this developer to evict people so that he could build an apartment block, take control of that site and construct social housing thereon.  The developer involved was Tom McFeely.  We succeeded and stopped him.  Despite all the bullying and threatening, and his having a court order to evict an 84 year old woman from her home, we forced Tom McFeely to abandon the site and the council to take ownership of it.  We said at that time that we would in the long run save public money.  We should not be facilitating these gangsters.  If we had not succeeded the result would have been another Priory Hall.  What we should be doing is building affordable social housing so that the new market is not dominated by developers like Tom McFeely but we are never listened to.  Even now, we are not being listened to.<\/p><p>  The Government's policy on social housing is to outsource it to the same people, although not Tom McFeely this time but other people like him.  The Government has abandoned the direct provision of social housing and has handed over, as the Taoiseach calls it, the most important market of a roof over the heads of human beings, which is the precondition for civilised existence, to the bankers and developers who got us into the mess we are in.  The Government has also given the bankers the power to veto sustainable mortgage solutions.  After all of the revelations of the past few weeks and given the attitude of the banks, did the Cabinet sub-committee not realise when it met on 30 September that a radical change of policy is necessary?  <\/p><p>  There has been much talk about sustainable solutions.  We have discovered that the banks are trying to bully as much money as possible out of distressed mortgage holders.  That is their strategy and we all know it.  The Taoiseach knows it and I know it.  We know from the deliberations of the Joint Committee on Finance Public Expenditure and Reform that their strategy is to squeeze every penny out of people.  Even those who are forced to give up their homes by handing back their keys are being chased for outstanding money.  There is no willingness on the part of the banks to accept that they must take some hit.  There is also no willingness on the part of Government to enforce that hit on them.  When will we see change?  Are we going to continue to allow the McFeelys and bankers of this world dictate the pace of everything at the expense of ordinary residents?  That is what makes people depressed.  People are depressed that this is allowed to continue.<\/p><p>  I recently discovered there may be a Priory Hall type issue with properties at the Pavilion site in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  I have heard that apartment owners living on the ground floor of the Pavilion apartment development, which some of us opposed and were denounced for doing so, have had to move out because damp rising from below has made them uninhabitable.  There was no regulation.  Despite public opposition, this development was backed by Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il councillors.  How many more tragedies like Priory Hall must there be before we finally wake up and stop these gangsters, opportunists and greed driven people controlling the provision of housing, the roof over the heads of families?  That is what we want to know?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800023#V00200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1381246800,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I am not sure of the Deputy's question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800023#V00300","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1381246800,"counter":242,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach knows it well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800023#V00400","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1381246800,"counter":243,"content":"<p>This is one of a number of scandals across Irish society that was left to this Government to deal with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800023#V00500","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1381246800,"counter":244,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach should not be playing politics with something that is fundamentally wrong in terms of how a local authority regulated.

I ask the Taoiseach to arrange a plenary session of his Cabinet every 21 days to examine in a comprehensive manner the overall situation that obtains.  Two weeks ago, Mr. Sebastian Barnes of the Fiscal Advisory Council, in describing Ireland's sovereign or national debt position as a proportion of national income or gross domestic product, stated we ranked third after Greece and Italy in the debt table.  A very important omission was made from that observation.  The two thirds of the equation that are missing are household debt and non-financial corporate debt, which is business or small and medium enterprise debt.  These are the two elements of the debt problem that weigh most heavily on Ireland.  If one takes all three elements of debt in the economy, one finds that Ireland's debt is the highest in the world.  This is the problem and the reason the banks are caught in paralysis.  Their lack of capital means they are not getting on with the job of writing things down, as Deputy Higgins correctly noted, and they also lack competent board direction and management to articulate the operation of so doing.<\/p><p>  The banks have been drawing out the problem in a slow-motion resistance exercise as they seek to preserve the capital they received following two inadequate capital assessment processes.  The first of these occurred in March 2010, at around the same time as payments were made to bondholders from money borrowed from the euro system, by the Central Bank in the case of Anglo Irish Bank and by the European Central Bank in the case of the two pillar banks because Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland had acceptable assets or loan security.  We must get real about this issue by assembling a robust combat team of negotiators to deal with the euro system and ensure the remaining banks, Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland, can secure creditor buy-in from the euro system for the remaining capital requirements they need to press on with the job.  The two pillar banks also need to have competent experienced managers who can negotiate with customers.<\/p><p>  Professional insolvency practitioners are a new profession and while some of them have experience, others do not, even if they are technically qualified.  To use the analogy of the health of the nation, when a pandemic breaks out doctors cannot fly over cities in helicopters and spray antibiotics or other medicines over the population but will instead engage in case-by-case assessments.  This also holds true for loans.  The lack of evidence that the banks have engaged in the restructuring or sorting out of loans means they do not meet the requirements for performing this task.  In other words, they do not have capital, experienced management and competent direction.  Their boards have been weirdly absent-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800024#W00700","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1381247400,"counter":256,"content":"<p>The Deputy must ask a question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800024#W00800","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1381247400,"counter":257,"content":"<p>I ask the Taoiseach to convene a plenary Cabinet session to discuss these matters and to be advised, in an evidential way, about what is taking place at these levels.<\/p><p>  The Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan, demonstrated that the banks do not have experienced visitation audit or inspection teams.

That deals very much with the previous question.<\/p><p>  The budget is being put together by this EMC, which, as I understand it, is a group of four male Ministers.  The way the Government goes about its business contradicts all the high rhetoric we hear about transparency, openness and political reform.  The budgets have been mean spirited.  I have no sense of the Taoiseach being a mean-spirited person, but these are the types of budgets that have been introduced.  Four men decide to cut child benefit and the entire Cabinet signs off on taking allowances away from people with severe disabilities.  It has cut respite care and imposed a family home tax on tens of thousands who are in mortgage distress.  Labour in government has no notion of equality-proofing a budget and has no notion of looking at the social consequences of the types of measures being introduced.<\/p><p>  I cannot find a way of articulating the reality of 300,000 mostly young people leaving the State with consequent communal and societal damage.  In the 1980s it was only about half that number.  Every week 1,200 to 1,700 young people are leaving and more than 400,000 people are unemployed.  This small group of middle-aged men have no notion of introducing a stimulus and believe that austerity rules.  Austerity is not working - it might work for the elites but it does not work for working folks.  The biggest unemployment burden is carried by young people.  Youth unemployment is huge and there is no real policy response.<\/p><p>  Is it not time to review the Government's budgetary decision-making process and put in place protections?  As we face into this budget no one has legislative protection - the Government can decide to do whatever it wants in terms of cuts and all the rest of it.  I ask the Taoiseach to review those processes.<\/p><p>  I again commend to the Taoiseach Sinn F&eacute;in's budget proposals.  This is not mathematical, but ideological.  The Government can adjust the deficit in a fair and equitable way or it can do it in the way it is doing it.<\/p><p>The reason I raise all of these points is to suggest that there is a better way of going forward, positioned, founded, based and embedded upon equality and fairness as opposed to what we have at this time.

The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, has set out the options or the range he must deal with in terms of taxation measures.<\/p><p>  Deputy Adams will be aware that today the Cabinet approved the general structure for the budget.  This was a matter for discussion with the troika personnel in Brussels, as is normal procedure, but not the detail of the budget - the framework only.  Very good reasons have been set out for this because, as has been mentioned already, with debt going to peak next year it is important that the targets we have set out be achieved, that there be a primary surplus and that the Government takes into account an understanding of the pressure, difficulties and challenges that so many people in our country have to contend with every day.  That is the deliberation for the Cabinet.  The Economic Management Council does not sign off on all the details of the budget; that is a constitutional responsibility of the entire Cabinet.<\/p><p>  I put it to Deputy Adams that his figures are incorrect in respect of emigration.

A formal Cabinet decision was taken to burn bondholders by &euro;6 billion.  Subsequently, the European Central Bank got wind of this and Mr. Trichet, the then Governor, was in touch with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan.  A tense situation unfolded and the Economic Management Council was convened and told about the resistance of the ECB to this measure.<\/p><p>  To the great surprise of the rest of the Cabinet, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, was ten minutes late in making his presentation to the House.  When he arrived in the House he announced the recapitalisation proposals minus the burning of the bondholders, to the astonishment of several Ministers.  The book states that no one noticed that a drama of huge proportions had just taken place.  No one in this House was informed that such had occurred in the hours and days beforehand.  The book states that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, although in Brussels, was especially angry when he learned the news.  Only the members of the Cabinet knew that a different course of action had been decided upon a few days earlier.  The book further states that some wondered about the legality of Noonan's announcement given what the Cabinet itself had agreed and so on.  We have a situation made up of an extraordinary decision-making process involving the Economic Management Council whereby the Cabinet had taken a formal decision that there would be recapitalisation plus burden sharing, which I understand was of the order of &euro;6 billion.  The intervention of the European Central Bank stopped the Government in its tracks but there was no subsequent Cabinet meeting to deal with the ECB's resistance.  Many Ministers were stunned with what had happened.<\/p><p>  I put it to the Taoiseach that there is an urgent need to publish the minutes and work of the council.  Why did the Government not open up on that day in terms of what had happened?  Why was everyone else kept in the dark, including Ministers, in terms of the announcement that the Minister for Finance made that day to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann?  He was ten minutes late.  His speech was hurriedly put together because of all the engagement and threats from Mr. Trichet, who said that if the Government did it, the bomb would go off but it would not go off in Frankfurt.  It would go off in Dublin, he warned.  I call on the Taoiseach to confirm that this occurred.  Why was that withheld from the public for so long?

Such groups appear to get what they want as notwithstanding a certain amount of rhetoric and expressions of concern and sympathy on the Taoiseach's part for the plight of those who are obliged to suffer austerity, when it comes to the bottom line, they get what they want.  Taxes they do not like are not imposed, tax breaks they seek are given and vetoes they seek on mortgages are granted to them.  In short, whatever it is they seek, they get.  On the other hand, ordinary people and civil society organisations, trade unions and so on, plead with the Government year after year and are doing so again this year.  I refer to antipoverty groups that index the worsening crises of poverty, of homelessness, of emigration and of mental health deterioration among huge swathes of the population such is the stress, anxiety and pressure being imposed on them because of the financial straits in which they find themselves.  They plead repeatedly with the Government, say \"no more\" and ask that it not be done to them again.  However, reports in today's newspapers indicate the Government is setting its sights yet again on the most vulnerable.  This is because the Government will not increase corporate tax and will not consider increasing higher taxes for those in receipt of more than &euro;100,000 per year.  Moreover, as it will not impose a financial transaction tax, who else remains?  The only people the Government can attack are the same people it has attacked year after year.  The Taoiseach may put up his hands and may say he is terribly sorry about this, it hurts him more than it hurts them but that is what the Government does.

First, the Economic Management Council has the status of a Cabinet committee and has four members, namely, me, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is not the Cabinet and does not have the collective responsibility of the Cabinet in putting together and agreeing the final details of the budget.  A second Secretary General has been appointed in my Department whose responsibilities include managing support for the Economic Management Council and who deals with that area of support.  Moreover, additional support is provided for the Economic Management Council from within the existing resources of my Department.  They work in close connection with the Departments of Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The role of the council is to manage the Government's programme in respect of economic planning and budgetary matters, the economic recovery programme, including the representation of Ireland internationally with the European Union-European Central Bank-IMF troika, the integration of the work of Departments and agencies in these matters and the co-ordination of banking policy.  This is what the Economic Management Council was set up to do and these are its responsibilities.<\/p><p>  The council provides a forum to discuss strategic issues before they get into Government for decision and like other Cabinet committees, it does not replace the role of the Government, whereby all Ministers have a duty and responsibility to contribute to final decision-making.  It is good practice, on foot of lessons learned from previous mistakes, to have a forum in which relevant Ministers and officials can consider the economic strategy based on the best advantages to the country.  As I stated, the budget for 2014 has not been signed off on or approved by the Cabinet in general and that will happen before Tuesday.

Apart from the action taken by the non-consultant hospital doctors, quite a number of cancellations for surgery have been made between now and the end of the year.  Hospitals are telling their staff to cancel surgeries because of inadequate resources, lack of finances and trying to square the circle before the end of the year.  We got various estimates starting about a month ago as to the potential degree of overruns in the health service.  My primary concern is patient safety and ensuring people get timely operations as planned.  Can the Taoiseach confirm to the House whether there will be a need for a Supplementary Estimate for the health area before the end of the year?  I remember asking the same question at an earlier period last year and the Taoiseach categorically saying &quot;No&quot; but there turned out to be a very substantial one.  I want a straight answer &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; as to whether there will be one this year.<\/p><p>  Mention has been made of the Priority Hall scandal.  The Taoiseach endeavoured to make a political colour of that issue at times and it did him no favours, the fact that he tended to dress it up in some sort of political commentary about the period and all of that.  The reality is there was regulation.  Regulation was enforced in other local authorities, and up to some years ago, I can recall a school, having been completed, not being opened because of the width of a corridor.  The burning question about Priory Hall is who oversaw what within the local authority and who certified what?  Are there any plans to have an inquiry into this to get to the answers as to how fire certificates and a variety of certification that was always required was not produced?  It just did not happen.<\/p><p>  In that context, there is the pyrite levy Bill, which relates to a range of other residents in different scenarios who are also under huge pressure.

He also committed to establishing a Constitutional Convention to consider comprehensive, constitutional reform.  Sinn F&eacute;in put it to him that the convention should be asked to re-imagine Ireland and to bring forward a new Constitution, and he refused to do that.  I also asked the Taoiseach on a number of occasions to put the future of the Seanad and its reform on the cl&aacute;r of the Constitutional Convention, and he refused to do that.<\/p><p>  In light of the result of the referendum at the weekend -  I think the Taoiseach made a hames of that referendum; he took it on as a personal political initiative but then refused to show leadership, refused to debate the issues and did not motivate or mobilise citizens - it is clear that no one can view the referendum result as a vote to retain the Seanad in its current form.  Will the Taoiseach now move with speed to extend the remit of the Constitutional Convention in order that it can discuss and make recommendations on the future of Seanad &Eacute;ireann?  He has said on at least four occasions in the House, including as late as today, that the essence of democracy is that one asks the people.  The convention is a grouping of citizen delegates and the Taoiseach should ask them about this.

Does the Taoiseach agree that it is somewhat regrettable that statements on the result of the referendum are not being taken in the House today?  On the second of the Taoiseach's recent statements, namely, that the D&aacute;il shall hold the Executive to account, I am of the view that one of the political consequences of the referendum result is that the Seanad should be reformed.  Neither I nor the majority of the Irish people believe the Upper House should be retained in its current form.  It is regrettable that we do not have time to take statements.  Rather than the leaders of the various parties and groupings meeting in a particular room, time should be made available for the taking of statements in the D&aacute;il in order that people might outline their views.  Many Government backbenchers have tabled requests for Topical Issue debates on political reform.  Perhaps the latter is borne out of frustration with the fact that the issue to which I refer is not on the agenda for discussion.<\/p><p>  There are more important issues than the reform of the Seanad.

I wonder why that was the case.  These are matters we need to discuss.  It is not just a case of saying that we held a referendum last week and that we should have statements in the D&aacute;il on the matter today.

I believe the problems in the county are replicated in other parts of the country.  A number of years ago, County Meath was served by four ambulances.  This number had decreased to three by 2010.  It was decided earlier this year that just two ambulances would be provided on two days of the week, Tuesday and Friday.  I understand that just one ambulance is now available in the entire county due to significant rostering problems and a lack of overtime provision.  This is happening at a time when there is significant pressure on ambulance services.  Ambulances cannot always go to local hospitals because service reductions mean those hospitals usually have to be bypassed.  It is significant that the call centre for ambulances in the north east is now based in Dublin, rather than being based locally.<\/p><p>  When a woman who lives five minutes from the hospital in Navan had a serious stroke two weeks ago, it took 40 minutes for an ambulance to come from Drogheda, arrive at her house and bring her to the hospital in Navan.  When an infant tragically died at the start of this year, the family had to wait an extended period of time for an ambulance to arrive.  I will mention some other incidents that took place recently.  An ambulance had to come from Ardee, County Louth to deal with a fatal road traffic accident in the south of County Meath.  A serious non-fatal accident on the bad roads of the south west of the county was dealt with by an ambulance from Ardee.  A person in the south of the county who suffered a cardiac arrest had to wait 45 minutes for an ambulance to arrive.  When an eight year old girl in Navan was pinned down by an industrial-sized gate two weeks ago, it took 50 minutes for an ambulance to arrive.  Ambulances are coming from towns like Mullingar and Portlaoise to serve County Meath.  Ambulances occasionally have to travel from County Down into County Louth because the nearest available ambulance to deal with an incident in Dundalk is in Navan.  Recently, a garda had to be asked to drive an ambulance in County Meath because just one member of the ambulance staff was available.  This information has been provided to me by ambulance personnel, fire service personnel and patients.  These people are living in a culture of fear and silence.  They feel afraid to discuss such service breakdowns with local Deputies.  In my view, every citizen should have the constitutional right to consult their Member of Parliament.<\/p><p>  Some months ago, I tabled a parliamentary question asking the Minister to investigate these issues before any further changes were made in the region.  I asked for the key performance indicators from County Meath and the rest of the north-east region to be made available.  The response I received from the Minister referred me on to HIQA and the HSE.  HIQA did not provide me with the key performance indicators because - believe it or not - it does not maintain key performance indicators for the ambulance service on a regional basis.  Anybody who knows anything about management will understand that one cannot manage if one cannot measure.  If the HSE, HIQA, the Minister or the Department of Health do not have the key performance indicators needed to measure the performance of the ambulance service in County Meath or the north east as a whole following these cuts, how is the Minister able to manage the manner in which this critical, front-line emergency service is provided to the people of the county?  I sent an e-mail to the National Ambulance Service 12 days ago to look for the key performance indicators for the region and the county.  When I contacted the service today because it had not acknowledged my letter, I learned that it has not started to look for the information I am seeking.  Will the Minister provide the key performance indicators for the region to the House?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800031#DD01400","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speech","time":1381251600,"counter":488,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  A significant reform programme has been under way in pre-hospital emergency services in recent years.  This is to ensure the best clinical care is provided for the people in each region served by the National Ambulance Service, through the provision of a clinically driven and nationally co-ordinated system that is supported by improved technology.  The programme includes a performance improvement action plan and the development of the intermediate care service, the emergency aeromedical support service and the National Ambulance Service control centre reconfiguration project.  Following discussions between the service and unions, changes are being implemented in rosters in a large number of ambulance stations around the country, including all stations in the former north east area, where the Deputy comes from.  As a consequence of these new rostering arrangements, additional cover will be provided in a number of ambulance stations based on discussions with staff and activity and demand analysis.<\/p><p>  The introduction of new rostering arrangements will progress a number of efficiencies arising from a Labour Court recommendation.  It will address excessive overtime in rostering arrangements and will require the full co-operation of all staff.<\/p><p>The National Ambulance Service has completed an individual and collective consultation process with staff at each station in Louth, Meath, Cavan and Monaghan.  Staff, through their trade union SIPTU have agreed to implement the new rosters.  Although staff and public representatives have raised concerns over claims of reduced cover, the National Ambulance Service has advised this is not the case - in Louth, Meath, Cavan and Monaghan, the new rosters introduced earlier this year will see an increase in cover of 188 rostered hours a week, or approximately 9,800 extra rostered hours a year.<\/p><p> As well as the additional hours, the National Ambulance Service has introduced two rapid response vehicles in Ardee and Trim to augment services further.  Also, as services are provided regionally rather than from single stations, ambulances from adjacent stations provide cover in a dynamic manner, by moving to areas as and where cover is required.<\/p><p> The National Ambulance Service has introduced more resources in tandem with the reorganisation of acute services in the Louth and Meath area.  Extended analysis has identified that demand is in inter-hospital transfers, which have traditionally used emergency ambulances.  In the former north east, this service is operating from Cavan, Castleblayney and Dundalk ambulance stations.  The National Ambulance Service has also implemented additional intermediate care capacity in Louth.  The ongoing introduction of intermediate care services allows the release of existing emergency ambulance resources back to emergency uses.  These and other changes being implemented at local, regional and national levels will continue to move the ambulance service in the right direction - a national service, providing the best clinical care for the needs of the people in each region it serves.  Emergency resources and staff are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, ensuring the people of the north east have timely access to highly skilled paramedic and advanced paramedic staff day or night.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800031#DD01500","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381252200,"counter":490,"content":"<p>Ours is, to a certain extent, a disjointed conversation, Minister.  There is no doubt that resource efficiencies are needed.  I support efficiencies in any manner they can be procured as long as they do not have a negative effect on patients.  I have requested from the Minister for Health, HIQA, the Health Information and Quality Authority, and the National Ambulance Service on previous occasions and again from the Minister today, key performance indicators to show the ambulance service's response time for life and death emergency situations in the north east.  I ask again that the Minister provide those to the House as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that I provide the Minister for Health with key performance indicators of patients and citizens who have come to me and shown me that the performance of the service falls outside the HIQA guidelines.  The Minister mentioned there is a rapid response unit in Trim.  HIQA guidelines say that treatment should be available to echo or delta patients in eight minutes but there needs to be an ambulance to transport the patients to a hospital in the 18-minute target.  The ambulance service is not achieving those performance indicators in the north east.<\/p><p>  The views of the National Ambulance Service and its staff are at polar opposites - one could not find two more divergent analyses of the situation in the region.  We can talk about who said this and who said that, but the only way to cut through the issue and to enable the Minister to manage the funding of the region better is for local key performance indictors to be provided.

There are - as there always have been - problems in the ambulance service.  According to my briefing note, the relatively high absenteeism rate rather than a lack of vehicle resources is an issue.  Although the absenteeism is being addressed by the National Ambulance Service's management, unforeseen and short-notice absence presents challenges for emergency provisions, which are dealt with through regional resource utilisation, deployment and call prioritisation.<\/p><p>  It was recently reported that a garda was driving an ambulance.

In making my points, I know that I will receive a historical lecture about why we are where we are.  However, we are in a difficult position because commitments have been made by the HSE, Health and Safety Executive, to address the issue.  The HSE's service plan 2013 highlighted that it would make efforts to address European working time directive issues.  I want to know why we are at the stage that the IMO and non-consultant hospital doctors have no trust or faith in the HSE and its commitment to resolve the issue.  It is required only to fulfil employment law and ensure that people work in a safe environment, are allowed periods of rest and work only in a roster in which services can be provided safely.  When one looks at the history of the situation and, more important, the past couple of months with the breakdown of trust between the HSE and the IMO, many questions are raised.<\/p><p>  The matter has been before the Labour Relations Commission - in fairness, it has huge expertise in bringing about resolutions to industrial disputes and has been doing so for many years - but the fact that it was unable to bring about a resolution raises many questions about why the HSE has not entered into meaningful dialogue in such a way that would allow non-consultant hospitals doctors to believe the HSE's commitment.  Given the HSE's role and that the Minister is in charge of and politically responsible for the HSE, does he completely trust the HSE on its commitments to implement the European working time directive for non-consultant hospital doctors? <\/p><p>  There are huge strains in the medical service.  The non-consultant hospital doctors are an integral part of the medical service - they provide hugely valuable services daily.  However, they are working under extreme conditions.  We have seen and heard cases - today we saw people outside our hospitals who have worked more than 80 hours a week in providing healthcare.  Everyone accepts that is happening.  Even the Minister said previously that working arrangements are in breach of European working time directives and are completely unacceptable.<\/p><p>  The HSE stated its position on the working time directive in its 2013 service plan, but today there are 3,000 non-consultant hospital doctors who have had to take action to encourage dialogue and a resolution to the situation.<\/p><p>The difficulty is that there are significant swathes of people who depend on the health system and non-consultant hospital doctors to provide the care.  A total of 12,000 outpatient and 3,000 elective surgeries have been deferred.  This puts significant pressure on individuals.  Were 3,000 procedures deferred today because of this action?

I urge everybody to go back to the LRC to see if this issue can be resolved but in the meantime, as political head of the HSE, the Minister must surely ask the HSE why trust has broken down and tell us whether he has faith in it in respect of how it has negotiated so far with the IMO on behalf of NCHDs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800033#FF00300","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1381252800,"counter":497,"content":"<p>The Deputy talks about a historical lecture because he does not want to be reminded of the true history-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800033#FF00400","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1381252800,"counter":498,"content":"<p>No, the Minister can remind me but he only has four minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800033#FF00500","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1381252800,"counter":499,"content":"<p>I will not focus on that but I will come to it later because it is important.  What is really important is for me to say that I share people's concerns about this action, the disruption to the delivery of acute care and the unnecessary worry and anxiety caused to patients.  I will correct the figures out there.  I do not have absolute accuracy but no more than 7,400 patients have been affected by this.  That is 7,400 more patients than should have been affected because this action will not help the situation.<\/p><p>  I believe junior doctors have a right to reasonable working hours and that patients have a right to feel safe in their care.  I do not believe it is safe to have doctors working the sort of hours they have been asked to work in the past.  We all must work together towards reaching a safe solution.  The point is that we have made major progress in tackling this long-standing problem, and a long-standing problem it is, as the Taoiseach said earlier.  There is a report from 2001, commissioned by Fianna F&aacute;il's leader, Deputy Martin, in January 2001 at a cost of &euro;254,000, and here we are in 2013.  <\/p><p>  At my request, the HSE established a national group in February 2013 to bring an urgent focus to implementation of the working time directive.  I have met with Commissioner Andor on a number of occasions in respect of this.  This group has made progress on the number of doctors working more than 24 hours in a single shift and instances of doctors working more than 68 hours a week.  The average number of hours of NCHDs is now declining.  Previous surveys have shown that average working hours for NCHDs fell from 60 hours a week in 2009 - notwithstanding the fact that the initial report in 2001 wanted them under 48 - to 54 hours a week in 2012.  During the first six months of this year, the number fell to 52.4.  I am not saying this is enough.  It must come down the rest of the way.  Furthermore, the proportion of NCHDs working shifts in excess of 24 hours has fallen from 58% in March 2013 to 34% in August 2013.  It is still too many and more must and will be done but we are making serious progress.  In addition, I set up a group chaired by the president of DCU to carry out a strategic review of the medical training and career structure of NCHDs with a view to improving retention of graduates in the public health system.  An interim report is to be provided in November.<\/p><p>  The establishment of the hospital groups will empower hospitals to co-operate and share NCHDs when scarcities arise.  This will further reduce average NCHD hours. <\/p><p>  Compliance issues arise largely in particular specialties.  Virtually all NCHDs in radiology, emergency medicine and psychiatry are fully compliant.  Following discussions at the LRC over recent weeks, a joint IMO-HSE verification and implementation process has been proposed.  This has already begun and will be proceeding during October.  Actions to change rosters and revise work practices identified during this process will be implemented during November.  Implementation and achievement of a maximum 24-hour shift would then be verified jointly by the HSE and IMO.<\/p><p>  There is clearly going to be a reduction in planned patient attendances.  It is estimated that cancellations will arise in respect of about 7,000 outpatient appointments.  The patients deferred are being offered the earliest possible re-attendance dates.  It is already Government policy that those waiting longest for treatment should be prioritised.  The IMO has confirmed that the same level of staffing cover as is normally provided on a Sunday will be in place.  It has also undertaken to provide all necessary urgent care as well as oncology, dialysis and transplantation.<\/p><p>  We are very keen to resolve this issue and to have clear sanctions in place.  The HSE has invited the IMO back to the LRC tomorrow to discuss all manner of sanctions.  I have already made a statement that I want to see the sanctions aimed at those who have failed - not patients, doctors or hospitals themselves but rather the management that fails to deliver.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800033#FF00600","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1381252800,"counter":500,"content":"<p>The report was commissioned in 2001 and it is now 2013.  We have not had a junior doctors' strike in 25 years but we have one today.  That is the difficulty.

We now have a situation where over 3,000 NCHDs are outside our hospitals today and it is impacting on the delivery of health care.<\/p><p>  We all accept that junior doctors have an integral role to play in the provision of health care in this country.

I accept that all this is very positive but in the meantime, there has been a fundamental breakdown in trust and I am asking the Minister to tell me why this has happened.  Is it because the HSE is dragging its feet?  Is it because management in some areas of the HSE is not co-operating in terms of addressing the working time directive because it is being implemented in some hospitals?  In these hospitals, rostering is being implemented to accommodate and comply with the working time directive but we do not have that in other areas.  <\/p><p>  Clearly, the HSE has a major problem in trying to deal with this and trust between the two sides has completely broken down.  The key question is why this is the case.  Does the Minister have full confidence in the HSE and does it have his full support in dealing with this issue because it is critically important?  The NCHDs do not have faith in the HSE and have expressed that on a number of occasions.  They do not believe there is a commitment to sanctions for those hospitals that fail to implement the working time directive.

We do not have money to throw at it, as Deputy Kelleher knows for reasons well known to everyone in this country, but we are reforming the system to address the issue of giving doctors safe working practices so they can deliver safety for their patients.<\/p><p>  Deputy Kelleher acknowledged that some hospitals are compliant and yet all hospitals are affected by this.  This is an understandable expression of frustration by NCHDs about what they see as inhuman working hours, the lack of a clear career path and facing exhaustion when it is unclear what they will have to show for it.  It is so difficult to ensure becoming a specialist in this country with our training times taking on average 12 years, which is far too long.  <\/p><p>  Deputy Kelleher asked me whether I had faith in the HSE and its management of this situation.

Is it still possible to implement these reforms?  One of the proposals was to focus on issues of major strategic and political importance, including public accounts, financial matters, the budget, EU scrutiny and social affairs.

The people have now spoken and we will have to listen to what they said.  However, we should not lose sight of the need for reform of the D&aacute;il.

I am a member of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which deals with matters as diverse as the restoration of the sugar industry in Ireland and fairness in the grocery sector.  There is great scope for improvement in this regard because committees do not get the credit they deserve.

The priority for the Government needs to be reforming this House so that the reforms are more tangible and our business can be done more easily.  The people want reform.

We must consider every possible avenue in this regard.  We could start with something small like the Order of Business, the remit of which needs to be expanded.  Limiting it to promised legislation is not enough.  Given Prime Minister's questions across the water in the UK, there is no reason for our Order of Business not to include something similar.

In such a scenario, the existing Seanad panels could be replaced by new panels organised along the lines of the directorates of the EU, for example, agriculture, innovation, research, health, etc.  Senators could be elected for terms coinciding with the European Commission, with every citizen receiving a vote.

As I have often stated, Friday sittings are just time-consuming efforts.  We do not have a vote and we normally only debate one Bill.  Proposals have been made to provide for additional Bills to be tabled on Fridays, but it is difficult for a backbencher to get a Bill on which he or she has worked onto the Order Paper.  A number of the Bills on the Order Paper, particularly on Tuesdays, have been outstanding since the D&aacute;il's first sitting in 2011.  This issue must be tackled.  Just as Private Members' business can be used to debate Bills, perhaps we can move back bench Bills from Friday and discuss them in a private Bills session, allowing us to vote at that time.  I hope that some consideration will be given to this suggestion.<\/p><p>  I wish the reform of the committee structure to continue.  It is important that civil society be involved in the initiation of legislation.  We saw the success of that process during the abortion Bill.

I was with family members on Saturday.  They were trying to console me about the result.  As one of them pointed out to me, people came out on a reform question.  Whether by voting \"Yes\" or \"No\", they were taking part in that process of reform.  They just had a different vision of it.  Some 40% came out to do that.  It is not a large number and we would have liked to have seen more, but 40% of the population are engaged and involved in the question of how we reform our Parliament to make it better.  This is a positive that both sides can take away from the referendum result.<\/p><p>  As a new Government and a new Parliament, we have a responsibility to rebuild the people's trust in their politicians, their leaders and their political institutions.  We do that in deeds, not in words - by their works shall they be known.  Putting the question to the people formed a part of that process.  We made a commitment on which we followed through.  We now have an advantage.  With so many interested in reform and willing to spend time and resources in trying to shape that vision and in moving forward quickly, it would be a shame were we to delay the process of D&aacute;il reform because we took time to reflect on Seanad reform.  The processes could work side by side.  For example, some of the reforms that have been mentioned in this debate - a loosening of the Whip on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il - would impact on the Seanad because Senators sit on those very same committees.  If the ordering of the D&aacute;il's business was returned to its Members in a non-Whipped vote in some instances, for example, the length of time for a Bill to be debated or its scheduling, it would flow down to the Seanad.  Many such proposals do not need referendums or new laws and could be implemented quickly.  I look forward to the reforms that will be made.

This is always about time and the capacity for everybody to have an opportunity to say their piece in respect of D&aacute;il reform.  Over the years, I have seen situations where Ministers came in to answer questions.  The Minister for Agriculture might be in possession for six months before anybody else because the questions just kept rolling through.  Thus, a Minister might answer from September or October right through until March.  We have made a lot of changes and there have also been some good suggestions, some of which are already under way.  I want Deputies to understand that I am serious about this matter.  What we introduce for this session and the next is not permanent.  We would like to have a situation whereby we try things and see how they can work in the best interests of all Deputies.  When we do make changes they are, of necessity, to be tried and we will continue with those that work best.  That is why we have Leaders' Questions on Thursdays, which the T&aacute;naiste takes.  Topical Issues have replaced the outdated and outmoded Adjournment Debate.  Friday sittings are for Deputies to introduce their own Bills, and we have never had that before, except in Private Members' time.  It is a good innovation.<\/p><p>  I am open to the question Deputy Lawlor raised about Friday sittings.  Who attends and do we have real debates on Committee Stage of Bills?  We could always put the votes off until Tuesday if necessary.  There is always a problem with Deputies from around the country who are not able to attend the House on Fridays.  It is an issue that has always been raised by them.<\/p><p>  I assure Deputies concerning the restructuring of the Oireachtas committees that we want to continue with the pre-legislative review.  The engagement with civic society is important, as was evidenced in a number of Bills recently.  As regards Deputy Kyne's point, that will not be watered down.  It will require the engagement of Ministers with Opposition spokespersons.  Committee chairmen will ask how many hearings are needed and how long they will last.  They are not dictated to by government.  The chairman and other members of the committee will decide what organisations and individuals to call to provide experience whatever the case might be.  Some Bills are short, comprising a few lines of amendment, so they may not require any hearings at all.  By contrast, the Companies Bill had 1,800 sections and was five years in gestation.  That was a very different matter.  Bills, therefore, can range from being simple to complex.  That system of scrutiny will not be watered down.  Committee chairs will have a role in engaging with civic society.<\/p><p>  We also want to move on so that committees can examine the stability programme update in respect of the budget.  When the forthcoming budget is over, I expect the committees will engage with Ministers on departmental Votes and Estimates, as well as what their spending priorities are and how effective that expenditure will be.  Hopefully, this will all be televised and streamed live so that the public is fully engaged on what is being spent on their behalf by different Departments.<\/p><p>  I would like to think that we can arrive at a situation whereby chairmen and Opposition spokespersons can work with Ministers on Bills.  Unless it is emergency legislation, it should not be rushed.  I wish to allow for proper debate here but I do not want people to play games and seek extra time just for the sake of it.  It must be recognised that this is the D&aacute;il and it is the Opposition's duty to hold the Government to account.  We must provide people with the facilities to do that. <\/p><p>  We had committee weeks before and they did not work.  We may look at that again.  We devoted a week to particular committees in the Chamber as distinct from being in committee rooms.  People said they liked it but it did not work.<\/p><p>  Deputies have raised valid points.  Some people mentioned the Whip vote but I have been in Governments where there was a minority situation, or very close to it.  One cannot have instability.  What might be one person's crisis of conscience is another's political crisis.  I see an opportunity when the heads of a Bill are being discussed on Committee Stage whereby people could give their view irrespective of whether it is in accordance with Government philosophy or not.  When one signs on for a Government Bill as Government Members, one will be expected to support that.  The issue of stability is important for international investors when they look at the country.  In a tight future election outcome, for example, people may ask whether the Government will be able to continue in office.  Without stability, one cannot have investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800036#JJ00200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1381254600,"counter":517,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for his response.

We are serious about being a reforming Government, from corporate donations to gender quotas and the perks, etc., of the past, which will ensure Parliament is seen to be more effective.  This is about getting the business done here and in committee.  I am serious about proving that our committee system can work far more effectively than ever before.  This will be done through engagement with the public and civic society, as already proposed.<\/p><p>  On Deputy Deering's point, we can look again at the possibility of having a committee week.  I favour this but many Deputies do not for a variety of reasons.  We have had committee weeks before.  We could, for example, take Leaders' Questions, the Order of Business and so on in the morning and then move to the committee week.  This is done to great effect in the European Parliament.  The process is well controlled there.  As I said, while I favour this, many others do not.  I will undertake to look at it again.<\/p><p>  On Deputy Griffin's question in relation to the budgetary process, the Government submits a stability programme update to the European Commission every April.  This allows for it to be reviewed by Members of the Houses in committee prior to the budget in October.  The Department of Finance and Independent Fiscal Advisory Council provides briefing to Oireachtas Members in this regard.  The budget and spending Estimates are published in October.  Members of committees can then between October and Christmas and prior to any moneys being spent engage with Ministers in regard to their priorities in terms of spending.  This is also in the public interest.<\/p><p>  Deputy Harrington referred to the heads of Bill discussions in committee.  We will ensure this happens.  I see this as a fundamentally important part of the process.  The Deputy will be aware that for years we have had a process whereby a Minister makes a decision to introduce a Bill, which is then prepared by the Parliamentary Counsel's office and returned to Government with nobody having any say on it until it reaches Committee Stage.  If we reverse that process and have everybody involved from the beginning, we would probably save a lot of time on Committee Stage.<\/p><p>  On the introduction of business hour sittings, many people here have families and long distances to travel, including the staff of the Houses.  We must cater for everybody.  I thought the introduction of earlier sittings would mean getting home earlier to family members and so on.

However, I have been in this House on umpteen occasions when voting was tight and people because of a crisis of conscience voted against the Government, resulting in it falling.  I refer the Deputy to the recent rise in interest rates when a Minister for Finance in Europe resigned.  Instability is the biggest cause of mistrust by investors.  They will not have sentiment, sympathy or memory.  They do not react, they anticipate.  A country in which there is instability loses that trust in terms of growing its economy.  These are issues about which we must be, and will be, serious in the time ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800037#KK00300","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Forestry Bill 2013: Order for Second Stage","time":1381255200,"counter":526,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800037#KK00400"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1381255200,"counter":527,"content":"<p>Bill entitled an Act to make further and better provision in relation to forestry; to provide for the development and promotion of forestry in a manner that maximises the economic, environmental and social value of forests within the principles of sustainable forest management; to confer power on the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to make regulations for the effective management of the forestry sector; to make further provision for the giving effect to Acts of the institutions of the European Union by regulation made by that Minister in respect of forestry and forestry-related activities; to repeal the Forestry Act 1946; to amend the Wildlife Act 1976; to amend the Agriculture Appeals Act 2001; to amend the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 and to provide for related matters.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1381255200,"counter":528,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That Second Stage be taken now.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800037#KK00600","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1381255200,"counter":529,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Forestry Bill 2013: Second Stage","time":1381255200,"counter":530,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800037#KK00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1381255200,"counter":531,"content":"<p>I move: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"<\/p><p>  I am pleased to have the opportunity to introduce the Forestry Bill 2013 and look forward to Members' constructive discussion and comment on its provisions.  The purpose of this Bill is to reform and update the legislative framework relating to forestry.  It will support the development of a modern forest sector, which operates in accordance with good forest practice and with a view to protection of the environment. <\/p><p>  As Members are no doubt aware, the current regulatory regime, underpinned by the Forestry Act 1946, has been in place for 67 years.  Considerable progress has been achieved within the forestry sector during this period.  There have also been many technological, scientific and regulatory developments in the intervening period.  Key among these has been the recognition that forests are a multi-functional resource with economic, social and environmental benefits.<\/p><p>  As Minister of State with responsibility for forestry, I need to ensure there is an appropriate balance between the various interests.  One of the objectives of the Bill is to promote and facilitate the growth and sustainability while at the same time having regard to protection of the environment and maintenance of the social benefits and other public goods that forests provide.  This Bill is about forestry and good forest practice.  It is not about Coillte.  Its provisions are applicable to public and private forest owners.<\/p><p>  It is important to stress that the intention of the Bill is not to add to the administrative burden on landowners or other stakeholders in the forest sector but to streamline and simplify the various processes.  This will benefit not only the forest sector, but the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which is responsible for the administration and regulation of forestry.  I can assure Deputies that the systems that will be put in place by the Department will be as user-friendly as possible and that this legislation will place no unreasonable demands on anybody.  Where regulations are to be introduced, I will facilitate prior consultation with the relevant stakeholders.<\/p><p>  I will expand on the individual features of the Bill later.  I would first like to briefly outline for the information of the Members of the House the importance of forestry to farmers, the economy and society.  It is useful to put Irish forestry into context, in terms both of size and its contribution to the economy.<\/p><p>  By the early 1900s, forest cover in Ireland had been reduced to just 1%.<\/p><p>This contributed to the need to regulate felling by the introduction of the Forestry Acts 1928 and 1946, which ensured that existing forest cover was maintained.  The area of the national forest estate is now slightly more than 730,000 ha or nearly 11% of the total land area.  While the forest estate has expanded significantly since the early 1980s with the introduction of grant schemes aimed at encouraging private landowners, mainly farmers, to become involved in forestry, the figure for Ireland is still relatively low compared to our European Union counterparts given that nearly 40% of total land in the EU is under forest cover.<\/p><p> Of the national forest estate, more than 54% is in public ownership, mainly through Coillte Teoranta, with the remaining 46% in private ownership.  This contrasts with the position 20 years ago when 70% of the forest estate was in public ownership and 30% in private ownership.  There are more than 19,000 private forest owners nationwide, the majority of whom are farmers.  Forestry is a growing sector and vibrant processing sector and a modern harvesting and transport operation.  The growing forestry industry comprises many small and medium-sized enterprises which service Ireland's woods and forests, including forest nurseries, foresters, forestry companies and forestry contractors.<\/p><p> The processing sector includes sawmills and panel board mills that rely on the growing forestry industry as a source of raw material.  Nine large to medium-sized fully automated sawmills process in excess of 90% of current supply, while three board mill processing industries utilise a combination of small round wood, recycled wood and wood waste.  Sawmills and board mills have a strong export focus and in value terms, exports of wood products reached &euro;303 million in 2012.<\/p><p> Wood fuel harvesting and processing are also expanding as forests enter the production phase.  The harvesting and transport sector forms the essential link between the grower and the processing sector.  Total employment in the forestry sector is estimated to be in the region of 12,000 persons.  The sector generates considerable economic activity and benefits in the wider economy, especially in rural communities.<\/p><p> As I indicated, farmers now undertake the bulk of new planting, which they regard as a realistic and viable land use option.  The afforestation grant covering the entire initial cost of planting of the trees, coupled with an annual tax-free premium of up to &euro;515 per hectare for up to 20 years, is an attractive option for farmers, many of whom would have been traditionally reluctant to plant trees on agricultural land.  Forestry offers a substantial income to the landowner, both annually and in the medium to long term, through the availability of thinnings and output from final harvest.  Other non-monetary factors must also be taken into account, including the way in which various farming and forestry enterprises complement each other, the type of land and how labour intensive and time consuming an enterprise is, especially if the farmer is also working part-time off the farm.<\/p><p> Since my appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for forestry, I have availed of as many opportunities as I could to visit forest plantations, nurseries and timber processing facilities to see at first hand the work involved.  I have also met with a number of representative groups, including forest owner producer groups.  The forestry sector has developed significantly in recent decades and it is appropriate that the legislative framework be updated to facilitate the further development of our forest resource.<\/p><p> I will now address the Bill's main provisions to give Members a general outline of its scope and the way in which the proposed system of regulation will work in practice.  Deputies will appreciate that many of the provisions are standard or technical legal provisions which do not require further clarification.  Part 1 contains a number of general provisions, including the Short Title, commencement, interpretations and rules governing the laying of documents before the Houses of the Oireachtas, service of documents and expenses of the Minister. <\/p><p> Section 2 contains the important definitions which determine the scope of the Bill.  It is of necessity an extensive list that draws on many aspects of forest operations and practices, including the various laws and directives, both national and European Union, relating to planning and environmental considerations that must be adhered to by the State and operators involved in forestry.  Given the potential impact that forestry can have on the environment, it is important that regard be had to these requirements.<\/p><p> In Part 2, the functions of the Minister, both general and specific, are set out in some detail.  The general functions in section 5 include a range of promotional responsibilities relating to forestry, including afforestation, good forest practice that maintains the biological diversity of forests, the promotion of knowledge and awareness of forestry through education and training and the development and marketing of a quality based processing sector.  The Minister's general functions also include the regulation and monitoring of forest operations to ensure forests are properly managed and protected from harmful pests, diseases and invasive species. <\/p><p> The specific functions of the Minister are set down in section 6.  The primary ministerial functions are the granting of licences, such as felling licences, approval of forest management plans and the attaching of conditions to such licences and approvals.  While I appreciate the powers are wide-ranging, this is standard for primary legislation.  The purpose is to set parameters for years to come.  Regulation of forestry activities is essential to minimise environmental damage and maintain the existing forest estate and, in so doing, protect the investment by the State in the afforestation programme.  It also enables the Minister to produce and implement guidelines, codes of practice and standards for good forest practice.<\/p><p> An important feature of this section is the granting of powers to the Minister to give legislative effect to those guidelines and standards which cover a range of environmental considerations, extending from water quality to the protection of species such as the red squirrel and freshwater pearl mussel.  While the powers in this section are wide-ranging, all future regulation will be the subject of widespread consultation before decisions are made. <\/p><p> Section 7 elaborates on the technical aspects of the Minister's powers relating to the granting of licences and approvals, including the setting of conditions, extension of such licences and approvals and their suspension or revocation.<\/p><p> Section 8 allows the Minister to appoint committees to assist and advise in the performance of his or her functions.  This will include the delegation to a committee of certain functions, subject to the Minister retaining overall responsibility and accountability.  Issues concerning the confidentiality of the work of the committee and responsibility of members are set down in section 9.<\/p><p> In a long-term activity such as forestry, which can create substantial and lasting change, good planning is essential to ensure that forest operations are undertaken with minimum impact on the environment and social and economic fabric of the areas in which they occur. <\/p><p>When the Forestry Act 1946 was enacted, commercial forestry was almost entirely State controlled, a situation which has now changed radically.  The emphasis in the Bill on forest management plans is to provide guidance to farmers, some of whom have little forestry experience, on the long-term management of their forests.  Section 10 enables the Minister to require forest owners to submit a forest management plan in support of applications for consented activities.  Such plans would cover felling, including thinning, reforestation, forest road works and other forestry-related activities such as amenity and recreational use of forests.  The forest management plan will also provide a mechanism whereby an application for a felling licence may be incorporated within the plan thus allowing for a flexible, responsive and timely system for dealing with activities such as thinning.  As I pointed out earlier in my address, the purpose of the legislation is to simplify processes and not to add to the administrative burden.  The requirements for management plans will, therefore, reflect this objective and no unreasonable demands will be placed on anyone.<\/p><p> Part 3 of the Bill provides for protection of the environment when any forestry activity is being planned.  Approval of all forestry schemes and licences is dependent on continued protection of the environment.  There are consultation processes in place with a range of stakeholders including the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Inland Fisheries Ireland, An Taisce, local authorities and the general public.  There are also guidelines on matters such as water quality, landscape, biodiversity, archaeology and on sensitive species.  Approximately 18% of the land area of Ireland is designated by Europe as special areas of conservation, SACs, or special protection areas, SPAs.  There are also additional Irish designations such as natural heritage areas, NHAs, and national parks.  Forest activities may be constrained in these designated areas.<\/p><p> Section 11 requires the Minister to have regard to the social, economic and environmental functions of forestry; to follow good forest practice; and to take particular account of the potential impact of forestry activities on different habitats and species in forests.  Activities occurring within designated areas, or that have the potential to impact on such areas, must be screened for any adverse impact.  Where it is considered that the activity has the potential to impact adversely on the designated area, the Minister will require the completion of an assessment of the impact of the forestry activity on the habitat, plant life, birds or animals so affected.<\/p><p> Sections 12 and 13 are technical provisions that place an onus on forest owners to notify the Minister if their forest is damaged or destroyed and also give the Minister the power to require information from forest owners and wood processing businesses for statistical or investigative purposes.<\/p><p> Section 14 is important in the context of forest protection.  The years 2010 and 2011 were among the worst on record for land and forest fires in Ireland with many forest fires being caused by the burning of furze and scrub which spread to nearby forests.  The forest estate suffered over 3,000 ha of damage during those two years.  This provision allows the Minister to serve a notice on a landowner to remove vegetation from uncultivated land that is posing a threat to an adjoining forest or to authorise persons to enter the land and remove the vegetation.<\/p><p> Section 15 deals with the control of species such as grey squirrels and rabbits where they pose a threat to forests, and generally restates an existing provision in the Forestry Act 1946.  It allows the Minister to serve notice on landowners requiring them to take specified action to protect trees from damage.  Where land is unoccupied or the owner fails to comply with such notice, the Minister may authorise a person to enter the land and deal with the particular species.<\/p><p> Part 4 of the Bill deals with the important issue of felling licenses.  The current licence system operated under the Forestry Act 1946 is now considered cumbersome given the needs of a modern forestry sector.  There are currently two types of felling licence - a general felling licence and a limited felling licence.  The Bill proposes to simplify the process by replacing the two existing licences with a single felling licence, the application for which will be made to the Minister in a specified format.  There will no longer be a requirement for a person to lodge an application for a felling licence at the nearest Garda station.  The licence will be valid for a period of up to ten years, which is a very significant development, as the existing legislation does not permit extension beyond five years.<\/p><p> When the Minister grants a licence, he or she may impose conditions including whether the land should be replanted.  As one of the primary purposes of the afforestation programme is to maintain and increase the national forest area, the removal of the replanting requirement will only be considered in the most exceptional of cases.  Unlicensed felling will continue to be an offence with penalties, on summary conviction, of &euro;200 for every tree removed and-or imprisonment for six months.  On conviction on indictment, penalties ranging to a maximum of &euro;1 million and-or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years may be imposed.  These penalties are at the higher end of the scale reflecting the seriousness of the offence and the need for dissuasive measures to ensure that the forest estate is protected.<\/p><p> There are, however, a number of exemptions to the requirement for a felling licence listed in section 18 of the Bill.  These include all trees within an urban area, trees that must be removed for public safety reasons, including in the aftermath of an accident, or to prevent the spread of fire, pests or disease; Christmas trees; and trees uprooted in a registered forest nursery for the purpose of transplantation.  An important exemption from the licensing requirement, and one which will be welcomed by many landowners, is that they will be able to remove for their own use on the holding up to 15 cu. m of wood in any 12-month period, provided the trees are outside a forest and do not from part of a decorative avenue or ring of trees on the holding.  The purpose of this is to allow farmers to exploit their wood resources for their personal use as a fuel source, for fencing or other purposes on the farm, in a limited and manageable way that continues to protect the natural beauty and landscape value of their holding.  Notwithstanding the exemptions, the Bill in section 19 also enables the Minister to issue an order prohibiting the felling or removing of any tree, with penalties for those who do not comply.<\/p><p> With a view to ensuring that the conditions of a felling licence or a replanting order are respected, it is intended in section 20 to allow the Minister notify the Property Registration Authority, PRA, of the granting of a licence or the imposition of a replanting order so that these can be registered as a burden in the case of registered land and a deed where the land is unregistered.  This will protect the purchaser of forestry land.  Once the conditions of the licence or the order are satisfied, the Minister, on such notification by the owner, will inform the registering authority of the discharge of the burden or compliance with the conditions.<\/p><p> Many of the provisions of the Bill impose obligations on owners and other parties engaged in forestry activities and the enforcement provisions in Part 5 are vital to ensure compliance with those requirements.  Section 21 allows the Minister to appoint authorised officers to enforce the various statutory provisions.  These officers are normally departmental forestry inspectors.  The powers of authorised officers are listed in detail in section 22 of the Bill.<\/p><p>They include the power of entry on to lands to inspect and remove, if necessary, any material considered a risk to trees and to remove records or other information relevant to the inspection or investigation.  I will not elaborate further on the powers since the purpose and content of this provision is self-explanatory.<\/p><p> An important innovation is the provision in section 23 that allows an authorised officer to impose a fixed payment notice on an individual who, he has reasonable grounds for believing, has unlawfully felled or removed a tree or trees without a licence.  In circumstances where the notice is imposed and paid by the offender within a specific period and where he consents to a replanting order, the person will not be prosecuted in the courts.  This is an important improvement in the enforcement of the laws relating to illegal felling.  It will remove the necessity for costly court cases and criminal convictions for minor offences while continuing to act as a deterrent to potential offenders.<\/p><p> Section 24 empowers the Minister to charge for licences and other services provided by the legislation.  It is a matter of policy whether the Minister should charge for such services and its inclusion in the Bill should not be interpreted as a statement of intent at this point.<\/p><p> One of the important tenets of sustainable forest management is the regeneration of forests following felling.  The licensing system outlined in the Bill is built on the premise that save in exceptional circumstances, forests that are felled must be replanted.  Where illegal felling has occurred it is important, therefore, that the Minister has the power to impose an order on the offender compelling him to replant the area or an equivalent area within his ownership.  Part 6, section 25 provides the Minister with such powers and makes it an offence if the offender fails to comply with the order.<\/p><p> Part 7 deals with offences and penalties and encompasses an extensive list of such offences in section 26.  Offences range from submitting false or misleading information in support of an application for approval or a licence, to failure to comply with notices or other conditions or requirements.  Important provisions include causing irremediable damage to a tree or intentional or reckless setting fire to trees.  The penalties in section 26 range from &euro;200 for damaging or removing a tree, to fines of up to &euro;1 million and five years imprisonment for conviction on indictment of felling or removing trees without a licence.  The penalties applicable, ranked according to the seriousness of the offences, are of necessity severe to act as a deterrent against wrong-doing or failure to comply with conditions set out in the legislation.  Where an offence is committed by a body corporate, section 28 enables the Minister to prosecute both the body corporate and officers of the body corporate.  Part 8, section 29 enables the Minister to make regulations relating to a range of forestry activities including afforestation, forest protection, forest roads, training and education.<\/p><p> Importantly, the regulations also include provision to prevent the entry into the State, or the control or extermination within the State, of insects, pests or invasive species which might threaten trees, an important provision having regard to the recent outbreak of ash dieback disease.  Yesterday, the Department confirmed that for the first time in Ireland ash trees other than imported young trees have tested positive for ash dieback disease.  These trees were detected in follow-up surveys of native hedgerows within and adjacent to the first confirmed positive plantation in County Leitrim.  This was the first site in Ireland where <i>Chalara<\/i>was detected in October 2012 and where trees had been planted using imported trees from the Continent.  To date, it remains the largest known outbreak of the disease in Ireland.  The site was cleared of these young imported trees in October 2012.  My officials have put in place a comprehensive eradication plan and works commenced on the ground yesterday to clear ash trees in the area within a buffer zone of 250 metres in an effort to eradicate the disease.  We will continue this policy of eradication and keep the policy under constant review as ongoing results come in from the national ash surveys.  The Bill includes an amendment to the Agriculture Appeals Act 2001 to extend its remit to several forestry activities.<\/p><p> I thank all Deputies for coming to the House this evening and for their attention.  I look forward to engaging with everyone on the many issues of interest in the Bill.  I believe we all share a common goal of ensuring that this legislation is fit for purpose and that it provides a solid basis for a strong indigenous forest industry, one which contributes greatly to the social and economic well-being of rural communities and which has a great deal to offer both environmentally and economically.  I assure the House that any of the ideas that come to the House, especially on Second Stage, will be listened to and I will be only too willing to make the legislation amenable to everyone.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800037#KK00900","speaker":"1089","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381257000,"counter":535,"content":"<p>I apologise for the absence of our spokesman, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, who, I understand, is in Northern Ireland on business.  Recently, he launched a detailed policy document on the future of Coillte, setting out a bold new vision for Irish forests.  I expect he will be in the House on Thursday to give the Minister of State some of his wisdom on this matter.  Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes steps to strengthen environmental protection of our forests but has some specific concerns with the Bill.  I welcome the fact that the Minister of State has said he will listen to suggestions from this side of the House and perhaps take amendments on Committee Stage.<\/p><p>  The Government should be more ambitious in the legislation and set out new targets for afforestation.  Licensing laws should be reformed to ensure they are not an unnecessary burden on forest owners.  Beyond this, the Government should address continuing taxation disincentives in forestry.  I realise this is not within the brief of the Minister of State or this Bill but perhaps he could discuss the matter with the Minister for Finance to ensure that some of the disincentives in place in the taxation area at present are removed.<\/p><p>  As the Minister of State noted, forestry plays an important role in the rural economy but remains underutilised and underdeveloped by comparison with our European neighbours.  The Irish forestry industry was worth &euro;673 million in 2010.  Direct output in Ireland's wood product sectors, panel board mills, sawmills and other wood-product sectors was &euro;1.3 billion in 2010 and the total value, direct and indirect, to the economy in the three wood-processing sectors was &euro;2.2 billion.  More than 12,000 people are employed in the forestry industry throughout rural Ireland.  In my part of the country there are many people employed in the many small sawmills and some of the major industries in the south east and I imagine it is same throughout the country.<\/p><p>  Unfortunately, Ireland remains the least afforested country in Europe with only approximately 11% of Ireland covered in forests compared to the European average of 35%.  Demand for timber is due to expand in the coming decade while Irish timber already has 5% of the United Kingdom market.  Opportunities exist to expand this greatly in the future.<\/p><p>  The Bill should be expanded in its ambitions for the forestry sector and include specific economic objectives of supplying the Irish timber industry.  Steps to protect the delicate ecological balance of our woodlands are welcome measures but should be strengthened with a feasible economic basis.  The key economic role of the forestry industry and indigenous timber mills must be recognised and expanded in the coming years under the framework of the legislation.  The Bill should set specific targets for the industry relating to afforestation levels in the coming years.<\/p><p>The licensing rules outlined by the Bill should be reduced to alleviate the burden of red tape and forestry management.  Many of the farmers to whom the Minister of State referred who have moved into the forestry sector in recent years complain continually about the level of red tape in the sector at present.  It is welcome that the Minister of State is anxious that some red tape, as well as some other areas that have hindered the development of the forestry industry, will be removed.  Irish forestry also is penalised by the burden of the high earner section of the Finance Act 2006, which undermines tax incentives for the industry.  Farmers may be burdened with paying a massive amount of tax on a crop that takes more than 40 years to bring to fruition.  This also is an issue that many growers have raised with me recently and I am sure the Minister of State will take up this matter with the Minister for Finance to assess how it can be incentivised in a different and better way because it certainly is not doing so at present.  Government policy must reflect the fact that forestry is an investment that involves an unusually long period before it pays off.  This is a unique investment and looking beyond this Bill and towards the finance Bill 2014, the Government should reflect on adequate taxation measures to incentivise the sector.<\/p><p> The policy document on Coillte recently launched by Fianna F&aacute;il set out an ambitious target for an afforestation rate of 20,000 ha per annum up to 2020, as well as the increased recreational use of the woodlands.  I understand the financial position that may be behind this, because I served in that Department for quite some time and there was a continuous battle with the Minister for Finance of the day to get adequate moneys available to meet the premium payments, to meet the planting grants and so on.  I sometimes felt the Ministers for Finance of the day did not understand the need to expand forestry or the opportunities that existed in that area for job creation and for increased production.  I expect the Minister of State probably will have the same problems when dealing with the present Minister for Finance but hopefully there will be a dramatic increase in afforestation in the coming years.<\/p><p> Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes the steps to protect the delicate balance of the woodlands.  Forests play a key role in maintaining biodiversity and in combating climate change.  The central position of forests in the fragile national and global ecosystems must be protected with effective Government regulation and recognition of the need for environmentally friendly and economically sustainable forests.  In this light, the decision not to sell Coillte is a welcome move by the Government, which must now reassess its attitude to the area and broaden its ambitions for the long term.  At the time, there was major concern regarding the possible selling off of Coillte and I am glad commonsense prevailed with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and other Ministers and that this did not take place.  I believe Coillte has a key role to play in the forestry sector in the future.  However, the company may not be doing enough at present to develop the forestry industry and hopefully the Minister of State will be able to kick a few shins in this regard to encourage the company to become more proactive regarding increased afforestation.  While serving as Minister of State with responsibility for forestry, I always had an issue with Coillte concerning its refusal to replant.  I am aware that Coillte has a problem with premium payments in this regard and that Europe would not allow the company to claim such payments.  However, Coillte forests certainly are being cut down and are not being replanted, which is a cause for concern.  It is worth noting that 45% of the marked ways around the country are on Coillte properties and were rural recreation within the forestry industry to be developed fully, experts state there would be a potential to create approximately 3,000 jobs nationally.  Coillte already has conducted substantial work in the area of recreation, which has significant untapped potential.  It started with walking, including long-distance walks and rambling, after which it got into activities such as mountain cycling for which defined tracks are provided.  Tremendous potential exists for further development in this area by Coillte and the Bill should encompass broader ambition for the industry to expand its remit over the recreational aspect of Irish woodlands.  On Committee Stage, the Minister of State might again consider how it can become more actively involved.<\/p><p> As I noted, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's policy would see Coillte increase net afforestation efforts throughout Ireland and in particular in rural areas that are considered unemployment black spots.  An opportunity exists to increase the level of afforestation and Fianna F&aacute;il's policy document suggests a target of 20,000 ha per annum between 2014 and 2020, thereby bringing Ireland's percentage of forest cover closer to the European Union average.  Such afforestation should be funded as far as practicable through Coillte's profits.  As the Minister of State is aware, Coillte makes substantial profits.  While successive Ministers for Finance have tried to get their hands on the pot without being too successful in recent years, perhaps this is an opportunity in which those profits could be used for afforestation and to guarantee supply and profit in the future.  New afforestation projects would have an increased density to maximise economic yields for the company and for farmers.  This is an issue for farmers and companies in the forestry sector, who believe the allowable density is far too low and should be increased.  The Minister of State, with his officials, might also consider how this could be brought about.<\/p><p> In addition, I understand that NAMA is in possession of thousands of acres across the country at present.  While I do not know what the agency will do with it or what plans it has for it, there certainly will be very little commercial or residential development to judge by what is happening at present.  Perhaps there is an opportunity for some of this land to be planted into the forestry family and I ask the Minister of State to give consideration to this possibility.  As I stated, the Irish Timber Growers Association, ITGA, has called on the Minister for Finance to amend the prevailing position in which the income on a forest is taxed as a single event rather than the culmination of years of investment and effort.  One must recognise the particular nature of forestry and the decades long efforts that are put into it.  As I mentioned, the Minister of State should ask the Minister for Finance to give serious consideration to such an amendment.<\/p><p> One of the most extraordinary untold stories of the collapse of the construction industry has been that none of the major timber operations has gone out of business or has closed down, which constitutes great news for rural Ireland.  The big mills are all intact, the small mills, many of which are located near to where I live, are competing and are working to full production, as are Coillte's factories.  The collapse of the construction industry potentially could have destroyed the indigenous forestry industry, which sold directly into it.  However, the successful retention of the timber mills was the direct result of high level co-operation between Coillte, as the biggest supplier of saw log, and the milling industry.  The industry was able to break into the British construction market and replace lost local sales through sales abroad.  This Bill must outline specifically the remit of the Irish forestry industry in supporting local timber mills and the employment they provide currently, as well as the increased opportunities that may arise through further developments and further expansion into the United Kingdom market.  I am informed by millers that tremendous opportunities exist in both the United Kingdom market and other markets in Europe.  However, they may require grant aid to provide the type of timber that is required and to increase the potential in this regard.  It will be important for the Minister of State to consider this point because of the underlying opportunities in this sector.<\/p><p> The felling licence issue has been a bone of contention for quite some time but I note that during the boom years, many developers in the industry did not bother about felling licences.  They simply moved in, knocked down forests or woodlands and built massive housing projects.  It was extremely difficult to do anything about it because usually the complaint reached the Department only after the trees had been knocked down.<\/p><p>I welcome that the Government is tightening up on the requirements for the granting of felling licences while also making the system more flexible.  I hope that the process will not become too bureaucratic or full of interference by officialdom.  Having heard the Minister of State's contribution, I believe the Government is moving down the route of making the process more flexible and helpful for the punter.  I welcome the Bill.  It is moving in the right direction and we will bring forward some amendments to it on Committee Stage.<\/p><p> The Minister of State and I come from two prominent hurling counties.  That was certainly the case in the past although not at present.  I am sure Clare's success will not last forever.  We will want hurleys in Wexford again and the lads in Kerry might be involved as well.  Many hurley makers have put forward the point to me that if disease is found in one ash tree in the forest, the whole forest cut down.  The Minister of State might address that point in his reply.  They consider it is a waste of ash timber for the hurley-making industry.  Many of them have to import ash timber from other countries.  They believe that 99% of the ash trees in the forestry are probably okay and question the reason huge tracts of the forest are removed.  A similar problem arose when I was in the Department when brown rot was discovered in the potato crop.  Fields of potatoes were destroyed initially because of a panic reaction, but eventually things settled down and only the potatoes in the field where the brown rot was discovered were removed and not the full crop of potatoes or all the potatoes a farmer had stored in the shed.  That serious concern regarding the removal of all ash trees has been raised with me.  I was disappointed to hear that the disease has been found in our own ash trees given that up to now it was found mostly in imported ash.  There is a need for broader thinking in the Department on this issue.  Naturally we do not want to see the disease spread but perhaps there is not a need to remove all the trees in a planation as is currently the decision of the Department.<\/p><p> I welcome the Bill and Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v will put forward some amendments to it on Committee Stage.  I am sure the Minister of State, if he considers them worthwhile, will be only too willing to take them on board.  As he stated, he may be able to work out the best practice for the forestry industry as we move forward by having continuous discussion with the stakeholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800040#NN00200","speaker":"1096","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381258200,"counter":538,"content":"<p>Although it is not directly related to this legislation, the first thing that ought to be said in regard to forestry is to welcome the fact that the Government has ruled out the privatisation and sale of forestry and land under the responsibility of Coillte.  It is evident that there was a plan in place to do so, and I am convinced that had it not been for the fact that those plans were highlighted publicly, we would have witnessed the selling off of those lands to private corporations.  I commend those such as the woodland league and others who campaigned on this issue and ensured people were aware of what was going on.  In particular, it was important that the role of a former Taoiseach, who was and perhaps still is employed by a private company interested in acquiring those lands, was brought to light.  The notion that up to 7% of the land area of the State might have been sold off to an international investment fund, and that this might have been facilitated by a former elected Head of Government beggars belief.  That is exactly what was being planned.  Therefore, it is to be welcomed that the current Administration has ruled out such a shameful selling off of a natural resource vested in the State on behalf of the Irish people.  However, there are still issues that need to be addressed in regard to the management of the public forestry and it may be possible to do so in the context of this Bill.<\/p><p>  During the course of the debate on Coillte and the possible sale of the forests, a number of issues arose.  It is not known, for example, to what extent public forests have already possibly been sold off to private interests.  Similarly, we have not been given the details of the sale of Coillte lands at Bellanaboy to the Corrib consortium.  Successive Ministers have avoided answering such questions under the absurd claim that Coillte is a private company and therefore not answerable to this House, or indeed to the Minister.  Given that the two shareholders are the current Ministers for Finance and Agriculture, Food and the Marine, that claim is farcical.  Coillte should be open to the same scrutiny as other public companies through the Departments under which it operates.<\/p><p>  When Coillte executives appeared before a committee last year, I asked them about a geological survey that was carried out on Coillte lands.  I asked this in the context of the then proposed sale of forestry and lands, as it was believed by some people that private investors were not only interested in the forests but had knowledge of possible mineral deposits under Coillte lands.  At first they replied that there were surveys of quarries and such like only.  I pressed them again with regard specifically to mineral deposits underground and they admitted that they had a &quot;ball park&quot;<sup><\/sup>idea of where such deposits might be.  Either they do or they do not.  I would like the Minister of State therefore to state whether such a geological survey was undertaken and what its findings were and whether such information was taken into account when the sale of the forestry was being considered.<\/p><p>  The Bill mainly concerns the public supervision of private forestry.  As the Title states, its aim is to maximise among other objectives the economic value of the forests.  In general terms, the Irish forestry sector is underdeveloped in comparison with other European states.  Approximately 12,000 people are employed in the forestry sector.  It is estimated that could increase by 50% over a ten year period if 15,000 hectares were planted each year.  While just over half of the land under forest is under public ownership and, thus, within the remit of the State to develop, there is considerable potential within the private sector to expand the area under forest and the related enterprises associated with it.  At present, we are well below the 15,000 hectare per year planting target.  How to improve on that is the issue, and this Bill will impact directly on that, as would changes to the grant incentives to land owners to plant trees.<\/p><p>  Concerns have been raised regarding the legislation by people who have land under forest, and among those concerns is the power to be granted to the Minister under section 6(<i>e<\/i>) to make compulsory purchases of land deemed &quot;suitable for afforestation or other forestry related activities&quot;.  In general I would have no problem with that where, for example, land is clearly lying fallow, perhaps adjacent to Coillte forestry, and where it could be used more productively for either forestry with a view to using the trees or even as part of a public amenity, but perhaps the wording is too vague and might be open to arbitrary compulsory purchases without the need to prove there is a public interest in so doing.  Perhaps that section requires amendment to make more precise the circumstances under which a compulsory purchase might be made.  We certainly do not want to have situations where, for example, land might be subject to a compulsory purchase order in order that it could be sold on to a commercial interest, as happened in the case of Bellanaboy, and as people have expressed concern in relation to wind farms.<\/p><p>  I do not believe there can be too much objection to the Minister having an input into forestry plans, as proposed in section 6(<i>b<\/i>), as there needs to be central control over the manner in which forests in private ownership are used.  There is perhaps scope for greater consultation between the Department and private owners in the framing of such plans.  As part of a plan to extract more value from the forests with a view to expanding the overall sector, perhaps it might be an idea to hold a consultation with private owners to find out how individual plans for the use of the forests might be co-ordinated with a national plan.  There is the question of whether such a plan exists, as one of the complaints against Coillte from people with a direct interest in the sector is that there is no overall plan, or if there is one, no one knows what it might be.  Again that ties in with the overall perception and suspicion-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800042#PP00200","speaker":"1047"},{"type":"speech","time":1381258200,"counter":539,"content":"<p>I must ask intervene to ask the Deputy to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800042#PP00300","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1381258200,"counter":540,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Discretionary Medical Cards: Motion [Private Members]","time":1381258800,"counter":541,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800043#QQ00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1381258800,"counter":542,"content":"<p>I move:<blockquote>  That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:<br \/><br \/>notes that:<br \/><br \/>- the number of discretionary medical cards fell from 80,524 at the start of 2011 to 63,126 at the end of 2012;<br \/><br \/>- in the first seven months of 2013 there was a further reduction of 8,142 such cards to 54,984, a monthly average reduction of 1,163;<br \/><br \/>- the Health Service Executive (HSE) set a target for 2013 to reduce the number of discretionary medical cards;<br \/><br \/>- this deliberate targeting was approved by the Minister for Health in the 2013 HSE Service Plan; and<br \/><br \/>- the targeted reduction to 55,328 in 2013 has already been exceeded;<br \/><br \/>agrees that the discretionary medical card is essential for those with serious illnesses, the treatment of which can cause major financial hardship;<br \/><br \/>deplores the decision to deliberately target people in clinical need of such cards;<br \/><br \/>and calls on the Government to:<br \/><br \/>- discontinue the targeting of those with discretionary medical cards; and<br \/><br \/>- ensure that no-one in clinical need is denied such cards where it can cause significant financial distress.<\/blockquote>I wish to share time with Deputies Sean Fleming, Browne, Cowen and Niall Collins.<\/p><p>  We have been raising the issue of discretionary medical cards for some time.  We did so when the budget for this year yeas introduced last December.  When, in the context of that budget, a policy of withdrawing and removing medical cards was announced, we highlighted the fact that this would create huge difficulties for many people.  On each occasion on which I have raised this issue, the Minister of State, Deputy White, has consistently stated that there has been no change in policy or in the guidelines.  However, a cursory glance at the number of discretionary medical cards in the system shows that there has been a concerted effort on the part of the HSE to withdraw such cards.  I accept that there has been no change in the guidelines.  People are normally awarded medical cards on the basis of their financial means.  That is how the system works.  People make applications, their financial means are assessed and, based on the relevant criteria, they will either be awarded medical cards or they will not.  However, there is also a mechanism whereby discretionary medical cards are granted to individuals whose incomes exceed the limits relating to ordinary medical cards.  A discretionary card is awarded in light of the costs a person may incur on foot of the nature of his or her illness.  At one stage in excess of 8,000 discretionary medical cards were in the system.  I do not know about the overall health profile of the nation.  However, I am aware of one thing, namely, there is no way there are fewer sick people in this State than was the case a number of years ago.  It is not feasible to suggest that people suddenly appear to be getting better very quickly , that they are not suffering with serious illnesses or that they do not have major needs.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State continually states in reply to parliamentary questions that there is a system in place in respect of the awarding of discretionary medical cards.  The latter is simply not the case.  There is a concerted policy on the part of the HSE in respect of this matter.  That policy primarily revolves around the need to reign in the budget.  We all know one thing for certain, namely, that discretionary medical cards are used by people who are very sick.  As a result of the fact that the individuals involved are so ill, the costs incurred by the State in respect of these cards will always be high.  The primary reason for the award of a discretionary card relates to the fact that the people to whom they are given are very sick.<\/p><p>  As already stated, I have been consistent in raising this matter in the D&aacute;il and I have tabled numerous parliamentary questions in respect of it.  I have in my possession a list of individuals who, despite what one might believe, had their discretionary medical cards revoked.  In some instances people have undergone both review and appeals processes but their discretionary medical cards have not been reinstated.  Almost all of the individuals on the list to which I refer have illnesses which cannot be cured.  The first of them is a young boy of six years of age who has profound intellectual and physical disabilities, who is confined to a wheelchair, who does not have the use of his limbs, who is incontinent and who cannot communicate.  The card relating to this boy was withdrawn as part of a review.  Following a protracted row with the HSE, a discretionary card was awarded for a period of six months.  This is in respect of a child with profound intellectual and physical disabilities and all of the other problems to which I refer.  I cannot understand how the Minister of State can stand over a system under which the medical card of a child whose physical and intellectual circumstances will never improve could be revoked and then replaced, following a review, with a six-month discretionary card.<\/p><p>  Those in government appear to be on a merry-go-round whereby they continually state that there has been no change in policy.  There has to have been a change in policy.  Such a change is quite evident from the figures provided in replies to all of the parliamentary questions we have tabled in respect of this matter.  There is no doubt that the number of discretionary medical cards has been reduced dramatically.  Another of those on the list to which I refer is a boy who will be three years old in December, who has Down's syndrome, who is profoundly deaf, who requires substantial daily care, who has serious medical needs and who has an intellectual disability.  This child's medical card was also revoked.  Is the Minister of State seriously saying that he can stand over this change in policy?  There is no point in his even suggesting that there has not been a change.  What is being done is underhanded and represents a sleight of hand.  I say this because medical cards awarded on discretionary grounds are now being assessed in the context of the guidelines relating to cards awarded on the basis of people's financial means.  Such cards will, of course, be revoked because they were granted on the grounds of medical need and not on financial grounds.  This is why there are 20,000 fewer discretionary medical cards in the system than was previously the case.<\/p><p>  Another of those on the list I possess is a man who has lung cancer, who was recently diagnosed as bipolar and who half of his right lung removed in March.  His medical card, which was granted to him three years ago, was withdrawn.  I am highlighting this matter because I am of the view that the Minister of State does not want to stand over what is happening.  He knows in his heart and soul that it is appalling that, under the current system, medical cards can be taken from children and adults such as those to whom I refer.  I instanced specific cases because what the Minister of State is being told and what is happening on the ground are completely different.  There is not one Deputy in the House who would concur with his view that there has not been a change in policy.  In parliamentary questions and during debates on health, Members continually highlight the fact that discretionary medical cards are being taken from those who are most ill.<\/p><p>  We await next week's budget with bated breath.  The Government has been flagging the fact that it intends to provide free GP care for those under five years of age.  We all welcome this but who is going to pay for it?  Will it be the six year and three year old boys or the man with lung cancer to whom I refer?  I have a sneaky suspicion that they will have to pay for it.  The Government's mandate is based on its commitment to introduce universal health insurance and free GP care for everybody.  As matters stand, no one has free GP care and those who are extremely ill and who have the greatest need of health services are suffering most.  The Government has stated that health care should be provided not based on one's ability to pay but rather on one's need.  Those to whom I refer are the people who need it most.<\/p><p>  Another man whose name appears on the list in my possession is over 70 years of age.  This individual has terminal stage cancer, he is being fed by means of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, PEG, tube, he can no longer move or speak, he is confined to a special wheelchair, he has dementia and we was awarded a GP-only card.  The Minister of State cannot, in all good conscience, state that there has not been a change in policy.  There has been a fundamental shift in policy.  The nature of that shift is very simple: the Government is withdrawing discretionary medical cards on a continual basis.  The Minister of State is correct in stating that there has not been a change in the guidelines.  This is because there have never been guidelines in respect of discretionary medical cards.  These cards are awarded at the discretion of the relevant individuals.  In other words, it is their responsibility to consider the circumstances and needs of individuals and then make the decision to either award or not award a card.  It has been stated that there has not been a change in policy.  Neither have the illness profiles of people with physical or intellectual disabilities or those with particular medical needs changed but they can no longer obtain medical cards on the discretionary basis on which they were previously awarded.  Of course there has been a change in policy in respect of this issue.<\/p><p>  We are calling on the Minister of State and the Government to do whatever it takes to reverse this sinister, nasty attack on the sickest and most vulnerable people in our society.<\/p><p>This motion is an indication that, on a continual basis, Members on both sides of the House are raising this issue.  If the Minister of State, Deputy White, does not believe me, he should read the parliamentary questions day in, day out on discretionary medical cards being withdrawn and asking the Minister to intervene.  <\/p><p> I raised this issue on Leaders' Questions as far back as last January.  At the time, the Taoiseach told me to send him on the individual cases.  I do not expect the Taoiseach to be involved in every case because, as he says, he is a very busy man.  However, the reason I sent him on the cases is that it is unbelievable that Members opposite can defend this issue.  I raised the case of a woman in the House who has had a double mastectomy and is on chemotherapy.  Her medical card was taken from her but eventually she was given a GP card.  <\/p><p> In all conscience, the Minister of State, Deputy White, must accept the veracity of this motion.  The amendment to the motion is an insult to the thousands of people who are waiting for reviews, who are trying to receive discretionary medical cards and who are trying to put forward their medical and financial evidence but who must wait months on end for a decision.  Unfortunately, in the vast majority of the cases, the decision is to take medical cards granted on a discretionary basis rather than to grant them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800043#QQ00200","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381259400,"counter":544,"content":"<p>I thank my colleague, Deputy Kelleher, for raising this important issue of discretionary medical cards which affects many thousands of families.  The Minister of State, Deputy White, may say there has been no change in policy but the practice has been changed.

The majority party in this Government has decided, as a matter of policy, that it will not ask those who can make a larger contribution to the running of the country to do so.  It has said it will make cuts in respect of people relying on State services, whether people with disabilities, people looking for medical cards, people on social welfare or parents depending on child benefit, and the Labour Party is implementing that down the line.  The Minister of State, Deputy White, is in the firing line for this issue which is basically as a result of Government policy to cut Government expenditure on those who need it most in order to protect the well off people who are the main voters of the larger coalition partner in Government.  That is why we have most of the difficulties in these areas.  <\/p><p>  If one looks back over the motions over the past year or two years, most of them relate to cuts in expenditure which this Government has decided to implement, as a matter of choice, rather than increase taxation.  It can longer blame the troika as it will be gone.  The level of adjustment will be the Government's choice and the breakdown of that adjustment in the budget next week will be a choice between taxation and cuts in expenditure.  If the Government follows the practice of the past two years, further regressive steps will be taken in that regard.<\/p><p>  I have been struck by the number of people coming to my constituency office about this issue.  Every Member will be able to list difficult cases and I will highlight one in a moment.  The Taoiseach was asked about the reduction in the number of discretionary medical cards by my party leader, Deputy Martin, on Leaders' Question some time ago.  There was a time when if a person had serious cancer, he or she got a medical card as a matter of course for one year or two years until he or she recovered.  It may not have been written down as policy but that was the established practice in every part of the country.  That practice has now changed.  If one has serious cancer, one will be told to go to one's public hospital and one will not get a medical card as a matter of course.  The discretionary medical cards have been withdrawn in those situations.<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach was pursued on this matter and the frightening comment he made was that people will get discretionary medical cards where their condition is life-limiting.  In other words, if the condition one has will make one die sooner rather than later, one will get a medical card but if it will make one very sick and distressed for the rest of one's life, although not shorten one's life, one will not get a medical card.  The Taoiseach was specific in referring to cases where the condition was life-limiting.  I have said to people that if they have cancer and get a medical card, some consultant must think they are on the way out because the Taoiseach made it very clear that they will only get one if their condition is life-limiting.  That is what is behind what is going on.  The Minister of State, Deputy White, should not take my word for it but should read what the Taoiseach said.  It is fine for him to say there is no policy on this but the practice, as a result of Government decisions, demonstrates otherwise.<\/p><p>  I have come across dozens of cases but I would like to highlight one case which came to public notice in County Laois recently.  I have the permission of the person involved to use his name in this debate.  Mr. Joe Barrett published this article in the <i>Laois Nationalist<\/i>, a local newspaper, on 1 October 2013.  The Minister of State's Department, which scans the newspapers for nice photographs of Ministers when they visit constituencies, should have come across this article.  The headline was: &quot;You Couldn't Make This Up&quot;.  That is how bad he thinks the story is.  I will summarise his story which is one of several stories I could relay and is in the public arena.<\/p><p>  He stated that after 30 years of receiving a medical card, he was refused one this year.  He went on to state that there has been a lot of disquiet since Fine Gael and the Labour Party came into government and cut 24,000 discretionary medical cards and that people who qualified before will only get a card if they require urgent and ongoing medical treatment.  The first he heard of it was when he got a GP card.  He asked the HSE why he was getting a GP card as he had serious conditions.  The Minister of State, Deputy White, cannot outsource this problem to the HSE because the Minister, Deputy Reilly, has abolished the board of the HSE and is taking direct political control of this area.  <\/p><p>  At that stage, Mr. Barrett decided it was necessary to outline his situation to the HSE.  He said that 30 years ago, he underwent a kidney operation and not long after that, he was found to have diabetes.  After that, he was diagnosed with high blood pressure and then qualified for a medical card.  Fast forward a number of years, and he then suffered a heart attack.  Two months later, he had two stents inserted in arteries in his heart and a month later, an artery that had already been stented had to be redone.  In the same year, he underwent open heart surgery and received a triple heart bypass.  Following that operation, he underwent a heart operation a year later when one of the grafts that was used in the bypass blocked and had to be stented.  Over the years, he has been in and out of the hospital in Portlaoise and St. Vincent's hospital in Dublin.<\/p><p>  This person was refused a medical card.  He stated that in consultation with a cardiac surgeon, he chose not to undergo another cardiac procedure.  Could one blame him?  During those years, he has undergone six angioplasty procedures and over the years, he has been on various doses of and different medication.  He is currently on a daily dose of 14 tablets.  On top of that, he is in heart failure but has been refused a medical.  Shame on the Minister for Health and the Department who will say there is no policy to review but the practice is otherwise.  <\/p><p>  Mr. Barrett went on to appeal the situation and wanted to know what medical assessor refused him.  He asked for a copy of the file of the medical assessor who reached the decision but he was refused it.  He was told he could apply to get his own medical information under freedom of information.  Talk about trying to deal with a member of the public properly.  He submitted an appeal but in the meantime, he is seeking review from the HSE as to why he was refused.  He will then be told he can appeal again.  In the meantime, he does not have a medical card despite those conditions.  That household has several other conditions which would back up the need for a discretionary medical card.  That is one example on the public record.  One might say the man is not going to die so he does not require a discretionary medical card.  <\/p><p>  I have good personal regard for the Minister of State, Deputy White, who I believe is sincere.  He has gone into a Department in which he wants to make progress but he must get on top of the situation where his Department is cutting back on discretionary medical cards for people who have these medical situations.<\/p><p>  I highlight cancer cases, in particular, because years ago, people got discretionary medical cards as a matter of course for the year or two years for which they required them.  I referred earlier to daily medication.  The prescription fee has been trebled from 50 cent to &euro;1.50 per item.<\/p><p>That is now costing many households up to &euro;10 a month.  They are having difficulty finding this additional cash.  Regardless of whether the Minister classifies this as a policy or as a practice, the reality is that it is happening on his watch and he is responsible for it.  People are suffering as a result of the deliberate policy of removing people from the system.  A similar approach is being taken in the Department of Social Protection, where disability and invalidity payments are being withdrawn from people.  The same policy is evident in the medical cards section of the Department of Health.  People are having their medical cards taken from them and their cover is being reduced.<\/p><p> The journalist I mentioned concluded his article by saying he wrote his appeal at 3 a.m.  He does not know where it is going next.  He is &quot;worried sick&quot; because he cannot cope with the stress he is under.  He says that this worry is adding to &quot;my cardiac conditions&quot; and &quot;starting to affect my family&quot;.  The Minister's answer is to tell him he is not entitled to a medical card.  It is shameful that the Department is acting in such a manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800044#RR00200","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381260000,"counter":546,"content":"<p>I compliment Deputy Kelleher on the motion he has proposed.  The widespread and deliberate withdrawal of medical cards is causing huge anxiety and concern throughout the country.  The number of discretionary medical cards fell from 80,000 at the start of 2011 to 63,000 in 2012.  As Deputy Kelleher has pointed out, in the first seven months of this year the number of medical cards reduced by between 1,100 and 1,200 per month.  I do not doubt that there is a cynical campaign to reduce the number of discretionary medical cards.  It is clear from what public representatives across the country are hearing in their clinics that a widespread cull of discretionary medical cards is under way.  I could mention many examples of this.  I have never received as many representations about medical cards as I received during the first six months of this year.  I am sure every other Deputy will say the same.  Many people are losing their medical cards.  In addition to the withdrawal of medical cards, there are delays in issuing medical cards.  People are very concerned and annoyed about this.  The Government is continuing to mislead the public by denying that any cuts are taking place in this area.  Indeed, the Taoiseach has said in this House on many occasions that there have been no changes in the ground rules or the regulations.  He has suggested that everybody who is entitled to a medical card should get one.  Obviously, the Taoiseach is out of touch with what is really happening on the ground at HSE level.<\/p><p>  Discretionary medical cards are issued on health grounds, on the basis of medical need.  Under this Government, thousands of medical cards are being withdrawn because the recipients' incomes are above the threshold.  When decisions on discretionary medical cards are being made, patients are assessed on the basis of the seriousness of their illnesses rather than on the basis of their incomes.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Health continuously claim that there has been no change in policy or in the medical card guidelines, but nothing could be further from the truth on the ground.  Every public representative has seen evidence of a widescale programme of cuts that is hitting very sick children and vulnerable families that are under enormous pressure.  As I have said, we have been inundated with representations from people whose medical cards have been revoked even though they have a clear and undeniable medical need.  It is very concerning that families facing severe health and medical pressures are having to deal with the withdrawal of medical cards.  As I said, the number of discretionary medical cards has decreased by more than 20,000 since 2010.  This seems to give the impression that everyone who had a medical card has suddenly been cured and no longer needs the card, which shows the cynicism of this Government at present.<\/p><p>  If the Minister does not want to believe what we are saying, I remind him that Emily O'Reilly recently said that cutbacks are being implemented by applying &ldquo;the letter of the law&rdquo; and removing the element of discretion that previously applied.  According to the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association, discretionary and emergency cards are not being given to people with the condition, which is terminal.  I have given two examples of independent voices that support what we are saying.  The Jack and Jill Foundation, which does tremendous work for children, provides direct funding to the families of children with brain damage to enable them to purchase home respite care.  The foundation says that as a result of these recent changes in this area, it is impossible to get medical cards for children at present.  The comments of these three independent groups about the withdrawal and removal of discretionary medical cards are at variance with what the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health are saying.<\/p><p>  Deputy Sean Fleming spoke about the treatment of cancer patients, which is causing grave concern.  Over the years, regardless of the Government that was in power or the Minister who held the health portfolio, medical cards were issued to cancer patients until such time as they no longer had the disease.  Medical cards are no longer being allocated to cancer patients on medical grounds.  Instead, all kinds of income and finance obstacles are being put in their way.  The HSE has said that it issues medical cards within 24 hours, but I can refute that by referring to the example of a person whose family applied for a medical card three weeks ago.  I have seen the letter sent by the consultant from the hospital where the person is being treated, which makes it clear that this is an end-of-life situation.  Three weeks on, that person has not been issued with a medical card.  I have been contacting the medical card section of the Department on a daily basis.  In fairness to the official in the section that deals with Deputies' inquiries, he has been very helpful and supportive of my efforts to find out why this medical card has not been issued.  All kinds of information, including insurance policies, proof of income and details of farm premium payments, has been sought from this person's family even though the consultant has said this is an end-of-life situation.  It is obvious that medical cards are no longer being issued in such circumstances.<\/p><p>  Medical card reviews are also causing consternation, particularly for older people.  Old age pensioners who were issued medical cards with expiry dates of 2014, 2015 or 2016 have come into my clinic to tell me they have received letters from the medical cards section of the Department to tell them that a review is being carried out.  I cannot get the HSE or the people who issue medical cards to explain why this is happening.  They just say they were told to seek a review, even though the medical card holder expected to have the card until 2014, 2015 or 2016.  I ask the Minister to find out why this is happening to old age pensioners whose circumstances have not changed.  The Minister, Deputy Burton, keeps telling us she has not reduced the old age pension, which is fair enough, but she has not increased the pension either.  It is not as if a pension increase has caused these people to fall outside the medical card limit.  The Minister needs to give serious examination to these areas.  The discretionary medical card system must be reintroduced.  Old age pensioners whose circumstances have not changed should be left alone, rather than being pressurised.  Old age pensioners should not have to send in their pension book numbers again when no changes have taken place.<\/p><p>  We are spelling out clearly that we have major problems with the manner in which discretionary medical cards are being issued.  As I mentioned, the same point has been made by the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association and the Jack and Jill Foundation.  Emily O'Reilly, who is the most independent person in this country, has been continuously saying that the HSE is withdrawing discretionary medical cards from patients who are seriously ill and suffering from cancer, stroke or heart problems.  These people have enough issues to be dealing with - family circumstances etc. - without having to face the pressure of having to reapply for a medical card and worry that the application might not be allowed.  I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to this situation.  All of the issues we have raised tonight need to be clarified and changes need to be made to ensure the discretionary medical cards to which people are entitled will be re-issued as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800045#SS00200","speaker":"1096"},{"type":"speech","time":1381260600,"counter":547,"content":"<p>The motion refers to the fact that the number of discretionary medical cards fell from 80,524 at the start of 2011 to 63,000 at the end of 2012 and that, in the first seven months of this year, there was a further reduction of 8,100, which is a monthly average reduction of 1,163.  This takes place against a background of obvious increases in eligibility and suitability on the part of many people in society by virtue of the situation in which we find ourselves.  Although the situation has reached such a pitch, this is not the first time the matter has been brought to bear in the chamber with a view to addressing and resolving the issues in a manner more in line with what Members find in their constituency offices.<\/p><p>  When I consult my office I hear about, and during my regular clinics I meet, a growing number of people who have been reviewed and subsequently lost medical cards.  I therefore contacted a sample of those people today to ask their permission to refer to their case in the chamber.  Although I have been given that permission - I will use my remaining time to talk about some of the cases - I will not use anyone's real name, but I will make the cases available to the Minister after the debate.  <\/p><p>  Helen has held a full medical card for a number of years as she suffers from severe rheumatoid arthritis and attends St Vincent's Hospital regularly.  Her application came up for renewal in April and was refused.  We requested a review, but it was disallowed.  We then requested an appeal and only yesterday we received word that she was granted a doctors only medical card.  This lady is on medication that costs more than &euro;100 a week, which she does not have the means to meet.<\/p><p>  Timothy has always held a full medical card on medical grounds as he suffers from ADHD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, drug addiction, depression and a fracture to a vertebrae.  As he held a card, his three children were also entitled to a card.  His card came up for renewal in August, but his application was refused.  The case is under review.  <\/p><p>  Anne has always held a full medical card on medical grounds as she suffers from osteopenia and severe rheumatoid arthritis.  Her case came up for review in April.  When her application was refused, it went to review but that, too, was refused, and it was later refused on appeal.<\/p><p>  Breda has held a full medical card as she has a number of medical conditions and is awaiting surgery on her kidneys and bowel.  Her card came up for renewal in August, and she was awarded only a doctor visit card.  A review was requested and we await the outcome.<\/p><p>  Audrey has always held a full medical card.  She suffers from hypertension and is on long-term medication.  She attends her general practitioner regularly.  Her application came for review in April.  It was refused.  We requested a review of the decision, but the original decision was upheld.  Her case is under appeal.<\/p><p>  Kieran always held a full medical card on medical grounds as he suffers from COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sleep apnea, heart disease and high blood pressure.  His card came up for review in February.  His application was refused, and we requested a review, which is ongoing.<\/p><p>  Jack is aged nine.  He has held a full medical card.  He has multiple disabilities, including cerebral palsy and a hearing impairment.  Jack's medical card came up for review in February and he was awarded a doctor visit card.  We requested a review and the original decision was upheld.  We therefore appealed the decision and that was again upheld.<\/p><p>  The final case that I will mention in the short time that I have relates to a young lady whom I know.  I wrote to the Minister and to the Department on 1 August:<blockquote>I write further to representations from the above named [We will just say that her name is Jeanette] and further to a phone conversation this morning with [someone] in your section.<br \/><br \/>  I've known Jeanette and her family all my life as she is from [my home town].  [She] was born without lower limbs and has been in a wheelchair all her life.  This has not, or never, deterred her as she lived a very fulfilling life [and has continued to do so], excelling in sport and all aspects of community life.<br \/><br \/>  Jeanette works in the HSE ... has always sought not to be an economic burden on the State.  She has had and retains her own medical needs which surpass her means, now that she has dependents, namely her partner ... whom is unemployed and her miracle baby [now 12 months old].  [That baby unfortunately] is in constant need of specialist medical attention.  All the relevant details pertaining to this case, economic and medical, are on the file.<br \/><br \/>  I find it distressing that this application process has been so poorly dealt with, considering the amount of communication Jeanette has had with the relevant sections dealing with her application.<br \/><br \/>  She was informed over the phone that the cards were granted only to be informed the opposite days later.<br \/><br \/>  It is unbelievable that Jeanette should be forced to avail of my ... office in seeking to have the only decision possible in this case, arrived at.<br \/><br \/>  I don't normally seek to personalise cases in this manner, but I am too well aware of the need in this instance and cannot 'for the life of me' understand how<br \/><br \/>a) This case has been dragged so long<br \/><br \/>b) That a medical assessor did not find in favour of this application.<br \/><br \/>  [I asked that arrangements be made] for these cards to be issued or failing that [to make available to me] the full reasoning and methodology at a decision that medical cards are not necessary from a medical perspective.<\/blockquote>I did not receive any explanation from the office in question on that decision and how it was arrived at and, unfortunately, the lady in question did not retain her medical card and is just in receipt of a doctors only visit card even though she has a great medical need and does not have the financial means to meet the demands on both her and her child . <\/p><p>  As I said, those are only a sample of the cases that are prevalent in all our offices.  The sample has grown greatly as the months pass.  It is plain for me and my colleagues to see that these issues are not being dealt with in a manner in which we can stand over.  I ask the Minister to take a personal interest in the cases that we will forward to him and to find out where the failings are in the relevant sections.  Is it the case - I would have doubted very much that it would be the case - a direction has been given?  It seems patently obvious that it might be the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800046#TT00100","speaker":"1101"},{"type":"speech","time":1381260600,"counter":548,"content":"<p>I begin by making a few comments on the junior doctors dispute.  It is very regrettable.  We must consider the plight of junior doctors.  Equally, we must consider the people whose procedures and operations were cancelled.  I  think that we would all agree that, for the betterment of everyone, it is incumbent on everybody to get together to resolve the matter.  It is fair to say that junior doctors over the years have been failed by the State.  They have also been failed by the IMO, their trade union and its old guard in particular.  I know that the IMO's leadership has changed, which is refreshing and welcome - it is about time junior doctors had proper representation and leadership from their trade union.<\/p><p>  The debate crystallises a number of points which I want to address briefly.  Why are people cynical about politicians and the political profession that we are engaged in?  It is because there is a complete disconnect between what happens to people on the ground and what they hear from official speak, which is regrettable.  The fact is that the Government and the Department will say that there has been no policy change, but there is no getting away from the fact there has been a <i>de facto <\/i>policy change.  We experience that change every day of the week; that is what people experience on the ground when they get notification that their medical card has been unilaterally cut off or withdrawn.  The first time many of those people hear about it is when they are in their doctors clinic or surgery.  There are a number of reasons for that and there may be fault on all sides, but that is not good enough.  The situation is not good for the patient, the cardholder or the doctors.  When people are sick, which is a stressful situation, the last thing they need to do, apart from trying to get themselves better, is worry about the status of their medical card.  For the Minister to say that is not something that he or his Department is responsible for is not good enough and must be addressed.<\/p><p>  My main concern - I will raise a specific case in the 60 seconds that I have left - is about the discretionary medical card for cancer patients.<\/p><p>I will give the Minister of State the details of the case when we are finished.  I have permission from this lady, Anne, to raise her case.  She rang me from her hospital bed on a number of occasions.  She was diagnosed with breast cancer last February.  She had chemotherapy and a mastectomy, is now undergoing radiotherapy in Limerick and bone treatment in Cork and is due a second round of chemotherapy in Cork in due course.  It is regrettable and reprehensible that I must raise her case in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, albeit with her permission, to try to further her case.  I have been dealing with people from the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS.  She is at the end of her tether.  It is about a medical report and her GP has furnished a detailed medical report.  She is literally at her wits end and her GP is telling her that the PCRS has been furnished with her medical status.  This woman has cancer.<\/p><p> Apart from this case, the details of which I will give to the Minister of State, there are all the other cases of people throughout the country who have had their cards unilaterally withdrawn.  When people are sick, they cannot work and earn money.  Some of them might have illness cover but others do not and medical cards entitle them to other benefits, for example, school transport for their children and other knock-on benefits.  It is putting pressure on people.  The Minister of State has responsibility for medical cards.  There has been a <i>de facto<\/i>change in policy and we need to be honest with ourselves and get away from the official spin which is being put out about this because the figures prove it.  The evidence is there on the ground and in our clinics.  The Minister of State needs to meet the challenge head on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800046#TT00400","speaker":"1057","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381261200,"counter":550,"content":"<p>I understand the Minister of State with responsibility for primary care, Deputy White, is sharing time with the Minister for Health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800047#UU00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1381261200,"counter":551,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<blockquote>To delete all words after &quot;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&quot; and substitute the following:<br \/><br \/>&quot;notes that:<br \/><br \/>-- there has been no change to the manner in which discretionary medical cards are awarded;<br \/><br \/>-- there is no target set in the Health Service Executive (HSE) National Service Plan to reduce the number of discretionary medical cards;<br \/><br \/>-- of the 24,000 reduction in discretionary medical cards from the start of 2011 to July 2013 almost 23,000 of these persons have been awarded medical cards on the basis of their financial means;<br \/><br \/>-- the HSE has produced National Assessment Guidelines to provide a clear framework to assist in making reasonable, consistent and equitable decisions when assessing applicants;<br \/><br \/>-- these guidelines facilitate the application of discretion by decision makers in responding to the needs of the applicant when additional or exceptional circumstances exist;<br \/><br \/>-- the Health Act 1970 (as amended) provides that persons who 'are unable without undue-hardship to arrange general practitioner' services for themselves and their family qualify for a medical card;<br \/><br \/>-- in accordance with the Health Act 1970 (as amended), the assessment for a medical card must 'have regard to the overall financial situation' of an applicant and dependants; and<br \/><br \/>-- the centralisation of the processing of medical cards at a national level, rather than at a local level as was the case before mid-2011, facilitates the assessment of applicants for medical cards in a consistent and equitable manner;<br \/><br \/>commends the Minister for Health for directing the HSE to set up a clinical panel to assist in the processing of applications for discretionary medical cards, where there are difficult personal circumstances;<br \/><br \/>further notes that:<br \/><br \/>-- between mid-March 2011 and end-August 2013, the number of individuals who had eligibility to a medical card increased by 214,244 (13 per cent) to 1,863,062; and<br \/><br \/>-- the HSE is facing significant challenges in 2013 and in 2014 given the need to set expenditure levels within the parameters of the National Recovery Plan; and<br \/><br \/>acknowledges:<br \/><br \/>-- the significant reductions in financial and staffing resources which the health sector has experienced over the last three years; and<br \/><br \/>-- the range of measures being actively progressed by the HSE to manage its financial resources to ensure that services are provided to persons entitled to receive them; and<br \/><br \/>commends:<br \/><br \/>-- the Minister for Health and the Government for providing resources to meet the increase of over 200,000 medical cards since March 2011;<br \/><br \/>-- the Minister for the passing of legislation to abolish restrictions on general practitioners wishing to become contractors under the medical card scheme;<br \/><br \/>-- the Minister on the implementation of legislation to achieve savings under the medical card scheme through the use of generic drugs and reference pricing; and<br \/><br \/>-- the Minister on the savings being made in the cost of drugs for the medical card scheme through negotiations with pharmaceutical drug suppliers.&quot;<\/blockquote>Deputy Kelleher commenced his contribution by talking about what he described as a policy of withdrawal of discretionary medical cards.  He made some reference to it having been announced in the budget last year.  I wonder whether either this evening or tomorrow Deputy Kelleher could draw our attention to where it says in the Budget Statement that a policy of withdrawal of discretionary medical cards is being announced or introduced.  The motion does not simply imply or suggest but baldly states that the HSE has set a &quot;target&quot; for 2013 to reduce the number of discretionary medical cards.  It goes on to say that what it describes as &quot;this deliberate targeting&quot; was approved by the Minister for Health in the 2013 HSE service plan.  I would respectfully ask Deputy Kelleher, through the Chair, to draw our attention to where he finds authority in the HSE service plan or budget statement last year for such an alleged targeting.  In the absence of Deputy Kelleher doing so, I must put on the record of the House that I must and do reject the contention in the motion that there is a deliberate targeting of holders of discretionary medical cards.  I must say that in the absence of any evidence that would bear out this very stark allegation, this contention is false and without foundation.  I want to make it clear that there is no &quot;target&quot; to reduce discretionary medical cards in the HSE national service plan for 2013 and neither, I assure the House, is it Government policy.<\/p><p>  The Deputies and the motion refer to the reducing number of cards awarded on a discretionary basis.  Information from the HSE indicates that there has been a reduction of about 24,000 in the number of discretionary medical cards between the start of 2011 and July 2013.  Of these, almost 23,000 have been awarded medical cards on the basis of their means assessment so that they have not, in fact, lost their medical cards.  A total of 23,000 out of the 24,000 who no longer have medical cards on the basis of the discretionary approach have medical cards on the basis of their means assessment.  Therefore, they retain the medical card.  The number of people who hold medical cards on discretionary grounds has fallen in recent years largely because more people who previously were marginally over the normal qualifying limit became eligible for medical cards under the normal scales.  I am not saying that this encompasses everybody about whom Deputy Kelleher is talking but it encompasses a huge number.<\/p><p>  Contrary to the suggestion that we are targeting people who need our support, this Government has provided funding to ensure an additional 220,000 people are now covered by the General Medical Services scheme since it entered office.  The suggestion that there is a tactic to reduce medical cards for budgetary purposes is fatally undermined by the fact that an additional 220,000 people are covered through the GMS scheme.  This means that over 43% of the national population currently has access to GP services without any charges under the GMS scheme.  That comprises 40.6% with the full medical card and 2.7% with GP visit cards.<\/p><p>  I can confirm that there has been no change to the qualifying criteria for discretionary medical cards in the past year and that the scheme continues to operate in such a way that those who suffer genuine financial hardship as a result of a medical condition receive the benefit of a medical card, as they should.  I acknowledge that the number of discretionary cards has fallen from the beginning of 2011 to July 2013.  This is evident from the publicly available statistics but it has occurred for the reasons I have stated and not as a consequence of some kind of so-called mission on the part of the Government to extract medical cards from those who are entitled to them.<\/p><p>  As the Deputies will be aware, under the provisions of the Health Act 1970, as amended, persons who are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange a general practitioner service for themselves or their family qualify for a medical card.  In accordance with the legislation, the assessment for a medical card is determined primarily by reference to the means, including the income and expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependants.  Under the legislation, the HSE is responsible for assessing an individual's entitlement to a medical card and a GP visit card.  Specifically, section 45(1) provides that adult persons who, in the opinion of the HSE, are unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependents are deemed to be persons with full eligibility.  Under Section 45(2), the HSE is obliged in deciding on an individual's eligibility to have regard to the person's overall financial situation, including the means of the spouse, if any, in view of the reasonable expenditure in respect of himself or herself and his or her dependants.  The Deputies will also be aware that different criteria apply for assessment for eligibility for a medical card for those persons aged 70 years and over.  Assessment is on a gross income basis, as provided for under section 45A of the 1970 Act.<\/p><p>  Medical card processing is now carried out centrally with single national governance and a central office location replacing the 100 different locations that existed in the past.  Customer service processes, assessment of applications and reviews, correspondence and the consideration of discretion are standardised and operated in a fair and equitable manner.  The medical card scheme is now underpinned by a stronger foundation, which enables better governance, more transparency and efficient modern processes.<\/p><p>  The PCRS of the HSE oversees the medical card scheme and has a target to process 90% of medical card applications within 15 working days.  These turnaround times are now published online on a weekly basis at<i><i><\/i><\/i><i>www.medicalcard.ie<\/i>.  In practice, almost 95% of applications are processed within the 15 day target.  Medical card applications are considered on the basis of an assessment of the applicant's means by reference to the HSE national assessment guidelines and national income guidelines.  Where a person's income is within the income guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be granted for three years in most cases.<\/p><p>  However, and this is the nub of the issue this evening, the HSE has discretion to grant a medical card where a person's income exceeds the income guidelines.  The discretion must be exercised by the HSE but the fundamental provision in the 1970 Act is that a person is assessed on the basis of undue hardship in arranging a GP service, as well as his or her means.  I will come back to this later on if I have time but a Member opposite referred to one of the cases that were raised by Members, all of which I am sure are absolutely genuine.  The Member referred to a case where somebody had a medical card on medical grounds.  There is no such thing in our system.  Perhaps there should be and perhaps we should have a debate about it.  I am quite happy to have a debate about it but the system that has obtained since 1970, over which the Deputy's party opposite presided for most of that period, certainly two thirds of it, does not and never has awarded a medical card to somebody on the basis of a medical condition.<\/p><p>There is no such thing as what one speaker referred to as a medical card on medical grounds.  Nobody acting on behalf of The HSE has the authority of this House to grant a medical card other than on the basis of the 1970 Act.  We might all have views on whether that Act should be amended but until such time as that occurs it remains the law.  Nobody, including Ministers, can act outside the law.  In fairness to Deputy Kelleher, he accepts this.<\/p><p> These are all difficult cases and no Member of this House would make light of the human circumstances described by Deputies during this debate.  Deputy Se&aacute;n Fleming referred to circumstances in which individuals with cancer always get medical cards.  Is it being proposed that a person with cancer should automatically receive a medical card irrespective of his or her income or circumstances?  I do not criticise anybody for making such a proposal but it would entail a fundamental change to our law.  If that is what is being proposed, let us debate it.  <\/p><p> Social and medical issues are taken into account when determining whether undue hardship exists for the individual concerned in accessing GP or other medical services.  Discretion will be applied automatically during the processing of an application where additional information has been provided by the applicant which can be considered by staff or a medical officer, where appropriate.  Once a full assessment of an application or a review is completed a letter issues to the applicant advising of the decision.  If a review of an application is assessed as ineligible or eligible for a GP visit card only the letter informing the applicant of this decision will include an explanation of how the application was assessed and the details of the means assessment calculated on the application.  Applicants will be advised that they can request a review of the HSE decision if they believe their financial or other circumstances have not been correctly assessed.  They will also be requested to provide any additional relevant information or details of any change in circumstances since their original application.  In addition, the letter will notify the applicant of the option to appeal the decision and the contact details of the appeals office.<\/p><p> Where applicants submit an application without any additional medical documentation and are refused, they will receive a letter giving a calculation of the guideline thresholds and where these have been exceeded.  At this stage, they are informed of the option to furnish further medical documentation to support the application.  If applicants finish medical evidence at either initial stage or following a refusal, and where discretion has been used, they are informed of the decision of the medical officer.  Once again, the letter will notify the applicant of the option to appeal the decision and the contact details of the appeals office.  Additional information that can be used for consideration on a discretionary basis, following receipt of a letter indicating an unsuccessful application, includes illness or medical circumstances which results in financial hardship; the cost of providing general medical and surgical services; the cost associated with the provision of medical, nursing and dental treatment; and the cost of medical aids and appliances.<\/p><p> At the direction of the Minister for Health, the HSE set up a panel of specialist medical professionals to assist in the processing of applications for discretionary medical cards where a person exceeds the income guidelines but is facing difficult personal circumstances, such as an illness.  These community medical officers, CMOs, apply discretion within the guidelines to determine if the applicant is suffering from hardship, review and interpret medical information provided on a confidential basis and provide reassurance to the medical profession and the public regarding the safeguarding of patient-doctor confidentiality.  They liaise with general practitioners, hospital consultants and other health professionals as appropriate so as to determine the health needs of the applicant and his or her family.  They advise on the granting of discretionary medical cards to an applicant and his or her family on the basis of the guidelines.  They also work closely with staff in the PCRS and contribute to the ongoing development and delivery of an equitable, efficient and streamlined medical card application process nationally.<\/p><p> Medical card eligibility provided either on the basis of means or where discretion is involved is identical and provides access to exactly the same set of health services.  More people than ever before have medical card eligibility.  It now stands at almost 41% of the population.  Furthermore, over 43% of the national population currently has access to GP services without any fees under the general medical scheme.<\/p><p> Deputy Se&aacute;n Fleming quoted the Taoiseach on the emergency medical card system.  The HSE has a system in place for the provision of emergency medical cards awarded on a discretionary basis.  The Taoiseach must have been referring to this system.  These cards are provided to patients who are seriously ill and in urgent need of medical care that they cannot afford.  Emergency medical cards are issued by the HSE within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and the letter of confirmation of the condition from a doctor or a medical consultant.  Deputy Browne referred to an end of life situation in which an individual was waiting for an emergency medical card to be issued.  That sort of situation should not arise.  I can provide my colleagues with further details on emergency medical cards and the circumstances in which they should be issued.<\/p><p> The processes I have outlined for consideration for a medical card on a discretionary basis clearly demonstrate that every effort is made to assist, support and facilitate both new applicants and those under review.  The opportunity to provide additional information in support of an application is afforded to an individual following refusal on means assessment basis and the avenue for appeal is also advised.  I am aware suggestions have been made in the public domain in recent months that the criteria for awarding discretionary medical cards had changed.  I emphasise that there has been no change to the qualifying criteria for discretionary medical cards in the last year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800047#UU00300","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381261800,"counter":553,"content":"<p>Absolute nonsense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800048#VV00200","speaker":"960"},{"type":"speech","time":1381261800,"counter":554,"content":"<p>Deputies will note that the former Ombudsman was recently reported in the newspapers as stating that her officials' examinations of complaints about the removal of discretionary medical cards revealed nothing substantial had changed in regard to the regulations that applied.

We also have an obligation under the legislation to ensure that those whose situations have improved are not using a service to which they are no longer entitled.  To this end, a critical element of probity in medical card scheme is the ongoing review of client eligibility by the HSE.

To support their argument, they have cited the drop in the number of discretionary cards in the system.  This is the main argument in support of the claim about targeting.  I have demonstrated to the House that a substantial number of those persons who used to have medical cards on discretionary grounds continue to have medical cards, but on income grounds.  Something in the order of 23,000 people of the 24,000 people who no longer have discretionary cards have remained in the system because they have been found to be entitled to medical cards on means grounds in the normal way.<\/p><p>  For these reasons, there is no basis whatsoever to suggest a targeting of people with discretionary medical cards, as has been claimed in the motion and by Deputies.  I commend the Government amendment to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800049#WW00200","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1381262400,"counter":559,"content":"<p>To pick up where the Minister of State left off, it is worth repeating that the number of people with access to free general practitioner, GP, care is the highest in the history of the State.  Some 43% of the population has access to free GP care.  Compared with when the Government took office, more than 250,000 additional people are eligible for free GP care.  At the end of August, almost 2 million people held medical cards or GP visit cards.  The number of discretionary medical cards has fallen.  As the Minister of State demonstrated clearly, this is because almost 23,000 people who would have had discretionary medical cards now hold full medical cards.  In this light, the Opposition motion has a hollow ring to it.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State has clearly outlined to the House the legislative basis for awarding medical cards, particularly those medical cards that are awarded on a discretionary basis.  His thorough description demonstrates how every effort is made to support applicants in applying for medical cards and, in particular, the efforts made to accommodate those who may be in excess of the income limits but who have difficult personal circumstances.  These processes, in themselves, demonstrate how the Government is concerned with looking after people and with making every effort to ensure that those most in need can qualify for the service.  This point is critical.  The Deputies across the way would be the first to jump up and down at the Committee of Public Accounts and in this Chamber if they discovered that people who were not entitled to medical cards had them.  It is important that our limited resources are focused on those who are entitled to and need services the most.<\/p><p>  The number of people who hold medical cards on discretionary grounds has fallen in recent years, as more people who previously were marginally over the normal qualifying limit became eligible for medical cards under the normal qualifying scales.  There has been no change to the qualifying criteria for discretionary medical cards in the past year and the scheme continues to operate in such a way that those who suffer genuine financial hardship as a result of a medical condition receive the benefit of a medical card.  Indeed, I asked that a group of professionals be put in place to consider the issue of hardship because of particular medical needs as well as the normal other issues that can result in hardship for people.<\/p><p>  The processing of medical cards at a national level, rather than at a local level as before mid-2011, ensures that all people are assessed in a similar and fair manner when applying for a medical card.  The HSE set up a clinical panel to assist in the processing of applications for discretionary medical cards where income guidelines had been exceeded but difficult personal circumstances, such as an illness, existed.  The HSE put in place a process whereby a medical doctor would consider the assessment for discretionary medical cards.  In previous years, there was a decentralised process, which meant that there could be inequities throughout the country.  This means that people may have been awarded discretionary medical cards in some parts of the country and not in others because of the lack of a centralised, standardised approach.  This led to inequities and pockets in which there were high numbers of medical cards above what one might have expected.<\/p><p>  A team of medical doctors unrelated to the patient assesses the situation and grants or declines a discretionary medical card on a medical basis.  Previously, different approaches may have been used in different parts of the country.  Now, the process is standardised and there is fair and equitable treatment for all.<\/p><p>  The HSE takes a person's social and medical issues into account when determining whether there is undue hardship for a person in providing a health service for himself or herself or his or her dependants.  The same supports are offered to new applicants and those under review.  Discretionary emergency medical cards may also be awarded.  The HSE has a system in place for the provision of emergency medical cards for patients who are seriously ill and in urgent need of medical care that they cannot afford.  Emergency medical cards are issued by the HSE within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and the letter of confirmation of the condition from a doctor or a medical consultant.<\/p><p>  The HSE issues all emergency cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card as a result of his or her means or undue hardship, and that the applicant will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card.  As a result, emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual with a limited eligibility period of six months.<\/p><p>  The arrangement is slightly different for persons with terminal illnesses.  Once the terminal illness is verified, a patient is given an emergency medical card for six months.  There is no means test and the nature of the terminal illness is not a factor.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that, given the nature and urgency of the issue, the HSE has appropriate escalation routes to ensure that the person gets the card as quickly as possible.  Furthermore, the HSE ensures that the system responds to the variety of circumstances and complexities faced by individuals in these circumstances.<\/p><p>  Deputies will be aware that, under the provisions of the Health Act 1970, as amended, persons who are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange a GP service for themselves or their families qualify for medical cards.  In accordance with this legislation, the assessment for a medical card is required to be determined primarily by reference to the means, including the income and expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependants.  Furthermore, it is clear that every effort is made by the HSE within the framework of the legislation to support applicants in applying for medical cards.  In particular, efforts are made to ensure that those who may be in excess of the income limits but who have difficult personal circumstances are catered for.<\/p><p>  I am aware of how the diagnosis of a serious illness can invoke fear and insecurity for the person affected and his or her family and friends.  Through the systems operating, every effort is made to provide the support needed to avoid further distress.  I am also acutely aware of how, regrettably, certain misinformation or misconceptions reported in latter months on awarding discretionary cards have caused such concern.<\/p><p>  The scheme provides GP and public health nurse services.  I wish to commend those working in our primary care services on their sterling work.  It is one of the most trusted parts of our health service.  Satisfaction with the GP service in this country is second to none.  Being able to see a GP within 24 hours must improve outcomes for our citizens.  However, I would dearly love to see reliable outcome measures so that we might focus on the work that improves outcomes and focus less on some other areas of activity.<\/p><p> It is worth repeating that, since this Government took office, there has been no change to the qualifying criteria for discretionary medical cards in the past year.  Furthermore, there was never a medical card for a specific condition, which is what seems to be implied here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800049#WW00300","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381263000,"counter":561,"content":"<p>We never suggested there was a medical card for a specific condition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800050#XX00200","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1381263000,"counter":562,"content":"<p>Deputy Fleming said it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800050#XX00300","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1381263000,"counter":563,"content":"<p>The scheme continues to operate in such a way that those who suffer genuine financial hardship as a result of a medical condition receive the benefit of a medical card.

Its actions have all been in the opposite direction.  It has increased the cost of primary care for people on medical cards by increasing prescription fees and for non-medical card holders by raising the drug payment scheme threshold.  As this motion points out, it has reduced the number of discretionary medical cards issued, which is an indisputable fact.<\/p><p>  The Government repeatedly points out that the overall number of medical cards, issued on the basis of income, has increased.  The Minister has just made that point.  That is correct but it is not an indicator of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to primary care.  It is, rather, an indicator of the dismal economic failure of this and the previous Government in driving masses of people down to the low levels of income which qualify for a full medical card or a GP visit-only card.<\/p><p>  I have repeatedly raised the issue of medical card restrictions with the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and his Ministers of State, Deputy White and Deputy Kathleen Lynch, both in this Chamber and in committee.  I have also met and lobbied the central medical card administration in Finglas.<\/p><p>  It speaks volumes about the lack of real planning and real substance in the Government&rsquo;s plans for universal health care based on the private insurance model that they fell at the very first hurdle with regard to GP care.  The proposal to begin the roll-out of free GP care for all people in the long-term illness scheme has been abandoned.  Why was it proposed to proceed in that way in the first place?  Why was false hope given to people on that scheme?<\/p><p>  Let us be clear.  Sinn F&eacute;in has long advocated GP care free at the point of delivery for all, funded by fair and reformed general taxation - the funding basis for the truly reformed universal health service that we advocate.  We have long advocated also commencing free GP care for children.  It now seems that the Government may be considering extending free GP care to children under five.  We included that proposal in our alternative budget proposals published today and we hope the Government does indeed proceed in that way, as a first step.  I take this opportunity to advise the Minister that Sinn F&eacute;in will fully support such an initiative or an even more inclusive measure, if that is to be presented in the coming week as a first step.  We must at least agree that a start needs to be made.<\/p><p>  The specific focus of this motion is the discretionary medical card.  We asked the Minister for Health about this matter recently and urged him to ensure that all children diagnosed with cancer are granted, or allowed to retain, medical cards.  This matter arose because it was reported to us, and, I am sure, to other Deputies, that whereas previously the granting of discretionary medical cards to children with cancer had been virtually automatic, in recent times some parents were experiencing refusal or delay.  This was contrary to previous experience and legitimate expectation.<\/p><p>  Last July, when I questioned him on this issue at the Committee on Health and Children, the Minister admitted that discretionary cards are no longer being granted to cancer patients in the same way as previously.  The record shows this.  I pointed to the irony that the Government is promising to extend free GP care to all while at the same time cutting medical cards for some of those who need them most.<\/p><p>  Medical card assessments need to be carried out with appropriate discretion and compassion, and not simply on the basis of the very low income threshold for qualification.  This is clearly a requirement where applicants have life-limiting conditions, including cancer.  The HSE has claimed that there has been no change in criteria for discretionary medical cards but has also admitted that the number of people on discretionary medical cards has indeed decreased, as the figures cited in the motion demonstrate.  It does not take much imagination to see the great distress all this causes to already traumatised parents of children with cancer.<\/p><p>  That distress for parents will be compounded by a reading of the Minister&rsquo;s reply to our recent D&aacute;il question urging him to ensure that all children with cancer get medical cards.  He pointed out that other than on the grounds of income and &ldquo;undue hardship&rdquo; there is no provision for the automatic granting of discretionary medical cards to children with cancer, unless they are terminally ill.  That is a most cruel position.  It is also illogical and medically highly questionable.  In very many cases no one can tell whether a cancer will prove terminal or not.  It depends on a number of critical factors, including how the patient responds to treatment.  What parent wants to provide medical evidence that their child&rsquo;s cancer is terminal, in order to qualify for a discretionary medical card that is valid for six months?<\/p><p>  This only goes to show the inequities and in some cases the cruelties that arise when the principle of universal care on the basis of medical need and medical need alone is not adhered to.  The reality is that the Minister - like the previous Minister, Mary Harney - is shredding our public health services with his regime of cuts and patients are suffering as a result.  That is the real situation.<\/p><p>  A budget over-run on health spending is predicted again this year.  That is no surprise.  We have had successive years of health cutbacks since 2007 with our public health system unable to cope.  Cuts of &euro;781 million in health were imposed by the Minister for the current year.  When Fine Gael and Labour cut over &euro;750 million out of health for 2012, on top of the &euro;1 billion cut in 2011, we said it was unsustainable and would cause huge damage to the health services.  These are cuts, not reforms of health service funding.  They then cut a further &euro;130 million in August 2012.  At the end of 2012, the Minister had to ask the D&aacute;il for an additional &euro;360 million supplementary Estimate to prevent services collapsing before the end of the year.  That is no way to fund and run our public health services.<\/p><p>  As we made clear at our alternative budget launch today, we would discontinue the futile austerity policy.  We would address the deficit by redistributing the burden away from those on low and middle incomes and taking a greater contribution from the highest earners and from wealth.  This is the only approach that can prevent further cuts to health and other public services. <\/p><p>  Look at what has happened to health over the summer.  In July, we saw further restrictions on discretionary medical cards, the focus of this motion.  We found out during the summer that hundreds of young people with severe disabilities, who have finished school, are to be denied the day services they need due to coalition Government cutbacks.  Cutting the allocation from almost &euro;10 million in 2012 to &euro;4 million in 2013 can only be described as callous in the extreme.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, signalled that the Government intends to bring in means testing for home care and other services for older people and people with disabilities.  This was denied subsequently but in the language of the reply to me from the Minister, there is clearly wriggle room for means testing to be sneaked in by the back door. <\/p><p>  We had the cuts to services for people with disabilities at Stewart&rsquo;s Hospital in Palmerstown.  We had the decision to close the 22-bed mental health unit at St. Brigid&rsquo;s in Ballinasloe.  We have had the cuts to services provided by St. Michael&rsquo;s House, one of the largest providers of services to people with disabilities.  Over 2,000 service users are dependent on St. Michael's House.<\/p><p>  In a D&aacute;il reply to me, the Minister stated that in 2012, some 121 HSE executives earned in excess of &euro;100,000.  Between them, total remuneration, including allowances and arrears, amounted to &euro;14.6 million.  He said that a high-level analysis of annualised payroll data from May 2013 indicates that at that time, the number of executives on annual remuneration in excess of &euro;100,000 had risen to 129. <\/p><p>This is scandalous, particularly in light of the cuts imposed on health services, the impact of which is having a devastating affect on the lives of many thousands of vulnerable citizens on a daily basis.  Front-line services, acute and community care, medical cards, disability and mental health services have all been cut while those at the top of the HSE are rewarded time and again.<\/p><p> The Minister, Deputy Reilly, has failed to deliver the level of savings possible from the State&rsquo;s drugs bill.  We estimate that an additional saving of more than &euro;300 million is achievable in 2014.  This is based on figures provided and confirmed by the Minister's Department.  The Minister and his predecessors, back to Deputy Martin, have failed to address the recurring junior hospital doctors crisis resulting in the industrial action which took place at hospitals across the State today.  This action was inevitable given the lengthy failure to implement the working time directive.  It is long past time to implement the directive in full and to bring in the root and branch reform of hospital medical staffing and training that is required.<\/p><p> I support the motion as presented by Deputy Kelleher.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800050#XX00600","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381263600,"counter":567,"content":"<p>Anyone who knocked on doors over the summer months while canvassing or who held regular clinics will have met a substantial number of people who had either lost their medical card in recent weeks or who are likely to do so.  Anecdotally, it was clear that there was a massive change in how medical cards, and in particular discretionary cards, were being allocated.  The motion, which I am glad to support, underlines this fact.  The cold statistics, which we all have, indicate a reduction in these cards from 80,524 at the start of 2011 to 63,126 at the end of 2012 and to 54,984 after the first seven months of this year, which is a huge decrease.  Many people every month are losing discretionary medical cards.  I dislike the word \"discretionary\" as it sounds like a luxury or something extra.  It is anything but.  For many families, it is essential to ensure that they or their loved ones get the treatment they deserve and quite plainly need.<\/p><p>  To illustrate this point, I will give an example.  Bryn Bailey is a young boy of six years of age from my constituency.  When his card expired he was refused the discretionary medical card even though his circumstances were worse than when it was granted.  Only on appeal and after ferocious lobbying by public representatives for four months did he even receive the six month emergency card, which is a mere stop gap.  He was in intensive care in hospital when this emergency six month card was approved.  He is still in hospital four weeks later.  His parents will have to go through this process again when they should be left to concentrate on his care.  Bryn's parents are not looking for cards for themselves but for Bryn who received the card initially on discretionary grounds.  Young Bryn faces challenges in his young life we can only begin to imagine.  Among other things, he suffers from epilepsy, spastic quadric paresis, mitochondriaI disorder, global developmental delay, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, precocious puberty, chronic constipation, hypothermia, microcephaly and right renal calculi.  He has no means of communication, no use of his arms or legs and is wheelchair dependent.  His parents have had to make huge sacrifices to support and care for him.  He requires 24 hour care seven days per week.  His parents are his carers.  They do absolutely everything, from feeding and bathing to physiotherapy for him.  They had to move to a bungalow in 2011 in order to care for Bryn safely.  The rent they receive from their old home does not cover the mortgage on this bungalow.  They need to adapt their car so as to be able to lift Bryn in and out as he now weighs more than 32 kg.  Bryn needs countless medications and equipment, which costs thousands of euro annually.  His card would cover his frequent visits to the GP, outpatient and inpatient visits, procedures and his wheelchair, on which he will depend for the remainder of his life.<\/p><p>  The application to the HSE is accompanied by dozens of letters from doctors, consultants, Bryn's school and so on, all of which contain the message, &quot;Please give this young boy a medical card.&quot;  Bryn is an incredible young man who is battling daily with many conditions.  His parents are the type of parents we would all aspire to be, doing all that they can to help him.  I defy anyone to tell me that he does not deserve a medical card; that he and his parents do not deserve that assistance, which would require very little effort from the authorities.<\/p><p>  Bryn is not the only one in this situation.  There are countless others like him and his family who are truly struggling and relied on the medical card.  Now that it has been withdrawn they do not know what to do.  The Government made a conscious decision to target these cards even though it was aware that many, indeed the bulk of those who would lose these cards, had received them on the basis of clinical evidence and a clinical need.  This is needless bullying on the part of the Government of the sick and the vulnerable.  It needs to halted now.  People such as Bryn Bailey should not be deprived of their discretionary medical cards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800051#YY00200","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speech","time":1381263600,"counter":568,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Deputy Seamus Healy, whom I understand is sharing time with Deputy Pringle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800051#YY00300","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1381263600,"counter":569,"content":"<p>I support this motion in regard to discretionary medical cards.  This is an issue about which I am deeply concerned.  The withdrawal of medical cards from sick and elderly people is in my view an act of social vandalism.  It is shameful in the extreme.  It is an attack on the sick and the elderly, the most vulnerable in our society.  The Labour Party should be ashamed of its involvement in this matter.  Not only are Connolly and Larkin turning in their graves, so too are Brendan Corish and Frank Closkey.  They would not have countenanced such an attack on sick and elderly people.<\/p><p>  This Government must stop terrorising sick and elderly people across the country.  This is what is happening.  The Government's austerity policies are targeting sick and elderly people.  It is targeting the medical cards of current medical card holders across the country.  This policy is being implemented by the Health Service Executive on behalf of the Government.  It is not possible to overstate the fact that sick and elderly people are traumatised and living in daily fear of losing their medical cards.  The post man or woman, always a welcome sight for sick and elderly people, is now a source of anxiety lest he or she might bring the dreaded white envelope in which is a letter stating their card is under review and may be withdrawn.<\/p><p>  Let us be clear about what is happening.  Sick and elderly people are being targeted by this Government in order to protect banks, bondholders and the 10,000 top earners in this country who each earn &euro;595,000 per annum.  It has always been the position that people with serious medical conditions in need of urgent or ongoing medical care qualified for a discretionary medical card.  This is still the stated policy of the Health Service Executive.  However, it has now <i>de facto<\/i> changed and is not being implemented.  Medical cards are being withdrawn.  The fact is that many people with cancer and motor neuron disease are being denied medical cards or are having existing cards withdrawn.  Another section of society affected is the elderly, including people from their sixties to their nineties whose cards are not due for review and are valid, having been assessed, approved and issued by the HSE, in some cases, up to 2020.  These people are being punished by this Government to satisfy the greed of bankers and bondholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100800051#YY00400","speaker":"960"},{"type":"speech","time":1381263600,"counter":570,"content":"<p>I support the motion.
