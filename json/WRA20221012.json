This is why the Government introduced a &euro;2.4 billion package of supports 2022 and a package of one-off measures worth &euro;2.5 billion in the Budget 2023 cost of living package. <\/p><p>The Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Payment credited &euro;176.22 (excluding VAT) to domestic electricity accounts, including pay as you go accounts,\u00a0through April, May and June this year. Upon the scheme&rsquo;s conclusion on 30 June over 2.1 million domestic electricity accounts had received the payment with the value of these payments totalling almost &euro;377 million. This means that 99.36% of eligible domestic electricity accounts had the credit applied.<\/p><p>Included in the Budget 2023 package is a new Electricity Cost Emergency Benefit Scheme through which &euro;550.47 (exclusive of VAT) will be credited to each domestic electricity account, including Pay as You Go accounts, in three payments of &euro;183.49 through the November\/December 2022, January\/February 2023 and March\/April 2023 billing cycles. <\/p><p>This is in addition to an extension of the 9% VAT rate on electricity and gas until February 2023 and lump sum payments to social welfare recipients of schemes such as the Fuel Allowance, the Living Alone Allowance, and the Working Family payment.The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU),\u00a0was assigned responsibility for the regulation of the Irish electricity and gas markets following the enactment of the Electricity Regulation Act (ERA), 1999. As part of its statutory role, the CRU also has consumer protection functions and sets out the obligations on suppliers in the Electricity and Gas Suppliers Handbooks. Further detail is available at <i>www.cru.ie\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CRU21111a-Electricity-and-Gas-Suppliers-Handbook-2021.pdf<\/i>.<\/p><p>Furthermore, as part of Responses 6 and 7 under the National Energy Security Framework, CRU have announced enhanced consumer protection measures for implementation this winter. For pay as you go customers, these strengthened protections include:<\/p><p>-  increased emergency credit of no less than &euro;20; <\/p><p>-  an obligation on suppliers to advise their prepayment customers in debt, of other payment options available to them, including bill pay; <\/p><p>-  debt repayment levels will reduce from 10% from a previous 25% on pay-as-you-go customers top-up payments, whereby, on a &euro;20 top-up only &euro;2 will go towards debt repayment (if it exists), rather than &euro;5 previously; and,<\/p><p>-  an obligation on suppliers to place their customers who are on financial hardship meters on the most economic tariff for them.<\/p><p>The obligations set out in the Supplier Handbooks include special provisions for vulnerable customers on billing and disconnection. A vulnerable customer is defined as a household customer who is critically dependent on electrically powered equipment, which includes, but is not limited to, life protecting devices, assistive technologies to support independent living and medical equipment. This category of vulnerable customers cannot be disconnected for non-payment at any time.<\/p><p>Vulnerable customers are also defined as those who are particularly vulnerable to disconnection during the winter months for reasons of advanced age or physical, sensory, intellectual or mental health. The moratorium on disconnections for this group has been extended to 6 months (1 October to 31 March). The moratorium applies to bill pay customers. It is important that people who are in such a situation contact their energy supplier to register with them as a vulnerable customer. Their electricity supplier will then notify ESB Networks. ESBN maintains a Vulnerable Customer Register based on the information provided to them by suppliers.<\/p><p>Given, the challenges that all\u00a0households will face this winter I met with the CRU and suppliers to discuss the situation on the ground and the practical supports,\u00a0such as hardship funds,\u00a0for\u00a0pay-as-you-go customers. As with all customers it is important that if someone finds it is difficult to maintain their credit that they contact their supplier as soon as possible. Energy suppliers also work with NGOs such as MABS and St. Vincent de Paul.

This provides an opportunity for all areas of the non-domestic sector to not only reduce their electricity bills, but to visibly demonstrate their commitment to sustainability and Ireland&rsquo;s broader climate action goals.At the current high electricity prices, businesses, including the community groups, have the potential to save &euro;2,000-3,000 per annum from a solar PV system supported under this scheme. Moreover, with the introduction of the Clean Export Guarantee (CEG), any residual renewable electricity not consumed on the premises is now eligible for an export payment which further supports the investment. This means that the installation can pay for itself quickly &ndash; thus helping to protect businesses and organisations across the country against rising energy prices into the future.

The responsiveness and competitiveness of Ireland's maritime transport industry are underpinned by National Ports Policy 2013. It has helped foster competition between ports and ensure minimal barriers to entry for shipping companies seeking to enter the Irish market.<\/p>  <p>  The aim of the National Ports Policy is to facilitate a competitive and effective market for maritime transport services and to ensure that the system has adequate and efficient capacity. It included a commitment to undertake regular independent assessments of port capacity starting in 2018.  A consultancy team were contracted to assess the capacity of Ireland&rsquo;s port network.   However, COVID-19, Brexit, and more recently the Russian\/Ukraine conflict have been a key priority for stakeholders and has delayed this work.<\/p>  <p>  The national and international environment for which the 2013 policy was developed has changed fundamentally. As Minister, I recognise that a new approach is needed to assist our ports with the environmental, technological, demographic, and geopolitical challenges of the next decade and beyond.<\/p>  <p>  In line with National Development Project objectives and National Ports Policy, the State ports are continuing to progress projects under their Masterplans. The Ports of Dublin, Cork, Shannon Foynes and Rosslare will spend &euro;144m in capital expenditure in 2022 and almost &euro;500m over the next five years. These non-exchequer funded investments will enhance Ireland&rsquo;s capacity and connectivity and will allow the ports to respond to market needs, handle increases in ship sizes and frequency and serve the import and export needs of the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101200067#WRD00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"question","counter":101,"qnumday":36,"qnumall":"[50512\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101200067#WRD00700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if his attention has been drawn to a report (details supplied) regarding the readiness of ports for the construction and installation of offshore wind; if he has considered the report and plans to ensure that Irish ports are ready to construct and install offshore wind farms; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1507","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":102,"content":"<p>I welcome the contents of the National Ports Study commissioned by Wind Energy Ireland (WEI) which provides a useful profile of port infrastructure and the proposed development plans of the port companies for both fixed and floating installations. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has ambitious plans with regard to the development of Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) in the Seas around Ireland.

This includes the establishment of a Ports Co-Ordination Committee in this Department which involves ports and relevant Departments to ensure alignment with Government policy in the delivery of the port projects. <\/p>  <p>  Work is also underway in the Department of Environment, Communications and Climate in preparation for the holding of the Offshore Renewable Energy Support Scheme (ORESS1) auction.

The CEF criteria was extended in 2021 to allow EU funding of port infrastructure for ORE for ports (or terminals within ports) on the Trans European Network for Transport (TEN-T). This is significant as successful applicants can obtain grant funding of up to 50% of eligible costs for studies and up 30% of infrastructure works costs. This is a competitive process and generally oversubscribed.  While the outcome of the 2021 CEF call was disappointing, the 2022 CEF call is now underway.   It is expected that ports, including Rosslare Europort, will be making new applications for EU funding under that call.  The Department assists, as appropriate, eligible applicants with the application process.

Until the changes I brought in as part of the Finance Act 2019, Ireland&rsquo;s vehicle benefit-in-kind regime was unusual in that there was no overall CO2 rationale in the regime. This is despite a CO2 based vehicle BIK regime being legislated for as far back as 2008 (but never having been commenced).<\/p>  <p>  In Finance Act 2019, I legislated for a CO2-based BIK regime for company cars from 1 January 2023. From that date the amount taxable as BIK remains determined by the car&rsquo;s original market value (OMV) and the annual business kilometres driven, while new CO2 emissions-based bands will determine whether a standard, discounted, or surcharged rate is taxable. The number of mileage bands is reduced from five to four. EVs will benefit from a preferential rate of BIK, ranging from 9 &ndash; 22.5% depending on mileage. Fossil-fuel vehicles will be subject to higher BIK rates, up to 37.5%. This new structure with CO2-based discounts and surcharges will incentivise employers to provide employees with low-emission cars.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware there have been arguments surrounding the mileage bands in the new BIK structure as they can be perceived as incentivising higher mileage to avail of lower rates, leading to higher levels of emissions. The rationale behind the mileage bands is that the greater the business mileage, the more the car is a benefit to the company rather than its employee (on average); and the more the car depreciates in value, the less of a benefit it is to the employee (in years 2 and 3) as the asset from which the benefit is derived is depreciating faster. Mileage bands also ensure that cars more integral to the conduct of business receive preferential tax treatment.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that better value for money for the taxpayer is achieved by curtailing the amount of subsidies available and building an environmental rationale directly into the BIK regime. It was determined in this context that reforming the BIK system to include emissions bands provides for a more sustainable environmental rationale than the continuation of the current system with exemptions for electric vehicles (EVs). This will bring the taxation system around company cars into step with other CO2-based motor taxes as well as the long-established CO2-based vehicle BIK regimes in other member states.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above and  in light of government commitments on climate change, Budget 2022 extended the preferential BIK treatment for EVs to end 2025 with a tapering mechanism on the vehicle value threshold. This BIK exemption forms part of a broader series of very generous measures to support the uptake of EVs, including a reduced rate of 7% VRT, a VRT relief of up to &euro;5,000, low motor tax of &euro;120 per annum, SEAI grants, discounted tolls fees, and 0% BIK on electric charging. <\/p>  <p>  This new BIK charging mechanism was legislated for in 2019 and was announced as part of Budget 2020, therefore providing a sufficient lead in time to adapt to this new system before its implementation in 2023. There are no plans to review it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101200067#WRD04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes","counter":137,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101200067#WRD04300"},{"type":"question","counter":138,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[50705\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101200067#WRD04400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the rationale behind limiting the business energy support scheme to those businesses that fall under Case I income category given that Case II Income businesses pay tax as well and have incurred a rise in energy costs too.","asker":"1553","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":139,"content":"<p>I indicated in my Budget speech that I would be introducing a Temporary Business Energy Support scheme (TBESS) to assist businesses with their energy costs over the winter months.<\/p><p>The scheme is being designed to be compliant with the EU state aid temporary crisis framework and will need to be approved by the EU Commission in advance of making payments. <\/p><p>The TBESS will be open to businesses that carry on a Case I trade, are tax compliant and have experienced a significant increase in their natural gas and electricity costs.

The purpose of the SSHA is to capture the total number of households qualified for social housing support across the country whose social housing need has not yet been met, in order to better understand the level of need for such support. It sets out the categories of need under which all applicants have applied for social housing supports, including those with a disability. <\/p><p>My Department introduced a revised social housing application form in March 2021 in consultation with the local authority sector. The changes made provided an application form that is more customer focused, and which is more streamlined and accessible for the applicant. The application form already provided for applicants to identify housing requirements arising from a disability or medical condition, but now also includes an identifier for persons requiring 'wheelchair liveable' accommodation. In order to ensure that data captured in the SSHA aligns with the changes to the application form my Department recently collaborated with the Local Government Management Agency and the Housing Agency on a project to assess how this can best be achieved. This work is completed and the SSHA 2022 report will include the number of applicants on the housing waiting list who require &lsquo;wheelchair liveable&rsquo; accommodation.<\/p><p>My Department does not hold information on the allocation of housing supports and the oversight and practical management of housing waiting lists, including the allocation and transfer of tenancies, is solely a matter for the relevant local authority in accordance with the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, and associated regulations.

This information may be available directly from local authorities.<\/p><p>The National Planning Framework (Objective 37) requires each local authority to carry out a Housing Needs Demand Assessment (HNDA) in order to correlate and accurately align overall future housing requirements, as an evolution of their existing Housing Strategy requirements under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  The HNDA framework also aims to ensure support of independent living for people requiring more specialised types of housing or support needs, including accessible and wheelchair housing. <\/p><p>The initiation, design, planning, development and management of housing projects is a matter for local authorities in exercise of their statutory functions.

A CWO is available as required either on an appointment basis or if an emergency need arises Monday to Friday. <\/p>  <p>  The Community Welfare Service continues to provide local access to local CWOs in local areas across the country and there are no plans to change this aspect of the service.  CWOs can facilitate urgent and in-person meetings in 51 Intreo Centres, across business hours, five days per week.  In addition to meeting citizens in Intreo Centres, Branch Offices and DSP offices, CWOs can facilitate an appointment within a short time of a person requiring such a meeting, at a mutually agreed location, including at the person's home. I have not received any complaints or adverse feedback from customers regarding access to the Community Welfare Service. <\/p>  <p>  Any person who needs to access the Community Welfare Service can also call the recently established National CWS freephone phoneline which is available at 0818 60 70 80 to make an appointment within a short time of a person requiring such a meeting, at a mutually agreed location, including at the person's home.   More and more customers are availing of the opportunity to have their issues resolved by this method rather than by calling into an office. <\/p>  <p>  A modern Community Welfare Service should be easily accessible to all customers and for this reason, customers no longer have to meet in person with a CWO to make a claim. This significant change ensures enhanced access to the Community Welfare Service.  <\/p>  <p>  It means, for instance, that those citizens living in Carrick on Suir who require community welfare assistance no longer have to meet with a CWO if that is more convenient for them.  The application form, SWA1, is widely available.  It can be downloaded at www.gov.ie.   It is available in all Intreo Centres and Branch Offices.  It can also now be requested by emailing cwsforms@welfare.ie  or by calling 0818 60 70 80.  Customers can also request a SWA1 form by using the Request Application Form page available on www.gov.ie.  The completed application form should be returned to my Department where it will be processed promptly.  <\/p>  <p>  This is a new addition to the service, and it does not replace or diminish face-to-face meetings with a CWO.  Depending on the person's needs a direct home visit appointment or a call to another mutually agreed location can be arranged, including at the person&rsquo;s home and customers in Carrick on Suir can meet a CWO by appointment at the Social Welfare Branch Office in Carrick on Suir. <\/p>  <p>  The Community Welfare Service is ready to provide a flexible service to meet the different needs of customers, who may find themselves in a financially difficult or vulnerable situation. It is important that this service is easily accessible and responsive to customer needs. While changes to modernise and improve the service for customers are a feature of the Community Welfare Service, the delivery of a locally based CWS remains and will continue to remain a cornerstone of the service.<\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101200070#WRG04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits","counter":300,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101200070#WRG04100"},{"type":"question","counter":301,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[50406\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101200070#WRG04200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if a complete reappraisal of an application for domiciliary care allowance can be undertaken in the case of a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":302,"content":"<p>Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) is a monthly payment in respect of a child, aged under 16 with a severe disability who requires continual or continuous care and attention substantially over and above the care and attention normally required by a child of the same age and the child must be likely to require this level of care and attention for at least 12 consecutive months.

This is the mechanism established by the Oireachtas to provide for the processes relating to funding under the NHSS and the negotiation of prices for services for private and voluntary providers with the designated State agency, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). Maximum prices for individual nursing homes are agreed with the NTPF following negotiations and based on the NTPF&rsquo;s cost criteria. These criteria include:<\/p><p>- Costs reasonably incurred by the nursing home<\/p><p>- Local market prices<\/p><p>- Historic prices- Overall budgetary capacity<\/p><p>  The NTPF carry out this role independently under the NHSS Act 2009 and there is no role for Ministers or the Department in these negotiations. It should also be noted that the Department continues to work with the NTPF to take forward the recommended actions that emerged from the review of the NTPF pricing system published in June 2021.<\/p><p>  I am aware that a number of nursing homes have closed this year, with several new closures notified in recent weeks. The closure of any nursing homes reduces bed capacity and puts pressure on other local health and social care facilities, including acute hospitals. Ensuring the welfare and safety of residents is secured when nursing homes close is the most important thing and work to alleviate the concerns of nursing home residents must continue.<\/p><p>  All nursing homes, as registered providers with HIQA, have well-established obligations under the legal framework in terms of the delivery of safe care to residents.  As per regulations, HIQA must also be notified of any closure with 6 months&rsquo; notice. It is essential that when nursing homes are intending to close, residents and their families are consulted with and given appropriate notice so that new homes can be found and they can be moved in a safe, planned way. The continued wellbeing of nursing home residents and their families remains my continued focus.<\/p><p>  The Government has provided substantial supports to the nursing home sector over the course of the pandemic. Over &euro;144 million has been claimed by nursing homes under the Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme (TAPS) since its introduction in 2020. The Government has now agreed to extend TAPS to the end of the year by maintaining the availability of Outbreak Assistance support. The scheme will also be refocused on addressing this year's inflationary pressures related to energy and heating, whilst continuing to support nursing homes with the cost of managing COVID-19 outbreaks. Details are being finalised and these will be communicated in the coming days. <\/p><p>  Substantial additional supports have also been provided by the HSE in terms of serial testing, PPE, the deployment of specialist teams and other services. Many of these supports continue. Finally, in response to the strategic workforce challenges in the nursing home and home care sector, a Cross-Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group was established earlier this year. The Group has been working to a tight timeline and is currently finalising a report which will outline a set of recommendations for my consideration.<\/p><p>  Respite care may be based in the community within the persons own home or in residential care settings through HSE managed facilities, by agreement with local\/ national voluntary organisations or by contracted private facilities. As of 31 August 2022, the HSE Bed Public Register for Older Persons reports that there are 1,466 short stay beds available across our public residential units. 225 of these beds are identified as general respite and a further 24 beds defined as dementia specific. There are also a further 189 beds categorised for convalescent care, which may also be used for respite purposes. In CHO 4 the register reports that there are 142 short stay beds, of which 42 are identified as respite with a further 50 identified as for convalescent care. It is important to note that these figures relate to publicly managed residential units and do not take into account respite beds sourced though contractual arrangement with voluntary or private agencies. In addition, Transitional Care funding continues to support discharging patients who have completed their acute care and who required long stay residential care under the Nursing Home Support Scheme or who required convalescence up to 4 weeks prior to returning home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101200074#WRL01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dental Services ","counter":474,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101200074#WRL02000"},{"type":"question","counter":475,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[50408\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101200074#WRL02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of adults and children who are on public dental and orthodontic waiting lists for each month of the years 2017 to 2021 and to date in 2022, by county, region and CHO in tabular form.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":476,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101200074#WRL02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":478,"qnumday":162,"qnumall":"[50409\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101200074#WRL02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of claims that were made under the dental treatment services scheme;

These are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.<\/p>  <p>  Under the LTI scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge.

In accordance with the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. The HSE assesses each application on a qualifying financial threshold. This is the amount of money that an individual can earn a week and still qualify for a card and is specific to the individual&rsquo;s own financial circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding persons aged 70 or older, the medical card assessment is based on gross income. The weekly gross income thresholds for eligibility to a medical card for those aged 70 and over were increased in November 2020 and are currently &euro;550 per week for a single person and &euro;1,050 for a couple. However, It should be noted that those aged over 70 can also be assessed under the general means tested scheme where there are particularly high costs, e.g., medication, nursing home fees. Furthermore, the Deputy may be aware that, since 2015, every individual aged 70 and over has automatic eligibility for a GP visit card.<\/p>  <p>  Persons aged 69 and under are assessed under the general means tested medical card thresholds which are based on an applicant&rsquo;s household income after tax and the deduction of PRSI and the Universal Social Charge. The means assessment determines an applicant&rsquo;s eligibility allowing for taking account of one&rsquo;s eligible expenses from their income. Given that this is a net assessment, it means that where one&rsquo;s income or allowable expenses change there will be an impact on the decision about one&rsquo;s eligibility. Examples of allowable expenses include rent, mortgage, insurance, childcare, maintenance, nursing home costs, (detailed guidelines are available at: www2.hse.ie\/file-library\/medical-cards\/medical-cards-national-assessment-guidelines.pdf).<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that certain social welfare payments are not included in the means assessment for a medical card.  Changes to the rates in Budget 2023 include changes to these non-assessed payments and, therefore, changes will not have any bearing on the outcome of a medical card assessment. For other social welfare payments that are assessed as income for a medical card, it is noted that the increase in the rates in Budget 2023 would not be expected to make a substantial difference to the outcome of the assessment process.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputies that, to ensure the medical card system is responsive and sensitive to people's needs, my Department keeps medical card issues, including the current medical card income thresholds under review and any changes are considered in the context of Government policy and other issues which may be relevant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101200075#WRM02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service","counter":524,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101200075#WRM02100"},{"type":"question","counter":525,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[50541\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101200075#WRM02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will urgently provide home help hours to a person (details supplied) in County Cork who has recently been discharged from hospital.","asker":"1521","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":526,"content":"<p>As this is an operational matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101200075#WRM02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":527,"content":"<p>Question No. 178 answered with Question No. 176.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services","counter":528,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101200075#WRM02500"},{"type":"question","counter":529,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[50552\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101200075#WRM02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of senior occupational therapists who work with the children&rsquo;s disability network teams, CDNTs;

Although the strain of avian influenza currently in circulation in wild birds in Ireland (HPAI H5N1) is considered by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC)\/HSE to be of low risk to humans, current advice from the HPSC\/HSE and DAFM to the public is from a general health perspective is not to approach or handle sick or dead wild birds at this time. Dogs should be kept on a lead and not allowed to approach sick, injured or dead birds.<\/p>  <p>  In locations where HPAI has been confirmed further sampling may not be required from that location.
