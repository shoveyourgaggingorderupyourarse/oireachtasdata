Commercial operators have invested more than &euro;2.75 billion in upgrading and modernising their networks over the past five years.  In 2012 fewer than 700,000, or 30%, of all 2.3 million Irish premises had access to high-speed broadband.  When this Government came into office, this had risen to 52%.

The facts remain that the Government committed back in 2012 to roll out high-speed broadband to areas that were not commercially viable.  People made decisions in this regard but there has been little or no progress since.  It is the case that a final tender was submitted in September.  However, back when the Government negotiated the programme for Government, the projected date for the signing of that contract was June 2017.  We are no closer to it now than we were then.  What we need from Government is a clear timeline of completion of its work.  I have some issues with the Smyth report but it is completed.  I cannot understand, nor can most people, the necessity of these ongoing discussions within the Minister's Department.  He knows what is required.  This has been ongoing for a very considerable period.  What we now need is action and timelines in order that we bring some certainty to the people who have waited far too long for this really important service.  The work the Department agreed under an arrangement with Eir to roll out broadband to 300,000 homes throughout the country has infuriated as many people as it has resolved issues for them.  A house that is one house beyond an area that Eir has committed to serving will not get broadband.  There is no sign of it happening.

We import from just one source in Scotland. <\/p>  <p>  The Shannon LNG project has been designated am EU project of common interest.  Ireland has supported that designation as it offers Ireland the potential for improved security of supply.<\/p>  <p>  In August 2018 Shannon LNG announced it had entered into an agreement with New Fortress Energy to develop the proposed LNG terminal at Ballylongford, County Kerry.  As this is a private commercial project, any future investment decisions on the development of this project are ultimately the responsibility of the project promoters, subject to compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400005#C01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1260"},{"type":"speech","time":1548326700,"counter":42,"content":"<p>The Minister of State did not say that it increases security.

Providing adequate charging infrastructure is critical to ensure the continued growth in the uptake of electric vehicles.  There are currently 668 standard public charge points in the ESB's ecars network and a further limited number provided by local authorities and retail outlets.  There are also 77 fast chargers, mainly on national routes.  Most standard public chargers can provide approximately 100 km of range in one hour whereas fast chargers typically provide 100 km of range in 20 minutes.  Since the start of last year, a &euro;600 grant has been in place for home chargers and over 1,000 grants have been paid out to date.  Under the first call for applications from the climate action fund, I approved funding of up to &euro;10 million to support ESB ecars to develop a nationwide, state-of-the-art electric vehicle fast charging network.  The key elements include six high speed charging hubs on motorways capable of charging eight vehicles simultaneously; 16 high speed charging hubs capable of charging four vehicles simultaneously; additional high power chargers at 34 current 50 kW locations; upgrading over 50 22 kW chargers to 50 kW, and replacing up to 264 locations with 528 charge points at the pre-existing pilot grade of 22 kW to next generation high reliability models.  It is an ambitious programme.  New EU regulations will require employers with over 20 parking spaces to provide charging points by 2020.  This is in addition to the requirements in respect of new developments for both commercial and multiple dwelling developments.  As part of the climate action plan I am developing, I intend to look at the adequacy of the infrastructure and its path of growth to ensure we can meet the ambitious target we have set for electric vehicles in the network.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400008#F01000","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1548328500,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the reply.  The Minister has outlined some of the progress and indicated that there are 668 ESB charging points.  He further stated that his Department had provided a &euro;10 million grant to the ESB.  The Minister said there will be private charging points such as those which employers with more than 20 car spaces will be required to provide by 2020.  While that will cater for a lot of it, there is a need to create a network nationally which is more substantial and strategically located.  For people travelling from the west, south or even midlands, the question of range is always at issue, in particular when one's lights and window wipers are going at the same time as everything else.  I ask about the policy direction on the ownership of the network.  From where is the policy that the ESB must divest itself of the network coming?  Is it the Department?  Charging is not like refuelling a diesel or petrol car, it is a major investment.

The expectation is that many more entrants will come into the market when the service is no longer free.  The other network is that of the local authorities which have been very conscious of trying to develop a network which deals with range anxiety.  We are also considering whether the role of local authorities can be enhanced and whether they can be supported in this context.  There will be a mixture of public and private provision.  The key is that when charging is no longer entirely free, those who have obligations to meet will get some recompense and that will promote greater density in the network.  I will be assessing this carefully in the context of the plan to ensure we have it right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400008#F01200","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1548328500,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I refer to the chargers in the ESB's network currently.

I understand the rate is high compared with that in other European countries.  That is the reason the regulator gives and has given in the past, but the problem is it does not deal with the issue of price because people are given a reduced price for a short period only.

It warned him that without immediate action it believed the future viability of the cervical screening programme would be in jeopardy.

Before answering the Deputy&rsquo;s political charges and questions, I want to reassure the many women who understandably want to know exactly what is going on.<\/p>  <p>  In May, the Minister for Health made the decision to offer free out-of-cycle smear tests to women who were concerned about their health following issues which had emerged regarding the CervicalCheck controversy.  This decision was made in good faith to address the considerable fears of many anxious women throughout the country.  The Government&rsquo;s approach has always been to seek to provide reassurance to women and to be fully transparent about that.  This clearly heightened concern and awareness around CervicalCheck, and the offer of free out-of-cycle smear tests has contributed to capacity issues - it is not a resource issue - resulting in the emergence of a backlog.

It is entirely inaccurate to claim that the repeat smears which women were offered have expired.  The new issue is separate to this and relates to one company only of the three involved in providing screening services.  Quest Diagnostics has advised CervicalCheck of a specific problem with standard human papillomavirus, HPV, tests which have been carried out outside of the manufacturer's recommended timeframe since secondary HPV screening was introduced.  The HSE's clinical review has assured women that this poses very little risk to women's health.  Evidence shows that HPV tests of this kind are effective outside of manufacturers&rsquo; recommended timeframes.<\/p>  <p>  However, as a precaution, the HSE will be writing to women to attend their GPs for repeat smear tests to confirm the results and to provide them with the reassurance to which they are entitled.  The HSE expects up to 6,000 women are likely to be recalled for a repeat smear.  These tests will be processed by the laboratory as a priority.<\/p>  <p>  Regardless of the politics of this issue, all in this House have an obligation to reassure women and give accurate information on what is being discussed and how we are going to solve it.

The cost of the proposed national children's hospital is spiralling out of control and will have serious impacts on other health projects over this year and beyond.  On Tuesday, 500 ambulance personnel staged a strike because the HSE bluntly and blatantly refuses to recognise the union seeking to represent members.  There is now a scenario where thousands of letters are being delivered to patients, many of whom have waited for long periods, telling them surgeries have been postponed because of the inevitable industrial action from nurses and midwives because of the Government's continued failure to address a recruitment and retention crisis.  To top all of this, in the past 24 hours another CervicalCheck scandal has emerged, as serious issues have arisen relating to the screening programme.  We have a health service that is in a state of constant chaos, and nobody on the Government benches seems to be willing to accept the seriousness of the position.<\/p>  <p>  The latest developments concerning CervicalCheck will be a source of serious concern and worry for many women.  We have been assured the risk to women is low but it is yet another example of the incompetence that prevails in a chaotic system.  Guaranteeing free smear tests for all women in the aftermath of the CervicalCheck scandal was the correct action but the Minister, Deputy Harris, announced that move without first consulting with GPs or labs.  Ensuring the labs had the capacity to deliver on the increased workload and complete the tests within the necessary time would have been correct as it would have avoided the problems we now see.  Lo and behold, we are now witnessing serious issues again.<\/p>  <p>  When this scandal was its height last year and people were demanding information and accountability, the buzzword was \"confidence\" and we can hear it again today.  Building public confidence in the cervical cancer screening programme is necessary as we know screening saves lives.  Problems like this, however,  rock the confidence of people in the process.  We have been told that the Minister, Deputy Harris, was informed in December but will the T&aacute;naiste be a bit more specific about when the Minister found out that the screening was inadequate and retests would have to be done for up to 6,000 patients?  Why will it be February before these women can be informed that they need to have another test?  That will be two months later so what has the Minister done in the intervening period?  Why is it so late in the day while women have not been informed that the information they may have received on their second test - this would have been done because of a potential abnormality in the first test - could be inaccurate because it was done outside the timeframe stipulated by the manufacturer?  How can we be assured that this is the end of the matter and no more women will get a letter to the door or a phone call from a GP telling them information relayed to them relating to life-saving screening may be inaccurate?  Will the T&aacute;naiste answer those questions and clarify for those concerned women out there that this is the end of the matter, a line has been drawn under it and we can now move on?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400013#L00600","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1548331500,"counter":150,"content":"<p>Managing a health service in any country always throws up significant challenges at different times because mistakes are made and need to be fixed.

This is the secondary test when low-grade changes are detected.  The HSE is working with Quest Diagnostics, which is one of the three laboratories used by the cervical cancer screening programme, to address the situation that has been identified regarding HPV tests.  Of the approximately 500,000 samples tested by Quest since 2015, the HSE has advised that some HPV tests have been performed outside of the recommended 30-day timeframe.  I am assured that this issue affects a very small portion of people, approximately 1%, of the tested total.  There will be cases where this means that a woman who has already had a test will be written to and requested to present for a re-test on a precautionary basis.  The HSE will write to those women and their GPs next week to request that they return for a further test.  It is expected that up 6,000 women will be invited to attend for a repeat test.  These tests will be processed by the laboratory as a priority.  The HSE has advised that all of the evidence suggests that even though the test was done outside of the 30-day window, the original results are still very reliable.  Consequently, can we please try to reassure people here that there is no cause for undue concern?  This is about full transparency because that is what patients should be entitled to expect.

The T&aacute;naiste is right; all of us in this House support medical screening for the early detection of cancer and other diseases.  The medical evidence that screening saves lives is overwhelming and we all need to ensure that we encourage men and women to avail of all screening opportunities.  In that context, it is essential that we and the public have full confidence in all our screening systems, including CervicalCheck.  However, there has been a litany of problems.  We know of the suffering and courage of the group of 221 women and we will continue to press the Government to respond to their needs.  We now see that 1,000 smears have been compromised over the summer due to delays.  The smears were waiting too long in the queue to be examined in the laboratory and now women need to have those smears repeated.  In the latest twist that was unveiled yesterday, it appears that a further 6,000 tests, a figure we only received late last night, are compromised due to HPV testing in the same laboratory, which has led to technical problems that, again, require those 6,000 women to endure a repeat test.  The delay in getting the cervical smear test is now 22 weeks according to the HSE.  If there are problems with the check and a re-check is required, this results in a further delay of 22 weeks.  Many women are availing of private healthcare options to get a faster check but that is not an option for everybody.  It is another example of the two-tier system.  I was contacted by somebody today who said that when she was told about this inordinate delay, she was advised that she could get a fast test if she paid for it.<\/p>  <p>  Delays in CervicalCheck are also causing delays to life-saving procedures.  For example, if women are to get a number of other medical procedures such as kidney transplants, they need up-to-date smear tests.  The delay in getting that check can cause delays to other life-saving procedures.  How much scandal can the screening programme take?  We are in favour of screening but the problems besetting CervicalCheck indicate that something is deeply wrong.  These problems are further eroding confidence in screening and people are anxious.  <\/p>  <p>  On behalf of the Government, can the T&aacute;naiste confirm how much additional funding was allocated to CervicalCheck last year?  Will the Government commit to full staffing and funding so that we can get CervicalCheck back on track and delivering the quality service we all want?

It is Government policy that the ESB's coal-burning power station at Moneypoint in County Clare will cease production by 2025.  Moneypoint is an old coal-burning station, which at its full capacity has the capacity to provide 900 MW of power and which plays a very important role in electricity generation in Ireland.  It provides a cheap, stable source of electricity.  The closure of the plant at Moneypoint presents the Government with a major problem in maintaining sufficient production of reasonably priced energy for a growing economy while meeting its international climate change obligations.  According to EUROSTAT, the cost of producing electricity in Ireland in 2017 was quite high.  Burning coal leaves a huge carbon footprint, which results in Ireland facing large fines of up to &euro;600 million for missing its carbon emission targets and climate change obligations.  Emitting greenhouse gases comes at a price.<\/p>  <p>  What will replace the power station at Moneypoint in 2025?  How will the ESB replace its capacity to generate power if the station is closed completely?  What are the plans in that regard?  Can Moneypoint be converted into a station which uses an alternative source of energy such as biomass or gas?  Can electricity generated from renewable sources such as offshore wind energy and tidal energy, which is available in abundance in the Shannon Estuary, be harnessed and channelled through Moneypoint?  Can the station be used as a landfall location for electricity produced from such renewable sources?<\/p>  <p>  Moneypoint is an important part of the electricity grid structure, the high-voltage lines of which radiate across the country.  The question is whether it can generate enough renewable energy to replace that generated by coal.  Will the T&aacute;naiste give me an indication of what the Government plans to do in respect of the plant at Moneypoint, which will cease burning coal in six years?

Moneypoint, and energy generation generally, is a little different because it is in the traded sector and so does not have as direct an impact in terms of our national targets as do other emission sources.  Having said that, it is inappropriate to produce power from coal any longer.  We have to give the ESB the time to find viable alternatives that can use the significant grid infrastructure that connects Moneypoint across this country.  The station is connected to two 400 kV lines and is the most significant piece of electricity grid infrastructure we have so we should be using it in the future to transport power around this island.  However, we have to find alternatives to coal in order to do that.  It is up to the ESB to work with the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to find alternatives that use the grid to its full capacity and that recognise the employment challenges that may come from a move away from generating power from coal.<\/p>  <p>  There are multiple opportunities arising from renewables, both onshore and offshore; from gas, which is an awful lot cleaner than coal although it is still a carbon fuel from which we need to move away; and from biomass, where there certainly are opportunities.  However it is up to the ESB to come up with viable commercial alternatives that can protect employment in the region and that can use the existing infrastructure, just as it is up to Bord na M&oacute;na to do so with respect to the transformation process in which it is involved.  It is worth noting that the ESB announced this week that it is engaging in the development of a very significant offshore wind project off Dundalk.  This will be a very significant contributor of renewable energy to the Irish grid in the future.  This is the change that is happening.  The use of coal to generate energy must end by 2025 but we need to use the infrastructure which has been built up over many years and which will still be part of our power solutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400015#N00300","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1548332700,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste.

On 29 November last year, Permanent TSB announced it was selling 6,139 loans linked to family homes.  That was not the first sale of family homes by that bank, or indeed by other banks, including State-owned banks, going right back to the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, to vulture funds.  What made this a new low in Irish banking was that these mortgages involved families who were meeting their agreed arrangements with the banks.  They were fully up to date, but the sale still went ahead.  No sale to a vulture fund is right, but this sale is particularly offensive.  It is time for action, and the people and Sinn F&eacute;in say that enough is enough.<\/p><p>This Bill builds on the Central Bank's code of practice on the transfer of mortgages.  The first line of the code of practice, introduced in 1991, states &quot;A loan secured by the mortgage of residential property may not be transferred without the written consent of the borrower&quot;.  The code dates from a time before the banks destroyed this country's economy.  The cruel irony is that the banking collapse directly led to the loss of jobs and businesses, which in turn led to hundreds of thousands of people falling into arrears.  Some ten years after that collapse, those same banks are now turning on those families unfortunate enough to have suffered.  They are literally throwing them to the vultures.<\/p><p>This is a vicious circle.  Its victims are hard-working families and individuals who are doing their best to recover after the banks crashed the economy.  Anyone with a sense of justice or fairness must see that these vulture sales are completely unnecessary.  Another quote I came across is the following: &quot;Notwithstanding its voluntary nature, I expect that best\u00a0practice\u00a0dictates that the\u00a0code\u00a0be applied by all institutions to all classes\u00a0of\u00a0residential property&quot;.  Those are not my words, but the words of former Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, from 2012, when he placed on the record of this House his answer to the current Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, when asked about the voluntary nature of this code.  It should be noted that he said that it should be applied to all institutions.  Some six and a half years later, we hear nothing from the Government about best practice and the application of the code.  Have these years of putting banks first changed the core values of the people so much that we do not dare insist on what were basic demands only a few short years ago?<\/p><p>I do not believe that this is a radical Bill.  It is concerned with fairness and putting into legislation what the Central Bank and the Minister for Finance had until recently considered best practice.  The Government will surely say that the Bill will end the market for sales to vulture funds in this State.  I deeply hope that is the case, and I have no problem in saying that.  I do not want a vulture economy, and neither does my party.  I have chosen a side.  I am on the side of the small struggling farmer, homeowner and small businessman, not the side of the vultures.  I hope that is clear.  The banks selling off these loans are not paying a penny of tax.  They are subsidised by the help to buy scheme.  They are allowed to charge rip-off interest rates.  They are reducing services bit by bit, especially in rural Ireland, and are allowed to sell these loans despite the code of practice saying that they need the consent of the borrower.<\/p><p><i>1 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>The people have a right to say to the banks that we almost bankrupted ourselves to save them and that we have thousands of our sons and daughters in Australia and elsewhere because of them.  The least we can ask of them is for them to do their job and work through their mortgage arrears applying the options available and doing their best to keep people in their homes.<\/p> <p> The Bill is not great in length - it is a medium-length Bill - but its purpose can be summed up in the line taken from the code of practice of the Central Bank of Ireland.  It says that a loan secured by the mortgage of residential property may not be transferred without the written consent of the borrower.  That is where Sinn F&eacute;in proudly stands.  I look forward to hearing where others stand when we move the Bill through Second Stage, which I intend to do next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400017#P01800","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548334500,"counter":228,"content":"<p>Is the Bill being opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400018#Q00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1548334500,"counter":229,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400018#Q00300","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1548334500,"counter":230,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1548334500,"counter":231,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400018#Q00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1548334500,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400018#Q00600","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1548334500,"counter":233,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Irish Nationality and Citizenship (Restoration of Birthright Citizenship) Bill 2017: Second Stage (Resumed) [Private Members]","time":1548334500,"counter":234,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400018#Q00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1548334500,"counter":235,"content":"<p>I must now deal with a postponed division relating to Second Stage of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship (Restoration of Birthright Citizenship) Bill 2017, taken on Thursday, 17 January 2019.

Deputies expressed the view that there should be an input from this and the Upper House prior to the Government making a decision on the exact role and functions of directly elected mayors.  I am glad that the D&aacute;il will be able to have this discussion.  We will have it in the Seanad next week.<\/p><p>I wish to outline the proposals that I intend to present to the Government in the coming weeks.  I am here to listen to any good suggestion from Members.  Nothing has been finalised yet, so suggestions regarding this significant reform of how local government is run will be taken on board.<\/p><p>As the House will be aware, A Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to consider directly elected mayors in cities as part of a broader range of local government reforms.  Several previous programmes for Government included similar measures.  The reforms' principal aim is strengthening local democracy and shifting the balance of power, which is lopsided in many respects, between the executive and those who are directly elected by the people.<\/p><p>On foot of the commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government, I submitted to the Government last September a policy paper, entitled Local Authority Leadership, Governance and Administration, which included a number of policy proposals for directly elected mayors.  This policy paper was approved by the Government at its meeting of 27 September and forwarded to the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government for consideration.  The Government also agreed in principle that plebiscites would be held on directly elected mayors with executive functions in the areas of Cork City Council, Limerick City and County Council, Waterford City and County Council, and Galway city and Galway county councils at the same time as the local government elections next May.  This decision was subject to the necessary provisions for the holding of the plebiscites being included in the Local Government Bill and the requirement that I would revert to the Government with more detailed proposals on the plebiscites, the questions to be put and the specific powers to be given to these directly elected mayors.<\/p><p>Following yesterday's completion of the Local Government Bill by the Houses, the Bill provides for plebiscites on directly elected mayors with executive functions in the local authority areas of Cork City Council, Limerick City and County Council, and Waterford City and County Council.  It is intended that the plebiscites will be held at the same time as the local elections in May.  The Department is prioritising the Government's instruction to produce more detailed proposals on plebiscites, the questions to be put to the electorate and the specific powers of mayors.  These detailed proposals, including an analysis of the costs involved, will be submitted to the Government in the coming weeks.  Prior to reverting to the Government with these more detailed proposals, I wish to consult both Houses to understand their views on the matter.<\/p><p>As Deputies will be aware, local government legislation divides local authority functions into executive and reserved functions.  The proposed office of directly elected mayor with executive functions should bridge the gap between the two categories of functions.  It is my view that, subject to some exceptions, responsibility for executive functions could be transferred in their entirety to directly elected mayors.  The directly elected mayor would be an <i>ex officio<\/i>member of the elected council and continue to perform the functions currently exercised by local authority cathaoirligh, mayors and lord mayors, including reserved functions.  This would encompass a civic and representational role, where the mayor would act as the &quot;face&quot; of the local authority domestically and internationally.<\/p><p>Given the potentially wide range of functions performed by local authorities, the directly elected mayor's role would need to be supported by a chief executive officer.  The executive mayor would have a similar relationship with the local authority chief executive as a Minister has with a Secretary General of a Department.<\/p><p>The mayor's functions would exclude executive functions related to planning matters, which would remain with the chief executive.  Chief executives would also continue to be responsible for organisational and staff related matters.  This is similar to arrangements in Departments, where the Secretary General is responsible for such matters.<\/p><p>The elected council would be the primary body with responsibility for oversight of the mayor in the performance of his or her functions and for holding him or her accountable while also exercising its existing and future reserved functions.  I emphasise this point, as it has been raised in many discussions in the D&aacute;il and elsewhere.  We are not proposing the removal of any of the existing reserved functions that local councillors have.<\/p><p>A mechanism to recall the mayor should also be set out and will be included in the final memorandum that goes to Government.  I would be interested in Members' views on that issue.  At a local level, on creating a position with such responsibility it also would be necessary to ensure, were a matter to arise, that there would be a recall election mechanism for the public, as has been recently provided for in the United Kingdom but that has existed for years in many other democracies across the world.<\/p> <p> In addition to the directly elected executive mayor proposals, I will propose a strengthening of the strategic planning committees, SPCs.  My intention is to create a Cabinet-style system where the chairs of the various SPCs would form the mayor's cabinet, replacing the corporate policy group.  As to what role or title would be officially given, no decision has yet been made.  It is the case in local authorities right across western Europe that different councillors sometimes are the lead councillor for certain strategic matters that the local authority controls and I certainly envisage that should be the case in Ireland.<\/p> <p> I intend that the policy paper will analyse the costs involved in establishing a new position of directly elected mayor.  This analysis is to include the costs of the position of mayor itself and of the plebiscites to be held.  This is an important requirement for the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p> <p> As I mentioned, it is intended that the plebiscites on directly elected mayors with executive functions will be held on the same day as the local elections in May next.  Anyone entitled to vote in the local government elections in the local authority areas listed will be entitled to vote in a plebiscite on directly elected mayors.  Regulations for the holding of the plebiscites and their necessary requirements and arrangements, will be made by the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  Information for electors on the proposals to be voted on in the plebiscites will be drawn up by the Department and sent to local authorities for distribution to electors.<\/p> <p> The Government decided at its meeting of 27 September that in view of the complexities of local government in County Dublin and the Dublin metropolitan area, which is defined in the national planning framework, it would be appropriate to allow space for detailed and informed public discourse on the matter of directly elected mayors for Dublin.  For that reason, the Government decided that the issue of directly elected mayors for Dublin would be referred to a Dublin citizens' assembly, to be convened in 2019.  The Department of the Taoiseach is leading on the convening of the assembly, with the input of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  Consideration will need to be given to the membership of the assembly, for example, whether the assembly should include elected officeholders similar to membership of the Convention on the Constitution.  It certainly is my personal view that the assembly should have a similar make-up as the Convention on the Constitution.  There is also a range of complex policy questions to be examined by the Dublin citizens' assembly, including the consideration of functions of the officeholder; the proposed relationship between the directly elected mayor and the local authority elected members and the executive of the local authorities involved; and the geographical area that would fall under the Dublin mayor's remit.<\/p> <p> I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and Members for their ongoing engagement on the issue.  The establishment of offices of directly elected mayors with executive functions would represent a very significant change and development in the political accountability of leadership at local authority level and I look forward to hearing the views of Members during the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400021#W00600","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548336600,"counter":248,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity today to speak on this issue of directly elected mayors.  I will start by reflecting on some comments the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, made last night in respect of the Local Government Bill 2018.  The Minister of State noted that when he was speaking with the councillors' representative group, the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, it was not able to provide him with even one additional power that it thought could be allocated to councillors in the performance of their elected roles.  That is difficult to believe but if it is true, it is shocking.  Having spent 17 years as a councillor - the Minister of State also was a councillor - there are plenty that I could have suggested for the group.  In respect of the specific role of directly elected mayors, there are powers I definitely believe should be allocated to these mayors should the plebiscites be successful.  They are powers I note the Minister of State already has ruled out when he touched on the subject during the debate before Christmas and, again, this afternoon.<\/p><p>I believe that if all we are doing in creating directly elected mayors is creating a post for a councillor to go and cut ribbons, we are doing a disservice to the role in the first place and, in fact, are codding the people.  They would be going out <i>en masse<\/i>to vote for a person who they believe could act as a genuine local leader who could effect change in their area only to find that the Government did not give him or her any real powers in the areas that matter.  Those powers would still remain with the chief executive because those at Government level could not trust a mere elected councillor to have powers that could bring together the forward-looking plans we need for our towns and cities.  If we really want to create the positions of directly elected mayors that will be comparable with the same positions across Europe that the Minister of State has cited, these need to be afforded executive powers.  These executive powers should be along the lines of a director of services in respect of planning, housing and transport in order that when reports are produced by the respective professional persons at staff level in such local authority departments, ultimately, a file can be signed off on or rejected by an elected representative who has been sent there by the people of that county and city to do the job.  That is the key line, namely, a person sent there by the people.<\/p><p>Increasingly, people are becoming frustrated that when it comes to major decisions impacting on their lives in their counties and cities, they suddenly find that those for whom they went out and voted do not have the power to make or rescind a decision.  They can make lengthy speeches in the council chamber and can stand with people at a protest but they do not have the executive power to make or rescind executive decisions.  It will be an unelected person, a faceless official whose details will not be listed in many cases on the local authority's website, not even his or her email address or telephone number, who will make that decision.  Frankly, that is not right.  I had enough of it when I was a councillor.  I do not want to see an opportunity wasted by us not affording directly elected mayors, in whom people would have confidence, the power to do that.<\/p><p>As a country, we either will have the welcome conversation that, thankfully, is starting today in this Chamber about whether we now accept we have matured and moved past the scandals and clientelism that scarred this country in the post-Independence era to a position where we trust those elected to do the job we expect they should be able to do or, if the Minister of State does not create such a vista, we will be saying that our future leaders at local and city level, including those who have not yet even been born or conceived, are to carry the sins of a small number of their forefathers.  We will be saying that, forever and a day, we do not believe we can trust elected members to discharge what is the preserve of unelected officials.  I do not believe in that mantra.  I want to see elected members have powers similar to those of a director of services in the areas of planning, transport and housing in order that they can set down a programme and vision for their respective city and county and then lead the development of that plan with the powers to implement it.  I do not seek a situation where we have directed elected mayors rolled out to recite the corporate message of the local authority, that is, the &quot;face&quot; of the local authority, as the Minister of State called it, as opposed to the expressed will of the people.<\/p><p>The benefit of trusting our elected representatives with such power is that these officeholders will be accountable in a real sense for their actions to the people who elect them in their city or county.  If they fail in meeting those high standards or in upholding their mandate, they will be gone in the next election.  Let us take, as an example, the recent controversy in south inner-city Dublin surrounding the removal of the Weaver Square garden space, which is used currently for allotments by residents but will be turned into 100 rapid-build homes.  It is a green lung in the heart of inner-city Dublin, which is a condensed urbanised space where there is a dearth of green space for city dwellers to enjoy a green lung and plant their own vegetables.  It also is an urban space where there are thousands on the social housing waiting list and where 100 rapid-build homes would make a real difference to people waiting years for a place to call home.  During that debate, there were passionate statements on both sides with equal credentials, but one statement that stood out for me was that of Ms Samantha McCaffrey from the Weaver Square Community Garden group, as reported in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, &quot;We want to see a fair, transparent public planning process&rdquo;.  That statement sums up the frustration of people with their local authorities when it comes to decisions that really impact their lives.  People can live with final decisions if they can see that their opinion mattered in the process.<\/p><p>We need real decision-making powers for elected mayors.  They should not be allocating a few bob for potholes or making representations to an engineer.  We should have a situation whereby a local resident can speak to a local elected person who can either accept or reject his or her petition.  The fact that so many decisions that matter to people are made by unelected officials is a source of great frustration.  The public would prefer to have a mayor with the line manager power to sign or reject a planning file.  This is a debate worth having and I am starting it today.<\/p> <p> I referred to a recent controversy in Dublin by way of example.  Of course, the plans being brought forward would have made little difference in that situation because there are no proposals for a mayor for our capital city, which quite frankly is unbelievable and a disgrace.  Fianna F&aacute;il firmly believes that Dublin needs a directly elected mayor.  Deputy John Lahart, who will speak on the issue, brought forward a Bill on 27 October 2016 which proposed holding a plebiscite for a Dublin mayor.  Fianna F&aacute;il recognises that such a position could revolutionise the city of Dublin.  If afforded the correct powers, it could ensure that we have a European capital which runs properly, rather than one strangled by transport issues, as was the case last year.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, strolled into the Chamber, said it was nothing to do with him and left again.  Nobody was accountable and nobody took the issues by the scruff of the neck.  However, everyone pays the price for the system that, as a country, we are prepared to endure.  The citizens of Dublin want to see a massive step taken and a directly elected mayor for the city.  That question should be put to the people.<\/p> <p> Equally, there is a need for a discussion about the powers a directly elected mayor would have in order to get Dublin moving and operating correctly.  That is the case for many areas of the country, in addition to Dublin and those listed, which would benefit from having a directly elected mayor.<\/p> <p> Having had the honour of twice serving as mayor of my home town of Navan, I know what a privilege it is.  However, we should seek to take the position to a new level.  We should trust the people we elect and let them set out a vision which they can implement when elected rather than having a scenario similar to the presidential election, in which candidates talk policy but such flowery language means nothing in the long run in terms of tangible changes.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State referred to councillors having Cabinet-style positions at a local level and taking the lead role in certain departments.  That is the situation across Europe, as I am aware having engaged with councillors in twinned towns across the Continent.  However, there is no point in floating that idea unless those lead Cabinet roles would come with the powers of a director of service.<\/p> <p> I welcome the discussion.  The Minister of State has come forward and asked for our opinions.  I have given mine.  I hope they will be taken on board and that we can have a robust debate and work collaboratively to ensure that if directly elected mayors are endorsed by the people in a plebiscite, they will have real powers, be truly representative, change the communities they represent and be accountable to the people.  If we do that, it will be a good piece of work and we will have changed the system in this country in a meaningful way for generations to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400022#X00200","speaker":"1218","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548337200,"counter":250,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Quinlivan.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to note on the record the very constructive way in which the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, has engaged with members of the Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government on the broader issues of local government reform as well as on the Local Government Bill with which the House dealt yesterday.  In light of that engagement by the Minister, it is important that members on this side of the House engage in the same constructive spirit.  For decades, Members of the Opposition have demanded reform of local government, but when they get into power they do not do anything about it.  We would be far better served by having a genuine and constructive debate on what can be done in the short to medium term and then acting on it.  If there are good Government proposals which reflect some of the views of the Opposition, let us get the ball rolling on them.  All Members accept that our local government system gives too little power to elected members and too much power to chief executives and managers.  Many of them are public servants of outstanding quality and ability and serve their communities well but, nonetheless, they are unelected.  On that basis, I wish to put forward some reflections of my views and those of my party colleagues.  Deputy Quinlivan will do likewise.<\/p>  <p>  There is no straight answer to the question of whether one supports the idea of a directly elected mayor because it very much depends on what powers will be vested in that office.  I welcome the personal views of the Minister of State that there should be a shift of executive functions to a directly elected mayor if such a post is created.  I too believe a plebiscite is the right way to go because it would give the office popular democratic legitimacy, as well as generating debate among the public on the matter, which is good for democracy.<\/p>  <p>  I am concerned that we are discussing elections and plebiscites before discussing the powers which directly elected mayors would have.  We must address that matter quickly.  The Government proposals in that regard should be put into the public arena well in advance of any plebiscite in order that we can decide whether or not we support the propositions.  I oppose any reduction in the reserved functions of elected members and, therefore, welcome the indication of the Minister of State that those functions would remain as they are.  There should be consideration of functions being devolved downwards from some State agencies or, possibly, Departments because that would further enhance the role of directly elected mayors.<\/p>  <p>  I am disappointed that Dublin is not being included in the broader discussion.  However, I acknowledge that a process initiated by a predecessor of the Minister of State fell foul of Fingal county councillors, including some Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael councillors, who blocked the possibility of a plebiscite for a directly elected mayor in Dublin.  The issue is more complicated in Dublin because there are four local authorities.  I was a member of South Dublin County Council and am aware of concerns that a directly elected mayor would be city centric and that there would be a return to some of the difficulties encountered in the days of Dublin Corporation.  There was also a genuine concern, including with my local authority in south Dublin, regarding powers being devolved upwards to a directly elected mayor from the local authorities.  Sinn F&eacute;in would not support such a move.<\/p>  <p>  It would be best to identify a small number of strategic important functions that would be vested in the office of a directly elected mayor.  I agree with the Minister of State that planning should not be one of those functions, although that could be considered at a later stage when the system is embedded.  However, given where we have come from in terms of planning corruption and the improper relationship between some politicians and some planning decisions, it would be far better to begin with directly elected mayors having responsibility for issues such as strategic development plans and transport.  If we design an office that has clear executive functions and start with a number of clearly defined issues on which a directly elected mayor would add value, it will win public confidence and demonstrate the office works.  One could then have a process of rolling devolution of other powers at further stages.  That would be a sensible way to go about it.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in supported the creation of the office of a directly elected mayor for Dublin, subject to its being granted the right kind of powers.  However, our preference is for a different system than may exist in Limerick, Cork or Waterford, for example, if the people of those cities and counties agree to such a proposition because Dublin requires a mayor who does not have the functions of the individual chief executives of the four local authorities but, rather, strategic functions overarching those.  For example, rather than being responsible for planning decisions, the directly elected mayor should be tasked with deciding on planning issues of very strategic importance such that one does not have the kind of practice whereby one local authority decides to gazump a commercial centre in the neighbouring local authority by developing a very large retail shopping centre, as happened some years ago on the border between Fingal and south Dublin.  If some of those larger strategic functions were vested in a directly elected mayor for Dublin, it could be very positive.<\/p>  <p>  We must also think carefully about how such an office would interact with the existing structures of local government, including local councillors, strategic policy committees and other bodies, whether in the cities for a directly elected mayor is currently proposed, in Dublin or elsewhere.  That would not be straightforward and should form part of the discussion.<\/p>  <p>  It is welcome that we are having this debate in public.  The housing committee would be a good forum for us to have less rhetorical and more evidence-based and cordial discussions as to what is required.  The committee would be happy to facilitate the attendance of any Oireachtas Member with an interest in this matter.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to acknowledge a comment the Minister of State made to the housing committee on several occasions.  He pointed out that we have been so focussed on the housing crisis that we have not given local government enough space and he is correct in that regard.  The committee must take its responsibility in regard to local government more seriously and create more space for those discussions.  Some of these legislative proposals will give us an opportunity to do so.  Sinn F&eacute;in is committed to working constructively with the Minister of State on this issue.<\/p><p>We want to see more powers devolved to elected politicians.  We would like to see the public given the opportunity to decide on directly elected mayors.  If the Minister of State is willing to continue to work with us as he has done so far, he will find that, even where we have differences, we will be very willing partners in the process to ensure the kind of government we provide for citizens at local government level is enhanced in their interest and the interest of the wider community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400023#Y00200","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548337800,"counter":252,"content":"<p>As the Minister of State is aware, Sinn F&eacute;in will be supporting the upcoming plebiscites on directly elected mayors.  Generally, we believe more needs to be done to secure support.  I remain deeply concerned that, this close to the proposed plebiscite, we are still unaware of what powers and functions the newly elected mayors will have and how the office will work.  With European and local elections at the same time, people will get confused.  We need to have the discussion as quickly as possible.  We need to tell people what the Minister of State is proposing.  We need him to tell us first of all, obviously.  If he wants us to sell the concept at the doors, he needs to start informing us now.  Voters are already looking at local election manifestoes in which there will be information on mayors or upcoming referendums.  Time is passing quickly.  I am genuinely concerned the proposal will not pass because people will not have enough information on it.  If it is passed, directly electing a local mayor will hand power back to the citizens of Limerick and other cities.  That can only be positive.<\/p>  <p>  The Local Government Bill 2018 provides for the holding of plebiscites on directly elected mayors with executive functions for Cork City Council, Limerick City and County Council and Waterford City and County Council.  The mayors will provide for a new type of leadership in our main cities.  The system will allow candidates from each party and none to set out their vision and ambitions for their cities.  This is vital in my city, Limerick, where a mayor could set out his ambitions and plans for regeneration areas, for attracting more business to the region, and for boosting tourism in the city.  There could probably be a targeted response to try to address the great number of unemployment blackspots across the city.<\/p>  <p>  Having directly elected mayors will be of little benefit or value to us if they do not have real power, however.  Key functions related to transport, infrastructure, economic development, waste management and tourism should be vested in the mayor's office.  These powers must be devolved from central government and also the relevant State agencies.  It is important that staff and funding follow to allow the plans to be implemented.  There is no point in electing a mayor who has no power, nothing to add, and is just in office as a figurehead.<\/p>  <p>  It is vital, however, that there be no reduction in the powers, functions and budgets of the existing local authorities.  The merger of the Limerick councils would not have been achieved without strategic intervention from the Government to allow it.  It was not the case that the two councils were able to merge on their own.  Therefore, we need to be cognisant that we will need to provide additional funding to councils if they want to do this.<\/p>  <p>  In Ireland, we already have a weak local government system by comparison with the systems of many of our European counterparts.  It is important, therefore, that if we further strengthen our local government structures, we devolve responsibility for issues that can be dealt with at local level to those on the ground.<\/p>  <p>  I am concerned about the upcoming plebiscite as there has been completely insufficient engagement with voters about it.  There is a high degree of uncertainty about the exact shape a directly elected mayor's office would take.  Individuals have spoken to me about this.  They hear there will be a directly elected mayor and plebiscite but they do not know anything about them.  I cannot answer the questions because the Minister of State has not given us information on what the Government intends to do.  We need to provide the information as quickly as possible.  May is fast approaching and it will come sooner than we expect.<\/p>  <p>  People in Limerick to whom I have spoken are completely unaware of the proposal.  My concern is that the proposal will not pass.  It is in danger of defeat.  If the Government goes ahead with the plebiscite, which I want it to do provided it gives us the information, and if the relevant powers are in place, having directly elected mayors could have a very positive effect on Limerick, Waterford and Cork.  The Minister of State will have our support if he comes forward with some proposals that enhance the functions of directly elected mayors and if he devolves more powers to them while retaining the functions of local councillors and providing the additional resources and staff that are required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400024#Z00200","speaker":"1327"},{"type":"speech","time":1548337800,"counter":253,"content":"<p>I welcome this debate.  I agree with what has been said about the importance of having a public debate on this issue in advance of plebiscites in May.  There is very little knowledge that there will be plebiscites in the areas concerned.  Across the water and north of the Border, we see from the Brexit negotiations the damage that can be done if a major change is proposed and the public does not know what it is about.  The British public learned a lot about what Brexit is since it decided in favour of it but it really should have been having the conversation on it before it voted, and it should have had all the required information.  It did not have it.  This is an example of where putting something to the public without having the necessary broad conversation is dangerous.<\/p><p>Having said that, I believe we should have the plebiscites but we do need the conversation.  The Minister of State needs to find a way in which to have the public debate in the areas concerned as well as here in the D&aacute;il Chamber, at meetings of the committee and so on.  The Minister of State needs to find a way, be it through town hall-style meetings or otherwise, to have a general debate so people will understand what the matter is about.<\/p><p>I support what has just been said.  I said in the debate before Christmas that we do not know what the functions will be.  The Minister of State referred to the requirement that he would revert to the Government with more detailed proposals on the plebiscites, the question to be put and the specific powers to be given to mayors.  It is all very well to be reverting to the Government, but will he do so soon so there will be enough time in which to have the conversation?  If we only get the information out on the functions and powers close to the vote, there will not be time for a public debate.  This is a big decision for local people.  If somewhere ends up with a celebrity-style mayor because there has not been a proper debate on what mayors do, it will have the wrong kind of person.  We need somebody who can take the responsibility.  It is not just about powers.  It is about responsibility.<\/p><p>Traditionally, because local government has been so weak, local public representatives have not been in the habit of taking serious decisions and accepting the consequences of their actions.  I support the fact that the Minister of State said councillors will continue to have their reserved functions.  To an extent, in decisions on budgets and such functions, councillors do take responsibility.  If, however, a person is given specific powers, he or she has to take the associated responsibility.  Sometimes it is said that while one would like to do everything and would vote for everything, there is only a limited budget, meaning only certain things can be done..  Therefore, there needs to be clear understanding.<\/p><p>My experience of this issue is based largely on the model in France.  I was chairman of a twinning committee at one stage and visited the city twinned with Limerick, namely Quimper, Brittany.  I had discussions with French mayors and deputy mayors.  A French municipality includes the town or city plus the rural hinterland.  The mayors make decisions.  The deputy mayors are in charge of matters such as transport and the budget.  Therefore, they have to say they can do this road but not that road, or this but not that.  These are the kinds of responsible decisions we have not been used to in local government.  We really need to prepare our public representatives, in addition to the public, for genuine responsibility.  It is not just a matter of voting against something because it is in one's area when one knows one's colleagues will vote for it in some other area and it is going to go through.  We have to make sure there is real responsibility taken at local level.<\/p><p>There are a number of different models.  I have not had time to read about them all.  The IPA had in the winter 2017 edition of the <i>Local Authority Times<\/i>an article about the different kinds of models for directly elected mayors.  We need to consider what model we will have.  I would be inclined to agree with Deputy &Oacute; Broin that a small number of specific functions would be more appropriate in the beginning.  That will mean the public will have a better chance of understanding what it is voting for, and the public representatives and the directly elected mayor will understand what their responsibilities will be.  Some of the decisions they might have to make might not be all that popular, and they need to recognise that.  There is a genuine learning curve and there is not an awful lot of time to learn.<\/p><p>I presume Galway is excluded because it will not be ready on time.  In a way, it is a pity that the people of Galway will not have the opportunities to vote for what the rest of us will have the opportunity to vote on.  The people of Dublin will not either.  With regard to Limerick, mayors should be municipally based.  An issue arises over the fact that the local authority in Limerick has responsibility for both the city and county, as is the case in Waterford.<\/p><p>As Deputy Quinlivan knows well, under the existing system, Limerick City and County Council has had mayors from far away parts of the county.  There is also a municipal mayor which causes a lot of confusion about the two roles.  I am not sure how it will pan out, but if the directly elected mayor comes from a rural part of the county, it will present an issue.  Mayors in other places such as New York, London or Vancouver represent cities.  There is an understanding internationally that a mayor - a directly elected mayor in particular - is a city based politician.  If we end up with a directly elected mayor of Limerick city and county or Waterford city and county from the rural part of the electoral area, it will pose a problem in how he or she will represent the municipality.  I do not know what can be done about this, but it is something that needs to be considered.<\/p> <p> I support the principle and hope it will work out well, but it will have a much better chance of being successful if there is clarity well in advance on the functions, powers, responsibilities and budgets, as well as the relationship with the executive of the council, the people and the Government.  There are many issues about which the public has not thought or been aware in terms of how it might work.  We have always had the same system of local government, which is not about directly elected mayors with powers and functions.  I presume the intention is that a directly elected mayor will be like a Minister, that the chief executive will be like the Secretary General of a Department and that the staff will work under both in some way.  There are issues to be clarified in that regard and I call for as much public dialogue as possible.  Although the responsibility primarily rests with the Minister of State, there is also a responsibility on the rest of us to ensure it is possible and that the information will be decided and made available as quickly as possible in order that the plebiscites and elections will be conducted in such a way that there will be public understanding of what is being voted on.  People will not be voting for a champion sportsperson but for somebody who will take responsibility for the running of the area.  There also needs to be a sense that this is about subsidiarity, local conversations and engaging with community organisations, businesses and everything that goes on in a local area, not about one person sitting in his or her office making decisions for everybody else.  It must be collaborative and there must be engagement throughout the area.  I am broadly supportive, but, please, let us get out and speak to the public about what is being proposed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400024#Z00300","speaker":"1325","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548338400,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak about the issue of directly elected mayors.  A groupthink opinion has developed and it appears that the majority of Opposition parties and Deputies in the House, from Fianna F&aacute;il to the Green Party and all parties in between, support the idea without being able to offer any meaningful explanation of how the role will actually work.  On what we can all probably agree is that local government in Ireland is in desperate need of urgent reform.  We do not really have local government but poorly funded local administration.<\/p>  <p>  Consecutive Governments, beginning with Fianna F&aacute;il in the 1990s, have whittled away the powers of local authorities, with the result that is now probably the most centrally governed country in the European Union.  However, I am not convinced that the introduction of a directly elected mayor will resolve the issue.  The argument in favour of having a directly elected mayor appears to be as follows.  If Dublin, Galway or Cork had a single recognisable figurehead who was directly elected by the people, that person would have a mandate to use his or her executive powers to fix any problem.  If it all sounds too good to be true, it is.  Instead of making vague statements on the reasons we may need to have a directly elected mayor, the parties and the Government should examine how the model has worked in the United Kingdom in the past 15 years.<\/p>  <p>  More than 20 years ago, before he became a war criminal, Tony Blair, on the verge of becoming Prime Minister for the first time, used similar rhetoric to that used by political parties here when he stated the heart of the problem was that local government needed recognised leaders if it was to fulfil a community leadership role.  He said the people and outside organisations needed to know who was politically responsible for running the councils.  His love of all things American, including its mayoral system, resulted in the Local Government Act 2000.  Among the reforms contained in it was the possible adoption by local government of a directly elected mayor model.  The residents of a city could vote through in a referendum that it would be governed by a directly elected mayor.  Towns and cities would still retain councils and the plan was that the two would work together, with final responsibility residing with the mayor.  Since the introduction of the legislation, there have been 53 referendums held in the United Kingdom, with only 16 of the 326 towns voting to be governed by a directly elected mayor.  Although the lack of appetite for the proposal does not necessarily equate to failure, a study comparing a city that had adopted the model with the previous model of local government found there had been very little change in terms of policy output and spending.  Research undertaken in the 16 cities in question has shown that directly elected mayors are just as dependent on central government for funding, that their introduction does not lead to a sudden upheaval in a city's fortunes or spending power and that it is extremely difficult for a mayor to exert influence in specific policy areas.<\/p>  <p>  I will take the city of Liverpool as an example.  At approximately 500,000, it has a similar population to Dublin, excluding the suburbs and other boundaries.  From 2011 to 2012 the city had a standard Cabinet and council leader model.  In that period the city spent 64% of its annual budget on social services, including education, housing and social care services.  The following year, from 2012 to 2013, it voted in favour of the elected mayor model.  Figures show that it now spends an almost identitcal figure, 62%, of its annual budget on social services.  The new mayor had no choice but to work with the existing council.  The same will happen in Dublin or Galway if they decide to adopt such a position.  Not only have directly elected mayors in the United Kingdom been unable to exert any real power, they have not been taken seriously by the citizens of their towns and cities, for which one would hardly blame them.  In 2002 voters in Hartlepool elected the mascot of the football club, H'Angus the Monkey, as their first mayor.  His campaign slogan was \"free bananas for schoolchildren\", which was actually not a bad idea.  He won two further consecutive elections and served for a total of ten years.  In 2013 Hartlepool voted to get rid of the directly elected mayor and return to the original cabinet and council leader model.<\/p>  <p>  Comparisons with cities such as New York or London are not helpful.  The mayor of New York has a budget of $60 billion and appoints the police commissioner.  As we know, the United States has a federal system.  Therefore, the system of local government is established by each state, not the federal government.  Local government is not dependent on central government for funding or powers.  That is why the US system works, the UK model has failed and the Irish model will also more than likely fail.  Similar to New York, London is cited as an example we should have directly elected mayors.  However, it is not only at city but a region.  Yes, it has a directly elected mayor, but there are also a Minister for London, a regional government office and a regional budget, as well as 32 councils in the 32 boroughs.  The 32 councils are responsible for the majority of local services such as education services, social services, waste collection and road maintenance.<\/p>  <p>  For the mayor system in Ireland to work like the US system, mayors would have to have significant executive powers, but I have yet to hear anyone outline from where those powers would come.  They would need to be taken away from somebody who already has them and we do not do that too easily in Ireland.  If a directly elected mayor were to exert real influence over a city, he or she would need similar powers to those vested in the Ministers for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Transport, Tourism and Sport and Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  Given that for the past 25 years consecutive Governments have diluted the role of local government, it is unlikely that there will a complete U-turn on this policy.  In fact, it is probably delusional.<\/p><p>In addition to ministerial powers, for directly-elected mayors to work, they will need powers similar to those now vested in semi-State organisations such as the National Transport Authority, NTA, and C&oacute;ras Iompair &Eacute;ireann, CI&Eacute;.  The newly created Land Development Agency is probably the worst thing that has happened in this Chamber since I came in here in March 2011.  This agency will have significantly powers to source sites and land.  Will these mayors be given similar powers?  NAMA still has significant powers.  It controls most of the development of the Dublin docklands.  Will a directly-elected mayor be able to challenge NAMA's use of its powers or will he or she be given similar powers when NAMA is finally disbanded?  <\/p> <p> Truth be told, the Land Development Agency is NAMA mark 2 anyway, so this going to run and run.  It will continue to use that mechanism to provide unaffordable housing to the people of Ireland at great cost, given that developers will be engaged who look for between &euro;60,000 and &euro;80,000 profit per unit for themselves.  I do not expect that authority will be given to a mayor.  There is a growing trend in this House of legislation being proposed that goes against empirical evidence and data.  Legislation is instead drafted on the basis that if it sounds good then it must be good.  <\/p> <p> A Bill was passed last week on sexual offences which went against all of the empirical data yet the Government allowed it to advance to appease its coalition partners.  It was a load of rubbish.  The introduction of directly-elected mayors is similar in nature.  It sounds like a great proposal, all the Opposition parties can get behind it and they can call and sell it to their constituents as something that will solve the problems in their cities or towns.  When we drill a bit into the proposal, however, there is not much detail.  Analysis of our nearest neighbours in the UK, where a similar system of central and local government operates, shows that the introduction of directly-elected mayors has not worked.  It could be argued that it has been a bit of a disaster.  <\/p> <p> I welcome, therefore, the Minister of State's decision to hold a citizens' assembly to examine the proposal to introduce the office of a directly-elected mayor in Dublin.  I ask him, however, to suspend the proposed plebiscites in Cork and Galway and allow the assembly to examine the overall proposal in respect of the whole country and not just Dublin.  If do this, if we would like to dream about how it should be done, that is fine.  It works for cities in America.  Unless we are prepared to go down that road, however, and take so much power away from others and give it to the new mayor, we are wasting our time.  This is just another sham that looks good and sounds good but is going nowhere.  The mayor will just be a tool of the local authority, which has very little funding and is totally dependent on central government.  This proposal will, more than likely, end up just costing the State more money without deriving any merit from it. <\/p> <p> If this was an Opposition Bill and not a Government one, it would not get the money message.  Imagine the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018 not getting a money message yesterday.  That is a new low for that scheme to stop Bills progressing.  The Bill yesterday was opposed on the basis that introducing criminal offences could cost the State money and that it could be open to challenges.  All legislation ever introduced here since the State was founded has been open to challenge.

I deeply regret we are not adding the people of Dublin to that list.  It is a real missed opportunity.  A citizens' assembly is coming - and to answer one of the questions the Minister of State asked in his opening statement - it should include elected representatives.  That is because we have experience of local government, most of us, which can usefully add to that assembly.<\/p>  <p>  I will make some broad points to explain why we are so supportive of the concept of directly-elected mayors.  I was at a Women for Election event last night.  I reflected then that in the depth of our crisis about ten years ago, a whole range of different movements rightly rose up seeking to change our democracy and how we do things.  Some of those things have been delivered.  I refer to examples such as having gender quotas for people to run for Parliament.  That has been very beneficial.  The provisions originally written by the Green Party, and, in fairness, implemented by the subsequent Government, took corporate donations out of Irish politics.  That is another example of how we have changed the nature of politics.  <\/p>  <p>  There are various missed opportunities I place at the doors of the Fine Gael and Labour parties during their time in government.  One was the wrong property tax being picked.  That was instead of a tax based on site value.  That is one example.  The other biggest failing, however, or one of the biggest in reforming the way we do politics, has been the failure to follow through in strengthening local government.  I am particularly bitter about that because when we were in government, we introduced legislation for the introduction of a directly-elected mayor in Dublin.  It had almost gone right through the parliamentary process, I think it was on Report Stage in the Seanad when we ran out of room and that Government fell.  We were that close to achieving the objective of having a directly-elected mayor for Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  The Government needs to rectify that.  I hope the people will direct us towards have a real strengthening of local government by supporting the plebiscites.  It is particularly important for Cork, Galway, Waterford and Limerick because we need to counterbalance the excessive and growing influence of Dublin as a centre of development.  We need to see other strong cities to balance development more effectively.  That is not to do down Dublin.  I was at an interesting conference in Cork where clearly researched analysis showed that the development of second, third and fourth cities also tends to strengthen a capital.  It is not one versus the other.  I believe that will be best achieved by the people of Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway starting to develop their cities in a far more creative, careful and intelligent way.<\/p>  <p>  No one could look at the development of those cities over the last 30 or 40 years and not surmise that the current system is fatally flawed.  One of the key issues to examine is what the responsibilities of a directly-elected mayor would be in respect of planning.  I agree with the Minster of State's comment in his statement that directly-elected mayors do not necessarily have to deal with individually planning decisions.  I refer to co-ordinating planning such in the broad planning of a city and the broad task we have of turning around the city of Cork.  It is a fantastic city with incredible Victorian and Georgian heritage.  Over the past 30 or 40 years, however, the city has seen a hollowing out of its centre and a sprawl beyond it.  That is because of a lack of leadership, a lack of co-ordination by the city council and a lack of any real vision for how Cork might develop as a city.  <\/p>  <p>  That needs to change and it needs local political leadership to make it happen.  It is the same for each of the other cities.  Only 3% of the population of Limerick city lives in the historic core area of the city.  It is also a fantastic Georgian city with an amazing location on the Shannon.  It too has seen a sprawl out with motorway networks that just lead to gridlock.  The development of public transport has not been facilitated and nor has the development of high-quality new housing and schools close to where people work and want to live.  That has to change.  It is the same in Galway and that is probably the worst example, in terms of being a city where everyone seems to live on one side and then travel across to the other side to work.  It is hell for motorists because we have built a city of roundabouts rather than a city of tribes.   <\/p><p><i>3 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>That has to change.  A civil servant or a chief executive who has all the powers does not have the mandate to achieve the scale of change needed.  While it may be contentious for the Minister of State as a Kilkenny man, in my mind Waterford needs to be the capital of the south east and promoted as such.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400026#BB01700","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548339600,"counter":274,"content":"<p>I agree fully.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400027#CC00200","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1548339600,"counter":275,"content":"<p>Good.

The current system is not working and needs to change.<\/p>  <p>  I broadly agree with the proposal that the relationship between the new directly elected mayor and the local authority chief executive would be akin to that of a Minister and a departmental Secretary General.  I agree with the proposal for making the chairs of the various strategic planning committees, the current corporate policy group, into a cabinet.  That is an easy way of the current system evolving into this approach.  Those of us who have worked as councillors know the local area committee system works.  That should be strengthened at the same time.  Powers should not just rest in the key areas of transport and planning but include enterprise development, culture and the environment.  I would also like to see the strengthening of local government in education, policing and healthcare.<\/p>  <p>  This would really empower local government.  However, it will happen better when faith in local government is returned.  Faith in politics comes from people having the ability to get rid of a mayor if they do not like the way their city is being run and developed.  The current system whereby we hand over a mayoral chain every year is a phoney exercise, pretending the real power is there.  It is deeply unfair to councillors and those who take up the office of mayor.  My experience in Dublin is that one is only getting to grips with it and understanding the scale of the job when one is then out of office because the year is up.  It is a completely flawed and failed system.<\/p>  <p>  Being brave in terms of adopting a different system is the right way to go.  It needs to be done in tandem with other elements.  At a climate committee meeting yesterday, I acknowledged that some of the initiatives such as the regional rural and urban development funds, as well as the climate fund, are well designed.  Rather than the system deciding everything centrally in the Department of Finance or the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, it is far better for us to provide funding to allow local authorities or other institutions to make bids to do regeneration projects.  Those projects which work best should then be replicated in other parts of the country.  In those circumstances where there is a significant pot of money for cities to compete where the best project wins, this would encourage the expertise, planning and thinking in local authorities which would help them flourish.<\/p>  <p>  When will the convention for Dublin take place?  My city is probably the one in greatest need for new leadership.  The current system in Dublin is broken.  We are facing gridlock in our city.  We have an inability to develop.  We are still widening every approach road to Dublin.  The greatest possible lunacy in transport and planning is happening under the current system.  We need a mayor for Dublin.  We need for that convention to finish to ensure Dublin can have its plebiscite.  Dublin deserves the right to have a directly elected mayor and a say in how our city should grow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400027#CC00900","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1548339600,"counter":282,"content":"<p>It must include Dublin 16 and not just Dublin 2.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400027#CC01000","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1548339600,"counter":283,"content":"<p>This is an important debate and I welcome the proposals made by the Minister of State.  A directly elected mayor is of considerable importance to the community which elects that person.  I note the powers of executive authority which will transfer to a directly elected mayor will be useful, powerful and make him or her accountable to the public for his or her actions.<\/p>  <p>  The current weakness in local government is that the system goes back to the various local government Acts introduced in the 1920s.  Eventually, the County (Management) Act brought in the county manager essentially as a dictator to order and decide what happened with a local authority.  Councillors and mayors, unless they were strong personalities, did what they were told.  Conflict in local government as a result of this approach was often reflected in reports in local newspapers.  The position of county manager was unelected.  In the majority of cases, county managers led dynamically and we have had excellent administrators and managers.  However, we also have had bad ones.  From my local newspapers, I note there is conflict between my local authority chief executive officer and councillors.  Members opposite are smiling about this.  I will not comment on the controversies or the personalities.  However, it is not right that local government in County Louth has been reduced to a confrontation between the two.  If that were to change, I would welcome it.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State&rsquo;s legislation should go further.  The Government has had the wisdom to nominate several towns for future exceptional development, such as Drogheda, Dundalk, Sligo and Athlone, in the national spatial strategy plan.  We need to identify a new source of executive authority in the local government areas in which these towns are situated.  If one were to add directly elected mayors for Drogheda and Dundalk, it would lend authority to decisions being made by, as well as the focus of, local government.  It is important we do that because the democratic deficit is clearly there.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Eamon Ryan is correct about councillors getting the mayoral chain every so often.  I have been privileged to wear the chain of office in Drogheda at least three times myself.  In the future, should I ever be retired from this House, I might do it again.  Local government needs accountability, decision-making and people power.  At the heart of what the Minister of State is doing is bringing people power, executive authority and accountability back to the people.<\/p>  <p>  Another deficit in local government is due to the fact that Oireachtas Members can no longer be local authority members.  I know the arguments for removing the dual mandate but I was and am still against that move.  Members&rsquo; experience, knowledge and insight could be particularly useful to local government.<\/p>  <p>  If a directly elected mayor will have the same executive functions as the chief executive officer of a local authority, then the mayor should have the same salary too.<\/p><p>The salary of a mayor should be the same as that of the current chief executive or administrator.  It would attract the required calibre of person needed to do this job.  The position would need to be properly paid to attract the best candidate.<\/p> <p> I presume the election of a mayor would be a separate vote in the local government elections.  The difficulty is whether a person could run for mayor while simultaneously running to be a councillor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400027#CC01100","speaker":"1329","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548340200,"counter":285,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400028#DD00200","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1548340200,"counter":286,"content":"<p>How would we get over that problem?

It is fair to say he has advanced it more rapidly than any of his predecessors.  There is an issue with the citizens' convention.  It is not a real citizens' assembly as this Chamber is the citizens' assembly.  I know the matter is to be referred to the Citizens' Assembly because it will make the decisions that this House lacks the courage to.  It will come back with the same kind of ideas about a directly elected mayor for Dublin that the more radical among us have been proposing for a number of years.  It is a shame and we should grasp the concept.<\/p>  <p>  Dublin Chamber has been making the point for a number of years about the number of agencies with which someone coming to the country must engage.  Other cities with directly elected mayors that have powers and budgets have a one-stop shop or a go-to person who everybody in the city or county knows.  Ultimately, the buck stops with the person.  He or she has responsibility and with that responsibility comes accountability.<\/p>  <p>  I disagree with Deputy Eamon Ryan on the point as I would start with a very restricted number of responsibilities, just as London did.  We could even start in Dublin by giving a directly elected mayor responsibility for transport, making him or her the one-stop shop for the area.  Even as an Opposition Deputy, there are a number of agencies that must be engaged when dealing with transport.  Dublin Chamber has a voice from business and we must also consider Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the National Transport Authority, Dublin Bus and cyclist groups.  These are a small sample of the total group as we must talk to everybody to get the different views.  The mayor would have the power to call all of those in and make decisions affecting them.<\/p>  <p>  I have spoken with the Minister of State and I know he realises that Dublin is different.  It must be stressed that Dublin is not competing with other cities in Ireland.  As an international city, it is competing with other cities in Europe that already have directly elected mayors.  Climate change meetings, for example, would be attended by mayors from Munich, Barcelona, Madrid and Paris.  They have great power and authority.  In Dublin, on the other hand, there are four mayors that are indirectly elected and which have no say in the direction of policy at home.  They may sign up to conventions but they have no real power or influence.  A directly elected mayor affords a capital the opportunity to develop partnerships with other cities with whom we have common policy interests.  In a scenario where the United Kingdom has left the European Union, it will be critical to develop new allies.  These do not always have to be national and they can be city-based if we find a common cause and are able to fight our corner with those allies fighting for the same issues.  Westminster restricted the power of the London mayor but increased its power over the years as the directly elected mayoralty began to bed in.<\/p>  <p>  Dublin has been grinding to a halt and congestion costs an estimated &euro;300 million per year, rising to an estimated &euro;3 billion per year by the time we get to 2030.  We need somebody who is accountable and responsible, and the current Minister exercises no great responsibility or interest in traffic congestion or transport issues concerning everyday Dubliners.  He shuns any kind of accountability in that space.  I am a spokesperson for Dublin issues and I know from engaging with the four Dublin local authorities that they have four directors for each of the areas of planning, transport, arts and culture or environment, and it is rare for those directors to communicate with each other.<\/p>  <p>  I am the first to champion the idea that the establishment of those four Dublin local authorities as a response to the corruption that was in the planning system.  Elected representatives who may have lived in another part of a county could potentially have voted to zone land 50 miles away.  The four Dublin local authorities became very manageable and absolutely ruled out that possibility of corruption.  Another benefit is that we have established three successful county towns in Dundrum, Swords and my constituency of Tallaght.<\/p>  <p>  I raised the following matter at a meeting of the climate change committee.  A roundabout has recently been constructed in my constituency.  It is a small matter in the grand scheme of things.  Somebody said to me recently that I must be up to my tonsils dealing with Brexit but I said the biggest issue I am facing is a roundabout in my constituency because nobody seems to be accountable for it.  It is causing chaos but no public representative can pinpoint who is responsible.  There are public meetings planned - I am going to one after this - and there will be a protest on Saturday.  It seems that it is only through protest in town that officialdom begins to listen and take action.  If we had a directly elected mayor, the people in my constituency would know it is the person to go to and the mayor would be responsible and accountable.  The mayor would have to rectify the problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400028#DD00800","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1548340200,"counter":292,"content":"<p>I found the Minister of State's speech disappointing and lacking ambition.

As I said when debating the Bill, I am very disappointed that Galway and my city did not get the same provision.  The Minister of State set out the steps to be taken on plebiscites etc. and there is a tremendous need for devolved administrations at the closest level to the people.  I did not like the Minister of State indicating in his speech that there would still be a chief executive officer, CEO.  Surely the CEO would be the directly elected mayor.  Would it not be better to call the head of the administration, who would be responsible for human resources etc., the secretary general or whatever?<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State has set out a reasonable argument on how to select the strategic planning committees.  All of us who served in local government could see the leaders of the committees forming that type of cabinet across a local authority.  The biggest disappointment is that the Minister has not gone straight ahead and asked the 1.5 million Dubliners to vote on this.  As Deputy Lahart said so eloquently, they want somebody whom they can hold responsible for the range of services from local government that are not being fulfilled.  This could relate to the state of the streets or lights.  Even with housing there is a lethargic and bureaucratic approach from the four councils in the Dublin region.  It is the record of the past 25 years and we need a much more dynamic system.<\/p>  <p>  I have always been in favour of directly elected mayors and a strong supporter of a single directly elected mayor for the four Dublin local authorities.

The decision of Cumann na nGaedheal in the late 1920s to do away with local administration - at the time, there were local councils in Howth and Rathmines - and set up the bureaucracies involving county managers represented a very regressive step.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400028#DD00900","speaker":"1361","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1548340800,"counter":294,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1548340800,"counter":295,"content":"<p>At the end of the day, local people know best.  The major problems that dramatically affect the Dublin region, including the shocking lack of affordable and social housing, the very backward state of the poor transport system compared to those in other European capitals of similar size and in the erratic ad hoc developer-led planning system, may all be traced back to a lack of vigorous local leadership throughout the past 100 years.  Probably the most effective manager in Dublin city and county was Mr. Frank Feely.  When I served on the council, he used to say Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael would never allow a directly elected mayor in Dublin because the day he or she was elected, he or she would become the second most important politician in the State after the Taoiseach.  There is an element of truth in that and it is something to which we should face up.  Other great cities such as Vienna in Austria have them.  When we look across Europe, we can see 17 directly elected mayors in the United Kingdom in places such London, Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham.  It is fascinating to watch mayors who have a clear mandate such as Mr. Andy Burnham in Manchester, Mr. Andy Street in Birmingham who used to head up a famous retail chain and Sadiq Khan in London and the operation of their dynamic programmes encompassing public transport, housing and the revival of drainage systems.  Likewise, when we look across the United States, we see the same.  I was struck some years ago by the example of Stockholm which has four councils but a single executive mayor, Karin Bj&ouml;rnsdotter Wanng&aring;rd.  She can make key executive decisions for the entire municipality.  The greater Stockholm area has a population of 3 million or 4 million.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the tiny steps the Minister of State has taken and would like him to reflect on the points made about the chief executive.  I know that it is going for consultation, but Dublin desperately needs a directly elected mayor.  It is a step I support and it is ironic that Cork, Waterford and Limerick will have directly elected mayors before Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400029#EE00300","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1548340800,"counter":296,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  As a former councillor and mayor of Fingal County Council, we have a tremendously weak system of local government, which is not the fault of local authority members; rather, it is because authority has not been delegated to local authority members.  As Deputy Lahart outlined, even when local authority members want something done, they are prevented from doing it by the unelected officials.  This must end.<\/p>  <p>  Without a lot more work and information in the public domain, holding a plebiscite in May in the cities and counties outlined in the provisions brought forward by the Minister of State will be difficult but not impossible.  Therefore, we must move quickly.  The matter of Dublin city and county must be managed very carefully.  While I really look forward to the debate in any form of citizens' assembly or convention, the underlying principle of my difficulty and that of the members of Fingal County Council when we rejected the previous ill-thought-out and weak proposal for a mayor of Dublin still stands.

They do not have the authority they should have.  My difficulty lies in the fact that a celebrity candidate could be elected, a point mentioned by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.  When someone runs for election as Dublin city mayor, it will be like the European elections or a presidential election.  That person will obviously use his or her platform to either stay in the job for years or catapult himself or herself into D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and other offices.  I am not sure if this would be of benefit to the people of Dublin city.  However, I was not talking about Dublin only but about the concept of mayoralties.<\/p>  <p>  We need to identify what the roles would be.  The concept of retaining the post of chief executive, albeit under the title of director general, is wrong.  The mayor would be that person and I do not think we should create a ministerial function.  We should create a position of mayor, rather than duplicate what is done in other countries.  There are directors of services across local authorities.  They should be the ones who would provide for co-ordination between departments and the office of mayor.  As Deputy Eamon Ryan and the Minister of State pointed out, the right thing to do would be to form a cabinet, including various functional departments within each local authority, that would be headed by a councillor elected by the council, as is the case in the strategic policy committees.  The roles and functions should be transparent and authoritative.  It should be absolute that decisions would be made and that people would be responsible directly to the mayor.  Councillors should have a budgetary function in order that they could hold the mayor to account because otherwise one would only have a say every five years, by which time the city or county could be in a mess.  It is imperative that there be that interface between councillors.  <\/p>  <p>  The question of pay for local authority members and mayors is important.  I would hate to create a mayor of Cork city or county or Limerick city or county who would be paid less than the role deserved, which would be at chief executive or county manager level.  <\/p>  <p>  On the interface with other service providers, Deputy Wallace was incredibly cynical and did not make one positive contribution to this discussion, apart from referencing the federal system in the United States.  Of course, when Irish people think about the position of mayor, they think about that system.  Unfortunately, we do not have a federal system, but having control over An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or at least having clout with Irish Water is incredibly important.  Chairing the joint policing committee would not be good enough as the mayor would have to have some interface with policing, even if it was a little beyond what we already do as public representatives.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputy O'Dowd spoke about being a mayor in County Louth in the future if he was ever \"retired\" - his word, not mine - from this House.  If he was able to call to see the chief superintendent in the Louth division on foot of the seizure of drugs worth &euro;950,000, as happened yesterday, nobody in County Louth would mind one bit.  They would be happy that the mayor of one of the major towns in the county was taking direct control of and interest in the matter.  It does not have to undermine the role of the Commissioner, but there should be some thoughtful way to create an interface.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400029#EE00600","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speech","time":1548340800,"counter":299,"content":"<p>T&aacute; an t-am caite.

When those Bills were taken on Second Stage, the House agreed to defer a vote on them, pending further discussion and consultation with the Minister and the Government.<\/p><p>That was a wise move.  I would suggest that the citizens of Dublin will need to know the details of just how such a directly elected mayor would operate before voting on the principle of having such an office.  It would be important to examine the role and functions of such a directly elected mayor in the Dublin area, which is the area on which I will be concentrating in my contribution.  I am very supportive of the principle of directly elected mayors.  The issue of having such a mayor for Dublin is being referred to a citizens' assembly.  I am disappointed that more work has not been done on the situation in Dublin and that more consultation is needed through the citizens' assembly.<\/p> <p> As the Minister of State said in his speech, we need to examine the functions of such a mayor, the relationship the office will have with elected members and the executive, and the geographical area to be covered.  Functions which will certainly be covered include housing, planning, transport and, perhaps, some justice issues such as those covered by the joint policing committees of the local authorities.<\/p> <p> If central government and Departments are going to cede power to local government, it will present challenges for the Minister of State.  He knows that.  Civil servants do not like ceding power and any Bill he proposes could be scuppered by the permanent government.  I am sure the Minister of State is quite aware of that as he is a very experienced Deputy and Minister of State at this stage.<\/p> <p> There is no doubt that the existing post of Lord Mayor of Dublin is largely ceremonial but the huge amount of goodwill citizens have for the office cannot be underestimated.  That is something which can be built on.  It is certainly something which I have experienced in my own right.  That said, the system of local government in Dublin city is not working at the moment.  I was elected to Dublin City Council in 2014 and it was my experience that the assembly was too big at 63 members, that it is very fragmented politically, that it has very limited powers and that, as a result, it is impossible to get anything done.  Meanwhile the problems in respect of housing, transport and planning which I mentioned earlier continue to get worse.

Citizens will need to be assured that the office is necessary and that scarce resources are not being squandered.  The message is clear: no waste, no duplication, no unnecessary bureaucracy, and no exorbitant salaries.<\/p>  <p>  I will finish up on this point.  If somebody wants to invest in Dublin or has a major proposal for Dublin, who does he or she ring?  That is very unclear at this point in time.  A directly elected mayor would give leadership, bring forward accountability, as Deputy Lahart has outlined, and give the city a profile, which is very important.  We have had the examples of other directly elected mayors throughout Europe and the world outlined to us in this debate.  Those are the key issues.  I want the Minister of State to continue with his consultations.

There is no point in divesting the chief executive role without doing something similar with the director of services role.  That is absolutely right.  I am not going to get involved in the specific case in Dublin but the Deputy went on further to give out that Dublin was not included.  The reason for Dublin&rsquo;s non-inclusion is that it is different from the rest of the country.<\/p><p>It is complicated by the fact that there are four local authorities.  Where do we fit the directly elected mayor's piece into the rest?  Deputy &Oacute; Broin said it was a good idea.  He questioned how it would interact with the existing structure.

The public will have the power to elect whoever it wants.  If it is a sports person, a personality, a regular Joe, a business person or whoever, we cannot second guess that.  Deputy O'Sullivan went into detail and said that the mayor should be somebody from Limerick city.  The directly elected mayor will be a person elected by the people of Limerick city and county. That might be somebody from Abbeyfeale.  In the context of population distribution, one might think it unlikely to be a person from Abbeyfeale, but I would not prescribe that it would have to be somebody from the city who is elected to hold the position.<\/p> <p> Deputy Wallace is correct on the issue of groupthink and it is never any harm for someone to say something different.  People may sometimes accuse Deputy Wallace of saying something different just for the sake of saying something different.  I would never do such a thing.  The Deputy is also right about local government reform.  The move to take some of the control in local government and give it to those who have been directly elected is a substantial local government reform.  Deputy Wallace quoted Tony Blair, of whom he is not a fan, and it was interesting that he thinks that local government works in the United States of America and in Britain.  It does not work.  The Deputy also referred to the Hartlepool United football mascot H'Angus the monkey.  I must inform the House that H'Angus was not a directly elected mayor with executive powers.  The mascot was directly elected but did not have the executive powers.<\/p> <p> Deputy Eamon Ryan welcomed the plebiscites but expressed reservations about Dublin's exclusion.  The Deputy was absolutely right when he referred to the opportunity that exists in our regional cities to develop those city centres again, especially in the case of brownfield sites that exist in many of those city centres.  In my own city of Kilkenny the brewery site is to be redeveloped.  There are cities in those regions that have dockland sites.  The north quays in Waterford form one such very prominent site with a huge city centre location that can bring businesses in and people back to live in our city centres.  I have never once questioned that Waterford is the capital of the south east and it will help the rest of the region.  It has always struck me that the south east lags behind the rest of the State economically despite having some obvious advantages.  Part of the reason is the lack of coherence when viewing it as a region in comparison with the west.<\/p> <p> Deputy Ryan spoke in favour of the new procurement framework-style bidding system for the funding of projects at local level into the future, and he emphasised the focus on certain areas such as transport, planning, enterprise, policing and education.  One of my predecessors, the European Commissioner, Mr. Phil Hogan, gets a lot of criticism about his time as Minister, but he brought the enterprise issue directly into the remit of local government through the local enterprise offices.

That funding relates to regional and local drug and alcohol task forces.  I believe that the Minister of State is sympathetic and that she understands the problem.  The problem is that we have to convince the Minister of State's colleagues and members of Government that this issue needs to be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth putting onto the record of the House that the proposed funding for 2019 is exactly the same level of funding that was made available in 2018.  The 2018 finding was the same as the 2017 budget, as it was for 2016, 2015 and 2014.  For all of those years the budget allocation has been the same.  In 2014, there was a reduction on the previous year of 2013.  I understand and acknowledge that we have had a recession but we have come to a point in recovery.  Drug and alcohol task forces are primarily funded by the HSE and the Department of Health.  Funding going into the parent Department is increasing significantly year on year, but these projects are being left behind.  The projects are struggling to survive and maintain the existing level of service, to pay the salaries of those people employed, and to meet new and emerging challenges.  They are under huge pressure.<\/p>  <p>  I have asked these questions in the past and I am aware that in her reply the Minister of State will say that additional one-off funding has been made available to improve the organisational effectiveness of the task forces, and that towards the end of the year there was additional funding.  I put it to the Minister of State that if this additional one-off funding had been built into the base as core funding, we would have seen growth year on year.  I have very real concerns about the effectiveness of one-off funding.  It is a challenge for task forces to engage and introduce new programmes to spend that money.  In real terms, when the funding runs out, the problem remains to be dealt with.  Unfortunately, the reality of the situation is that the work done by the people involved in drug and alcohol task forces and the programmes that they support in our communities is a continual demand.  It is regrettable but it is the reality.  We will be facing addiction treatment and minimising its impact for a long time to come.  If these programmes and projects are to be supported, they need to be supported financially.<\/p>  <p>  I can see no reason at all, when the health budget has been increasing year on year, why the base core funding going to task forces has remained the same since 2014.  I find this incredible.  Apart from the physical strain it puts on the providers of these programme projects, the lack of support also undervalues them.  People feel that they are being ignored, the work they do is not being recognised, and they do not get the same recognition as other groups.  I do not know of any other group or programme, be it for capitation fees in schools or the recipients of grants given out by the Minister, Deputy Ring, to RAPID areas, that has been left static for that period of time.<\/p>  <p>  I do not blame the Minister of State for this whatsoever.  I genuinely believe that she realises the work being done by the task forces, but between us, and I include the other Members of the House in that, we need to convince the Minister for Health and the Minister for Finance that the funding made available in budget 2019 is inadequate.  Rather than coming at the end of the year with a Supplementary Estimate, that budget needs to be amended at the start of the year so the money can be spent wisely in a managed and effective way to achieve the programmes set out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400031#GG00700","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1548342000,"counter":332,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Curran for raising this issue.  I know he is very passionate about it, as am I.  I will go through my speaking notes first and then I will address some of the issues raised by Deputy Curran in his contribution.<\/p>  <p>  Government policy in relation to drug and alcohol addiction services is set out in the national drugs strategy, Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery - a health led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017-2025.  Providing additional resources to enhance service provision is a key objective of the strategy.  I welcome the additional funding provided for integrated treatment services for people in addiction and mental health issues in the HSE 2019 national service plan.  The service plan also commits to improving healthcare services for people who are homeless.  The service plan will also deliver more integrated and effective models of care for people with complex healthcare needs and who are experiencing severe health inequalities.<\/p>  <p>  Drug and alcohol task forces play a key role in assessing the extent and nature of substance misuse in their areas, and in supporting community responses, as part of a co-ordinated approach involving all sectors at local and regional levels.<\/p><p>A total of &euro;27.645 million was allocated to the drug task forces by the Department and the HSE in 2018.  This level of funding has been maintained for the past number of years.  A further &euro;500,000 in once-off funding was provided to task forces in 2018.  In addition, task forces were consulted by the HSE on the provision of &euro;710,000 in once-off funding for priority projects and services in CHO areas in 2018.  This funding is used to support community drug projects in order to deliver services which meet local priorities.  I am very familiar with and greatly appreciate this valuable work in communities.  Measuring the overall effectiveness of the response to the drug problem is an important objective of drug policy.  Resources should be directed towards interventions and strategies which are most likely to lead to a reduction in problem substance use and an improvement in public health, safety and well-being.<\/p> <p> The level of progress achieved in delivering on the national drugs strategy will be determined using performance indicators.  To this end, the national drugs strategy commits to operationalising a performance measurement system by 2020.  The system is primarily concerned with the overall effects of implementing the drugs strategy at a population level, including the effects on the health, well-being and quality of life of people living in areas served by the drug and alcohol task forces.  Last year, I established a working group to revise and update the handbook for task forces.  It is intended that the revised handbook will improve the overall governance and accountability of task forces.  I hope to be able to provide that handbook in the next two or three weeks.  The group is developing a governance code for task forces in line with best practice as set out by the Charities Regulator.<\/p> <p> I appear to have mislaid a page of my statement.  I cannot seem to find it.

I want to bring it to her attention that she provided the same reply on 23 January 2018.  It is taking a long time to implement the model.  At the same time, we are expecting the task forces to effectively operate on the budgets of 2014.  That is not doable - it is not possible.  I am all for accountability and for measuring the effectiveness of the various programmes.  In the meantime, however, they must be funded.  I am concerned that the lack of funding will mean that the projects will not be as effective as they could and should be.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State also referred to once-off additional funding.  I still believe that is not the most effective way to proceed.  When money becomes available in a Department, this is one method of using it.  However, increasing core funding, where there are managed programmes which provide certainty and which are effective, is much better than once-off funding.  A lot of time goes into setting up those programmes.<\/p>  <p>  On Monday night last, after our visit to mark the centenary of the first sitting of the D&aacute;il in the Mansion House, I returned to &Aacute;ras Chr&oacute;n&aacute;in in Clondalkin where the Clondalkin drug and alcohol task force had an evening to present certificates to a number of people graduating from its addiction studies course.  I chatted to those involved and two interesting things emerged.  I spoke to the co-ordinator of the task force, who reminded me that when the it was established in the late nineties, the catchment area for which it was responsible had a population of 35,000.  Today, it is 117,000.  It was receiving more money then than it is now.  We are setting the task forces an impossible task.  When I was presenting the certificates, it dawned on me that some of the people had travelled from far and wide.  I asked if there was huge interest in the course.  There were 20 people graduating, but over 70 had applied for the course.  I asked the co-ordinator why there were so many and was informed that other task forces do not have the funding to run similar courses.  This is an example of the impact of the restricted amount of funding available.  It is not tenable or feasible to state that we will wait and have a new model next year.  I am appealing to the Minister of State to go back to the Ministers for Health and Finance and argue that there should be an increase in the allocation of core funding, rather than once-off additional payments being made over the course of the year.  That would help us improve the position year on year.  The base has been significantly eroded because the lower level introduced in 2014 has remained in place.  This matter must be dealt with as a matter or urgency.  The programmes and projects that should be supported in our communities cannot be as a result of the amount of funding available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400032#HH00200","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1548342600,"counter":335,"content":"<p>I want to make it very clear to Deputy Curran that the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Harris, were very much a part of the launching of the new strategy, Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery.  The latter came into being as a result of a public consultations held throughout the country.  At those consultations, it became very clear that task forces are unhappy because funding has not been increased.  We will not talk about the past, however.  We should focus on the future.  In allocating more money in the latter part of 2018, I was very conscious fact that I was only providing short bursts of funding to fill small holes.  In the coming weeks and months, I intend to look at the envelope I have and consider options for the provision of additional funding to task forces.  However, I do not want to just give out money willy-nilly.  I want to make a real impact and provide core funding from one year to the next.  It is not good enough to give small amounts of money to a group and expect it to do good work with it.  We need continuous funding, and I will be looking at that issue.<\/p>  <p>  Although we did not have a great deal of success in getting money via the budget, we have received more funding in the past couple of weeks.  I intend to look into how to use that money in the next couple of weeks to establish how that can be best spent within the task force areas.<\/p>  <p>  On the task force handbook, it should be remembered that the existing version was released in 2011.  It is time to examine the structures of the task forces and investigate where we might make gains and improvements in areas where what was envisaged has not worked as well as we hoped.  There has been a very positive reaction from the people on the task forces who are responsible for the handbook.  I hope the new handbook will be available by the end of the month.<\/p>  <p>  I agree that projects cannot continue to be funded unless money is made available on an annual basis rather than in the form of once-off allocations.  We have not been lucky in the past.  As the Deputy is aware, last year was the first in a long time that the drugs policy department was allocated funding.  Of the &euro;7 million allocated previously, &euro;2 million went to mental health and homelessness services and the other &euro;5 million was spent on the implementation of strategy, not only in the context of drugs task forces but also within communities and the HSE.  I am confident that in the coming weeks and months we will start to make an impact and allocate additional funding through the task forces.  We will not just fund anything; the funding will be given for a reason.  I am of the view that the only way to strengthen task forces is to provide them with continuous funding.  In order to do that, we must have a proper model.  I have looked at some of the issues regarding task forces and the many reports that have been compiled.  For us to get this right, it is important that we begin this year by ensuring that any money available to task forces is allocated correctly and is strategically located within task forces so that it can make a difference in communities.  Deputy Curran and I are singing from the same hymn sheet, but I need a few more weeks in order to put in place some of the funding that has been made available and to look at the areas in which we should be spending it in the context of the task forces and communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400032#HH00300","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1548342600,"counter":336,"content":"<p>I look forward to the response of the Minister of State in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400032#HH00400","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services Funding","time":1548342600,"counter":337,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400032#HH00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1548342600,"counter":338,"content":"<p>As there are three Members who wish to contribute and only four minutes in which to speak, I know the Acting Chairman will exercise a degree of leniency.

The IDS has this week decided to cancel all its classes from the end of February.  This is the first operational decision it has had to make in acknowledgement of the society's serious lack of funds.  As the next month approaches and proceeds, it will be more and more difficult to reverse these inevitable actions.

We are shocked and deeply concerned.  Without the Irish Deaf Society it will be virtually impossible for the deaf community to access these services.  Many people at the meeting at the weekend questioned whether this is happening because they do not get access to the airwaves - in that sense their voice is silenced.<\/p>  <p>  We should be in a position where the society is looking at expanding services and where ISL is taught to hearing people so that deaf people can become an integral part of our communications.

I will set out the prepared response but I will respond to some of the comments made as well.<\/p>  <p>  On behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy McGrath, I thank Deputies Wallace, Daly and &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in for raising this important issue and for the opportunity to respond to the House.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities that will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.<\/p>  <p>  Significant resources have been invested by the health sector in disability services in recent years.  This year alone, the Health Service Executive has allocated &euro;1.9 billion to disability services programmes.  People with disabilities, including those who are deaf, hard-of-hearing and deaf-blind, can access the broad range of acute care, primary care and community-based services that are provided by the HSE.  They can also avail of specialist disability services, which are provided in a variety of community and residential settings in partnership with service users, their families and carers as well as a range of statutory, non-statutory and community groups.<\/p>  <p>  Several non-statutory organisations are specifically focused on addressing the needs of the deaf community.  Services offered include family and support services, active technology and active listening devices, community and lip-reading classes, information and advice and sign language classes as well as a mental health and deafness service.  Most of these organisations receive funding from the HSE either through local grants of various amounts or direct funding.  The HSE had 35 separate service level agreements with organisations providing services for the deaf or hard-of-hearing in 2018.  The largest provider of such services is the National Association for the Deaf, which received significant core funding from the HSE of &euro;6.7 million in 2018.  The Irish Deaf Society, on the other hand, focuses its service delivery on advocacy and training and development as distinct from the delivery of services and social care supports to deaf communities.  For this reason, the Irish Deaf Society does not receive core funding from the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State with responsibility for disability services, Deputy McGrath, is aware of the financial difficulties that the Irish Deaf Society is currently experiencing and of the concerns regarding its future sustainability.  Several different funding options are available to the organisation and the Minister of State strongly urges the society to pursue them actively.  I understand, for example, that it has received funding in the past from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in respect of its advocacy work.  The society received &euro;269,700 under that Department's most recent round of the scheme to support national organisations in the community and voluntary sector.  This scheme is running for a three-year period from mid-June 2016 to mid-June 2019.  The society has also been funded by the Department of Education and Skills and it has received grants from the Department of Justice and Equality and the national lottery.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to emphasise that the Department of Health does not provide direct funding to organisations and any such funding is provided by the HSE.  Furthermore, the HSE can only fund organisations for the purpose of providing health services on its behalf.  However, in May 2018, one-off bridging funding of &euro;195,000 was provided by the Department of Health to the Irish Deaf Society to allow it to resolve its financial issues.  This was provided on an exceptional, once-off basis and the Department made it clear that it would not be repeated in the future.  The Department urged the organisation to take immediate steps to resolve its ongoing funding requirements.  It would appear that the Irish Deaf Society has not made much progress in this regard and it has submitted a further application to the HSE for core funding for 2019.  The HSE has reviewed this submission and has again declined the society's funding request on the basis that it does not provide health-related services.  This decision has been confirmed in writing to the Irish Deaf Society.  I know that the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, is currently in discussions with his Cabinet colleagues to try to resolve the Irish Deaf Society's financial difficulties.  These discussions have been very positive so far and the Minister of State will be in a position in the coming days to confirm the outcome of these discussions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400033#JJ00400","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1548343200,"counter":343,"content":"<p>I know this is not of the construct of the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne.

That is the official waiting time for a child in community healthcare organisation, CHO, area 7.  In response to a letter I wrote in June 2018 concerning a child who had been waiting for assessment since 2016, I was told there were 95 other children ahead of the child in question and the team was working at maximum capacity.  At that stage, the team was dealing with referrals made in May 2015.  In December, I wrote another letter to CHO area 7 about a separate case.  This time, I was told that there were 298 children ahead of the child in question on the speech and language waiting list, a further 80 children were being screened and a further eight were waiting to transition from the early intervention service to the speech and language service.  There are currently 222 children ahead of this particular child.  The current waiting time for assessment is 42 months.<\/p>  <p>  According to the reply I received, there has been no movement on the waiting list in the past 11 months owing to the large number of children who have transitioned from the early intervention service, the capacity caseloads of team members, delays in filling vacancies and the failure to replace staff on maternity leave.  I was also informed of the staff positions that are vacant.  A staff grade educational psychologist post has been vacant since December.  A staff grade psychologist is only available on a half-time basis and a half-time senior speech and language therapy position is also vacant.  Other posts that remain unfilled include a social worker and a staff grade physiotherapist.  It is clear the team is broken and that this is causing the backlog.<\/p>  <p>  A significant increase in health and social care professionals is required to adequately meet demand for services for children in CHO area 7.  Additional resources are required to address the backlog.  It is unfair that any child is left in this position.  One expert told me that every day that a child is left without this support represents a backwards step of two days.  For a child waiting three and a half years that represents seven years in his or her development.  This must not be allowed to continue.<\/p>  <p>  The latest census figures suggest that the increased population and increased prevalence of disability will result in increased demand in future.  Families and parents are at their wits' end.  Where do they go from here?  Clearly, the system is broken.  One suggestion is that parents should go down the private route, but that is a costly alternative.  Many of the families who contact me are not in a position to take the private route.<\/p>  <p>  Does the Minister of State agree that the policy of early intervention is not working if children must wait 42 months to secure access to a team?  God knows how long they must wait after that to receive speech and language therapy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400034#KK00800","speaker":"1309"},{"type":"speech","time":1548343800,"counter":352,"content":"<p>CHO area 7 covers some of my constituency and I deal every day with some of the issues raised by Deputy Crowe.  It is very disturbing and frustrating for parents who are left waiting for such a long time.<\/p><p>On behalf of the Minister for Health, I thank the Deputy for raising the very important matter and for providing the opportunity to update the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>The Government accepts that there are challenges in accessing times for speech and language therapy services and that this is a concern for patients and their families.  I assure the Deputy that every effort is being made to reduce waiting times nationally and at the local level in Dublin South-West.  The challenges we face in ensuring timely access to services should not be underestimated.  Not only is the demand for speech and language therapy and other therapy services increasing across the country, but the HSE reports that the complexity of individual cases is increasing.<\/p> <p> The speech and language therapy team in Dublin South-West works across primary care and disability services.  In the primary care sector, the majority of the service is focused on the needs of children under 18 years of age.  In the 11 months up to the end of November 2017, 1,377 referrals were accepted in the area.  The current position is that 713 people are waiting to be seen for an initial assessment, 244 of whom have been waiting for longer than one year.  All of those waiting over one year are under 18 years of age, with the majority of these individuals awaiting specialist disability multidisciplinary team assessments and interventions.  In addition, 313 individuals are waiting for initial intervention following assessments.<\/p> <p> It gives me no pleasure to inform the Deputy of such numbers.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, is conscious that behind these figures are real people seeking care and support.  Access times for speech and language therapy services are too long, and it for this reason that we have introduced a range of measures to address the problem.<\/p> <p> Funding was provided in 2016 for speech and language posts to prioritise the longest waiting children.  CHO 7 was allocated an additional 16 posts under this initiative.  Other actions taken to improve services in the area include the establishment of drop-in clinics that provide advice and support, the provision of maternity leave cover and the introduction of new models of working.  Of particular note is the in-school speech and language therapy demonstration project that is now up and running in CHO 7, covering Dublin, south Kildare and west Wicklow.  This joint collaboration between the HSE, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs provides occupational therapy and speech and language therapy services across 150 schools and preschools.  Under this scheme, children can receive in-house therapy services with the aim of delivering therapeutic interventions as early as possible to support their social skills, mental health and academic performance.<\/p> <p> The HSE's national service plan 2019 reflects the Government's commitment to improve access to primary care services such as speech and language therapy.  It contains provision for the recruitment of 170 additional community nursing and therapy posts and sets a target of 4,500 additional patients to be seen in 2019, with a full-year impact in 2020 of 9,000 additional patients seen.  An additional 100 therapy posts are planned to reduce waiting times for the assessment of need under the Disability Act 2005.<\/p> <p> The Government appreciates that delays in accessing services can be difficult for the families and children affected.  However, the recent investment in speech and language therapy posts, along with new ways of working, such as the in-school project, will support improved access to services and have a favourable impact on the long waiting list, including children on it.  Furthermore, the 2019 national service plan contains a number of provisions aimed at improving access to therapy services.  This additional investment should make a real difference to patients and their families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400034#KK00900","speaker":"1307","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548344400,"counter":354,"content":"<p>We raise these issues to try to get some action on them.  This year's budget provided an allocation for 100 new therapy posts, but the CHO 7 area has yet to be advised how many of these will be allocated to it.  Clearly, this sector needs to be prioritised.  It is unacceptable that any child should have to wait 42 months to access key services that would transform his or her life.  Not getting that access impacts on the child's development.<\/p>  <p>  To be positive, will the Minister of State ask the Minister to use whatever influence he has in this matter?  I have outlined the gaps in the area's team.  I do not blame the team operating out of Chamber House, as it does not have the key personnel.  This is not the team's fault.  However, families and children are being impacted.  I have tried everything and do not know what else I can do.  The only route I can recommend to the families is for them to go to the courts.  I do not want any family to have to do that just to get what the family's children are entitled to, but that seems to be the only option open to them.  It would be a costly affair for the State, which will have to deliver services for these children eventually anyway.  Clearly, the State is not doing so now.  No one can say that the system is working.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State's response was actually more depressing than the figures I outlined.  This matter needs greater focus from the Minister.  I realise that he faces other difficulties, but these are vulnerable children and this issue will not just affect them now, but also as they get older.

I read this response before coming to the Chamber and was shocked by the numbers.  The Minister acknowledges this situation as well, though, and is concerned that efforts are taking so long, particularly given the number of individuals under 18 years of age who still have not been assessed.  Access to multidisciplinary assessments and intervention at an early stage is important.  In many ways, this is why the new in-school support service has been put in place.  Via my grandchildren, I witnessed it starting to operate recently.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that the Deputy has raised this matter with the Minister and the Taoiseach previously and is pursuing it again today.

Deputies do not come into this Chamber to raise concerns like these unless they affect the people in our communities whom we represent.<\/p>  <p>  We have a great deal of work to do in this sector, as I know from the area I represent.  In Deputy Crowe's area, my area and others where people are less fortunate and living in communities with multiple problems, people can sometimes be left behind.

I appreciate him choosing this Topical Issue.  It is an important issue that I have raised in the House previously.  I particularly thank the Minister for Education and Skills for taking time to come in himself to deal with the issue.<\/p><p>The Minister is still relatively new to this brief and I wish him well in his challenging position.  While the Minister is new to his position, the staff and students of St. Michael's House special school in Skerries are in the same position they have been in for many years.  I am sure the Minister will have read in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>this morning that they have been in temporary accommodation for 36 years.<\/p><p>The school has a longstanding application in for a new school building and I have raised this on many occasions in the Chamber.  In a Topical Issue reply I received in March last on this issue from the Minister's predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, stated:<\/p><blockquote>No effort will be spared in trying to progress the situation.  It is an important project for us.<\/blockquote><p>However, there is no evidence of this.<\/p><p>I am disappointed by the slow development of much-needed school provision by the Government.  In fact, disappointed does not even cover it.  It is devastating that so little progress has been made.<\/p><p>I understand a site has been identified and purchased.  The site was the issue for so long.  When a site is identified and acquired, there are still further delays on other matters.<\/p><p>In the previous Government, Labour Party Ministers prioritised the provision of new schools in the worst of economic times.  In 2015, I brought the then Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, to St. Michael's House in Skerries to see for herself the current building and how inadequate it is to meet the needs of the pupils.  Deputy O'Sullivan and the Department officials recognised the need but the prioritisation of the provision of new schools has been too slow.<\/p><p>When will we see works commence on site?  That is key for the people.  The principal, staff and pupils and their families deserve a proper answer.  They deserve a timeline for this to happen and I hope that in his response the Minister will provide that.<\/p><p>The current building is unfit for purpose.  The school has been housed there for 36 years.  Unfortunately, the building is well past its use-by date.  It is an old farmhouse.  I have visited it several times.  The mounting level of repairs needed just to keep the building in basic condition is financially onerous.<\/p><p>The school received prefabs in recent years due to the poor state of the building and the benefits are acknowledged by everyone involved, but these are not long-term solutions and are merely putting the finger in the dam.  In the summer, it can be too hot to have classes indoors.  In the winter, the school can be very cold.<\/p><p>Also, the school is at maximum capacity.  There is no more space for any increase in the student body.  Currently, pupils are only admitted when an existing pupil finishes his or her time at the school.  With a maximum capacity of 30 pupils supported by 17 dedicated staff, the number of spaces that crop up is small.  Many families are left on waiting lists and are living with perpetual disappointment and, of course, great concern.<\/p><p>With a new building, St. Michael's House could increase its service provision to 92 pupils, thus trebling its current number and giving hope to many others who are waiting for places.  What a transformation that would be.<\/p><p>We talk about this being a time of economic recovery, and it is.  Unemployment is returning to boom time levels, Exchequer receipts are up and we finally have some funds to invest back into the State.  We need to look after our most vulnerable citizens.<\/p><p>The students in St Michael&rsquo;s special school need and deserve a facility which meets a good standard.  In a new school, they can thrive and fulfil their potential.  They cannot do it in the current building.<\/p><p>The staff in St. Michael's House are a credit to the teaching profession and to the public sector generally.  They are being inhibited from doing their job to the best of their ability by the inadequacy of their building but they are not the real losers.  The people who lose the most are the pupils.  They are not getting the facilities they deserve and which would allow them to thrive and fulfil their individual potential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400036#MM00100","speaker":"1301"},{"type":"speech","time":1548345000,"counter":359,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for putting down this matter.  It is an important area and I join with the Deputy in acknowledging the valuable work that is carried out at St. Michael's House special school, Skerries.<\/p>  <p>  I am happy to clarify the position in respect of the development of permanent accommodation for St. Michael's House special national school.<\/p>  <p>  The school was established in 1982 and is currently located in a rented building with temporary accommodation in Hackettstown, Skerries.  My Department is committed to providing a permanent accommodation solution and in that regard, a project to deliver a new school building for St. Michael's House special school on a greenfield site has been included in the Department's six-year capital programme.  It is planned to provide a new building for St. Michael's special school to accommodate a 14 classroom school expandable to 16 classrooms, to include classes for pupils with mild general learning difficulties, autistic spectrum disorder, multiple disabilities and severe-profound disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with Fingal County Council in accordance with the memorandum of understanding in relation to the acquisition of a suitable site to facilitate the school building project.<\/p>  <p>  The site acquisition process for this school has been ongoing for some time.  Initial efforts were focussed on acquiring land in the vicinity of the school's current location which was preferred by the school authorities.  However, efforts in that regard were unsuccessful and subsequently the current site option was identified.  The acquisition process was subsequently paused for some time while my Department engaged with the school authorities regarding potential alternative accommodation which was available at the time.  However, based on the outcome of this engagement, the site acquisition process re-started and agreement was reached with the relevant landowner in respect of the proposed acquisition.  This acquisition is currently at conveyance stage.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to confirm that my Department is committed to progressing this project and will continue to liaise with Fingal County Council and the school authorities to achieve this.<\/p>  <p>  The acquisition process for a permanent site is under way.  My Department is aware of the limitations of the current temporary accommodation and every effort is being made to progress the permanent accommodation for the school as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  That is for the purpose of putting on the record the history of the matter and where we are at.  At a personal level, I am eager to move this forward.  If there may be areas where we can work together to make this happen, I would be happy to do so.  The Deputy asked for a timeframe.  Unfortunately, I am not in a position to give the timeframe because of the conveyance issue but I am aware parents want certainty, staff want to know when this will happen and the Deputy also spoke of the opportunity to grow the school population.  It may require meeting with relevant officials sitting around a table.  Deputy Brendan Ryan's constituency colleagues, my own party colleagues, have been on to me as well on this issue.  It is not just because it is a public issue that appeared in the media today - Deputy Brendan Ryan has raised this on numerous occasions.  I want to give my personal commitment to do whatever it takes to do this.  It is not acceptable to be in this position for over 30 years but, unfortunately, things happen.  The Deputy talked about his colleagues being in positions previously, a site was identified and things did not happen.  Unfortunately, that can happen.  It is a slow process.  At the same time, if there are areas where we can work together, I would be happy to sit down with the Deputy and the relevant officials to ensure that we keep this on a live agenda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400036#MM00200","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1548345000,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.

As I understand it, the conveyance matter should not take long.  This is an issue of priority.<\/p>  <p>  From the time St. Michael's House was founded in 1955, it has helped to change fundamentally how we as a country educate people with intellectual disabilities.  It has been a leader in the development of community-based services for people with intellectual disabilities, providing services to 1,751 children and adults.<\/p>  <p>  St. Michael's House has demonstrated exceptional leadership throughout the years but if it is to deliver its vital service, it requires assistance from the State in the form of a new building and facilities worthy of its staff and deserving of its pupils and their families.<\/p>  <p>  The school community needs a new school delivered.  It needs the Department to provide this as a priority by getting work under way as soon as possible.  The people are waiting to see machines go on that site.  If they can see that, they will take hope from it.  From where the process is, that should not take too long.  It needs to be accelerated.<\/p>  <p>  I have been working closely with the school in recent times.  I am aware of the various developments and reasons for delays, but I cannot emphasise strongly enough how stretched the school is.  Pupils cannot take their required breaks.  There are also pressures on space from a staff perspective, which has a direct effect on how well they can deliver their services to the pupils.<\/p>  <p>  St. Michael's House is a special school and as such has special requirements unlike mainstream schools, but these requirements are not so special that an inordinate delay should occur.<\/p>  <p>  I ask this Minister to be the one this school has been waiting for who finally delivers this project.  The Irish are a compassionate people who want to see fellow citizens treated equally and fairly.  I want to see this progress as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  There is a wider concern I want to raise in the couple of seconds I have left.<\/p><p>Throughout my 12 years as a Member of the Oireachtas, school building programmes have come and gone.  Special schools tend to factored in at the tail end of each school programme and are never given priority.  They are never provided for upfront in year one or two of the programme but, rather, are afforded low priority.  They tend not to be delivered and are then rolled into the next programme.  On and on it goes.  The Minister is new to the Department and there is an opportunity for him to make his mark.  He must root out this approach to how the Department treats special schools and he will be a hero of the disability sector.  They very much deserve it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400036#MM00300","speaker":"1301","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548345600,"counter":362,"content":"<p>I wish to reiterate my point on the conveyancing process.  The matter is currently with the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  If there is something that can be done at this stage of the process to keep this alive and on the agenda, I will do it.<\/p>  <p>  On the Deputy's second point regarding where we are in terms of the priority of special schools, in my initial introduction to the Department and the area of special schools and special classes in mainstream schools I have been struck by the intensity involved.  The services are demand led.  Parents demand the choice of being able to send their children to a special or a mainstream school based on what is most suitable for the child.  I met representatives of three special schools this morning and committed to continuing to work with them.  The Deputy is correct that we must ensure there is equal focus on this issue, including special classes.  The number of special classes has increased from more than 408 in 2011 to 1,500 currently, indicating significant momentum and change.<\/p>  <p>  The overall budget for this year is approximately &euro;1.75 billion.  We must hold what we have in terms of priority for special schools, which is very important.  I appreciate the sometimes very challenging areas within that.  However, a recent visit to Little Angels, a special school in my county, highlighted the number of dedicated staff, including special teachers and special needs assistants, who work very well on a collaborative basis.  However, if the staff do not have the proper environment and buildings, it makes their job far more difficult.<\/p>  <p>  I am focused on this issue and want to see progress made on it.  If there are things we can do collectively, I am prepared to do them.  The Deputy and I worked very well together on the Business Committee, along with the Ceann Comhairle.

The report arose from several contacts and requests made to me and other members of the committee, identifying the problems regarding the adequacy of training and supports for providers of special needs education and education in DEIS schools, as well as in schools that, in the opinion of the committee, may deserve DEIS status but did not receive it.  Having considered the matters, they were given priority by the committee and several stakeholders were invited to make a written submission outlining their views.  That led to the committee agreeing to hold a public hearing to examine in more detail the points raised in those submissions.  I wish to thank the stakeholders who gave oral evidence to the committee, namely, Ms Deirbhile Nic Craith, director of education and research, Irish National Teachers&rsquo; Organisation; Dr. Anne Ryan, senior lecturer in education, Marino Institute of Education; Dr. Gene Mehigan, principal lecturer in education, Marino Institute of Education; Ms Noreen Duggan, principal of Scoil na Naomh Uilig in Newbridge; Ms Pauline Dempsey, principal of St. Anne&rsquo;s special school in the Curragh; Ms Breda Corr, general secretary of the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education; Ms Teresa Griffin, CEO of the National Council for Special Education; Ms Madeline Hickey, director of the special education support service for the National Council for Special Education; and Dr. &Aacute;ine Hyland, professor of education, University College Cork.  There were very worthwhile exchanges with each of the witnesses.<\/p><p>The report deals with two distinct topics which the committee agreed to deal with together: training and support for providers of special needs education and education in DEIS schools.  In the course of the hearing, several themes of particular concern to the committee emerged.  These themes are highlighted in the report and form the basis for the eight key recommendations relating to both topics.<\/p><p>All Members recognise that attendance at mainstream schools by children with special educational needs results in significantly better outcomes for students and, indeed, the wider community in terms of inclusiveness.  Of course, it is accepted that special schools have a role to play for some students and their families.  However, simply providing these places will not have the desired result without sufficient supports and resources being made available and qualified personnel in particular.  It is essential that all members of the education community be fully and appropriately trained in order to ensure that the best interests of every student are at the centre of any decision and that any student who so wishes and whose family so desires should have the opportunity to attend a mainstream school, either within an autism spectrum disorder, ASD, unit or in a mainstream classroom with the appropriate resources.  The committee was told that there is a significant problem regarding teachers attending appropriate training courses.  This is due to several factors.  One of particular concern which could be dealt with by the Department relates to the lack of substitute teachers available to facilitate the release of teachers to attend the training.<\/p><p>I wish to specifically mention the issue of schools which are granted ASD units but do not receive sufficient resources to kit them out.  Last Friday, I visited a primary school in Rath, County Laois, which caters for almost 250 students.  It has two ASD units.  The Department sanctioned a fantastic ASD unit which is almost fully built.  I commend the Department on the quality of the build.  It will make an incredible difference to the 12 young people who will be in the two units.  However, the Department has not sanctioned any funding to kit out the unit, which will be ready in two to three weeks.  There are, for example, three padded areas: two for break-out areas from the separate units and one for a sensory room.  The padding will cost a significant amount of money but the Department is refusing to pay for it because several years ago the school received a small grant of &euro;6,500 for another sensory space.  I saw the latter space last Friday.  It is little more than a cupboard.  There is no way that anything could be transferred from it.  I have submitted parliamentary questions on the matter and spoken to the Minister's office about it this week because I have no doubt that school is not the only one in that situation.  It is important that we refer to such issues.<\/p><p>The provision of a special needs assistant, SNA, in the classroom is essential to assist the student and support him or her in achieving his or her full potential.  However, we must remember that the SNA is not responsible for the delivery of teaching or instruction, which are solely matters for the teacher.  It is appropriate for the SNA to work with the teacher to differentiate or adapt the curriculum to suit the needs of individual pupils.<\/p><p>In addition to the many challenges facing teachers and SNAs, the committee feels their role is constantly being challenged with the significant volume of paperwork and circulars emanating from the Department.  The principal focus of teachers and SNAs must always be on the student and his or her educational progression and personal development.  This should not be diluted by dealing with a burden of administrative duties, yet many students with special educational needs still find themselves in classrooms with too many students and insufficient supports to allow them to make progress and achieve the goals to which they aspire.  This creates a highly pressurised and frustrating environment and can result in students and teachers being injured at schools.  Reports of such incidents have been brought to my attention and that of other members of the committee.  It is shocking and unacceptable for everybody.  One school referred to the adequate number of clinical staff to support the needs of certain students and said that, despite an increase in student numbers, it has had to reduce the number of hours clinical staff are available due to insufficient funding.  The lack of adequate and appropriate supports for students and schools will obviously result in a negative experience and outcome for them, their families and the wider school communities.<\/p> <p> The committee notes that an increased capitation grant is paid to special education schools, but the evidence given to it clearly suggests this is still insufficient.  Consideration may be given to the provision of such supports separate from capitation grants.  I acknowledge that the State is investing a significant amount of its budget in providing support to special education, yet there are still glaring gaps in the service.<\/p> <p> Moving on to the delivering equality of opportunities in schools, DEIS, element of the report, the introduction of DEIS was certainly very welcome, but a number of the contributors to the committee pointed out that there are still challenges within schools despite the scheme.  No matter what, there are disadvantaged children in every school, regardless of whether it has DEIS status.  Therefore, we must consider how we can support those who are disadvantaged in schools that do not have DEIS status.  DEIS was originally aimed at addressing the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities.  This was a very welcome initiative and has resulted in significant success.  Therefore, the introduction of its successor in 2017 was widely anticipated.  The committee will monitor its effectiveness.  There is certainly dissatisfaction in regard to how schools were accepted into the DEIS scheme.<\/p> <p> DEIS 2017 aims at providing a vision for education to become more fully a proven pathway to better opportunities for those in communities at risk of disadvantage and social exclusion.  It plays an important role.  We can never forget that, but we need to have more resources under the scheme.  DEIS sets out a number of objectives and actions to support children at greatest risk of educational disadvantage.  These are to implement a more robust and responsive assessment framework for identification of schools and effective resource allocation; to improve the learning experience and outcomes of pupils in DEIS schools; to improve the capacity of school leaders and teachers to engage, plan and deploy resources to their best advantage; to support and foster best practice in schools through inter-agency collaboration; and to support the work of schools by providing the research, information, evaluation and feedback to achieve the goals of the plan.  No DEIS scheme can succeed fully, however, unless other elements of the education experience complement and support it in achieving its goals.  The problem with many such schemes is that they can be interpreted too rigidly and can fail some of those whom they are supposed to help.  I accept that such consequences are unintentional but this appears to be the case based on the evidence to the committee.<\/p> <p> All schemes and the guidelines governing their implementation and operation must have inbuilt flexibility to develop in response to the ever-changing needs to achieve their ends.  In addressing the issues highlighted by the committee in producing this report, the outcomes will be universally beneficial by ensuring that the needs of the students are met, school staff on the ground can manage resources appropriately, and the State and all our communities will get value for their money.<\/p> <p> The committee's report makes a total of eight very reasonable and practical recommendations based on the evidence put to it.  The Minister has provided an overview of progress made under DEIS Plan 2017 arising from recommendation No. 8.  I certainly welcome this.  I do, however, wish to place on the record of the House the other recommendations.  The first is that the committee recommends that the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 be put into effect fully.  The Act puts in place legislation to give children with special educational needs the right to graduate from school with the skills necessary to participate, to the level of their capacity, in an inclusive way in the social and economic activities of society and to live independent and fulfilled lives.  Parts of the law have been brought into effect but not those that would give a statutory entitlement to provide students with a full assessment of the supports needed to allow them to participate in education and to have the necessary resources provided in accordance with an individual education plan.  It is imperative that they be brought into effect.<\/p> <p> The second is that the committee asks the Minister for Education and Skills to consider the merits of establishing a two-year pilot co-teaching-for-inclusion project at primary level.  Third, the committee recommends that the Minister for Education and Skills put in place measures to address issues affecting schools that were raised in the course of the discussion, including the shortage of school places, facilitating children with challenging behavioural issues, injuries to staff and other pupils, staff-pupil ratios and substitute cover.<\/p> <p> Fourth, the committee recommends that the shortage of specialised school places for post-primary children with autism and other special educational needs be addressed as a matter of urgency.  An issue in Kildare took 18 months to resolve.  This will happen on an ongoing basis, so addressing it is an absolute priority.<\/p> <p> Fifth, the committee recommends that the training of staff, from teachers to bus escorts, be made compulsory and that consideration be given to the provision of a separate fund for this training to be made available by the Department of Education and Skills so as not to impact further the funding of schools.  Sixth, the committee recommends the standardisation of nursing and clinical supports throughout the educational system.  Seventh, the committee recommends that the findings and recommendations on supporting students with special educational needs in school be examined and implemented where practicable.<\/p> <p> The Minister has addressed recommendation No. 8 in correspondence but I will put it on the record.  The committee recommends that an update on the implementation of the five goals identified in DEIS Plan 2017 prior to the publication of the report be provided to the committee.  The committee believes supports should be pupil-centred and made available to students who are disadvantaged, rather than providing only for children who attend a DEIS school.<\/p> <p> I would be grateful for some clarification on the apparent focus on allocating funds based on students who reside in an area of high deprivation as a proportion of the total enrolment.  The support should be associated with the student and should not be limited by virtue of geographical location alone.<\/p> <p> Most important, I acknowledge the commitment of all involved in the provision of education for children with special educational needs and those who teach and provide support in DEIS schools throughout the State.  Without them, many children would not have been given the opportunities they have had to date.  I pay tribute to secretarial and support staff in schools on their dedication.  Their significant contributions are often overlooked.  The committee is considering examining this formally.<\/p> <p> The report and its recommendations highlight a number of specific issues that speak for themselves.  While addressing some of these may be under way, I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400037#NN00400","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548346200,"counter":366,"content":"<p>The Ceann Comhairle has advised me that if the House agrees, the next two speakers may now be heard, followed by the Minister's reply and the wrap-up contribution.

I thought it was apt that two of the Topical Issue debates today were on delays in speech and language services for children and a special school.  In general when we speak about special education, children with additional needs constantly seem to be treated as second-class citizens.  As much as some people might disagree with this analysis it is the case because they must battle for absolutely everything, whether it is speech and language services, occupational therapy, a place in a preschool, a place on a bus or a place in a school, and we seem to accept standards for children with additional needs that we would not accept for other children, such as long delays and travelling distances to and from school.  We are supposed to tell parents and children they should be grateful they finally got a school place after battling and, in many cases, having been stressed for the previous two years.  It is just not good enough.  We speak about it an awful lot in the Chamber.  I want to apologise to anyone who has heard me speak on the topic previously because I will pretty much say the same thing I have always said but I hope that at some point it will be taken on board and listened to.  It is an area in which I have a very strong interest.  I feel it is completely unacceptable that we treat children with additional needs in this way.<\/p>  <p>  The main areas I want to focus on are recommendations Nos. 4, 5 and 8.  Recommendation No. 4 is on the shortage of specialised school places for post-primary schoolchildren with autism and other special educational needs.  The committee asks for this to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  Coincidentally, last week my office received a call from a lady in my constituency who highlighted this very matter.  There are two autism spectrum disorder classes available in County Kilkenny at post-primary level, one is in Kilkenny city and the other in rural Kilkenny.  The school in rural Kilkenny is the one in Ballyhale visited by the Minister yesterday.  That is it for any child who has come along really well through an autism spectrum disorder class at primary level.  When it comes to secondary school they are extremely limited with only those two schools.  There are issues of geography.  It is completely unacceptable.  It is a very serious matter.  It is a live issue in my constituency and I am sure it is the same for many Deputies.<\/p>  <p>  Recommendation No. 5 is on training for staff, including teachers and bus escorts, to be made compulsory and that consideration be given to the provision of a separate fund for this training to be made available by the Department of Education and Skills so as not to impact further on the funding of schools.  I fully support this recommendation.  It is similar to a matter I raised in a parliamentary question to the Minister earlier in the week on having a specific training course for teachers to teach in either special educational schools or autism spectrum disorder or special classes.  This will always be met with issues regarding inclusiveness, and everybody wants inclusiveness, but in some situations this could be very good because not only would we give the very much needed and required training but it would provide an opportunity for people with a specific interest in the area and in working with children with additional needs.  We should look at this.<\/p>  <p>  During Question Time, the Minister stated he did not mind looking at the area and I hope the recommendation in the report means that he will do so.  We have seen a very significant increase in autism spectrum disorder classes and we must meet this with the required training and give teachers an opportunity.  Many special needs assistants, who have worked in the field for years, would love to progress and teach in a special education school or class.  Unfortunately, at present, they are met with many barriers.  We need to examine these practical issues.  I do not like to be negative and criticise without stating what we should do and this is an area we can look at.  A large number of special needs assistants would like to progress and training should be made available.  The training should also be made available to people in general with a specific interest in special education.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to recommendation No. 6, a witness who attended one of the hearings made the point she was initially employed as a nurse for 26.5 hours for three children and this was reduced to 24 hours despite the fact she was then caring for 24 children.  She went from caring for three children to 24 children but the number of hours was reduced.  She was unable to take a lunch break and was working a further nine hours for which she was not paid.  This is completely unacceptable.  We cannot have these situations.  This will not be sustainable.  There is no way that even with the best will in the world anybody can stay in a job working under these terms and conditions.  We would not accept it in other sectors so we should not accept it when it comes to special education and children with additional needs.<\/p>  <p>  Recommendation No. 8 is on DEIS.  I agree with Deputy O'Loughlin that it can be a great system, particularly in recent years when we have seen the high impact of cuts, many children going to school hungry and not being able to afford lunch, and the impact of poverty on children but we need to figure out a way to have the resource follow the child.  Many children who are not in DEIS schools are struggling and impacted.  In a small number of non-DEIS schools children may have access to the school completion programme.  It is primarily in DEIS schools but it is in a few other schools also.  The vast majority of children do not have access to these services.  They do not need the services of Tusla but if we could figure out a way for the resources to follow the child or expand DEIS to include other schools it would be extremely valuable.<\/p>  <p>  I hope we look at the recommendations.  The Minister has a genuine interest in the area and he wants to see progress.  He comes from a rural constituency so he knows what it is like for children who are faced with long journeys and long waiting lists.  I hope we will see action on some of the recommendations.  We cannot just keep talking about it and saying how bad it is.  We do point out small bits of progress here and there but it is not enough and they do not meet demands.  It is not acceptable that there are only two autism spectrum disorder classes at post-primary level in County Kilkenny.  It is completely unfair and puts children with additional needs at a disadvantage.  I hope the recommendations are taken on board and that we see action in the near future and not in five or ten years' time when we have discovered a whole new set of problems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400039#PP00100","speaker":"1266"},{"type":"speech","time":1548346800,"counter":368,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills and committee members for producing this very valuable report.  When I told somebody today the report was coming before the D&aacute;il, that person, who is on two boards of management, asked me to ask that boards of management and patrons of schools are specifically included in the training opportunities available because there are a number of difficult points.  When parents apply for a place in a primary school at very junior level they are told by special education needs organisers, SENOs, to ask for a place in every primary school in the area and told that it would be great if the parent gets a place.  Very often, they cannot do so.  We need information and support for parents on getting access to an educational place.<\/p>  <p>  Boards of management do not necessarily understand the criteria.  They definitely need training.  They also need training because, as the Chairman is aware, many issues involving a child with severe behavioural issues go to board level for action by the board and I am concerned about this.  The behavioural issues may be very severe and may involve actual or perceived threats to staff or other children in the school.  This can sometimes result in the child effectively being excluded from school.<\/p><p>There is an epidemic of this practice in the UK and we do not want to go down that route.  We need to think about such exclusions because this is a difficult issue for everybody.  The same issues clearly arise all over again at secondary school level.  I refer, for example, to a child attending secondary school who is on the autism spectrum and has not progressed in a way that might have been expected or perhaps still suffers from severe behavioural issues.  While there are no easy answers, there are practical measures that need to be considered.<\/p> <p> I also am aware of a number of children who have transitioned from primary school and are now in their first year in secondary school.  They are on the autism spectrum but also have difficult behavioural issues.  In Castleknock in my constituency, which is the Taoiseach's home area, there has been no prescribing consultant psychiatrist in the child and adult mental health service, CAMHS, based there since two months before Christmas.  The Minister may be aware of what that means.  It means that a child with ADHD, panic attacks or other severe behavioural issues cannot be prescribed the medicine that may be essential to him or her to help manage his or her behaviour while attending school.  <\/p> <p> I raised a Topical Issue matter on this issue earlier in the week to which the Minister for Health replied.  It was indicated that other staff could be allowed to prescribe medication.  I agree that prescribing medicine in these circumstances is really important for children but it is also important that senior staff are involved in decision-making.  The medicine prescribed can have important effects on the lives of both the child and his or her family.  We are just developing knowledge in this area and not every school has access to this knowledge.  <\/p> <p> I commend all the people who work in special needs schools and in schools, as well as all the genuine efforts being made to integrate the children.  Reference was made to ASD classes.  As Minister for Education and Skills, my colleague, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, dropped the term \"unit\".  Children were sometimes being asked when they were getting out of the unit, as if they were in a place that was somewhat special, so the language was changed.  Recommendation No. 6 on standardising nursing and clinical supports is a good solid recommendation.  It also is a very ambitious recommendation.  I worked for a long time with the Daughters of Charity in Castleknock, the Navan Road and much of the north side of Dublin and I saw big changes in the model on the HSE side.  The schools were then left to pick up the nursing support side.<\/p> <p> I do not think that situation has ever been fully addressed, except where there is a full special needs school.  That needs to be looked at because parents want their small child, with special needs, to be mainstreamed into our educational system with other children as far as possible.  That is understandable and good but definitely requires appropriate nursing and clinical support.  There needs to be co-operation between the medical and social services and the schools, regardless of whether we are talking about DEIS or non-DEIS schools.  In the greater Dublin area, however, the only school parents can often get their children into are DEIS schools because, in practice, they may have more vacancies.  The Minister's officials will be able to tell him about that.  <\/p> <p> Parents raise another issue with me all of the time.  Children, in Dublin and elsewhere, are obliged to go on long bus journeys every day.  Some children may like and enjoy that.  It is, however, very demanding on a child on the ASD spectrum who might have particular sensitivities to lights, movement, noise or traffic, to have to be on a bus for an hour or an hour and a half twice a day.  I am sure it is something the educational experts have factored in.  Parents usually welcome their child being in a special school but it is a very long journey.<\/p> <p> As Minister for Social Protection, I carried out a review, with the chief medical officer of the Department, on the domiciliary care allowance.  It was changed at the time to specifically include the behavioural disorders that many of us have only learned of in relatively recent years.  I am not sure those behavioural disorders are fully accounted for and recognised by the Department of Education and Skills.  The Department of Education and Skills recognises autism spectrum disorders now but perhaps 20 years ago it did not.  Behavioural issues, therefore, need some expert attention.  In the UK, many children are being excluded from school and much subsequent analysis suggests that some of those children have behavioural issues that could be helped were they to receive expert help.  <\/p> <p> It is very difficult for a school when staff and other pupils have to deal with a situation like that.  It is not always easy.  Nobody wants to see children being expelled from school or being excluded.  Equally, no one wants parents to be told that their child can only be in school for an hour, that a parent has to be on the premises ready to intervene, should that be required, or be available to stay in the school if the child cannot be taken home.  I am sure the staff in the Department have probably discussed this at great length.  I like the idea of a nursing presence.  That was always available in the specialist primary schools attached to the traditional institutions which provided care for children with intellectual and other disabilities.  It makes a lot of sense to have qualified, experienced and skilled nurses available.  I appreciate that it would probably be expensive.  It is something, however, that needs to be examined and considered.  <\/p> <p> I return to my experience in the then Department of Social Protection during the examination of the domiciliary care allowance.  By consulting with various people with great experience in the field in a range of different countries, it was possible to make vast improvements in who qualified for the allowance.  That took some of the pressure off of the families and gave them an acknowledged support.  I think the same thing is happening in the area of schools.  We are at the beginning of further and better developments.  I know many special needs assistants, SNAs.  They give enormous support to children and are very important in the life of a school, both for the other children and for the school staff.  There should be a focus on providing much more training capacity and opportunities to SNAs because many of us are aware of the great care they give to children.  I refer also to school secretaries and the care they too give to children and to children with special needs in particular.  If they can be included in the positive developments to come, that would pay major dividends in developing our understanding of how, as a society, we can best respond to special needs.  That would be to everybody's benefit.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400039#PP00200","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548348000,"counter":370,"content":"<p>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm deis a bheith agam labhairt ar an &aacute;bhar t&aacute;bhachtach seo.  It is nice and quiet here on a Thursday.  It is a good place to be to think properly and listen to individual contributions.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome this opportunity to address the House on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills report on training and supports for providers of special needs education and education in DEIS schools.  I thank all the committee members and its Chairman, Deputy O&rsquo;Loughlin, for their deliberations and report on this matter.  I will follow up on the provision of autistic schooling services in County Laois which Deputy O&rsquo;Loughlin raised with me.  I join with her in acknowledging the witnesses who presented to the committee and their invaluable contributions.  We are in such an evolving space with special education, particularly when one considers the trajectory of funding from 2011.  That in itself is a sign that there has been change and there will be more.  We need to be in a position to adapt to that.<\/p>  <p>  The topic is significant and worthy of the full consideration of the House.  The matter at its core relates to our most vulnerable children and young people with special educational needs and those who are educationally disadvantaged.  The committee identified the topic of training and supports for providers of special needs education and education in DEIS schools as one of its priorities.  It undertook a consultation process with a broad range of education stakeholders.  A key component of the committee&rsquo;s report recognises the need for greater inclusion and diversity in the educational system for all children, based on their individual strengths.<\/p>  <p>  The committee made eight recommendations.  The recommendations include the full implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act, compulsory training for all school staff, standardisation of nursing and clinical supports throughout the education system and that an update on the implementation of the five goals identified in the DEIS plan 2017 be provided to the committee.<\/p>  <p>  Ensuring children with special educational needs are supported and given the opportunity to reach their full potential is a key priority for the Government.  The Government&rsquo;s basic aim is to use our economic success to build a fairer and compassionate society.  Equality of opportunity is at the heart of our vision.  Notwithstanding the fact that not all the sections of the EPSEN Act have been commenced, several significant developments have taken place in recent years regarding the provision of supports for children with special educational needs in schools.  This includes significant levels of additional investment, combined with a number of reforming measures.<\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to seek to improve provisions by implementing the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, policy advice recommendations, including the policy advice on supporting students with special educational needs in schools published in 2013.  It also seeks to bring into effect many of the good ideas contained in the EPSEN Act on a non-statutory basis initially through policy developments across a range of areas.<\/p>  <p>  During the worst years of the recession, when public spending was cut across the board, we not only protected supports to children with special educational needs, we increased them.  In 2018, my Department invested more than &euro;1.75 billion in this area, one fifth of my Department&rsquo;s overall budget and up 42% since 2011 at which point &euro;1.24 billion was invested.  This additional investment has provided for an increase of 38% in the number of special education teachers allocated to schools from 9,630 in 2011 to almost 13,300; a 137% increase in the number of special classes from 548 in 2011 to 1,304; and a 42% increase in the number of SNAs available in 2011 with 15,000 SNAs working in our schools at the end of 2018.  That figure will come close to 16,000 this year.<\/p>  <p>  A range of other supports are also provided for children with special educational needs such as special school transport arrangements, assistive technology supports and additional teachers in special schools.  My Department is committed to a number of measures across the sector to ensure training and upskilling teachers and other professionals working with students.  We will continue to examine all avenues of training and not just the traditional routes.  There are many good people looking after children in the school environment, as well as acting their guardians.  We need to ensure they get equal access to training.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE strives to bring about improved educational outcomes for students with special educational needs by developing schools&rsquo; and teachers&rsquo; capacity to provide a relevant and meaningful school experience for students through a multi-tiered continuum of support which is inclusive and responsive.  This is achieved by providing supports to schools; by giving advice to educators, parents and guardians; by undertaking and disseminating research into special education; and by providing policy advice to the Minister for Education and Skills on special education issues.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE aims to support the professional development needs of teachers and schools in the teaching of children with special needs in as flexible a way as possible.  The establishment of one NCSE support service, incorporating the special education support service, SESS, national behaviour support service, NBSS, and visiting teacher service with a special education needs organiser service, provides a more integrated and coherent support structure to support schools, parents and students.  The NCSE provides a range of supports to teachers, parents and students in the area of special educational needs.  This includes continuing professional development, CPD, for teachers which includes school-based seminars, NCSE designed and delivered seminars; NCSE supported courses; online courses; e-learning and book borrowing schemes.  The NCSE support service also provides support for schools, groups and individual teachers, including school visits, phone support and email support.  CPD courses are available through Middletown Centre for Autism, while college and university courses are provided at postgraduate level such as applied behavioural analysis, deaf-hard of hearing and visual impairment.<\/p>  <p>  In 2017 in all areas of special educational need, the NCSE delivered 7,211 courses or events in CPD.  More than 15,600 participants, school management and teachers, received CPD outside of school and over 22,200 participants received in school support through visits and presentations.  The concept of co-teaching, or team teaching, is already in evidence in my Department&rsquo;s policies and supports for inclusive education.  There is experience of this both in special educational needs and DEIS.  Team teaching encompasses a range of models which have to be used in a way that is appropriate and meaningful to the individual school context, as well as acknowledging the roles of the teachers and students involved.<\/p>  <p>  The professional development service for teachers provides CPD support to teachers on an ongoing basis for team teaching and also has had involvement with student-teacher projects in this area.  Section 39 of the Teaching Council Acts 2001 to 2015 provides for the council to review and accredit programmes providing continuing training and professional development for teachers.  In the Education (Amendment) Act 2012, section 39 was amended to enable the council to regulate for conditions for renewal of teacher registration, including attendance at programmes of continuing education and training.  These amendments have yet to be commenced.<\/p>  <p>  Under section 38 of the Teaching Council Act, all initial teacher education programmes have been reviewed and accredited by the Teaching Council for registration purposes.  The criteria and guidelines for programme providers, published in 2011 and revised in March 2017, is an important document which must be observed by all providers of initial teacher education in order that their programmes are recognised for the purposes of teacher registration.  Inclusive education is a mandatory area of study for all student teachers who are undertaking programmes of initial teacher education at primary and post-primary levels in Ireland in accordance with the criteria and guidelines.<\/p>  <p>  The graduate teacher is required to demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the factors that promote and hinder learning, the impact of pupils&rsquo; backgrounds on learning and the need to provide for the holistic development of the learner, particularly through differentiated approaches.  It is widely accepted that the issue of training and supports is much broader than teacher education.  Students can benefit when all staff in schools and people with whom they interact have been trained in whole-school approaches to inclusion.<\/p>  <p>  The 2018 comprehensive review of the special needs assistant scheme, which set out to ensure the scheme is achieving the best outcomes possible for children with special educational needs, recommends the development of a national training programme tailored to the needs of school communities.  This will include training for special needs assistants to ensure school staffs have the requisite skills to meet the needs of students' care needs arising from significant medical, physical, emotional, behavioural, sensory and other significant difficulties with engaging with learning.  The full report of the SNA comprehensive review also contains a recommendation on the provision of nursing and clinical supports which was informed by the report from the working group on nursing supports for students with complex medical needs.  The Department of Health and my Department are tasked with agreeing and delivering the health and education supports required to meet the complex needs of students in special schools and classes.<\/p><p> In response to the comprehensive review of the SNA scheme I have undertaken to develop proposals for the implementation of the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, recommendations and I will bring to the Government shortly a proposed implementation plan for the policy recommendations of the report for approval.  I acknowledge the Connacht-Ulster branch of SNAs that I met in the past two weeks who raised the matter and asked when we would advance the issue.  I am glad to say we will be doing it as a priority very shortly.  The issue of complex behavioural needs was also examined as part of the comprehensive SNA review.  My Department is currently working on the development of guidelines for schools on the specific matter of the use of restraint and intervention.  Before finalising this work, the Department will consult with stakeholders and training will also be considered as part of this work.<\/p> <p> With regard to the recommendations in the committee report relating to issues affecting schools raised in the course of the committee's consultations with stakeholders, I have recently requested the NCSE to develop advice on the educational provision that should be in place for students educated in special schools and classes and to make recommendations on the provision required to enable students in special schools and classes achieve better outcomes.  The advice will also look at international approaches.  The NCSE has been asked to complete and submit its report to the Minister not later than June 2020.<\/p> <p> This Government has been able to continue to meet the needs of children with special educational needs attending our schools and to increase provision to address emerging needs in this area.  The Government will continue to prioritise investment in the area of special education support.  I assure the House that the education of children with special educational needs remains a key priority for this Government.<\/p> <p> With respect to the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, programme, inclusive education is a fundamental principle of our education and training system.  It is vital that all learners have the opportunity to benefit from education in order to help them fulfil their potential in life.  DEIS is my Department's main policy initiative aimed at tackling educational disadvantage in primary and post-primary schools.  The DEIS plan for 2017, launched by my Department in February 2017, contains five key goals and 108 actions to achieve those goals.  In line with the recommendations of the report, my Department has recently submitted an update to the committee on the implementation of that DEIS plan for 2017.  There are now 896 schools participating in the DEIS programme, with my Department having invested over &euro;125 million last year in the range of additional supports provided to DEIS schools, such as DEIS grants and enhanced DEIS book grants.  Additional funding of approximately &euro;81 million in 2018 was provided by the Government for the school meals programme and the school completion programme.  A number of years ago Deputy Burton was keen to ensure that aspect of funding could be protected, which I acknowledge.<\/p> <p> The current level of funding provided to DEIS schools highlights the Government's commitment to ensuring education becomes a proven pathway to better opportunities for all learners, especially those at risk of not maximising the benefits of education.  DEIS schools receive financial resources in the form of a DEIS grant, as well as an enhanced book grant.  They also have access to literacy and numeracy supports, priority access to professional development and the Centre for School Leadership, enhanced guidance allocation, access to the Incredible Years and Friends for Life programmes, as well as access to the school meals programme, the home school community liaison scheme and the school completion programme.<\/p> <p> My Department has introduced an objective, statistics-based model for assessing which schools merit inclusion in the DEIS programme so that all stakeholders can have confidence that we are targeting extra resources at those schools with the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage.  The rationale for allocating resources and supports based on a school's level of concentrated disadvantage is based on the existence of a \"multiplier effect\", whereby students attending a school with a concentration of students from disadvantaged backgrounds have poorer academic outcomes.  Research by the Educational Research Centre, ERC, and the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, indicates a strong evidence base in the Irish context that the social class mix of a school matters, providing a rationale for prioritising supports for schools that cater for those from lower socio-economic backgrounds.  Students in schools with high concentrations of peers from lower socio-economic backgrounds have lower achievement levels than those in schools with a more socially advantaged intake, all other factors being equal.  There is strong evidence of such an effect in DEIS post-primary schools and in urban DEIS primary schools, especially band 1 schools.<\/p> <p> The latest report published by the ERC on 7 January on the evaluation of DEIS at post-primary level indicates significant positive trends in achievement at junior certificate level.  However, more work needs to be done as indicated in last week's ESRI report on the impact of the revised leaving certificate grading scheme.  At the heart of the DEIS initiative is the requirement and opportunity for schools to determine their own needs, set their own targets and use resources as they think best to target those students most at risk of educational disadvantage.  I have listened closely to Deputies' comments on a targeted approach in order to get the highest impact and get support services to those most in need.  The new DEIS identification model will have an impact not only on the assessment of schools for inclusion in the programme but also on the scaling of resources to allow for more graduated levels of support.  This in turn will allow for the ultimate objective of allocating resources to best meet the identified need of individual schools.<\/p> <p> I thank the committee for its contribution and observations.  I have had meetings with leaders in the school system while touring around to different schools, including special schools, and I know there is always room to do more.  There are weaknesses but there are also strengths.  We must ensure we can continue to engage with stakeholders.  The committee's work involved reaching out to the people who matter and who have the experience and knowledge, which is really important.  I thank the committee for doing it.<\/p> <p> There has been an enormous influx of representations from colleagues around the House because of pressure to seek additional support for autistic young people.  I have already spoken this week about the language we use in the area.  I will not use the word mentioned by Deputy Burton but we must figure out a better way of getting our vocabulary around these issues so we do not create stigma and alienation in a school environment.  I know from the representations I have seen that there is pressure to provide the required classes for pupils on the autism spectrum.<\/p> <p> This does not just affect the greater Dublin area and it also has an impact on the Acting Chairman's county of Kildare, Meath, Wicklow and the rest of the country.  I acknowledge what Deputy Funchion described in her constituency.  A complex process of consultation is required and as the Deputies mentioned, the onus is on parents to find a place.  There can be complications and there may be better ways of facilitating information flow, such as through training boards of management or giving schools more of a roadmap on how to help.  It is difficult enough for a parent of a child with special needs without that parent having to go through the harsh reality of fighting for a school place.  There will be a big demand down the line but we must figure out a way of meeting it.<\/p> <p> In the Department's work and especially in the special needs area, there is a deep awareness that the inclusion model is working.  There is a need for special classes but there are also elements of choice and mainstream participation.  There is an awareness in the officials with whom I work that we must continue to prioritise the issue.  A change in legislation came into effect last December on the ministerial role with respect to special classes.  This is something we will monitor closely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400041#RR00100","speaker":"1290","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548348600,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I will not take 15 minutes but I would be happy to share it with other Deputies if they wish.  Nelson Mandela stated that education is the most powerful weapon we have to change the world.  We are really trying to make the world a little bit easier for those pupils who face challenges because of special needs, as well as their parents and those who are born in disadvantaged parts of society.<\/p><p>It is a battle and it can also be a battle to break out of the cycle of poverty and inequality.<\/p> <p> Deputies Funchion and Burton have spoken about the challenges facing parents of children with special needs, which are significant.  While parents have all the love in the world for their new baby, they face a fight every step of the way in terms of absorbing a diagnosis of autism or some other form of special needs or intellectual or physical disability at a later stage, trying to make sense of it and then trying to get an assessment, figure out what is available and get the supports.  Finding a school place at primary and secondary level is a significant challenge, which is unacceptable.  I have had experience of special education needs organisers, SENOs, telling parents to do the round of schools when the SENOs know whether there is capacity in them, and most of the time there is no capacity.  SENOs then suggest to parents that they make section 29 appeals.  Those who are there in a supportive capacity to help parents to get over these challenges should be doing far more than that.  What then happens is that parents come back to us to look for support around section 29 appeals.<\/p> <p> A principal of a special school spoke about that process.  It was heartbreaking listening to her.  Her school is overcrowded.  Funnily enough, the children who go to this school have fewer resources and SNA support than they would in mainstream schools but the SENO recommended that all the parents in question, and we are talking about children who had finished in an autism spectrum disorder, ASD, unit, apply to this school.  Three of them were granted.  Two of the children left that school after a number of months because the parents realised the school was nearly dangerous for their children to attend.  We need training and support for teachers and ancillary staff, including SNAs.  I take the point Deputy Burton made regarding boards of management so that they have a better understanding of the matter.  We need a rethink of how SENOs operate.  I have no doubt there are excellent SENOs out there but it is not good enough for them simply to recommend that parents take section 29 appeals and then nearly wash their hands of the matter when it comes to trying to find a place, particularly when children start in an ASD unit in a primary school and nothing is done about providing an education after an eight-year period.  Thankfully, the situation relating to Scoil Na Naomh Uilig in Newbridge was resolved with the help of the Minister, but we need to rethink the whole area.<\/p> <p> What the committee tried to do, and I am sure I speak for every Deputy and Senator in the Houses of the Oireachtas, was recognise and put in words the need for future inclusion and diversity in the education system for all our children based on their individual needs and strengths.  For some, this relates to special education while others may come from a disadvantaged background and may need extra supports in school.  We need a more pupil-centred approach.  It should be a given that students in need receive the supports they require to give them an equal chance at every stage and to allow them to get the very best educational outcome for them to become full citizens, go on to some kind of further education if they need to, have a positive role in society and be fulfilled and fulfilling citizens.<\/p> <p> The Minister said in his response that the Government has been able to continue to meet the needs of children with special educational needs attending our schools and increase provision to address emerging needs in this area.  I accept that work is being done but I do not think we are continuing to meet the needs of children with special educational needs on so many different levels, for example, the provision of an adequate number of ASD classes and supports at second level.  Transport is a very significant issue in terms of collecting children, bringing them to their place of education and bringing them home.  Every year, there are so many calls from distraught parents because the Department has told them that while there is a place for their child, the Department cannot give him or her transport.  In some cases, it will provide a grant towards providing the transport, which certainly goes nowhere near meeting needs.  On an individual basis working through the system, we have been able to deal with some of those after a period of time.  In my situation, it took six weeks before we were able to get transport.  There is much more that needs to be done.<\/p> <p> When the Minister talks about DEIS, he spoke about the objective statistics-based model for assessing schools.  We made the point that this is not working and that there are schools that are being left out and children who are being disadvantaged because they are being left out of this system when they need it.  I appreciate that, in his final comment, the Minister said that he will not only look at assessment for schools and inclusion but also the scaling of resources to allow for more graduated levels of support.  I accept that this might mean something for disadvantaged children in schools that do not have DEIS status.<\/p> <p> I thank the Minister for his engagement.  The committee appreciates the time he has taken.  This issue will never go away.  There will always be needs, vulnerable and disadvantaged children we must help, or children with special needs we must help through the Department and linking with the Department of Health, especially with regard to the provision of nursing staff etc.  As we go on, we continue to refine the system and make it better for those who will need to access all of these extra supports and resources we can offer.  I thank the Minister and all the members of the committee who contributed to this along with all the stakeholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400042#SS00200","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1548349200,"counter":374,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1548349200,"counter":375,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 5.45 p.m. until 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 29 January 2019.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
