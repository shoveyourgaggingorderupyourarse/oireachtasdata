Ireland has set an ambitious target of 945,000 EVs on our roads by 2030. This target is challenging but indicates the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to achieve its climate targets in the coming years. <\/p><p>Considerable progress has been made to ensure that conditions and policies are in place to support citizens in making greener vehicle choices. As the Deputy will be aware, a comprehensive suite of measures is available to EV drivers, including<\/p><p>- EV Purchase Grant Scheme of up to &euro;5000 for BEVs<\/p><p>- EV Home Charger Grant of Up to &euro;600 towards the installation cost of a domestic charge point for new and second-hand BEVs or PHEVs.<\/p><p>- Low Motor Tax - BEVs qualify for the lowest tax band of motor tax at &euro;120 per annum, while a PHEV is typically taxed at circa &euro;170 per annum.<\/p><p>- VRT relief of up to &euro;5,000 for BEVs.<\/p><p>- BEVs qualify for a 0% Benefit-in-Kind rate up to &euro;50,000 without mileage conditions.<\/p><p>- BEV and PHEVs qualify for 50% and 25% toll reductions respectively up to a maximum &euro;500 annual threshold for private vehicles and a maximum annual threshold of &euro;1,000 for commercial vehicles<\/p><p>- A grant of up to &euro;10,000 to support the purchase of a BEV in the taxi\/hackney\/limousine sector with an additional &euro;2,500 available for those choosing to make their vehicle wheelchair accessible. Those scrapping older, more polluting, or high mileage vehicles are now eligible for double the normal grant if they make the switch to electric with up to &euro;20K available for a new BEV, &euro;25K for a new wheelchair accessible BEV and &euro;15K for a new wheelchair accessible PHEV.<\/p><p>- Alternatively Fuelled Heavy-Duty Vehicle (AFHDV) Purchase Grant Scheme - grant levels under the Scheme are calculated as a percentage of the difference in price between a conventionally-fuelled diesel HDV and its alternatively-fuelled equivalent.<\/p><p>These measures have collectively contributed to increased take up of EVs in Ireland in recent years, albeit from a low base in 2017, to over 58,000 by end April 2022. <\/p><p>Notwithstanding this, I am acutely aware that the cost of electric vehicles remains an issue for many consumers and that supply chain issues globally have also proven difficult. These have been exacerbated by international events. For these reasons, our policy measures here are kept under continuous review. In this context, my Department convened the Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway (EVPP) Working Group to produce a roadmap to achieving the 2030 EV target. This Group considered a variety of regulatory, financial, and taxation policies to accelerate EV adoption and recommended that the generous suite of EV supports already in place in Ireland should be retained until at least end-2022. Additional measures to further incentivise EVs and\/or disincentivise fossil fuelled vehicles will also be necessary. Cost-effective, targeted policy supports should continue to be developed and strengthened over the coming years. <\/p><p>An Implementation Group has been established to progress the recommendations and consider further potential measures to drive the adoption of the EVs. This Group will report on its progress to Government in Q4 of this year.<\/p><p>The Government is fully committed to supporting a significant expansion and modernisation of the electric vehicle charging network over the coming years. A draft national charging infrastructure strategy for the development of EV charging infrastructure, covering the crucial period out to 2025 was published for consultation in March. The draft strategy sets out the government&rsquo;s ambition regarding the delivery of a public EV charging network to support up to 194,000 electric cars and vans by the middle of the decade. Responses and submissions received as part of the consultation are currently being considered in the development of the final Strategy for publication.<\/p><p>Preparations are underway to establish Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland (ZEVI). This Office will play an important role in our transition to zero emission vehicles. It will co-ordinate measures to support the uptake of EVs and the rollout of charge point infrastructure.<\/p><p>Home charging is the primary charging method for most Irish EV owners as it&rsquo;s convenient and cheaper for the consumer as well assists in the overall management of the national grid. Over 80% of charging is expected to happen at home. Government will also deliver a high quality seamless public charging network that will provide for situations or instances where home charging is not possible such as neighbourhood or residential charging, destination charging, and en-route or motorway charging. <\/p><p>As outlined above, a grant is available from the SEAI for those individuals seeking to install a home charger. Work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant to include shared parking in apartment blocks and similar developments. My Department is working closely with the SEAI and expects a scheme for apartments to open shortly.<\/p><p>&euro;10 million was committed from the Climate Action Fund to support ESB investment in the charging network and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB, with the infrastructure to be in place by the end of 2022. This intervention alone will result in:<\/p><p>- 90 additional high power chargers, each capable of charging two vehicles<\/p><p>-  Seventeenhigh-powerchargers distributed across 14 multi-vehicle hubs have been delivered as part of the programme to date.<\/p><p>- 52 additional fast chargers, which may replace existing standard chargers - This work is completed at 36 locations and delivery of new, faster and higher capacity technology is awaited to complete this element of the program, due in August and the upgrade program will resume then.  The remaining locations have all been identified and surveyed.<\/p><p>- 264 replacement standard chargers with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points - This work is substantially complete. 258 of the chargers have now been successfully replaced.<\/p><p>Further details on the progression of this project including the rollout of charge points in each county can be found at <i>esb.ie\/ecars\/our-network\/network-upgrades<\/i><i><font color=\"#0000FF\">.<\/font><\/i><\/p><p>The Public Charge Point Scheme continues to be available during 2022 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. My Department has reviewed the Scheme and the draft Strategy sets out a number of additional actions to support delivery by local authorities, such as funding capital costs for civil and electrics works, as well as charge point installation, through a new Residential Charging Scheme.<\/p><p>Finally, my Department is developing new grant schemes which will support the installation of destination charge points in locations including hotels, car parks and visitor and tourist attractions, both State-owned and commercial sites.

This would also be in step with the change in place in 2021 in the UK and planned for Northern Ireland. <\/p><p>The Minister for Transport published the Renewable Fuels for Transport Policy Statement in November 2021. The Statement sets out a roadmap for the supply and use of renewable energy in transport to address Ireland&rsquo;s national commitments under the Climate Action Plan 2021 and European obligations under the Renewable Energy Directive. It supports the actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in transport and increase the share of renewable fuels in the national Climate Action Plan 2021 and our international obligations, including the EU Renewable Energy Directive.<\/p><p>The use of biofuels is currently one of the main pillars of land transport decarbonisation. Since 2010, increasing volumes of biofuels have been introduced to Ireland&rsquo;s transport fuel supply through a biofuel blending obligation on fuel suppliers.<\/p><p>The obligation ensures that a certain percentage (currently 13% by volume) of the motor fuel placed on the market comes from renewable sources, for example bioethanol and biodiesel. In 2020 alone, 239 million litres of biofuels replaced about 209 million litres of fossil fuels, avoiding approximately 520 Kilo tonnes CO2 equivalent.

This is particularly so for hard to abate sectors such as heavy-duty vehicles, where alternative transport energy and technology are at early and varying stages of development. However,  concerns exist regarding the source, production, traceability and sustainability of the feedstocks for biofuels. The Department of Transport is currently carrying out a study on the sustainability and availability of bio- and renewable fuels supply and demand in transport. This study will help to inform the development of the Renewable Fuels for Transport Policy over the coming years, with due regard to the ambitious domestic targets for renewable fuels in the Climate Action Plan and proposed future European obligations for renewable fuels.<\/p><p>The Climate Action Plan states that Government will <i>&ldquo;Carry out a review of the supply of renewable transport fuels in Ireland, such as biofuels, advanced biofuels, e-fuels, synthetic fuels, green hydrogen, and biogas.&rdquo;<\/i>As a key step to deliver this action, the Department of Transport is progressing a study reviewing the profile, sustainability, and supply of renewable transport fuels in Ireland, such as biofuels, advanced biofuels, e-fuels, synthetic fuels, biogas, and green hydrogen. This work is being carried out under DECC&rsquo;s Climate Action Modelling Group (CAMG) with additional input from NORA and will be delivered this year.<\/p><p>The Policy proposes measures to achieve higher rates of biofuel blending in transport fuel supply annually to achieve the Climate Action Plan target of 10% bioethanol in petrol and 20% biodiesel in diesel by 2030. The policy statement sets out that, to achieve this Climate Action Plan 2021 target for biofuel blending, indicative increases of a further 3% increase in the obligation will be put in place in 2024 and 4% in 2025. Further consideration of the indicative trajectory from 2025 to 2030 will give due regard to domestic obligations and the European Union&rsquo;s Fit for 55 package of climate measures.<\/p><p>In addition, the Renewable Fuel for Transport Policy aims to further incentivise the supply of advanced renewable fuels such as biomethane and green hydrogen. Further, as part of the suite of policy measures set out in the Renewable Fuels for Transport Policy Statement, from 2023 and subject to legislation, an advanced biofuel obligation will be put in place as part of the overall renewable fuels for transport obligation. <\/p><p>This will require obligated parties to place a proportion of advanced biofuels that are produced from waste materials specified by the European Commission within the recast Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) on the market as part of their overall blending obligation. From 2023, the advanced biofuel obligation rate will be an indicative of 0.3% by energy and the indicative trajectory of increase for the advanced biofuel obligation will increase out to 2030.

However, I am very aware of the serious challenges that the RSA and the NCTS are currently facing to meet demand and the frustrating delays which vehicle owners have encountered since the start of this year. I would like to thank Deputy Richmond and our other colleagues for raising this important matter.  <\/p>  <p>  Since January of this year, the NCTS has reported a severe testing backlog and a higher-than-usual rate of test cancellations. The average lead time for an appointment has almost doubled from a pre-pandemic average of 12 days to just over 23 days. I understand that this has been caused by a number of factors. Notably, the service experienced extremely high demand for test appointments in the first months of the year, in conjunction with the continuing impact of Covid-19 on staff and customers and long-term challenges to recruit suitably qualified staff.<\/p>  <p>  The RSA is overseeing the NCTS response to address the backlog.

The RSA has indicated that 99% of customers are given a test date within 28 days.<\/p>  <p>  My department has additionally been informed that the NCTS has taken a number of steps in the immediate term to provide additional capacity at test centres, including staff overtime and longer shift schedules. However, in the longer-term, the recruitment of suitably qualified vehicle inspection staff (QQI Level 6) remains challenging. As I understand it, the RSA has agreed that NCTS may pilot the use of additional personnel at QQI Level 5 for a 12-month period to assist with automated elements of the test process in order to increase overall capacity. There are 15 vehicle Inspectors to commence training this month, with further intakes of staff planned from August onwards.<\/p>  <p>  A decrease in the current high NCT waiting times will depend on recruitment and the net increase in staffing towards a target of 620 additional personnel.

Our public transport operators are central to this goal, leading by example and demonstrating that change is possible and positive. <\/p>  <p>  As the largest public transport company in the state, Dublin Bus is acutely aware of their responsibility to embed sustainable practices in every aspect of their business from their buses to the travel patterns of their own employees. The company currently has 24 charging points across five locations as well as a policy that, where suitable, electric vehicles are to be used for pooled cars\/vans. Dublin Bus are also committed to a replacement programme to transition their existing pooled diesel cars to zero emission alternatives where available. In line with their commitment to reduce the number of car journeys by the company in Dublin, including those made by their employees, the company has just launched a dedicated employee e-bike scheme.\u00a0The new initiative, a pilot project to run for 12 months, is designed to provide employees with a more sustainable way to travel between the companies&rsquo; various locations.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly, GoAhead takes sustainability very seriously.

And while I recognise the importance of incentivising greater use of our public transport services, I am not convinced that providing free public transport is the most balanced means of achieving this objective. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, funding for the provision of public transport services is made up of both the fares paid by passengers and the subvention payments from the Exchequer.  The main purpose of the subvention payment is to meet the gap between income from fares and the cost of operating services.<\/p>  <p>  COVID gave us some insight into the level of funding that might be required in the absence of fare revenue. For example, in 2020, an additional &euro;370 million was required to enable the continued operation of public transport services due to the collapse of fare intake. In 2021, &euro;659m was required to run PSO services, and this year we have allocated &euro;538 million for the continuation of these essential services. Apportioning such significant levels of Exchequer resources to one goal undoubtedly impacts the State&rsquo;s ability to support other worthy public services. <\/p>  <p>  While free or significantly subsidised public transport is available in some European locations, I understand that results have varied or have yet to be seen as per the German initiative referenced in the Deputy's question. The intention is always commendable - encouraging modal shift, reducing congestion, and capitalising on the associated environmental benefits. However, such schemes can have unintended consequences, for example encouraging people away from active travel modes. This is counter to our core Government goals of improving citizen&rsquo;s health and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. <\/p>  <p>  While I might not agree that free transport provides the answer - I do believe there is merit in incentivising fares when an appropriate balance can be struck. In view of the importance of incentivising young people to use public transport, I was delighted to introduce the Young Adult Card in May which will allow any person nationwide who is between 19 and 23 years old, to avail of an average of discount of 50% on public transport fares. In addition, a 20% average PSO fare reduction was introduced as part of a suite of Government measures to help combat the rising cost of living. <\/p>  <p>  In summary, funding our public transport services represents a significant expenditure of taxpayers' money, and funding levels have increased in recent years to cater for additional services and growing capacity.  Any assessment of a proposed change to public transport fare structures would need to be considered carefully and in full awareness of their potential impact on finite Exchequer resources. I will of course stay informed on how alternative incentives, like the German &euro;9 ticket, develop.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400062#WRB04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":50,"content":"<p>Question No. 81 answered with Question No. 72.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bus Services","counter":51,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400063#WRC00300"},{"type":"question","counter":52,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[29647\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400063#WRC00400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the status of the BusConnects plan for Cork.

This has caused a spike in the price of crude and in the price of refined products on the retail market.<\/p>  <p>  On 15 March 2022, Minister Ryan and I proposed to Government an emergency support measure &ndash; the Licensed Haulage Emergency Support Scheme. The Scheme provided support of &euro;100 per week, for eight weeks, for each eligible heavy goods vehicle (HGV) authorised on the licence of a road haulage operator as of 11 March 2022. <\/p>  <p>  In deciding on a targeted scheme, the Government considered that the licensed haulage sector is a specific case for several reasons, primarily that the sector is of national strategic importance as a critical enabler of a functioning supply chain, bringing essential supplies into and around the State, supporting key infrastructure and enabling the maintenance of economic and social activity. While this is true for some own account operators also, in addition fuel represents a greater overall proportion of overhead costs for licensed hauliers than would be the case for other businesses who self-provide transport as part of their wider business.<\/p>  <p>  The Scheme was administered by the Department of Transport. On 19 May 2022, Minister Ryan and I announced the extension of the closing date for receipt of completed applications to close of business 6 June 2022. Over &euro;15 million has been paid out under the Scheme to 2,923 licensed operators.

It should be noted however that support under the Scheme was increased in Budget 2020. In light of the challenges arising from Brexit uncertainty facing the industry, the marginal rate of compensation at prices over &euro;1.43 (VAT inclusive) was doubled up to the maximum repayment rate of 7.5 cent per litre and in recognition of the vital role that the haulage sector plays in the economy, this increase in the DRS has been maintained since.<\/p>  <p>  More generally, the Government has acted to offset the rising cost of fuel through a reduction in Excise on fuels - a reduction of 20 cent on petrol and 15 cent on diesel fuel. While this measure (announced in early March 2022) was originally proposed to last until 31 August 2022 the Government has extended it out to Budget Day 2022. This measure provides assistance to all citizens and businesses to help mitigate the impact of recent fuel price increases.<\/p>  <p>  In general, however, it should be noted that the causes of the current fuel price pressures are not within the control of Government and are being directly influenced by external factors, including the Ukraine crisis. Unfortunately, we must accept that it will not be possible to fully insulate citizens and businesses from the impact of these fuel price increases. <\/p>  <p>  Since early March with the benefit of the excise reduction, 8 weeks support under the Licensed Haulage Support Scheme and the ongoing Diesel Rebate relief, haulage businesses will have had the opportunity to revise and renegotiate contracts with their clients in order to reflect increased prices, as is an unfortunate reality in all sectors across the economy.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has limited resources but through the Excise measure, as well as the Licensed Haulage Emergency Support Scheme, it has responded to help to ease the impact of these price increases. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400063#WRC01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Transport Policy","counter":61,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400063#WRC01300"},{"type":"question","counter":62,"qnumday":85,"qnumall":"[25018\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400063#WRC01400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will consider establishing an innovation hub for sustainable aviation in Shannon, County Clare.

However, there are a number of considerations relevant to the possibility of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) innovation in the Shannon region, namely its geographic location, close to a potential resource of offshore wind energy, and the existing infrastructure at Shannon Foynes Port. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of policy, the question of SAF development is a very current one.  Recently at the European Transport Council a General Approach was agreed among Member States, with support from Ireland, on how to proceed on the ReFuelEU Aviation proposal.  This will mandate the use of increasing levels of blended SAF between 2025 and 2050, including the introduction of a synthetic aviation fuel sub-mandate in 2030. A clear signal is being sent to industry that the market will be there when they begin to produce these fuels.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Environment, Climate and Communications will be preparing a national Hydrogen Strategy this year, which should help inform developments in this area.  Harnessing wind energy to generate hydrogen by electrolyser technology could potentially provide feedstock for a range of sustainable fuel uses including aviation.   <\/p>  <p>  Government has recently established the Shannon Estuary Economic Task Force, under the auspices of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (DETE).  The Taskforce will consider the strategic strengths and comparative advantages of the Shannon Estuary in the areas of transport and logistics, manufacturing, tourism, and renewable energy. Members of the Task Force include, amongst others, Shannon Group, ESB Generation and Trading, and Shannon Foynes Port. I understand that Wind, Hydro and Solar energy are some of the areas set to be examined, with the group aiming to produce an initial report by November of this year which I look forward to reviewing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400063#WRC01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":64,"content":"<p>Question No. 86 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rail Network","counter":65,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400063#WRC01700"},{"type":"question","counter":66,"qnumday":87,"qnumall":"[30328\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400063#WRC01800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the improvements that have been made to the frequency of rail services on non-radial routes out of Dublin in the two years since he took up office as Minister of Transport; the destinations that are served by these lines; the frequency of service on each of the lines; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

It was adopted in recognition of the need to strike a balance between achieving standards that offer the customer confidence, comfort and safety, and allowing industry members to operate successfully, cognisant of the fact\u00a0that the replacement of a vehicle is a SPSV operator's single largest cost.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Taking account of all these factors, there is no consideration being given to amending these age-related rules now, or again in the future.<\/p>  <p>  At the same time, there continue to be supports available to drivers who wish to change their vehicles.<\/p>  <p>  As part of my commitment to supporting the transition of the SPSV fleet towards zero\/low-emission vehicles and the &lsquo;greening &lsquo; of the SPSV sector, I put in place the electric small public service vehicle (eSPSV) grant scheme.\u00a0The Scheme is funded by my Department and administered by the NTA. \u00a0The SPSV industry is regarded as a champion in the normalisation of electric vehicle use, and &euro;15m was allocated in 2022 to support the industry to switch to electric.\u00a0 The Scheme is kept under continuous review and is currently paused to allow for the drawdown and payment of provisional grant offers.\u00a0When these grant offers are drawn down, there will be a clearer picture of the funding available for the second half of the year. At this stage, I anticipate that the Scheme will re-open for applications during the summer, allowing SPSV operators to once again apply for the supports on offer.<\/p>  <p>  At the same time, Microfinance Ireland is still providing the so-called eSPSV Business Loan, which is available to support SPSV owners that are unable to secure finance from banks and asset finance providers and are availing of the eSPSV Grant Scheme to replace their vehicle with a more sustainable model (electric\/hybrid). \u00a0These loans range from &euro;5,000 to &euro;25,000, with a fixed interest rate of 4.5% if submitted through a Local Enterprise Office, and with no additional fees or charges.<\/p>  <p>  The availability of electric vehicles is unpredictable because of the ongoing difficulties with global vehicle production. The reasons for the vehicle supply shortages are varied, but it is largely centred on the effects of the pandemic. All vehicle production was shut down in the early stages of the pandemic, and an ongoing worldwide microprocessor shortage in the automotive sector is contributing to further delays in restoring vehicle production back to pre-pandemic levels. It has been reported that the shortage of microprocessors is unlikely to end soon, and automotive industry leaders have advised the issue will continue through 2022 and possibly even 2023. Since microprocessors are required for all vehicle production, so the shortage will equally affect the supply of petrol\/diesel powered vehicles, and electric vehicles.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the deputy will be aware of the NTA&rsquo;s recent proposal to introduce an average increase of 12% on taxi fares from 31st August 2022 as a result of the National Maximum Fares Review, which closed for public consultation on May 27th last.\u00a0 This would be the first increase on such fares since 2017. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The approach taken by the NTA has been to weight the proposed increase in favour of the periods in which the premium hour rate may be charged by drivers, i.e. between 8pm and 8am or on Sundays \/ public holidays. \u00a0As already mentioned, there has been a large upswing in demand for taxi services, particularly for servicing the night-time economy and, while drivers are obviously free to choose their own hours of operation, the proposal to increase taxi fares, with a weighting towards the premium rate periods, is designed to encourage more taxi drivers to operate during those times, thus increasing their income, as well as the availability of taxis to passengers nationally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400063#WRC02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":77,"content":"<p>Question No. 91 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Transport","counter":78,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400063#WRC03000"},{"type":"question","counter":79,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[30614\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400063#WRC03100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the status of the Connecting Ireland Rural Mobility Plan; when he expects the consultation analysis process to be finalised and a report issued; if he will provide an overview on the intended roll-out of improved services on a phased basis up to 2025; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Work has continued on finalising the two schemes and planning permission for the Cross City Link is expected to be sought this year.

As ORE will develop in phases on the east, south, south west and west coast, a multiple of ports will be required to provide facilities for the different activities at several locations around the country and at different times for the various phases of the fixed and floating ORE developments.<\/p>  <p>  This will help maximise the economic benefits at regional as well as national level in terms of the creation of jobs and new SME enterprise that can support the development of the ORE industry. A multiport approach will ultimately allow investments that are commercially viable in the long-term progress without undermining the ability of any port to meet its primary obligations in relation to the facilitation of international trade.<\/p>  <p>  While Irish Ports receive no exchequer funding, EU funding of port infrastructure for ORE is now available for ports, or terminals within ports, on the Trans European Network for Transport (TEN-T).

This year more than &euro;2 billion worth of measures have been put in place.  Of these measures, many were targeted at the rising costs of transport:<\/p>  <p>  - a cut of 20c for every litre of petrol and 15c for every litre of auto diesel, and a proportionate 2c reduction for excise on green diesel;<\/p>  <p>  - the temporary enhancement to the Diesel Rebate Scheme, which was provided in Budget 2020, has been maintained;<\/p>  <p>  - cutting public transport fares by 20% from the end of April;<\/p>  <p>  - the introduction of the Licensed Haulage Emergency Support Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of the latter two measures, which fall under my remit, the Government approved a 20% fare-reduction initiative on Public Service Obligation (PSO) public transport services, at a cost of &euro;54m.  A Young Adult Card was introduced on both PSO and commercial services in Budget 2022. This measure allows any person nationwide who is between 19 and 23 years old, to avail of an entitlement for discounted travel costs, and to increase the level of discount over and above the current student discount to an average discount of 50% across all services, including city, intercity and rural services. Over 1000 applications received by the National Transport Authority (NTA) on launch day alone. The initiative will be broadened to include commercial operators later this year, with the aim to have it in place before the recommencement of third level colleges.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Licensed Haulage Emergency Support Scheme, this measure provided &euro;100 per week, for eight weeks, for each eligible heavy goods vehicle authorised on the licence of a road haulage operator as of 11 March 2022. On 19 May 2022, the closing date for receipt of completed applications was extended to 6 June 2022. Over &euro;15 million has been paid out under the Scheme to 2,923 licensed operators. Further eligible applications received will be processed over the coming days and final payments will be made shortly.  The Scheme is now closed.  There is ongoing engagement with the haulier industry in terms of their needs.<\/p>  <p>  The Diesel Rebate Scheme offers a partial excise refund to qualifying operators. In Budget 2020, in light of the challenges arising from Brexit uncertainty facing the industry, the marginal rate of compensation at prices over &euro;1.42 (VAT inclusive) was doubled up to the maximum repayment rate of 7.5 cents per litre. In recognition of the vital role that the haulage sector plays in the economy, this increase has been maintained since.<\/p>  <p>  More generally, the Government has acted to offset the rising cost of fuel through a reduction in Excise on fuels - a reduction of 20 cent on petrol and 15 cent on diesel fuel. While this measure (announced in early March 2022) was originally proposed to last until 31 August 2022, the Government has extended it out to Budget Day 2022. This measure provides assistance to all citizens and businesses to help mitigate the impact of recent fuel price increases.<\/p>  <p>  Since early March, with the benefit of the excise reduction, the 8 weeks support under the Licensed Haulage Support Scheme and the ongoing Diesel Rebate relief, haulage businesses will have had the opportunity to revise and renegotiate contracts with their clients in order to reflect increased prices, as is an unfortunate reality in all sectors across the economy.<\/p>  <p>  While it will not be possible to fully insulate citizens and businesses from the impact of these fuel price increases, I will continue to monitor actively this evolving situation very closely, and consider such further steps as may be necessary in conjunction with my Government colleagues and in consultation with the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400064#WRD02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Transport","counter":130,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400064#WRD02700"},{"type":"question","counter":131,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[30743\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400064#WRD02800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he has examined expanding late night public transport services in urban areas to provide additional transport options at night; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1507","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":132,"content":"<p>The Minister for Transport has responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport; however, he is not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport.

During the same period, however, the number of drivers licensed to operate (stand\/ply for hire) in Dublin rose by 381 from a total of 14,572 as at 31 December 2021 to a total of 14,953 at end May 2022. <\/p><p>In terms of licensed vehicles, the total number and breakdown by type of SPSV vehicles licensed in Dublin to end May 2022 has also shown a small increase (of 32) since the beginning of the year as follows:  <table>    <tr>       <th>County  <\/th>       <th>Hackney  <\/th>       <th>Limousine <\/th>       <th>Local Area Hackney <\/th>       <th>Taxi <\/th>       <th>Wheelchair Accessible Hackney <\/th>       <th>Wheelchair Accessible Taxi <\/th>       <th>Total <\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin (30 May 2022) <\/td>       <td>16 <\/td>       <td>430 <\/td>       <td>0 <\/td>       <td>7,833 <\/td>       <td>2 <\/td>       <td>1,806 <\/td>       <td>10,087 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin (31 December 2021) <\/td>       <td>17 <\/td>       <td>417 <\/td>       <td>0 <\/td>       <td>7,838 <\/td>       <td>2 <\/td>       <td>1,781 <\/td>       <td>10,055 <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>The Government and the NTA have taken a number of steps to support taxi drivers nationally. Most recently, the NTA proposes an average increase of 12% on taxi fares from 31st August 2022 in the National Maximum Fares Review, which closed for public consultation on May 27th last and which will be the first increase on such fares since 2017.<\/p><p>Whilst the NTA has statutory responsibility for regulating (licensing and enforcement) the SPSV industry, taxi drivers are self-employed individuals and, as such, decide on their own business strategies within the regulatory framework.  Additionally, SPSV operators choose the times at which they operate.<\/p><p>In this regard, the 2022 driver survey, conducted by the NTA earlier this year, shows that 93% of drivers are now working but only 29% currently work the premium rate period, which covers journeys taken between 8pm and 8am or on Sundays and public holidays. 30% of drivers (up from 17% in 2019) reported that they would consider working these hours if fares were to increase for this &ldquo;night work&rdquo;.In recognition of this, the NTA&rsquo;s increased fare proposals have been weighted in favour of the premium rate period. The increase in cents\/euro for each taxi user per journey is not substantial; however, the cumulative impact of the increase is significant for drivers, and it is hoped that this may encourage more taxi drivers to operate during these periods, and particularly at night-time, to meet the renewed levels of demand that have arisen because of the increase in social activity and the reactivation of the night-time economy.<\/p><p>In addition, the Deputy will be aware that my Department and the NTA previously introduced a number of supports during the Covid-19 pandemic to reduce the costs for licenced SPSVs to continue in the industry during this very difficult period. These included several extensions of the maximum vehicle age on an emergency basis, and a temporary licence fee waiver. The NTA also introduced a regulatory measure to allow licence holders to be inactive for 24 months (previously 12 months) to allow them to remain attached to the industry with no associated costs during this very uncertain period. It is hoped that a significant proportion of these licencees will return now that demand for services is increasing.<\/p><p>The SPSV motor tax refund scheme was introduced as an additional financial support to assist the SPSV industry in its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. I announced this support on 9 June 2021 and an allocation of &euro;2m in funding was provided.  The Scheme commenced on 1 September 2021 ensuring that SPSV licence holders could receive a reimbursement of &euro;95 for their SPSV Motor Tax. The Scheme will end on 31 August 2022.<\/p><p>The NTA also introduced the NCT Initial Test Fee Waiver Scheme for the SPSV sector on September 1st 2021, with funding of &euro;1.5m from my Department.  As a result, SPSVs presenting for the NCT received, and continue to receive, this test for free.  This Scheme also ends on 31 August 2022.<\/p><p>I remain committed to supporting the transition of the SPSV fleet towards zero\/low-emission vehicles. The SPSV industry is regarded as a champion in the normalisation of electric vehicle use.  The Scheme is funded by my Department and administered by the NTA. &euro;15m was allocated in 2022 to support the industry to switch to electric. A grant of up to &euro;10,000 to support the purchase of a BEV in the taxi\/hackney\/limousine sector, with an additional &euro;2,500 available for those choosing to make their vehicle wheelchair accessible, is available under the Scheme. Those scrapping older, more polluting, or high mileage vehicles are now eligible for double the normal grant if they make the switch to electric. The Scheme is kept under continuous review and is currently paused to allow for the drawdown and payment of provisional grant offers. When these grant offers have been drawn down, there will be a clearer picture of the funding available for the second half of the year and, at this stage, I anticipate the scheme will reopen for applications in the summer, allowing SPSV operators to again apply for the supports on offer. <\/p><p>At the same time, Microfinance Ireland is still providing the so-called eSPSV Business Loan, which is available to support small business owners with a Small Public Service Vehicle (SPSV) that are unable to secure finance from banks and asset finance providers and are availing of the government&rsquo;s eSPSV Grant Scheme to replace their vehicle with a more sustainable model (electric\/hybrid).  These loans range from &euro;5,000 to &euro;25,000, with a fixed interest rate of 4.5% if submitted through a Local Enterprise Office, and with no additional fees or charges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400065#WRE02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Transport Policy","counter":181,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400065#WRE02200"},{"type":"question","counter":182,"qnumday":129,"qnumall":"[30698\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400065#WRE02300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his plans to introduce a car kilometre reduction target for all car kilometres, both for internal combustion engine and electric vehicles in order for the transport system to be decarbonised at a pace that meets the statutory emissions targets; and if he will make a statement on the matter. ","asker":"1594","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":183,"content":"<p>The <i>Climate Action Plan (CAP) 2021<\/i>makes clear the need to reduce fossil-fueled passenger vehicle kilometres by at least 10%, to support a 51% emissions reduction for the transport sector, by 2030.  This 10% target is also included in my Department's recently published <i>Sustainable Mobility Policy (SMP)<\/i>, which aims to reduce demand for private car journeys in general by making it easier for people to travel via more sustainable modes &ndash; be that walking, cycling or public transport.  In tandem with other suitable demand management measures and the electrification of the national passenger fleet, this shift to more sustainable modes will help to deliver on the 10% km reduction target.<\/p><p>With regard to reduction targets for kilometres driven by electric vehicles (EVs), such targets would not be impactful in terms of decarbonizing the transport sector, given that EVs have zero tailpipe emissions. Rather, incentives aimed at encouraging people to replace their fossil-fueled cars with EVs will help to increase the rate of EV penetration and commensurately reduce the level of emissions in the sector.<\/p><p>However, as the deputy will also be aware, there are a number of benefits which can be associated with reducing private car ownership and use, regardless of their fuel type, and particularly in urban areas.  These include enhanced livability for residents; increased permeability of the urban space; noise and pollution reduction; reduced traffic congestion; increased road safety; an environment more amenable to active travel choices; and a higher degree of equity among transport users across all modes.<\/p><p>With that in mind, my Department is undertaking work across several areas aimed at reducing the demand for private car journeys overall.  In December 2021, it published the <i>Five Cities Demand Management Study<\/i>, which aimed to identify transport demand drivers in Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway, and to assess the impact and suitability of an array of different demand management measures for each city.  The study focused on addressing decarbonization, air quality, congestion and improving the overall urban environment.  A key conclusion of this study is that there is no single solution to tackling the transport demand challenges facing our urban environments.  Rather, utilizing an integrated Travel Demand Management approach to policy development, planning and delivery of our land use and transport systems will be fundamental to addressing these challenges in the coming years.<\/p><p>In line with our Climate Action Plan commitments, my Department, the NTA, the Regional Assemblies and other bodies are continuing to engage to identify a pathway for the implementation of suitable demand management measures at national and local level, and to advancing these measures by 2025. <\/p><p>Coupled with the work being carried out under the Sustainable Mobility Policy, these efforts will serve to reduce the number of kilometres driven by passenger cars - firstly by causing people to consider an alternative form of transport, and secondly by making it easier for them to choose more sustainable options such as walking, cycling, or public transport. <\/p><p>Finally, the preparation of <i>Climate Action Plan 2023<\/i>will commence shortly and will require engagement among all departments and agencies up to September 2022, before the Climate Action Plan is submitted to Government for approval in November 2022.  It is therefore too early to preempt any changes to targets for the Climate Action Plan 2023, which may otherwise be determined following these engagements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400065#WRE02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":184,"content":"<p>Question No. 130 answered with Question No. 105.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of An Taoiseach","counter":186,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400065#WRE02700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wage Data","counter":185,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400065#WRE02600"},{"type":"question","counter":186,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[30795\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400065#WRE02700","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the gross median wage for each of the years 2012 to 2021 and to date in 2022.

From the start of January to the end of December 2021, some 27,666 applications were received, representing a 69% increase over the same period in 2020 (16,293) and a 47% increase on 2019 (18,811), which itself represented an 11 year high in applications.  16,275 employment permits were issued in 2021, and a total of 17,968 applications processed, which represents a significant volume of activity. <\/p>  <p>  The increased demand was also driven by the extension of categories of employment permits following the Review of the Occupational Lists in October 2021.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department and I recognise the impact delays in the processing times for employment permits has for businesses and their workers.  An internal plan of action has been implemented which has increased resources and implemented more efficient methods of processing applications in the permits system. The processing team has trebled in size and daily output has more than tripled compared to 2021 levels.<\/p>  <p>  Since the implementation of this plan, the Employment Permits Unit has made positive progress by reducing the number of applications awaiting processing from about 11,000 in January 2022 to c. 6,000 today, despite further strong growth in demand in 2022.  As new staff were trained on Critical Skills and Intra Corporate Transfer Employment Permits, processing times for those permits have fallen from 21 weeks to 5 weeks.  The Department aims to maintain processing times for these permit types at under 6 weeks for all of Q2.  <\/p>  <p>  The Employment Permits Unit has recently completed processing 3,000 additional General Employment Permits applications made available to the meat and horticultural sectors, following the last review of the Occupational Lists, in addition to normal processing workload. <\/p>  <p>  Within the last month processing times for General Employment Permit applications for Trusted Partners fell from 22 weeks to 14 weeks, while applications from Standard applicants fell from 22 weeks to 17 weeks.  These should continue to fall, with processing times considerably reduced by the end of Quarter 2.  <\/p>  <p>  The administration and processing of immigration permissions, including visas, is a separate system with a different legislative framework encompassing rules and requirements to the employment permits regime and is the policy responsibility of the Department of Justice.  <\/p>  <p>  My officials liaise regularly with their Department of Justice colleagues to deliver changes to improve the efficiency of both systems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400067#WRG01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1505"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Company Law","counter":284,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400067#WRG01400"},{"type":"question","counter":285,"qnumday":165,"qnumall":"[29006\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400067#WRG01500","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if the position in relation to section 357 of the Companies Act of 2014 will be clarified, specifically in relation to the exemption which allows each subsidiary to submit the financial statements of the parent company instead of its own as in the case of a company (details supplied).

The regime is managed through the operation of the occupation lists: the critical skills list in respect of skills that are in critical shortage in the labour market and the ineligible occupations lists for which a ready source of labour is available from within Ireland and the EEA.<\/p>  <p>  The lists are subject to regular, evidenced-based review to ensure their ongoing relevance to the State&rsquo;s human capital requirements, guided by available research undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), and the Skills and the Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU) in SOLAS.

The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland offers the Brexit Impact Loan Scheme, offering loans from &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5m, and the Credit Guarantee Scheme for businesses responding to the impact of COVID-19. These loan facilities may also be helpful to businesses struggling with increased energy costs. <\/p><p>Microenterprises can also avail of loans of up to &euro;25k from Microfinance Ireland which they may not be able to avail of from commercial lenders.<\/p><p>Additionally, the Lean for Micro scheme works with LEO clients to help build resilience.<\/p><p>Government Departments have been consulting with stakeholders on specific measures that could be considered to ameliorate the short to medium term challenges to energy security. The Energy Supply Emergency Group is an inter-departmental and inter-agency group with responsibility for informing the Government response to the impact of rising energy costs on business, in addition to security of energy supply more generally, and a longer-term reduction in Ireland&rsquo;s dependency on imported oil and gas.<\/p><p>Under the aegis of this Group, my Department has established the Business Energy Users Sub-Group to lead on consultations with business and industry to learn about the specific impacts on Irish businesses, and to hear their concerns and perspectives on the appropriate and most effective tools for policy action. The work of this sub-group, as part of the wider Energy Supply Emergency Group has informed the National Energy Security Framework which was launched by the Government on 13th April 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400067#WRG05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1505"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Measures","counter":324,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400067#WRG05400"},{"type":"question","counter":325,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[29743\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400067#WRG05500","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the status of the Industrial Relations (Provisions in Respect of Pension Entitlements of Retired Workers) Bill 2021; if he intends to support the referral of the Bill to Committee Stage in advance of the anniversary of the Second Stage reading of the Bill on 30 June 2022; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Act commits Ireland to achieve a climate neutral economy by no later than 2050, and provides for a 51% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 2018 levels. The significantly strengthened legally binding framework under the Act also ensures delivery of successive Climate Action Plans, as well as National Long-term Climate Action Strategies, and National Adaptation Frameworks,To deliver on the ambition set out in the Act, the Government published the Climate Action Plan 2021 last November. The 2021 Plan identifies the actions necessary to achieve our emissions reductions targets for each sector of the economy, based on their respective starting points, and the relative challenges and benefits, of reducing emissions. In the coming months my Department will engage proactively with the public, key stakeholders, and other Government Departments to prepare this year&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan, which I expect to publish before the end of the year.

I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport, nor decisions on fares. <\/p>  <p>  It is the National Transport Authority (NTA) that has the statutory responsibility for the regulation of fares in relation to public passenger transport services and also has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public transport services by way of public transport services contracts in respect of services that are socially necessary but commercially unviable.  The funding of those services comprises both the fares paid by passengers and the subvention payments from the Exchequer.  The main purpose of the subvention payment is to meet the gap between income from fares and the cost of operating services.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of public transport services is heavily dependent on passenger fare revenue as it normally contributes about 65% of the operational cost.  The remaining 35% of cost is covered by the PSO grant and the Department of Social Protection grant under the free travel scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  Prior to COVID-19, &euro;287 million of Exchequer funding was provided for PSO services in Budget 2020; however, since 2020, additional funding has been required to continue to address the significant COVID impacts on public transport provision.<\/p>  <p>  In 2022, I secured &euro;538m to support PSO services including over &euro;200m to address COVID expenses (i.e. loss of fare revenue, cleaning costs). Up to &euro;12m will be provided as ongoing support for the licensed bus sector; while, over &euro;15m has also been allocated to support Local Link regular service provision in rural Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  In view of the importance of incentivising young people to use public transport, as part of Budget 2022 I secured &euro;25m of funding to provide for the introduction of a young adult card (YAC) which will allow any person nationwide who is between 19 and 23 years old, to avail of an entitlement for discounted travel costs, and to increase the level of discount over and above the current student discount to an average of discount of 50% across all services, including city, intercity and rural services. <\/p>  <p>  The YAC was launched on PSO services on the 9th of May, with over 1000 applications received by the NTA on launch day alone. The initiative will be broadened to include commercial operators later this year, with the aim to have it in place before the recommencement of third level colleges.  This will not only promote modal shift in the transport sector among this age group but should also contribute towards a reduced reliance on private transport with associated benefit of transport emission savings. <\/p>  <p>In addition, as the Deputy will be aware a 20% average reduction is being introduced on PSO services as part of a suite of Government measures to help combat the rising cost of living. This fare reduction was applied to all services outside the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) from the 11th of April and nationwide from the 9th of May. The fare reduction will be in place until the end of the year and &euro;54m in Exchequer funding has been secured to allow for the introduction of these discounted fares, this is in addition to the REV22 allocations. <\/p>  <p>  The PSO programme represents a significant expenditure of taxpayers' money, and funding has increased in recent years to cater for additional services and growing capacity.  Any assessment of a proposed change to public transport fare structures would be a matter for the NTA to consider in the first instance.  Therefore, I have forwarded the Deputy's specific question in relation to a feasibility study for free public transport in Ireland, to the NTA for direct reply.

The National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally, including night-time bus services.<\/p><p>In addition, the regulation of the small public service vehicle (SPSV) sector is a matter for the National Transport Authority (NTA) under the provisions of the<i>Taxi Regulation Act 2013. <\/i><\/p><p>The Government and the NTA have recently taken a number of steps to support taxi drivers who are already in the industry. <\/p><p>The draft Maximum Fares Order 2022, which was open for public consultation until May 27th, included a proposed average increase in taxi fares of 12.5%.  By facilitating this increase in maximum fares, the NTA is addressing the pressures that the taxi industry clearly faces, particularly the rising cost of fuel. This is designed in such a way as to provide a larger increase for premium hours (20.00 to 08.00, Sundays and Bank Holidays) and shorter journeys. This is the period, particularly on Friday and Saturday nights, when there are the most complaints about the unavailability of taxis. It is hoped that increasing taxi fares, particularly the premium fare, will encourage more taxi drivers to operate during that time, as well as making the sector more attractive to new entrants, thus increasing availability to passengers nationally.<\/p><p>The 2022 driver survey, undertaken by the NTA, shows that 93% of drivers are now working but only 29% currently work this period. 30% of drivers (up from 17% in 2019) reported that they would consider working these hours if fares were to increase for this &ldquo;night work&rdquo;.In recognition of this, the proposed fare has been weighted in favour of the Premium Rate period.  The increase in cents\/euro for each taxi user per journey is not substantial; however, the cumulative impact of the increase is significant for drivers and it is hoped that this will encourage more taxi drivers to operate during these periods and also encourage drivers to reactivate their licences.<\/p><p>My Department and the NTA introduced a number of supports during the Covid-19 pandemic to reduce the costs for licenced SPSVs to continue in the industry during this very difficult period. These included an increase in the maximum vehicle age, and licence fees at no cost. The NTA also introduced a regulatory measure to allow licence holders to be inactive for 24 months (previously 12 months) to allow them to remain attached to the industry with no associated costs during this very uncertain period. It is hoped that a significant proportion of these licences will return now that demand for services is increasing.<\/p><p>The SPSV Motor Tax Refund Scheme was introduced as an additional financial support to assist the SPSV industry in its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. and I provided &euro;2m in funding for this Scheme. The Scheme commenced on 1 September 2021 following NTA&rsquo;s extensive efforts to put in place the necessary process to ensure SPSV licence holders could receive a reimbursement of &euro;95 for their SPSV Motor Tax. The Scheme will end on 31 August 2022. <\/p><p>The NTA also introduced the NCT Initial Test Fee Waiver Scheme for the SPSV sector on September 1st 2021, with funding of &euro;1.5m from my Department.  As a result, SPSVs presenting for the NCT received, and continue to receive, this test for free.  This Scheme also ends on 31 August 2022.<\/p><p>My Department has made available funding to the NTA to provide grants for the provision and conversion of vehicles to being wheelchair accessible which is a requirement for new entrants to the SPSV industry.  The uptake of the Wheelchair Accessible Taxi (WAT) grant scheme has been strong, with 3,341 grants allocated for the purchase of a WAT between 2014 and 2021, with associated funding of over &euro;3 million given over that period.<\/p><p>I remain committed to supporting the transition of the SPSV fleet towards zero\/low-emission vehicles. The SPSV industry is regarded as a champion in the normalisation of electric vehicle use.

Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, or HVO, is a form of renewable diesel that can be used as a replacement fuel for fossil diesel. It is a drop-in fuel and, unlike conventional biodiesel, it can be blended at higher rates and is not limited to a 7% blend.<\/p>  <p>  The biofuel obligation has been in place since 2010 and, since that time, increasing volumes of biofuels have been introduced to Ireland&rsquo;s transport fuel supply through a biofuel blending obligation on fuel suppliers. The obligation ensures that a certain percentage (currently 13% by volume) of the motor fuel placed on the market comes from renewable sources, for example bioethanol and biodiesel. In 2020 alone, 239 million litres of biofuels replaced about 209 million litres of fossil fuels, avoiding approximately 520 KtCO2eq. GHG emissions. <\/p>  <p>  Biofuels will remain a core transitional measure for medium-term reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in road transport. This is particularly so for hard to abate sectors such as heavy-duty vehicles, where alternative transport energy and technology are at early and varying stages of development. However,  concerns exist regarding the source, production, traceability and sustainability of the feedstocks for biofuels. My Department is currently carrying out a study on the sustainability and availability of bio- and renewable fuels supply and demand in transport. This study will help to inform the development of the Renewable Fuels for Transport Policy over the coming years, with due regard to the ambitious domestic targets for renewable fuels in the Climate Action Plan and proposed future European obligations for renewable fuels.<\/p>  <p>  I published the Renewable Fuels for Transport Policy Statement in November 2021. The Statement sets out a roadmap for the supply and use of renewable energy in transport to address Ireland&rsquo;s national commitments under the Climate Action Plan 2021 and European obligations under the Renewable Energy Directive. It supports the actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in transport and increase the share of renewable fuels in the national Climate Action Plan 2021 and our international obligations, including the EU Renewable Energy Directive. The Policy proposes measures to achieve higher rates of biofuel blending in transport fuel supply annually to achieve the Climate Action Plan target of 10% bioethanol in petrol and 20% biodiesel in diesel by 2030.<\/p>  <p>   In addition, the Renewable Fuel for Transport Policy aims to will further incentivise the supply of advanced renewable fuels such as biomethane and green hydrogen, and it reiterates the commitment to the highest standards of sustainability of biofuel supply from source. It is Government and EU policy to support the deployment of alternative fuels. This is reflected in the introduction of the Alternatively Fuelled Heavy-Duty Vehicle grant in March 2021, the Budget 2022 announcement of the expansion of the Accelerated Capital Allowance scheme for natural gas propelled vehicles and related equipment to include hydrogen vehicles and equipment, the roll-out of the CNG fuelling network and the provision of policy advice for projects looking at the development of green hydrogen projects. <\/p>  <p>  In this context, the Alternatively Fuels Heavy-Duty Vehicle (AFHDV) Purchase Grant scheme supports the purchase of new large vans, trucks, buses and coaches. The Scheme, which is administered by TII, is intended to help bridge some of the difference in purchase price between conventional heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) and those powered by alternatively-fuelled power-trains that offer environmental benefits over standard diesel vehicle technologies, and that would not otherwise have been bought. <\/p>  <p>  To accord with EU State Aid rules, grant levels under the Scheme are calculated as a percentage of the difference in price between a conventionally-fuelled diesel HDV and its alternatively-fuelled equivalent. Maximum grant levels for eligible vehicles depend on the size of the company or enterprise applying for the grant, and on the fuel-type of the vehicle that the applicant wishes to buy. <\/p>  <p>  &euro;3m was allocated to this scheme in 2021 and given the excellent response to the initiative, a further &euro;3m was allocated this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400072#WRM00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electric Vehicles","counter":691,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400072#WRM00500"},{"type":"question","counter":692,"qnumday":303,"qnumall":"[30323\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400072#WRM00600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he and or the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland will provide a schedule of the registrations of new electric vehicles purchased in Ireland by vehicle type in 2021 and to date in 2022; and the totality of grant aid provided for the purchase of these vehicles.","asker":"1489","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":693,"content":"<p>Electric vehicles (EVs) are the most prominent transport mitigation measure in the 2021 <i>Climate Action Plan<\/i>and Ireland has set an ambitious target of 945,000 EVs on our roads by 2030.

This fare reduction was applied to all services outside the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) from the 11th\u00a0of April and nationwide from the 9th of May. The fare reduction will be in place until the end of the year and &euro;54m in Exchequer funding has been secured to allow for the introduction of these discounted fares, this is in addition to the REV22 allocations.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The PSO programme represents a significant expenditure of taxpayers' money, and funding has increased in recent years to cater for additional services and growing capacity.\u00a0 Any\u00a0assessment of a proposed change to\u00a0public transport fare structures\u00a0would be a matter for the NTA to consider in the first instance.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, I have forwarded the Deputy's specific question in relation to the estimated cost to provide free nationwide public transport to persons in full-time education, to the\u00a0NTA for direct reply. \u00a0Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400074#WRO03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rail Network","counter":853,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400074#WRO03500"},{"type":"question","counter":854,"qnumday":362,"qnumall":"[30990\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400074#WRO03600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the latest estimated cost of completing the restoration of the western rail corridor between Claremorris and Athenry;

This exercise suggested that, based on certain assumptions about numbers of beneficiaries, the measure could cost at least &euro;36.9 million if reintroduced at the same level of support as existed in 2010. However, it also drew attention to the potentially significant deadweight element which would accompany the measure.

A tax deduction for fees paid to professional bodies is available where, for example, there is a statutory requirement for membership of a professional body or where there is a requirement for a practicing certificate or license. A person cannot be refused the right of employment for failure to join a trade union, however, a person can be refused the right of employment as a solicitor, for example, if they fail to hold a practicing certificate.<\/p><p>I am advised by Revenue that there are no current data available from tax returns on the number of taxpayers with union subscriptions or the cost of their individual union subscriptions.

For this reason, the FSPO issues levy invoices on a staggered basis throughout the year, in order to reduce moneys held on deposit at any one time and thereby reduce negative interest charged. The FSPO continues to monitor announcements by credit institutions regarding any changes to negative interest rates and consults with the Office of Government Procurement on its banking services framework to explore suitable alternative options, as appropriate.<\/p><p>For completeness, superannuation contributions pertaining to two Model Schemes operating in the FSPO are being held by the FSPO in a Pension Account, which is included in the sum above, pending a decision by the Department of Finance on the proposed funding arrangements of the FSPO&rsquo;s Staff and FSPO&rsquo;s Ombudsman and Deputy Ombudsman superannuation schemes.  Superannuation contributions relating to the FSPO&rsquo;s Model Pension Schemes are held on deposit, and therefore attract negative interest charges.<\/p><p>**I am advised by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners that the negative interest costs they incurred have risen significantly over the period due to two factors. Firstly, as the number of banks imposing these charges has increased it is no longer possible to minimise the charges by holding larger balances in banks that do not do so.

Ireland is not unique in having a specific regime for securitisations. The importance of securitisation has been recognised by the European Commission through their work on the Capital Markets Union. This is a European Commission initiative to mobilise capital in Europe, a main objective of which is to build a sustainable securitisation regime across the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  Securitisation involves the creation of tradeable securities out of an income stream or projected future income stream generated by financial assets.  Securitisation allows banks to raise capital and to share risk and, by providing a repackaging and resale market for corporate debt, it lowers the cost of debt financing.  Such financing is useful for the productive economy as it can underpin the supply of finance to industries and companies in Ireland, Europe and further afield.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that there is nothing specific in the Section 110 framework that is of particular relevance to Russian investors or originators and such vehicles are a common feature of financial service centres.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to Central Bank regulations, certain section 110 companies may be required to publish a prospectus under Regulation (EU) 2017\/1129 (the &ldquo;Prospectus Regulation&rdquo;), where an issuance of securities fall under its scope. The Prospectus Regulation applies to persons:<\/p>  <p>  -  Seeking admission of securities to trading on an EEA regulated market, including the Irish Stock Exchange plc, trading as Euronext Dublin, or<\/p>  <p>  -  Making an offer of securities to the public within the EEA, albeit not seeking admission to trading on an EEA regulated market.<\/p>  <p>  The Prospectus Regulation harmonises requirements for the drawing up, approval and distribution of the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated market. The objective of the Prospectus Regulation is to ensure investor protection and market efficiency, in accordance with high regulatory standards.  The Central Bank is the Competent Authority in Ireland with responsibility for the scrutiny and approval of prospectus documents under the Prospectus Regulation. The Central Bank scrutinises the prospectus to ensure it meets all of the disclosure requirements set out in the legislation and must approve the prospectus prior to commencement of the listing or offer of the securities to the public. <\/p>  <p>  Separately, Special Purpose Entities (SPEs) that carry out activities listed under Schedule 2 &ndash; a comprehensive list of financial activities of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 - are subject to supervision by the Central Bank for Anti-Money Laundering\/Counter Financing of Terrorism (AML\/CFT) purposes. Such firms are referred to as &ldquo;Schedule 2 firms&rdquo;. Firms obligated to register include those which participate in securities issues and the provision of services relating to such issues. An SPE is required to report to the Central Bank if it is an SPE which predominantly engages in securisations, and if it avails of the tax provisions of section 110.<\/p>  <p>  Schedule 2 firms are subject to the Central Bank&rsquo;s minimum engagement model and are supervised in accordance with this model. During the course of this supervision, where weaknesses in the AML\/CFT frameworks are identified in Schedule 2 firms, the supervisors issue findings that the Schedule 2 firms are required to implement. The Central Bank conducts supervisory activities to ensure that Schedule 2 firms are complying with their statutory obligations. These activities include:<\/p>  <p>  -  Conducting on-site inspections and other supervisory engagements across the financial sector to effectively monitor that there is compliance and effective implementation of the relevant statutory obligations;<\/p>  <p>  -  Ensuring compliance with the requirements under the Criminal Justice Act 2010 to adopt and implement policies and procedures for the assessment and management of risks of money laundering and terrorist financing;<\/p>  <p>  -  Inspection of policies and procedures, and confirmation that senior management (including boards of directors) can demonstrate full awareness of their responsibilities;<\/p>  <p>  Separately, where an SPE is linked to an investment fund resident in Ireland, it is subject to the relevant investment fund regulations and requirements. <\/p>  <p>  I now refer to section 110 company&rsquo;s compliance with EU sanctions. All natural and legal persons in the State are obliged to ensure compliance with EU sanctions. This includes section 110 companies. A breach of financial sanction is a criminal offence. The Central Bank of Ireland, as the competent authority for financial sanctions, is undertaking work in relation to firms with links to Russia. Should the Central Bank identify, or have a suspicion of, a breach of sanctions it will report that to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as the investigative authority.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that it carries out a programme of risk focused compliance interventions on section 110 companies, to monitor the regime and to satisfy itself as to the accuracy or otherwise of tax returns filed by these companies and to ensure they continue to meet all qualifying conditions. In line with its overall tax compliance monitoring programme, Revenue has a multi-faceted approach to tackling non-compliance. Compliance interventions range from non-audit compliance Interventions, such as appraisals, aspect queries, and profile interviews, to audits and investigations. As with all tax compliance interventions, Revenue will take appropriate action, including making assessments and seeking penalties and interest, where evidence of non-compliance is found to exist.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that Revenue has taken appropriate steps to identify section 110 companies subject to or linked to individuals, groups or entities subject to EU sanctions on Russia and Belarus in connection with Ukraine. Revenue has the necessary procedures and processes in place to ensure full adherence with its obligations under EU sanctions rules. <\/p>  <p>  As respects section 110 companies identified as possibly linked to entities\/individuals on the EU sanctions list, there have been 37 compliance interventions and 65 risk appraisals closed in respect of such companies in the last 5 years (none of which were formal audits). One compliance intervention is ongoing in respect of such a company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400076#WRQ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":938,"qnumday":391,"qnumall":"[30017\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400076#WRQ01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":" the total value of assets held by special purpose entities in each of the past five years; the total number of these entities; the number that are connected to Russia; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1496","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":939,"content":"<p>Reviews undertaken by the Central Bank of Ireland have identified just under 2% of the 3,000 Special Purpose Entities (SPEs) in Ireland as having links to Russia.

In general, the EU VAT Directive provides that all goods and services are liable to VAT at the standard rate, currently 23% in Ireland, unless they fall within categories of goods and services specified in the Directive, in respect of which Member States may apply a lower rate or exemption from VAT. <\/p>  <p>  The Directive allows for historic VAT treatment to be maintained under certain conditions and Ireland has retained the application of VAT exemption to the transport of passengers and their accompanying baggage. This means that under Ireland&rsquo;s VAT rules, the supplier of passenger transport services does not register for VAT, does not charge VAT on the supply of their services and, consequently, has no VAT recovery entitlement on their input costs. In accordance with the EU rules, Ireland may continue to apply this existing, historic VAT exemption on the supply of domestic passenger transport but, for as long as the exemption remains, the conditions under which the exemption was granted cannot be changed. In fact, the introduction of a new entitlement to VAT recovery for the passenger transport sector could only be done if Ireland were to decide to end its historic exemption for the sector, and bring passenger transport services into the VAT net;  this would then require suppliers to register for VAT and charge VAT on their passenger fares.<\/p>  <p>  A VAT-registered trader is generally entitled to deduct VAT charged on the purchase or hire of a motor vehicle for use in their business if the vehicle comes within the definitions of Category B or Category C vehicles for the purposes of Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT). If such a vehicle is used exclusively for business purposes, the VAT is deductible in the normal way. Vehicles within VRT Categories B &amp;amp; C, such as vans and lorries are generally deductible for VAT, and these are often referred to as commercial vehicles for VAT purposes. However, buses or minibuses suitable for carrying between 12 and 16 persons (including the driver) are not generally deductible for VAT, although they come within Category C, as they are normally used for the VAT exempt activity of passenger transport.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has also maintained a relieving provision, the Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (Touring Coaches) Order of 2012, which provides for a refund of VAT on the cost of acquiring &ldquo;qualifying vehicles&rdquo; used for the carriage of tourists under contracts for group transport. However, it should be noted that extending the scope of the Order while maintaining VAT exemption for passenger transport would be contrary to the EU VAT Directive. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400076#WRQ03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Coverage","counter":956,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400076#WRQ03400"},{"type":"question","counter":957,"qnumday":398,"qnumall":"[30191\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400076#WRQ03500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the regulations that are in place to ensure that a landlord can get insurance cover on their property when the property is being sublet to a local authority; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1619","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":958,"content":"<p>At the outset it is important to note that neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland can direct the pricing or provision of insurance products, as this is a commercial matter which individual companies assess on a case-by-case basis.

This is a well-established and broadly accepted principle. <\/p>  <p>  Section 19 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997, sets out that tax under Schedule E shall be charged in respect of every public office or employment of profit. Section 112 of the TCA 1997 brings into charge all salaries, fees, wages, perquisites or profits of any kind arising from an office or employment. Therefore, the long-standing position is that all tips, gratuities and service charges arising from an office or employment are chargeable to income tax under Schedule E in accordance with Section 112. <\/p>  <p>  Gratuities from customers for example, service charges in hotels or tips in restaurants, paid to the employer and subsequently paid out to an employee should be included in pay for the income tax week or month in which they are paid out. These tips constitute pay for the purposes of the PAYE system. However, in a situation where an employee receives tips directly from customers, the employer is not obliged to operate PAYE and in that case, the tips and gratuities are fully taxable and should be included by the employee in his or her income tax return. It is important to point out that such tips constitute pay for the purposes of the PAYE system.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is progressing legislation on tips and gratuities and this legislation will prohibit the practice of using tips or gratuities to top up wages. It will also ensure that electronic tips and gratuities, which are much more common these days, have to be divided fairly and equitably among the staff.

Therefore, it is important that motor insurance is affordable, which is why the Government has continued to focus on reducing costs for motorists, as well as other groups, through the <i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform<\/i>. <\/p><p>This whole-of-Government strategy contains several initiatives expected to positively impact motor insurance costs. For example, the new <i>Personal Injuries Guidelines<\/i>have significantly lowered award levels for many common injuries, with the latest data from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) indicating that the overall average award has reduced by 42% compared to 2020. Consistent implementation of the Guidelines should therefore lead to a reduction in the cost of claims, including motor claims, which accounted for 70% of all awards made by the PIAB in 2020. <\/p><p>Another key achievement with respect to motor insurance has been the publication of new Regulations by the Central Bank to ban price walking, following its extensive review. Price walking is where customers are charged higher premiums relative to the expected costs the longer they remain with an insurance provider. I therefore welcome this imminent move, as I believe it will protect motor insurance customers who prefer to stay with their current insurer from being unfairly penalised for doing so, in terms of the premium paid.<\/p><p>According to data from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) for April 2022, motor insurance prices declined by nearly 15% from September 2020, when the Sub-Group on Insurance Reform, which is driving these initiatives, was established. Overall, motor insurance prices are now 40% lower than their peak in July 2016, which I believe indicates that previous reforms under the <i>Cost of Insurance Working Group<\/i>, as well as recent achievements of the Insurance Reform Action Plan, are having a positive effect. This downward trend of motor insurance prices is also validated by data from the National Claims Information Database (NCID), with the latest motor report indicating that the average earned premium per policy peaked at &euro;708 in Q4 2017, and declined by 16% to &euro;595 in Q4 2020. I expect that the next NCID report on private motor insurance, due later this year, will show a continued decrease in insurance prices, as the impact of the various Government reforms in this area continue to bed in and take effect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400076#WRQ06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":984,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400077#WRR00200"},{"type":"question","counter":985,"qnumday":407,"qnumall":"[30458\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400077#WRR00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the tax rules regarding a person who works at sea in international waters for longer than 185 days per year; the tax-free allowances that are available; and if the person is exempt from paying income tax or social insurance contributions to any state (details supplied).","asker":"1547","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":986,"content":"<p>It would appear from the Deputy&rsquo;s Question that the individual concerned is an Irish national who has retired in the State, having worked at sea in international waters for a number of years.

Apportioned tax credits are calculated based on the proportion which the income of the non-resident which is assessable to Irish tax, bears to their total worldwide income. <\/p><p><b><i>Tax treatment of income overseas<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>In general, the state where an international seafarer is liable to tax on income derived from the exercise of an employment on board a ship in international waters will depend on a number of different factors, including, but not restricted to the following:<\/p><p>-  the domestic tax rules in the state of residence of the seafarer;<\/p><p>-  the tax rules applying to the employment income of international seafarers in the state where:<\/p><p>-  the employment is held and from where the employment income is paid<\/p><p>-  the vessel is registered<\/p><p>-  the vessel is managed.<\/p><p>On this basis, it is not possible to confirm that a person who works in international waters for more than 185 days in a year is exempt from paying income tax or social insurance contributions on their income to any state.<\/p><p>In cases where the employment income of the international seafarer is subject to tax under the domestic tax rules of two jurisdictions, the terms of a double taxation agreement (DTA) concluded between these jurisdictions may apply to alleviate double taxation. In such instances, Article 15(3) of the OECD Model Tax Convention provides that two jurisdictions may agree that remuneration which is derived from an employment exercised aboard a ship operated in international traffic is taxable in the country in which the place of effective management of the operator of the ship is located. <\/p><p>For example, an international seafarer who is resident and domiciled for Irish tax purposes will be subject to Irish income tax on his or her worldwide income, including that derived from the exercise of an employment on board a ship in international waters. If the seafarer is subject to tax on this income in another jurisdiction with which the State has a DTA, then the income may be relieved from double taxation in accordance with the terms of the DTA. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400077#WRR00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":988,"qnumday":408,"qnumall":"[30563\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400077#WRR00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide an update on the OECD proposals relating to corporation tax; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":989,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the OECD\/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS met last October to agree a two-pillar solution to address tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the economy.<\/p>  <p>  Pillar One will see a reallocation of 25% of residual profits to the jurisdiction of the consumer. The scope is confined to multination groups with turnover in excess of &euro;20 billion annually. Residual profit is profit greater than 10% of turnover. <\/p>  <p>  Pillar Two provides that the minimum effective rate is 15% for multinational enterprises with annual turnover in excess of &euro;750m.<\/p>  <p>  It is expected that the Agreement will bring long-term stability and certainty to the international tax framework arising from discussions which have taken place.<\/p>  <p>  The implementation timeframe for both Pillars is ambitious as acknowledged recently by the Secretary General of the OECD.  However, I am fully committed to delivering both pillars of the agreement as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Intensive work is ongoing, both at the OECD and EU, to reach agreement on the technical detail required in both Pillars to ensure that these complex provisions are transposed robustly and in co-ordination by all signatories to the agreement.<\/p>  <p>  An intensive programme of meetings is ongoing at the OECD to ensure that the Agreement can be translated into rules which ultimately can become legislation. My officials and those of the Revenue Commissioners are endeavouring to shape the rules to ensure that they provide the necessary tax certainty, are administrable for business and tax administrations, and remain broadly faithful to the October Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  On Pillar One the OECD have divided the work into 14 building blocks necessary to implement Pillar One.  Each block is sent to public consultation as part of the development process and these elements will eventually form the Pillar One Model Rules.<\/p>  <p>  These model rules, which will govern the reallocation of taxing rights to market jurisdictions, are to be delivered through a Multilateral Convention. This will be both legally and legislatively challenging to develop and deliver.  <\/p>  <p>  Pillar Two is more advanced. The OECD published Model Rules in December 2021 and published a commentary to these rules in March of this year.  The Model Rules provide an important framework to assist individual jurisdictions to implement the Global Minimum Effective Tax Rate in a coordinated and consistent manner in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on the OECD&rsquo;s Implementation Framework to deal with further implementation issues, such as coexistence with the US GILTI regime, and the GloBE information return.<\/p>  <p>  In the EU, work on delivering Pillar Two into legislation through the Minimum Tax Directive is very advanced. I am fully supportive of the efforts of the French presidency towards reaching unanimous agreement of the Directive and am optimistic that unanimous agreement can be reached at ECOFIN soon.<\/p>  <p>  The EU Minimum Tax Directive now provides for implementation by 31 December 2023, which is in line with the OECD agreement of 2023 implementation.  This remains faithful to the original deadline, while recognising the complex work required of both tax administrations and businesses in order to introduce and operate these rules effectively.<\/p>  <p>  Domestically, a public consultation has recently been launched on the implementation of Pillar Two into Ireland&rsquo;s tax code and I encourage all interested parties to engage with this consultation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400077#WRR00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Responsibilities","counter":990,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400077#WRR00800"},{"type":"question","counter":991,"qnumday":409,"qnumall":"[30564\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400077#WRR00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of his work as president of the Eurogroup; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":992,"content":"<p>As President of Eurogroup since September 2020, I have chaired 23 Eurogroup meetings, which have been conducted in both virtual format due to Covid, and more recently in physical format. In addition, I have conducted numerous bilateral meetings with Eurogroup Ministers, EU Commissioners, and the President of the European Central Bank to ensure the achievement of Eurogroup objectives.<\/p>  <p>  The Eurogroup has focused on a variety of policy areas, with economic recovery from Covid being a key focus throughout that period. The euro area&rsquo;s economic recovery has been impressive with a return to pre-crisis GDP levels by the end of 2021. This recovery is attributable to the co-ordinated supportive fiscal stance of member states, which has protected jobs and income with euro area unemployment rate now at its lowest level on record.  <\/p>  <p>  The Eurogroup played an essential role in coordinating this response across member states, and also coordinating with other EU supports such as the European Central Bank&rsquo;s monetary policy response to Covid; and with the implementation of the EU&rsquo;s three safety nets, including the &euro;100 billion SURE scheme which protected 30 million jobs, the European Investment Bank&rsquo;s &euro;200 billion pandemic guarantee fund, and the European Stability Mechanism &euro;240 billion Pandemic Crisis Support.  <\/p>  <p>  In recent months, the Eurogroup&rsquo;s economic discussions have been dominated by Russia&rsquo;s war of aggression against Ukraine. Member States have worked together to give a firm response to this aggression against a European state and the European Union has once again shown its ability to rise to the challenge in the most difficult of times. Euro area Governments have been taking action to respond to the increase in energy prices and the surge in inflation.  In these turbulent times, the common currency has offered an anchor of stability for the euro area and the EU as a whole, which is demonstrated by the strong implementation of Greece&rsquo;s programme of assistance, and Croatia&rsquo;s intention to join the euro area as of 2023.<\/p>  <p>  The Eurogroup has worked to deepen the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) including by strengthening the Banking Union, on which discussions are currently ongoing.

Some headline measures include increases in social protection payments, Fuel Allowance and Working Family Payment; health affordability measures; social and affordable housing funding, and enhanced student and childcare supports. Budget 2022 also contained an income tax package of just over half a billion euro.<\/p>  <p>  Since December 2021, over half a billion euro of additional expenditure measures have been put in place to support citizens and businesses with increased costs. A number of these measures build on supports put in place in Budget 2022. A summary of the main measures is as follows:<\/p>  <p>  -  An Energy Credit payment automatically applied to the electricity bill of all domestic account holders to assist with rising energy costs.  <\/p>  <p>  -  In addition to the &euro;5 per week increase in Fuel Allowance payments introduced in Budget 2022, a further two lump sum payments totalling &euro;225, paid in March and in mid-May, will benefit over 370,000 households. <\/p>  <p>  -  Budget 2022 announced an increase of &euro;10 in the weekly income threshold for the Working Family Payment. The implementation of this increase was brought forward from April to June.<\/p>  <p>  -  A further reduction from &euro;100 to &euro;80 in the monthly payment threshold for the Drugs Payment Scheme. This will reduce medicines and drugs costs for over 70,000 recipients. <\/p>  <p>  -  A temporary 20% reduction in Public Service Obligation Public Transport fares until the end of 2022 to reduce the financial burden on commuters returning to the workplace.<\/p>  <p>  -  The maximum annual School Transport charge was reduced to &euro;150 per family at primary level and &euro;500 per family at post-primary level for the next academic year.<\/p>  <p>  -  A temporary and targeted emergency grant scheme for licensed hauliers provides a payment of &euro;100 per week for licensed heavy goods vehicle for a period of eight weeks. This scheme reflects the vital role that hauliers play in the supply.<\/p>  <p>  To provide further support towards mitigating fuel cost increases, the Department of Finance have introduced temporary reductions in the excise duties charged on petrol, diesel and marked gas oil and have reduced the rate of VAT on the supply of gas and electricity.<\/p>  <p>  Together, these measures provide substantial assistance towards mitigating the impact of rising prices. Overall, the Government has sought to implement measures which strike a balance between delivering targeted support, capable of timely implementation and are temporary in nature to ensure that our public finances remain on sustainable trajectory and avoid actions that could result in further inflation. <\/p>  <p>  Over the coming weeks, I will engage with my colleague the Minister for Finance in preparation for the Summer Economic Statement.

While a potentially smaller piece of the overall response, it can help meet accommodation needs where other accommodation is not readily available.<\/p>  <p>  I have also established an\u00a0Emergency Vacant Housing Delivery Unit in the LGMA, as well as a Ukraine Accommodation Unit in my own Department, to support local authorities and public bodies in repurposing vacant public and private buildings as temporary multi-occupancy accommodation. Over 500 properties have been identified and analysed to date, with 90 or so capable of accommodating around\u00a05,300 persons already notified to D\/CEDIY.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Local authorities have since been requested to submit further proposals for priority refurbishment of vacant buildings suitable as temporary multi-occupancy accommodation in their respective areas. The aim is to provide an initial 3,100 beds, with approximately 100 beds available in each local authority area. Further phases of this programme will follow in line with the need identified by D\/CEDIY.<\/p>  <p>  To meet increased demand for housing arising from the unexpected and urgent need to accommodate persons from Ukraine, I also\u00a0established\u00a0a Clearing House Group to examine contractual, operational and compliance matters associated with planning permissions. The Group, comprising a small number of experts, will recommend measures to address blockages and constraints to residential and student accommodation development, as well as related local infrastructure required to facilitate housing. These measures may include using emergency planning powers under the Planning and Development Acts.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to the continued delivery of Housing for All. Any new accommodation developed in response to the humanitarian crisis will be separate and additional to Housing for All targets. That said, any suitable permanent accommodation delivered through these measures will be directed to social and affordable housing when the crisis resolves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400079#WRT04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1142,"content":"<p>Question No. 460 answered with Question No. 459.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Issues","counter":1143,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400079#WRT04125"},{"type":"question","counter":1144,"qnumday":461,"qnumall":"[28831\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400079#WRT04150","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"when the investigation that he initiated into possible conflicts of interest at the national planning authority An Bord Plean&aacute;la is expected to conclude.","asker":"1495","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":1145,"content":"<p>My Department\u00a0published the terms of reference (attached) for the\u00a0Report into the management of conflicts of interest and relevant disclosures by the Deputy Chairperson of An Bord Plean&aacute;la in relation to certain Decisions of that Board on the 12th of May 2022.

The current PPP Programme will deliver 1,500 social housing units, spread across three bundles of sites.<\/p>  <p>  The Social Housing PPP Programme is being delivered through the &lsquo;availability&rsquo;-based PPP model. Under this type of contract, the PPP project company, as the private partner, designs, builds, finances, maintains and operates (DBFMO) social housing developments for a period of 25 years in return for a monthly payment (unitary charge) from the State. Payment is made by the State only once construction of the buildings is complete and the homes are ready for tenanting. This funding mechanism means that PPPs typically require no upfront capital from the State, so the private partner takes on the full construction and funding risks. PPP's also provide cost certainty for the State, with unitary charge commitments known before the contract is executed. In addition, projects are subject to comprehensive value for money testing in accordance with guidance from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p>  <p>  Land provided by the local authority is made available by way of a licence, but remains in State  ownership throughout. In addition, handback provisions are a key feature of PPPs, with the private partner required to hand back the assets to the State at the end of the 25 year operating period, in a specified condition with a pre-defined residual life. This ensures the assets are handed back in good quality for future use.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of progress to date, in 2021 construction was completed on Bundles 1 and 2 of the Social Housing PPP Programme and the new homes are now fully tenanted.

The local authority does not have a role in the tenancy.<\/p>  <p>  Each local authority has statutory discretion to agree to a HAP payment up to 20% above the prescribed maximum rent limit in circumstances where it is necessary, because of local rental market conditions, to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it. It is a matter for the local authority to determine if the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis. Additional discretion of up to 50% above rent limits is available to assist in housing homeless households in the Dublin Region only.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is aware that some HAP recipients are making payments directly to their landlords, beyond the amount of HAP being paid on their behalf. While there is no legislative provision precluding HAP supported households contributing towards the monthly rent required by the landlord, local authorities have a responsibility to ensure that tenancies are sustainable and that households in HAP are in a position to meet the rental costs involved.<\/p>  <p>  HAP tenants are required to sign a rent contribution agreement to pay a weekly rental contribution to the relevant local authority, in line with the local authority&rsquo;s differential rent scheme. As set out in the rent contribution agreement, this weekly rental contribution must be paid by them so that they remain eligible for the HAP scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The HAP Shared Services Centre (SSC) manages the collection of all HAP tenants&rsquo; differential rents, on behalf of the relevant local authority, and the payment of all HAP rents to landlords on behalf of tenants supported by the HAP scheme. The HAP SSC follows a clear communication policy if rental arrears issues arise. This policy includes regular and early written communication with tenants, landlords and the relevant local authority.<\/p>  <p>  The approach taken by the HAP SSC has been very effective with minimal levels of rent arrears arising for HAP tenants. In 2019, the scheme had a 96% differential rent collection rate, with minimal arrears arising for tenants or local authorities. At Q4 2021, the scheme had a 99% differential rent collection rate. Therefore, only a very small number of tenants have fallen into difficulty with their differential rent.<\/p>  <p>  Under Housing for All, my Department was tasked with undertaking an analytical exercise to examine whether an increase in the level of the 20% discretion available to local authorities under HAP is required, in order to maintain adequate levels of HAP support.<\/p>  <p>  I am working with Government colleagues and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to provide for an increase in the HAP discretion rate to 35% and, for new tenancies, to expand the couple&rsquo;s rate to single persons. This will secure more tenancies and prevent new entries to homelessness. We do need to decrease our reliance on subsidies but we will only do that through significantly scaling up our social housing supply. Housing for all sets us on a pathway to delivering 90,000 social homes between now and the end of 2030.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400081#WRV02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Data","counter":1256,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400081#WRV02200"},{"type":"question","counter":1257,"qnumday":499,"qnumall":"[29515\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400081#WRV02300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the allocation that his Department made for outdoor dining in 2022.","asker":"1497","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":1258,"content":"<p>In 2021, due to the ongoing pandemic and health related restrictions imposed on businesses, particularly in the hospitality sector, &euro;3.62 million, was provided from the Local Government Fund to assist local authorities in supporting an outdoor summer for locals and visitors alike.

In preparing these plans local authorities were asked to assess the level of housing demand with affordability constraint projected for their area based on the Housing Need and Demand Assessment (HNDA) tool and plan their provision accordingly. Local authorities with a strong and identified affordable housing need were asked to prepare Affordable Delivery Action Plans and were set five-year Affordable Delivery Targets.<\/p>  <p>  An identified high level of affordable housing need arises where the HNDA indicates that, of the total projected need for housing in the county, over 5% of new households will not qualify for social housing but will also be constrained in accessing housing by their ability to afford to buy or rent. The level of affordably constrained need across the county of Longford is assessed at below 5%, although some localised affordability issues may arise in certain towns within the county.<\/p>  <p>  It will be a matter for the local authority to consider whether a particular requirement for affordable housing arises and whether it will bring forward specific affordable schemes to meet this need. It is possible for local authorities, including Longford County Council, to undertake HNDA analysis at sub county level to determine whether a need for Government funded affordable housing schemes is evident in specific towns\/areas. Affordable Housing Fund subsidy is only available to support affordable housing purchase in schemes located in large or key towns to uphold National Planning Framework objectives and to  ensure that provision is aligned with where need is concentrated. This Department and the Housing Agency are available to assist in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  Where particular challenges arise for facilitating owner-occupation in towns, and where viable sites available for building of new homes are in short supply, there is significant potential for local authorities to support homeownership in these areas by making available serviced sites at a reduced cost or providing support towards the refurbishment of vacant properties where the level of vacancy or dereliction is high.

It will also examine other relevant issues, including thatching standards, fire prevention guidance, and the availability of suitable thatching materials.

service<\/p><p>The vast majority of applications are processed within these turnaround times. Turnaround time applies to fully complete and correct applications, and begins from the date that supporting documents are received by the Passport Service, not the date the online application is made. Applications that are incorrect or incomplete will take longer to process. Since March of this year, the Passport Service has been operating a new document management system whereby incomplete applications that require further supporting documents are prioritised once the additional documents are received by the Passport Service. These applications are then processed within 15 working days. <\/p><p>An application is current in the Passport Service system for a period of 6 months from when the online application is made. From the time that the supporting documents are received, the Passport Service works with the applicant to process the application and ensure all required documents have been submitted to prove the applicant's entitlement to Irish citizenship, to verify their identity, and in the cases of children, to ensure that consent of guardians is verified. In a small number of cases, it can happen that all required supporting documents are not received by the Passport Service during the 6 month validity period. In such cases, the application will expire and a refund will issue to the applicant. <\/p><p>The Passport Service is already out-performing any previous year, despite the challenges that it has encountered over the past two years. The Passport Service continues to outperform its previous busiest year (2019) by almost 20%. Over 600,000 passports have issued to date this year. This is 83,000 more than the number of passports issued during the same period in 2019. <\/p><p>Diplomatic passport applications are usually processed within 10 working days of receipt of supporting documents. 10 working days is the standard turnaround time for adult renewal applications. Diplomatic passport applications are similar to simple adult renewal applications in that the applicant must hold a current valid Irish passport or have an application for passport renewal in the Passport Service system. <\/p><p>The Passport Service has a formal comments and complaints procedure in place to allow customers an opportunity to give feedback on the quality of the service they receive. <\/p><p>The Passport Service is committed to providing a high quality, effective service to all of our customers and welcomes feedback on how the service can be improved. All feedback is dealt with in confidence and in an impartial manner. <\/p><p>Customers can submit a complaint in writing to: Passport Complaints, Knockmaun House, 42-47, Lower Mount Street, Dublin 2, D02 TN83.<\/p><p>The Passport Service aims to resolve complaints as promptly as possible. Each complaint is examined upon receipt and acknowledged. The complaint will then be investigated and a response issued in writing.<\/p><p>If customers remain unhappy with the response, they can refer their complaint to the Office of the Ombudsman.<\/p><p>Further details of the Passport Service complaints procedure can be found on the DFA website - <i>www.dfa.ie\/about-us\/our-commitments\/passport-complaints-and-appeals\/<\/i>.<\/p><p>The Passport Service has reminded staff on the Oireachtas phone line to advise representatives of the postal address for submitting complaints, if requested. <\/p><p>My department provides a Wellbeing at Work programme and runs a schedule of bi-weekly events, both online and in person, to improve the health, safety and wellbeing of colleagues and to support them in achieving their potential. This Programme consists of the following pillars; Mental, Physical, Social and Environmental. Recent events include a talk on 'Positive Mental Health', Meditation for Wellness classes, Staff Relay Series and &lsquo;Thriving in the Age of Digital Distraction&rsquo;. <\/p><p>The Civil Service Employee Assistance Service (CSEAS) provides an internal employee assistance programme to all Civil Service staff and is designed to assist employees to manage work-related and personal difficulties. It is a free and confidential service providing support to staff and promotes employee wellness and organisational effectiveness. <\/p><p>The Passport Service recognises its staff as a valuable resource and my Department aims to maintain a resilient workforce by promoting positive wellbeing in the workplace. There has been an ongoing recruitment drive in the Passport Service over the past several months to ensure resourcing needs are fully met. Most recently the Passport Service held a Temporary Clerical Officer competition with a view to doubling staffing numbers since June of last year. To date the Passport Service has taken on over 400 new staff since June 2021. There are currently 762 staff in the Passport Service. <\/p><p>In order to protect the integrity of the Irish passport, the processing of passports requires physical attendance on-site. Passport Service staff who are processing applications or in customer service roles cannot work from home. The overwhelming majority of Passport Service staff work on-site every day. Staff who are not involved in the processing of applications, and who are eligible to work from home, (approx 2%) can do so for up to 50% of working time over a four week period, with anchor days built in, while also retaining flexibility for in person attendance required for meetings, training, key events and other priorities. <\/p><p>The information requested by Deputy Richmond is outlined below in tabular form.<\/p><p><b>Staff assigned to the Passport Service <\/b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year <\/th>       <th>Number of Passport Service staff in month of May <\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2015 <\/td>       <td>456 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2016 <\/td>       <td>519 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 <\/td>       <td>565 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 <\/td>       <td>574 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 <\/td>       <td>646 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 <\/td>       <td>646 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 <\/td>       <td>454 <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400084#WRY01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1719,"content":"<p>Question No. 567 answered with Question No. 543.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1720,"content":"<p>Question No. 568 answered with Question No. 543.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1721,"content":"<p>Question No. 569 answered with Question No. 546.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1722,"content":"<p>Question No. 570 answered with Question No. 542.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1723,"content":"<p>Question No. 571 answered with Question No. 543.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1724,"content":"<p>Question No. 572 answered with Question No. 543.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1725,"content":"<p>Question No. 573 answered with Question No. 542.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1726,"content":"<p>Question No. 574 answered with Question No. 542.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1727,"content":"<p>Question No. 575 answered with Question No. 542.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1728,"content":"<p>Question No. 576 answered with Question No. 546.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1729,"content":"<p>Question No. 577 answered with Question No. 546.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1731,"content":"<p>Question No. 578 answered with Question No. 546.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":1733,"qnumday":579,"qnumall":"[29023\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400085#WRZ00400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"when a person (details supplied) who submitted an application on 31 January 2022 will be issued with their passport; his views on whether it is acceptable to wait for this length of time; if he will consider making changes to the way that passport applications are processed; if issues with applications will be addressed earlier in the process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1508","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1734,"content":"<p>With regard to the specific application about which the Deputy has enquired, supporting documents for this application were received on 3 March 2022. Processing time for fully complete and correct applications begins from the date supporting documents are received by the Passport Service. At the time this application was received, the processing time for first time applications was 40 working days. In this specific application, the Passport Service requested additional supporting documents for the applicant which also increased the processing time. The passport was issued to the applicant on 2 June 2022. <\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service is proactively managing the current demand for passports and has put in place resources and structures to address the significant increase in demand for passports in 2022 in this essential citizen service.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service is already out-performing any previous year, despite the challenges that it has encountered over the past two years. In 2019, which was the busiest year for passports pre-Covid, the Passport Service had issued 517,000 passports by 14 June. In the same period this year, over 600,000 passports have been issued. Last year, 634,000 passports were issued in the whole year. In five and a half months, the Passport Service has issued 95% of the total number of passports that were issued in the whole of last year.<\/p>  <p>  Since March, online processing times for first time applications have been reduced by 40% and these applications now take 25 working days rather than 40 days, as of Monday, 6 June.

I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern regarding the situation on the ground, and we have expressed our views clearly in relation to illegal settlement activity, settler violence, violations of international law and any action that threatens the viability of a two-State solution.

To date, the Security Council has met 21 times to consider the matter, including on 19 April when I personally briefed them on my visit to Ukraine earlier that month. <\/p><p>Ireland co-sponsored the UN General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution condemning Russia for its illegal, unjustified and unprovoked attack against Ukraine, which was adopted on 2 March (141 votes to 5, with 35 abstentions); the UNGA Ukraine humanitarian resolution, which was adopted on 24 March (140 votes to 5, with 38 abstentions); and the UNGA Resolution to suspend Russia from the Human Rights Council, which was adopted on 7 April (93 votes to 24, with 58 abstentions).<\/p><p>We are also active across the full multilateral system in ensuring that Russia remains isolated, including at the Council of Europe, where we worked with the EU and likeminded countries to expel Russia on 16 March.  <\/p><p>Ireland joined over 40 States in referring the situation in Ukraine to the International Criminal Court. Ireland will provide a further &euro;3 million in funding to the ICC, which will assist with regard to all situations before the court, including Ukraine.  <\/p><p>We also welcomed the establishment by the UN Human Rights Council of the Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine. It is important that different accountability mechanisms in Ukraine can cooperate, within their respective mandates.  <\/p><p>The most effective way to isolate Russia and Belarus, is by acting in coordination with our EU and international partners.  To this end, on 21 March EU Foreign Ministers agreed common guiding principles for engagement with Russia and Belarus in multilateral fora.  <\/p><p>These commit to:<\/p><p>-  Following up on measures already taken or under consideration on suspension of Russia and Belarus&rsquo; rights of participation in international organisations and bodies and regional cooperation frameworks;<\/p><p>-  Examining further possible similar measures across the multilateral system;<\/p><p>-  Actively opposing the election of Russia and Belarus or Russian and Belarusian candidates;<\/p><p>-  Acting to suspend upcoming chairmanships of working parties in international fora; Advocating against appointments of candidates to leadership positions;<\/p><p>-  Acting to prevent Russia and Belarus from hosting international conferences, meetings, and events under UN or other multilateral instances. <\/p><p>Ireland engaged fully in the development of these guiding principles and has been working with our fellow EU member states to apply them on a case by case basis.  <\/p><p>The EU approach acknowledges that taking forward specific actions requires a proper assessment of the legal possibilities in the context of the relevant procedural rules for each organisation concerned. EU coordination takes place at local level to determine the best course of action for each international body or meeting. <\/p><p>The Department of Foreign Affairs has a lead role when it comes to the international relations of the State but this is without prejudice to the specific responsibilities which other Departments, public bodies and organisations have with respect to the international bodies in which they participate.

That decision, unprecedented in the Council&rsquo;s 73-year history, reflected the strongest possible condemnation of the Russian Federation&rsquo;s unjustified and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, another Council of Europe member, and the Kremlin&rsquo;s disavowal of the values, principles, and legal obligations which membership of the Council entails.<\/p>  <p>  On 28 April, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) presented a number of additional recommendations on accountability, detailed in Resolution 2436 (2022) and referenced in the Deputy&rsquo;s questions. <\/p>  <p>  The Committee of Ministers is reviewing these in consultation with the European Committee on Crime Problems, the Steering Committee on Human Rights, and the Committee of Legal Advisers on Public International Law. As President, we will await the opinions of these expert bodies and deliberation within the Committee of Ministers before determining a formal response. However, drawing on my engagement with the PACE Standing Committee in Dublin on 31 May, I will note some relevant considerations regarding the proposals cited by the Deputy.     <\/p>  <p>  Ireland remains a steadfast supporter of the International Criminal Court (ICC). We were amongst the first states to refer the situation in Ukraine to the ICC in March and, following my visit to Ukraine in April, I announced &euro;3 million in funding to support the ICC in the exercise of its jurisdiction there. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, this jurisdiction extends to investigation over war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, but not to the crime of aggression. Recognising this, I am sympathetic to proposals for the creation of an ad hoc tribunal for that purpose. However, I am also conscious that there are a number of significant legal and practical questions concerning the establishment and operation of such a tribunal that need to be resolved before it represents a credible option.<\/p>  <p>  While exploring these with relevant authorities, my priority, as President of the Committee of Ministers, is to ensure that the Council of Europe does all it can here and now, through its existing instruments, to support Ukraine and ensure accountability for the crimes committed there.<\/p>  <p>  To this end, I am firmly committed to advancing the Council&rsquo;s revised Action Plan for Ukraine, as endorsed last month by the Government in Kyiv. As President, Ireland will strive to ensure its full implementation, including by way of an additional voluntary contribution of &euro;200,000. <\/p>  <p>  The European Convention on Human Rights and the European Court of Human Rights are, of course, the cornerstones of the Council of Europe&rsquo;s accountability framework. Under the terms of its expulsion, Russia will remain accountable for violations of the European Convention on Human Rights committed up to 16 September 2022.  <\/p>  <p>  A contracting party to the European Convention on Human Rights may refer any alleged violation of the Convention or its Protocols by another party to the European Court of Human Rights. The vast majority of inter-state cases before the Court arise from regional conflicts between contracting parties. <\/p>  <p>  Ukraine has already initiated an inter-state case against Russia relating to violations of the Convention arising from the invasion. Ukraine is, of course, is best placed to put evidence before the Court as to the impact of the invasion on the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention. Ireland is supportive of Ukraine in these ongoing proceedings. We have also encouraged the Council Secretariat in its provision of expert advice to the Prosecutor General of Ukraine in documenting violations of the Convention. Already, in March, the European Court of Human Rights indicated a number of interim measures requiring Russia to refrain from military attacks against civilians.

Ireland does not have any unilateral sanctions regimes, and the Government has no plans in this regard. In common with all EU Member States, we play an active role in the development and adoption of EU sanctions. As a current member of the UN Security Council, we also participate in the Security Council's 14 sanctions committees.<\/p>  <p>  Sanctions are most effective when applied in a unified and coordinated manner across multiple jurisdictions. Since the invasion of Ukraine, the EU has adopted a wide range of sanctions targeting Russia and Belarus, as part of a coordinated international response involving the US, the UK, Canada and others. These are the most extensive sanctions ever adopted by the EU, and their impact is magnified by the fact that they are being developed and introduced in cooperation with like-minded partners.<\/p>  <p>  There have been calls to confiscate assets frozen under Ukraine-related sanctions, and to potentially use these assets to fund the reconstruction of Ukraine.  In March, the European Commission established a 'Freeze and Seize' Task Force to ensure coordinated and effective implementation of asset freezes imposed on Russian and Belarusian individuals and entities in the context of the Ukraine war. Three sub-groups of the Task Force have been created to focus on specific issues: the first on identifying and freezing sanctioned assets and reporting on these freezes; the second on investigations into links between criminal offences and sanctions, investigations into beneficial ownership, and confiscation of assets; and the third on the creation of a common European fund to reconstruct Ukraine using confiscated assets.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is participating actively in the work of the Task Force and its sub-groups, which have collectively met a total of 18 times to date.  Discussions so far suggest that assets may only be confiscated in circumstances where a crime has been committed. Further work is required to ensure a robust and clear legal basis for confiscations linked to sanctions breaches. The Department of Justice is taking a lead role on these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400091#WRFF03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1918,"content":"<p>Question No. 717 answered with Question No. 716.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1920,"content":"<p>Question No. 718 answered with Question No. 713.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1921,"content":"<p>Question No. 719 answered with Question No. 716.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1922,"content":"<p>Question No. 720 answered with Question No. 546.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1923,"content":"<p>Question No. 721 answered with Question No. 546.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1924,"content":"<p>Question No. 722 answered with Question No. 542.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Services","counter":1925,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400092#WRGG00700"},{"type":"question","counter":1926,"qnumday":723,"qnumall":"[30006\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400092#WRGG00800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the reason that a witness form and photograph were deemed unsuitable for a passport application for a child (details supplied) in County Donegal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

These applications include:<\/p><p>- All Passport Express applications - Section 9 Certificate of Identity<\/p><p>- First time adult online applications - Identity Verification Form<\/p><p>- First time child online applications - Child Passport Identity and Consent Form (Guardian A)<\/p><p>The witnessing of these forms is a vital element of the identity verification process for the Passport Service, as it provides initial assurance that the person in the photograph is the same person presenting to submit the passport application form.<\/p><p>In the case of an application for a minor the witnessing of this form provides evidence that guardians give consent for a passport to be issued to the child. In order to protect the integrity of the Irish passport and also the rights of parents or guardians and children, it is important that forms are correctly completed and verified by the Passport Service by calling the Garda station to confirm the Garda's signature.<\/p><p>It is stated in a note to the witness on the identity and consent forms that they may be contacted to confirm the validity of their signature. It is the responsibility of the witnessing Garda to ensure that the signature is correctly recorded in the logbook, so that when the Passport Service calls at a later date the signature can be verified.<\/p><p>In a small number of cases, the Passport Service contacts the Garda station and is informed that the witness was not recorded in the logbook. Prior to last week, this resulted in the Passport Service requesting a new witnessed consent or identity form from the applicant. <\/p><p>Over the past number of weeks the Passport Service has worked with senior management at An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (AGS) to develop a system for verifying Garda witnesses on passport applications in cases where the relevant Garda station cannot be contacted after three attempts, or where the Passport Service is informed that the witnessing was not recorded in the logbook. <\/p><p>Details on these applications are now forwarded by the Passport Service to Garda HQ on a daily basis. The Garda Liaison Officer will then undertake to verify the details. <\/p><p>This new system, which commenced last week, will assist in reducing the number of passport applications that are delayed due to a failure to make contact with AGS to verify witness details.<\/p><p>The Passport Service maintains a close working relationship with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and regularly offers training and guidance to Garda&iacute; on the correct completion of the required identity and consent forms.<\/p><p>The Passport Service has published a full-page informational advertisement in the June edition of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s magazine, the Garda Review, to assist Garda&iacute; with the process of witnessing passport identity and consent forms. This advertisement includes the information that the details must be recorded in the Garda log book and that the Passport Service will ring the Garda station to verify all first time passport applicants&rsquo; consent and identity form details.<\/p><p>The Passport Service takes its responsibility to protect the integrity of the Irish passport very seriously. The Irish passport has a strong international reputation due to the strength of the security features within the passport book and the robust processes involved in its issuance. The Irish passport was recently ranked 5th in the Henley Global Passport Index as it provides our citizens with visa-free access to 187 countries.<\/p><p>With regard to the specific applications about which the Deputy enquired, the Passport Service made contact with the relevant Garda station and was informed that the witness details were not recorded in the log book.

The 2021 progress report was brought to Government last month to mark Africa Day.<\/p>  <p>  The 2021 report shows that Ireland&rsquo;s trade in goods with Africa increased to a record level of &euro;2.42 billion, while trade in services reached all time high of just over &euro;4 billion.  The Africa Ireland Economic Forum, which my Department has convened for 30 June 2022, will help add further momentum to these trade and investment flows.<\/p>  <p>  Diplomatic links are being strengthened.  In 2020, Ireland became a member of the African Development Bank, opening trade and investment opportunities to Irish companies. Following the opening of an Embassy in Morocco in 2021, the Government has decided also to open an Embassy in Senegal.  Also last year, Ireland was accepted as an associate member of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries, deepening our links with Portuguese-speaking countries in Africa and around the world.<\/p>  <p>  Political contacts are strong.

I also visited Irish Aid projects in Rwanda and Uganda, where I also met with the Foreign Minister.

By the end of last year, nearly 193 million people were experiencing crisis levels of food insecurity, an increase of almost 40 million over the previous record in 2020. <\/p>  <p>  This situation has continued to worsen in 2022. The Russian invasion of Ukraine, including its effective blockade on shipping from Ukraine's Black Sea ports, has restricted access to wheat and fertilizers.  This has had an upward pressure on global food prices, exacerbating the precarious situation of vulnerable people particularly in countries experiencing ongoing humanitarian crises.  <\/p>  <p>  The United Nation&rsquo;s outlook for June to September 2022 identified 20 hunger hotspots where lives and livelihoods are at risk and urgent humanitarian action is a priority.

That said, the amount of funding given in response to these appeals significantly higher in absolute terms than at this point in previous years.<\/p>  <p>  There is a collective responsibility to act and Ireland is leading by example. Through our range of experienced and trusted partners, including UN agencies, the Red Cross family and NGOs, the Irish Aid programme is supporting responses across the globe, with a strong focus on the 20 hunger hotspots. The Irish Aid allocation for humanitarian action this year, at &euro;113 million, is substantially higher than last year, and is likely to increase further before year end in response to these emerging needs.  Separately, and to help address the underlying causes of food insecurity, Ireland has pledged to invest &euro;800 million by 2027 in improving global food and nutrition systems.<\/p>  <p>  As the informal focal point on Conflict and Hunger on the United Nations Security Council, Ireland is consistent advocate for urgent attention and action on global food insecurity. We are also a strong voice at the EU on collective action.<\/p>  <p>  The Grand Bargain Annual High Level Meeting will take place on 30 June and 1 July in Geneva. This will bring together 64 donor signatories, UN agencies, the Red Cross family and NGOs.

In Syria itself, almost two-thirds of the population are expected to face food shortages in 2022.<\/p>  <p>  This year, through the Irish Aid programme, the Government will provide over &euro;23 million to the Syria humanitarian response. This will bring Ireland&rsquo;s assistance to Syria since 2012 to over &euro;216 million, our largest ever response to a humanitarian crisis. Using a variety of trusted partners, we ensure that critical assistance reaches those most in need.

There is generally good capacity in schools generally across the country albeit there may be capacity pressures to be managed in some areas.  National enrolments at primary level are reducing (projected to be circa. 25,000 below their 2018 peak in September 2022).  A capacity survey at post-primary level, which has a 100% completion rate, indicates capacity of circa 20,000 school places.  An equivalent survey at primary level is currently underway and engagement with special schools will commence shortly.<\/p>  <p>  The 16 Regional Education and Language Teams (REALT), hosted by the regional Education and Training Boards (ETBs), to support the needs of children from Ukraine arriving in Ireland will have a key role in managing these capacity pressures.

This will bring the total number of SETs in the system to 14,385.<\/p>  <p>  The SET Model represented a significant shift in the way that students with SEN are supported in mainstream classes.  Previously, students needing additional teaching support required a diagnosis in order to access support which caused delays in providing the support and also imposed a burden on both schools and parents. The change in policy was welcomed by both schools and parents. The Model is based on the principle that those students with the greatest need receive the most support. <\/p>  <p>  The model encourages schools to support students with SEN in mainstream classes alongside their peers.  In fact most students with SEN are enrolled these classes. This approach is also consistent with the EPSEN Act<\/p>  <p>   When the SET model was introduced it was designed to be updated on a regular basis so as to distribute the total available resources across the school system based on profiled need. Because the level of student need may change in a school over time, some schools will gain under this distribution, with these gains balanced by equivalent reductions in schools where the model indicates reduced need. Re-profiling is the means of ensuring that new or increasing need in schools is met by transfer\/redistribution of teaching resources from other schools whose need has reduced as shown by the model.  <\/p>  <p>  Schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile.

The circular outlines that as a first phase of implementation of the agreement,  schools must, before the end of September, calculate the initial assimilation rate of pay and annual leave entitlement for secretaries and offer it to secretaries.

Previously, students needing additional teaching support required a diagnosis in order to access support which caused delays in providing the support and also imposed a burden on both schools and parents.

Because the level of student need may change in a school over time, some schools will gain under this distribution, with these gains balanced by equivalent reductions in schools where the model indicates reduced need.

This first year also included the first in-setting and in-school phase during which a CLIL approach would be implemented. <\/p>  <p>  Due to COVID-19 and the health advice current at the time it was necessary to postpone the in-setting and in-school phase of the project in 2019\/20 and again in 2020\/21.

My Department&rsquo;s CLIL team, which includes experts from third level institutions and teacher education support services, continued to liaise with schools and settings throughout this period, and developed CLIL based resources in a number of subject areas, such as PE for primary schools, and a dedicated CLIL website www.jct.ie\/content_and_language_integrated_learning_(CLIL)\/home.  <\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that seven Early Learning and Care settings, six primary schools and two post-primary schools are now approaching the end of the first phase of implementation of a CLIL approach to learning Irish and learning other aspects of the curriculum through Irish.

I wish to acknowledge the valuable work being done by school principals and wider school authorities in expanding the educational provision for pupils with special educational needs including the required physical infrastructure. I would like to assure the Deputy that the supports for school principals and communities who are supporting children with special education needs is kept under constant review.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is working actively with the NCSE and other key stakeholders including School Patrons and Management Bodies to provide additional special classes and special school places for the 2022\/23 school year so that the remaining gaps in provision from the current provision of circa. 99% to the full 100% is achieved as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has close engagement with the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) which has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide.  When the NCSE sanction a special class in a school, the school can apply to my Department for capital funding to re-configure existing spaces within the school building to accommodate the class or to construct additional accommodation. The purpose of my Department&rsquo;s Additional School Accommodation (ASA) scheme is to ensure that essential mainstream classroom and Special Education Needs (SEN) accommodation is available to cater for pupils enrolled each year, where the need cannot be met by the school&rsquo;s existing accommodation. While it is open to the school authority to make an application for additional accommodation through the ASA scheme, my Department works closely with schools in order to minimise the amount of information required and to fast-track to the maximum extent possible the application for funding for reconfiguration of existing capacity for special classes in particular.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE has additionally provided my Department with projections of future requirements for classes for students with special education requirements.  These are informing my Department's advance planning for special class accommodation which will enhance the opportunities for synergy and minimising the number of projects managed at school level. This advance planning is building on the significant work to date in delivering additional classrooms for students with special education needs.  Such classrooms for pupils with special education needs are included as standard in the accommodation brief for new school buildings and major extension projects, unless local circumstances indicate that they will not be required.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the delivery of building projects, my Department has a number of delivery programmes utilising various procurement methods including individual open market tendering, restricted two stage tendering, design and build and procurement framework arrangements. These methods of construction procurement are selected to suit the various types of school infrastructure requirements based on scope, complexity, programme, location and value for money. My Department&rsquo;s construction procurement methods are continually reviewed in light of these constraints. &ldquo;Bulk ordering&rdquo; of construction infrastructure is problematic due to the bespoke nature of individual school sites and the specific educational requirements of various schools. Furthermore, this method of procurement can lead to calls of restrictive tendering practices which is against EU and national procurement rules.<\/p>  <p>  In order to assist school authorities and principals with the undoubted workload associated with capital projects, my Department funds external stakeholders engaged in the devolved delivery of building projects for individual schools. These stakeholders such as Patron and managerial bodies, Educational Training Boards and local authorities are funded to procure project managers and services in order to enhance their other support functions to schools on whose behalf they can either deliver projects directly or assist schools in delivering projects. Many school patrons are also funded to employ building officers who advise and support schools regarding how best to manage and address their accommodation requirements.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2020, each primary school with a teaching principal has been provided with a minimum of one release day per week, with four additional release days allocated to schools with a special class.  Measures announced in Budget 2022 will see administrative principals in primary schools that have two or more special classes from September, regardless of the school&rsquo;s enrolment. Since the lifting of the moratorium on posts of responsibility in 2017, 1700 additional leadership posts have been invested in our primary schools, which has led to 1 in 3 teachers now holding promoted positions.  The Department has committed to annually revising the allocation of Posts of Responsibility to take into account retirements during the school year which ensures that the current level of Posts of Responsibility are maintained in the school system. Measures to assist school leadership at post primary include additional posts of responsibility to enable Deputy Principals to be more fully available to assist the school principal with the leadership of the school and the appointment of an additional Deputy Principal in schools with pupil enrolment in excess of 700 pupils or 600 for DEIS 1 post primary schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400099#WRSS05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":2360,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400100#WRTT00300"},{"type":"question","counter":2361,"qnumday":973,"qnumall":"[29392\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400100#WRTT00400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of primary schools with classrooms in prefabricated buildings in each county in 2019, 2020, 2021 and to date in 2022, in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1495","askee":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":2362,"qnumday":974,"qnumall":"[29393\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400100#WRTT00500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of primary schools with classrooms in prefabricated buildings for more than ten years in each county in tabular form.","asker":"1495","askee":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":2363,"qnumday":975,"qnumall":"[29394\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400100#WRTT00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of secondary schools with classrooms in prefabricated buildings in each county in 2019, 2020, 2021 and to date in 2022, in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1495","askee":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":2364,"qnumday":976,"qnumall":"[29395\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400100#WRTT00700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of secondary schools with classrooms in prefabricated buildings for more than ten years in each county in tabular form.","asker":"1495","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":2365,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 973, 974, 975 and 976 together.<\/p>  <p>Temporary accommodation in schools may be rented or purchased and funded by the Department or by the school authority itself, with or without Department sanction.  For that reason it is not possible to provide the Deputy with a complete picture in respect of all temporary accommodation at schools as requested.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, within the context of a rapidly increasing school population combined with arriving Ukrainian children, my Department's priority is to ensure that every child has access to a physical school place.  In this regard, it is sometimes necessary to make use of temporary accommodation in order to meet the accommodation needs of schools. <\/p>  <p>  The timing and duration of the accommodation need is also considered in determining the optimum accommodation solution &ndash; a short-term accommodation requirement does not require a long-term accommodation solution. For example, a school may require a temporary building in circumstances where a major school construction project is planned.  Such temporary accommodation is removed when the major project concerned is completed.  The length of time it is necessary to make use of temporary rented accommodation will vary from project to project. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is taking an integrated approach with the Prefab Replacement Programme through the replacement of prefabricated units as part of large-scale and devolved projects and as part of new projects approved under the Additional School Accommodation scheme.<\/p>  <p>  There are over 1,300 school building projects within the current pipeline across the various stages of planning, design, tender and construction - most of which are expected to be either under construction or completed in the period 2021 to 2025. The progression and completion of these projects is and will make further inroads on the replacement of rented sites and buildings with knock-on savings on the rental budget. Good progress continues to be made with the rollout of projects, and the current status of projects being delivered is listed in tabular format, on a county by county basis, on the Department&rsquo;s website at www.gov.ie and is updated regularly.<\/p>  <p>  Many schools based in rented buildings and on rented sites are already part of the pipeline of projects under the school building programme and their longer-term accommodation will be addressed as part of these projects. Maximising the opportunities to achieve value for money involves matching, as best as possible, the accommodation requirement with the appropriate accommodation solution. This is relevant for all accommodation projects progressed by the Department.<\/p>  <p>  The changing landscape in relation to enrolments including that of arriving Ukrainian children means that accommodation requirements can vary locally and regionally and between short, medium and long-term and this is a relevant factor considered by the Department in determining the type of accommodation solution to be put in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400100#WRTT00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2366,"content":"<p>Question No. 974 answered with Question No. 973.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2367,"content":"<p>Question No. 975 answered with Question No. 973.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2368,"content":"<p>Question No. 976 answered with Question No. 973.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":2369,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400100#WRTT01200"},{"type":"question","counter":2370,"qnumday":977,"qnumall":"[29399\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400100#WRTT01300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the proposed closure of the special education class in a school (details supplied) for children attending a mild general learning disability class; if her officials will engage with school management regarding any appeals avenues available; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1626","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":2371,"content":"<p>Enabling children with special educational needs to receive an education is a priority for this Government.

It allows us to make the best use of our expertise, information and knowledge to help inform decisions around education provision.<\/p><p>Since 2011, the number of special classes in mainstream schools has increased from 548 to a current total of 2,148 for the 2021\/2022 school year.<\/p><p>Budget 2022 has provided for the creation of 287 additional special classes for the 2022\/2023 school year. These additional classes will provide over 1,700 new places this year. This additional provision will bring the total number of special classes to 2,435 in the 2022\/2023 school year.<\/p><p>My Department provides funding through a Home Tuition Grant Scheme towards the provision of a compensatory educational service for children who, for a number of specific reasons, are unable to attend school, outlined below.<\/p><p>Home tuition is not an alternative to a school placement and is provided in very limited and specific circumstances.<\/p><p>The Department provides home tuition grant schemes to provide funding towards the provision of a compensatory educational service for children who, for a number of specific reasons, are unable to attend school,<\/p><p>This strand of the Home Tuition Scheme provides funding towards a compensatory educational service for children with special educational needs for whom such a placement is not available. The scheme also provides for early educational intervention for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) ,who meet the scheme&rsquo;s criteria, aged from 2.5 - 5 years before they start in school.<\/p><p>Children aged 4 years and over, including those with ASD, may enrol in primary placements (including special class and special schools placements). All children must be enrolled in the primary school system, whether through placement in mainstream classes, in special classes or in special schools in the September prior to their sixth birthday. <\/p><p>In such circumstances the NCSE will actively engage at local level with schools, Patron Bodies and the families to ensure that suitable places are provided as soon as possible.<\/p><p>If, following completion of that work, the NCSE has not been able to establish the required school placements it can activate the provisions contained in section 37A of the Education Act 1998 if required.<\/p><p>The medical strand of the Home Tuition Scheme provides funding towards a compensatory educational service for students, enrolled in schools, with significant medical conditions which has caused, and is likely to continue to cause, major disruption to their attendance at school.<\/p><p>In exceptional cases the Department will provide home tuition applications on behalf of students with diagnoses of school phobia and\/or associated depression\/anxiety which causes major disruption to their attendance at school.

A number of these actions have been implemented in full while others, which by their nature involve continuous action, are the subject of ongoing implementation. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the implementation of the Action Plan, anti-bullying procedures for all primary and post primary schools, which include a specific reference to cyberbullying, were published at the beginning of the 2013\/14 school year. The procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour amongst its pupils and in dealing with any negative impact within school of bullying behaviour that occurs elsewhere.

It will specifically consider cyber bullying, identity bullying and sexual harassment, among other areas. <\/p>  <p>  The review will also give detailed consideration to the recommendations contained in the Oireachtas Joint Committee Report on School Bullying and the Impact on Mental Health which was published last August. <\/p>  <p>  The Steering Committee consists of senior officials from the Department of Education, including the Inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological Service, representatives of the National Parents&rsquo; Council Primary, National Parents&rsquo; Council Post-Primary, Irish Second Level Students&rsquo; Union (ISSU), the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, the National Anti-bullying Research Centre in DCU and other external experts and representatives of advocacy organisations which include BelongTo, Webwise, Parentline National Traveller Women&rsquo;s Forum, Women&rsquo;s Aid and the Independent Living Movement Ireland.

It provides Member States' authorities with guidance and practical advice to ensure a quick, fair and flexible recognition process. Its stated goal is to help those fleeing the war to find a path to meaningful employment, while facilitating their integration. The Recommendation, inter alia, encourages Member States to: <\/p>  <p>  - reduce the formalities for recognition of professional qualifications to a minimum;  <\/p>  <p>  - speed up the process by putting in place fast-track procedures for handling applications of professionals enjoying temporary protection; <\/p>  <p>  - ensure that only essential documents are required; <\/p>  <p>  - accept other forms of proof than original documents (e.g. digital copies); <\/p>  <p>  - dispense with certain requirements, e.g. not asking for certified translations.<\/p>  <p>  To support the implementation of this Recommendation, the European Commission is hosting a number of focused meeting with EU Member States.

Previously, students needing additional teaching support required a diagnosis in order to access support which caused delays in providing the support and also imposed a burden on both schools and parents. The change in policy was welcomed by both schools and parents. The Model is based on the principle that those students with the greatest need receive the most support. <\/p><p>The model encourages schools to support students with SEN in mainstream classes alongside their peers.  In fact most students with SEN are enrolled these classes. This approach is also consistent with the EPSEN Act. When the SET model was introduced it was designed to be updated on a regular basis so as to distribute the total available resources across the school system based on profiled need. Because the level of student need may change in a school over time, some schools will gain under this distribution, with these gains balanced by equivalent reductions in schools where the model indicates reduced need. Re-profiling is the means of ensuring that new or increasing need in schools is met by transfer\/redistribution of teaching resources from other schools whose need has reduced as shown by the model.  <\/p><p>Schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile. The allocations to schools include provision to support all pupils in the schools, including where a child receives a diagnosis after the allocation is received by a school, or where there are newly enrolling pupils to the school.<\/p><p>Both the Department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) are committed to ensuring that all schools are treated equally and fairly in the manner in which their school profiles have been calculated.<\/p><p>In April 2022, the Department issued updated staffing allocations for the 2022\/23 school year to include SET allocations. This ensured that schools were aware of their teaching resources and this allowed them to make the necessary arrangements to ensure that the teaching and learning needs for pupils with SEN can be properly supported. The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has also provided guidance and support to schools to assist them in ensuring that the resources being provided are best managed to meet the needs of pupils with SEN. The support includes training and advice from special education professionals within the NCSE as part of the NCSE regional support teams. <\/p><p>The availability of SNAs is critical to the inclusion of students with significant care needs in education and in school life. <\/p><p>The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.<\/p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. <\/p><p>The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal\/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. <\/p><p>Schools were notified of the arrangements for the allocation of SNA support in respect of students in mainstream classes for the 2022\/2023 school year at the end of May. The arrangements include the following provisions:  <\/p><p>- SNA allocations for the 2022\/23 school year are being maintained at existing levels to give schools clarity and certainty, a process is now available to schools where their change needs have reduced to contact the NCSE so as to ensure that resources are focused on schools with the greater care needs.  <\/p><p>- The exceptional review process can result in an increase or decrease in SNA resources depending on changing care needs in a school. It is also intended to work on a rolling exceptional review pilot with the NCSE over the summer in consultation with our education partners.<\/p><p>A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, is not be necessary for this process.  <\/p><p>It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support.<\/p><p>Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, are dealt with by way of the exceptional review process.  <\/p><p>The Special Educational Needs provision for 22\/23  for the school mentioned above is as follows:<\/p><p>Special Education Teacher Hours 22\/23: 125 (increased from 87.5 in 2021\/22) increased by 43% <\/p><p>Special Class Teaching Posts 22\/23: 2.0<\/p><p>Mainstream SNA Allocation 22\/23: 4.33<\/p><p>Special Class SNAs 22\/23: 4.50<\/p><p>Total SNA Allocation: 8.83<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400102#WRVV04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport","counter":2506,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400102#WRVV04600"},{"type":"question","counter":2507,"qnumday":1023,"qnumall":"[30209\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400102#WRVV04700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of eligible applications that have been received and the number of eligible tickets issued for the school transport scheme in the 2021-2022 school year.","asker":"1460","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":2508,"content":"<p>School Transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department of Education.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.

My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in that area.<\/p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, all schools are required to have drafted new admissions policies, which have been approved by the patron, following consultation with staff and parents of children who are attending the school.  The newly revised school&rsquo;s admissions policy is published on the schools website. It is a key requirement of the act that all school admission policies are fair and transparent. Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available for the relevant year, the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available, a selection process will be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.<\/p>  <p>  The Act requires schools to clearly set out their selection criteria in their admission policies. Schools have discretion in relation to their admission criteria and how they are applied. The criteria to be applied by schools and the order of priority are a matter for the schools themselves. Schools can use age as a selection criterion should they wish to do so. It is an important feature of the act that schools can only make a decision on an application for admission that is based on the schools admission policy.  <\/p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school. In cases where my Department is satisfied that the nearest school is full, eligibility for the School Transport Scheme will be determined based on the distance that children reside from their next nearest school having regard to ethos and language.

My Department&rsquo;s demographic projections indicate a continuing decline in primary school enrolments of over 120,000 by 2033. Although these projections do not account for arriving Ukrainian students, it is clear that at a national level there will be increasing levels of capacity within our existing schools infrastructure. While local and regional variations will, of course, be relevant, the use of such capacity - to meet the needs of Ukrainian children in the first instance - will be an important element in my Department&rsquo;s strategic planning for capital investment in our schools.<\/p>  <p>  My Department already has a large pipeline of projects for delivery under the school building programme to cater for current and future educational demands. The pipeline of projects is kept under continual review to ensure alignment with Project Ireland 2040 objectives. Good progress continues to be made with the rollout of projects, and the current status of projects being delivered is listed in tabular format, on a county by county basis, on the Department&rsquo;s website at www.gov.ie and is regularly updated. Specifically, in the Ballinasloe School Planning Area, there is a new school planned for Scoil an Chroi Naofa and the brief for this has been revised to cater for a principal and 16 mainstream classrooms to cater for future demand in the area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400104#WRXX01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staff","counter":2579,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400104#WRXX01400"},{"type":"question","counter":2580,"qnumday":1048,"qnumall":"[30649\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400104#WRXX01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of an appeal by a school (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":2581,"content":"<p>The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.<\/p>  <p>  For the 2022\/23 school year, the staffing schedule for primary schools has been improved by one point and schools will be provided with class teachers on the basis of 1 teacher for every 24 pupils which is a historical low ratio, with lower thresholds applying to DEIS Urban Band 1 schools.<\/p>  <p>  The staffing process contains an appeals mechanism for schools to submit a staffing appeal under certain criteria to an independent Primary Staffing Appeals Board.

Information from a range of sources, including Child Benefit data, school enrolment data and information on residential development activity is used for this purpose.  Additionally, Project Ireland 2040 population and housing targets inform my Department's projections of school place requirements.<\/p><p>Having considered the projected requirements in each school planning area, my Department then makes an assessment of the existing capacity within that particular area and its ability to meet any increased demand. <\/p><p>Where data indicates that additional provision is required at primary or post primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:<\/p><p>- Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,<\/p><p>- Extending the capacity of a school or schools,<\/p><p>- Provision of a new school or schools.<\/p><p>My Department's projections of post primary school place requirements in Lucan show an anticipated continued growth in enrolments in the short- to medium-term.  The Department is aware of some local pressures and demand for additional post-primary school places in a number of school planning areas across the country, including the Lucan school planning area.<\/p><p>However, it is important to note that where enrolment pressures arise, it may not be as a result of lack of accommodation but may be driven by the following factors: <\/p><p>- Duplication of applications &ndash; pupils have applied for a place to a number of schools in the area. <\/p><p>- School of choice &ndash; pupils can&rsquo;t get a place in their preferred school while there are places in other schools in the town\/area. <\/p><p>- Some towns\/areas have single sex schools and while places are available in the school they are not available to all pupils. <\/p><p>- External draw &ndash; pupils coming from outside the local area.<\/p><p>My Department is working to establish the true extent of any capacity issues through ongoing discussions with the relevant school authorities\/patrons.  In that context, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, the Department is engaging with school patron bodies\/school authorities to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming year(s)  which may necessitate action including, where required, the provision of modular accommodation solutions. <\/p><p>There are 8 post primary schools in the Lucan school planning area and building projects are proposed,  in train or have been delivered as outlined :<\/p><p>St Joseph's College RN 60263V - a major building project for an extension\/refurbishment, which will provide capacity for 1,000 pupils is currently at Stage 3 (tender stage).

Nine modular classrooms have recently been approved pending the delivery of the major project .  <\/p><p>St Kevin's Community College RN 70042L - Four modular classrooms were approved in September 2021 and are now on site.<\/p><p>Lucan Community College RN 70080T - a major project comprising an extension \/ refurbishment is currently at Stage 2b and when completed, will provide capacity for 1,000 pupils.<\/p><p>Col&aacute;iste Cois Life RN76065H - 7 modular classrooms + Specialist rooms were approved in September 2021 and are now on site.<\/p><p>Col&aacute;iste Ph&aacute;draig RN 60264A - my Department has recently approved grant to the school to provide additional specialist accommodation.<\/p><p>Adamstown Community College RN76097U - a new 1,000 pupil post primary school has been constructed for this school.<\/p><p>Kishogue Community College RN 76152C - a new 1,000 pupil post primary school has been constructed for this school. <\/p><p>The annual admissions notice for each of the schools in the Lucan school planning area is available on the individual school website.<\/p><p>I understand that principals of schools in the area have had a number of meetings to establish an overall picture of school place requirements for the next academic year.

Under this scheme, my Department provided funding of &euro;17.2 million in 2021 to all of these schools. Schools participating in my Department&rsquo;s DEIS Programme receive an enhanced rate of book grant. <\/p>  <p>  School book rental schemes have an important role to play in reducing the cost of school books for parents and guardians. In order to support the establishment of book rental schemes my Department provided &euro;15.7 million seed capital in 2014, 2015 and 2016 to all primary schools.   From the information available to my Department currently, approximately 96% of all primary schools and 69% of all post-primary schools operate a book rental scheme. <\/p>  <p>  It is a matter for the Board of Management of each individual school to decide on its own policy in relation to the use of book grant funding in the school but they are expected to adopt a cost-conscious approach to the selection of books for use in their classes. The current arrangement relies on the local knowledge of the school in order to ensure a fair allocation of funds to those most in need.  Therefore, my Department does not hold information in relation to the number of schools that run a free book scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Additional funding of &euro;1million was provided under Budget 2020 to provide free books in DEIS primary schools on a pilot basis. This funding was allocated to 102 DEIS primary schools for a new pilot programme for the 2020\/21 school year. The aim of this pilot is to provide free school books for students in the schools involved, and to support these schools in eliminating the cost of school books for parents.<\/p>  <p>  Under Circular 46\/2013, DEIS primary schools receive a book grant of &euro;21 per pupil.  This pilot provided an additional &euro;64 per pupil to increase the overall book grant rate to &euro;85 per pupil enrolled in the school. This is in line with the costings as set out in the 2019 Barnardos report on the Real Cost of School which states that &euro;85 is the average cost of school books at primary school. <\/p>  <p>  Funding continued for the 2021\/22 school year and the effectiveness and impact of the pilot will be evaluated before any decision is made as regards its possible extension or continuation.

and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1611","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":2773,"content":"<p>My Department provides a range of income supports for full-time carers including\u00a0Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant.\u00a0 Combined spending on all these payments to carers in 2022 is\u00a0estimated to exceed &euro;1.5 billion.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>Eligibility for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is not contingent on a particular disability or illness or the severity of disability or incapacity of the person being cared for but\u00a0acts as an income support for those carers who cannot earn an adequate income in the open labour market due to their caring responsibilities.\u00a0 This allowance is part of the system of social assistance supports that provide payments based on an income need.\u00a0 The means test plays a critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; such as disability, unemployment or caring.\u00a0 This ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need and that resources are targeted to those who need them most.\u00a0 It is also important to note that, just as in the case of disability and job seeking payments, the allowance is not intended to be a compensatory payment for the full value of earnings foregone and nor is it a payment by the State in recognition of services rendered. <\/p><p>Removal of the means assessment for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance would not only change the nature of the scheme from a targeted income maintenance support for those most in need and providing full-time care, and it would, in effect, create a new universal social protection scheme.\u00a0 This would give rise to a very significant annual cost. Based on the number of carers identified in Census 2016, it is estimated that a universal carer&rsquo;s payment could cost in the order of an additional &euro;1.2 billion per annum.\u00a0 This would result in the provision of payments to people who may have significant sources of income while reducing the scope to fund other critical schemes and services.<\/p><p>The income disregard and means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is the most generous within the social welfare system.\u00a0 Since my appointment as Minister for Social Protection, supporting carers has been a key priority for me. <\/p><p>In this year&rsquo;s Budget, I made significant changes to the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance means test which took effect at the beginning of June: <\/p><p>- The\u00a0capital\/savings disregard for the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance means assessment has been\u00a0increased\u00a0from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000, aligning it with that which\u00a0applies for Disability Allowance.  <\/p><p>- For\u00a0carers who work, I have increased the weekly income disregard from &euro;332.50\u00a0to &euro;350 for a\u00a0single person, and from &euro;665 to &euro;750 for carers with a\u00a0spouse\/partner. <\/p><p>These are the first changes that have been made to the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance means test in 14 years.\u00a0 <\/p><p>A more generous means assessment for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance had been called for over successive Budgets by organisations representing carers.\u00a0 An increase in the general weekly income disregard will enable more carers with modest incomes to become eligible for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, and therefore provide an income support to carers, whose earning capacity is significantly constrained as a consequence of their caring responsibilities.<\/p><p>Increasing the capital disregard will allow carers who have accumulated relatively modest savings, often to provide sufficient moneys to care for a loved one, to retain these savings without it impacting upon their carer&rsquo;s payment.\u00a0 It also brings the capital formula applied to savings in the means assessment for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance in line with Disability Allowance.<\/p><p>It should be noted that both the monthly Domiciliary Care Allowance and the annual Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant are available to family carers providing full-time care and assistance regardless of means.\u00a0 As part of Budget 2021, I increased the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant from &euro;1,700 to &euro;1,850.\u00a0 On Thursday 2 June the grant was paid to some 121,000 carers and their families.\u00a0 The overall cost of the grant in 2022\u00a0is expected to be over &euro;241 million.<\/p><p>I can assure the Deputy that I am keenly aware of the key role that family carers play in Irish society and the challenges they face.\u00a0 I will continue to keep the range of income supports provided to family carers under review.\u00a0 However, any improvements or additions to the current supports provided by my Department &ndash; such as introducing further changes to the means testing\u00a0for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance - would have implications for overall spending and could only be addressed in an overall budgetary and policy\u00a0context.<\/p><p>I trust that this clarifies the matter for the

and sets out progress towards the Roadmap goals for the period January 2020 to September 2021.\u00a0 It is accompanied by a Report Card detailing progress on each of the Roadmap commitments.\u00a0 The Progress Report and Report Card are available on the Department of Social Protection pages on gov.ie.<\/p><p>Implementation of\u00a0Roadmap commitments is underway with a number of commitments\u00a0fully achieved or close to completion and with work ongoing in relation to a number of other commitments.\u00a0 This was achieved against a challenging backdrop with many Departments having to redirect resources during 2020 and 2021 to address the range of social, health, community and economic consequences arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>By the end of September 2021: <\/p><p>- 21 of the 69 Roadmap commitments were fully achieved or achieved with ongoing delivery; <\/p><p>- A further 4 commitments were in\u00a0progress on schedule with ongoing delivery; <\/p><p>- 37 commitments were in progress,\u00a0with delivery on some delayed due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; <\/p><p>- Work on 5 commitments had yet to commence; and <\/p><p>- 2 were deferred due to the pandemic.<\/p><p>Commitments that have been delivered over the first 21 months of the Roadmap include: <\/p><p>- The introduction of an additional three weeks of Parent&rsquo;s Leave and Parent&rsquo;s Benefit are available to each parent of a child born or adopted on or after 1 November 2019 (bringing the total to five weeks).\u00a0 Budget 2022 includes the introduction of an additional 2 weeks, which will bring the total to 7 weeks in 2022. <\/p><p>- The extension of the Hot School Meals programme in 2021, with 189 schools, including 171 DEIS schools, receiving funding under the programme. <\/p><p>- The allocation of &euro;5m to the Department of Social Protection under the Dormant Accounts Action Plan 2020 to Support and Improve Employment Opportunities for Carers and Persons with a Disability, with funding in excess of &euro;2.3 million awarded to 17 projects in December 2020. <\/p><p>- The establishment of the Labour Market Advisory Council, which plays a key role in advising the Minister and the Government on public policy responses to support the labour market recovery. <\/p><p>- The inclusion in Budgets 2021 and 2022 of specific welfare measures to support working families on low incomes such as improvements in the core weekly rates of payment and the Working Family Payment, and targeted increases in payments for children.\u00a0 <\/p><p>- The publication of national strategies which will support the delivery of Roadmap commitments including: <\/p><p>- The Further Education and Training (FET) Strategy 2020-2024 &quot;Transforming Learning&quot; in July 2020; <\/p><p>- National Volunteering Strategy 2021-2025 in December 2020; <\/p><p>- Our Rural Future - the Rural Development policy 2021-2025 in March 2021; <\/p><p>- Pathways to Work Strategy 2021-2025 in July 2021; <\/p><p>- Adult Literacy for Life: 10&ndash;year Adult Literacy, Numeracy and Digital Literacy Strategy in September 2021; and <\/p><p>- &lsquo;Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland&rsquo; in September 2021.<\/p><p>It is expected that the second Progress Report and Report Card will be published shortly.\u00a0 These will detail progress made in relation to Roadmap commitments over the whole of 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400107#WRAAA05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1563"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental

of carers&rsquo; income supports including\u00a0Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant.\u00a0 Combined spending on all these payments to carers in 2022 is\u00a0estimated to exceed &euro;1.5 billion.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is the main scheme by which the Department provides income support to carers in the community.\u00a0 Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is a means tested social assistance payment awarded to those carers who are caring for certain people who require full-time care and attention.\u00a0 The means test is used to target the support to those most in need.<\/p>  <p>  The primary objective of the payment is to provide an income support to carers whose earning capacity is substantially reduced as a consequence of their caring responsibilities and in so doing to support the ongoing care of the person in respect of whom care is being provided.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Carer's Benefit payment is an entitlement based on social insurance contributions.\u00a0 Carer&rsquo;s Benefit is a payment made to insured people who may be required to leave the workforce or reduce their working hours to care for a person(s) in need of full-time care.\u00a0 It is payable for a period of 2 years (104 weeks) for each care recipient and may be claimed over separate periods up to a total of 2 years (104 weeks). <\/p>  <p>  A primary qualifying condition for the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance and Carer&rsquo;s Benefit payments is that the applicant provides full-time care and attention to a person in need of such a level of care.\u00a0 The person being cared for\u00a0must be so incapacitated as to require full-time care and attention and be likely to require this full-time care and attention for at least 12 months.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The minimum hours condition for which a carer can be regarded as providing full-time care and attention is set out in legislation.\u00a0 A carer will be regarded as providing full-time care and attention to a relevant person, where the number of hours providing such care is not less than 35 hours in a period of 7 consecutive days, and care is provided on any 5 days, whether consecutive or not, within a period of 7 consecutive days. <\/p>  <p>  However, in order to support a carer&rsquo;s\u00a0continued attachment\u00a0to the workforce and to support broader social inclusion, carers may engage in some limited employment, education or training, while still being regarded as being in a position to provide full-time care and continue to receive their full payment.\u00a0 During this time of employment, education or training, adequate provision must be made for the care of the relevant person.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  There have been a number of significant improvements to the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance scheme regarding the relaxation of the full-time care and attention requirement so as to enable carers to engage in education, training or work.<\/p>  <p>  From August 1999, the full-time care and attention requirements were relaxed to introduce some flexibility and allow carers to work for up to 10 hours per week.\u00a0 As of June 2006, this was increased from 10 to 15 hours per week.\u00a0\u00a0In Budget 2020, this was further increased from 15 to 18.5 hours per week.\u00a0 This measure was prioritised in response to carers who had stated that they found the previous number of 15 hours to be too restrictive.<\/p>  <p>  Both the full-time care and attention requirement and the 18.5-hour limitation are contained in the respective legislative provisions of the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant schemes. <\/p>  <p>  I consider the limit of 18.5 hours to represent a reasonable balance between meeting the care recipient's requirement for full-time care and the carer's need to maintain contact with the workforce.\u00a0 Any proposals for further changes to this condition would need to maintain this balance and would have to be considered in\u00a0a\u00a0budgetary context.<\/p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the

November 2020 to examine the sustainability of the State Pension system and the Social Insurance Fund, in fulfilment of a Programme for Government commitment.\u00a0 The terms of reference included a review of the situation in other countries, the changes they have planned or legislated for and the approaches taken.\u00a0 The Commission was an independent body comprised of knowledgeable and experienced academics, pension experts, members of civil society and representatives of workers and employers.\u00a0 Once it completed its work and fulfilled its obligations, the Commission was dissolved. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Commission's Report was\u00a0published on 7th October 2021 and it contains almost 250 pages of analysis, consideration and recommendations.\u00a0 It is a comprehensive report that takes account of an assessment of various analyses of population, labour force and expenditure projections; an examination of international approaches; and responses to an extensive consultation process.\u00a0 The report includes assessments of the State Pension age (Chapter 11), Flexible Access (Chapter 12), Arduous Jobs (Section 11.8.1) and Recognition of Arduous and\/or Hazardous Jobs in Europe (Appendix 11A).\u00a0 The Commission&rsquo;s Report, Technical Sub-Committee's working papers and submissions made to the Pensions Commission are available on the website, pensionscommission.gov.ie.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Commission&rsquo;s analysis indicates that: <\/p>  <p>  - In general, the international trend is moving away from providing specific pension provision and instead using other provisions available within the system to support those in arduous employment <\/p>  <p>  - There is no single definition of what constitutes &ldquo;arduous and\/or hazardous work&rdquo;. <\/p>  <p>  - The operation of pension policies for workers in arduous or hazardous jobs is complex and varies widely between European countries. <\/p>  <p>  - While Ireland is atypical in not having some element of flexibility in its State Pension system, care needs to be taken in comparing State Pension systems internationally. Disparities in preferences for flexibility across countries are likely driven by the design of pension systems in each country.\u00a0  <\/p>  <p>  - Ireland has a flat rate, rather than earnings related, State Pension payment  system.\u00a0 While it makes the State Pension system effective at      redistribution and reducing pensioner poverty, it can also limit the extent to which flexibility can be introduced into the system. <\/p>  <p>  - The gender and equality impacts of this issue are difficult to quantify.  <\/p>  <p>  - As the labour market evolves, increasingly people are moving between employments more fluidly.\u00a0 Individuals who wish to continue working but can no longer work in their current job should be facilitated in moving to another area of employment.  <\/p>  <p>  - There are alternative social welfare payments in Ireland for those who are unable to work past 65 years of age, including the Benefit Payment for 65Year Olds, Invalidity Pension and Illness Benefit.<\/p>  <p>  Successive Governments have committed to supporting older peoples&rsquo; continued engagement in economic and social life, including in the National Positive Ageing Strategy (2013), the Report of the Interdepartmental Working Group on Fuller Working Lives (2016) and the Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018 &ndash; 2023 (2018).\u00a0 Building on the work of these previous groups and reports, the Pensions Commission supported measures to facilitate and encourage fuller working lives.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report established that the current State Pension system is not sustainable into the future and it set out a wide range of recommendations in this regard, including flexible access to the State Pension. <\/p>  <p>  In the interests both of older people and future generations of older people, the Government is considering the comprehensive and far reaching recommendations in the Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report very carefully and holistically.\u00a0\u00a0My officials are examining each of the recommendations and\u00a0consulting across Government through the Cabinet Committee system.\u00a0 The views of the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands and the Commission on Taxation and Welfare are being considered\u00a0as part of these deliberations.\u00a0 I intend bringing a recommended response and implementation plan to Government for its consideration in the coming weeks.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is clear from the Commission&rsquo;s work that State Pension reform is necessary and it is complex.\u00a0 It would be a strategic risk not to plan and provide for projected demographic changes, not least in terms of income adequacy for older people.\u00a0\u00a0The State Pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.\u00a0 It is extremely effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.\u00a0 This Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case for current pensioners, those nearing State Pension age and today&rsquo;s young workers including those who are only starting their careers.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400108#WRBBB03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Data Protection","counter":2811,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400108#WRBBB03200"},{"type":"question","counter":2812,"qnumday":1126,"qnumall":"[30008\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400108#WRBBB03300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the legal framework that enables her Department to share information on persons seeking employment with private companies operating JobPath;

the war in Ukraine on 24 February, and the invoking of the temporary protection Directive by the European Union shortly afterwards, my Department has worked intensively as part of the cross-governmental response to the Ukraine crisis.<\/p>  <p>The operational challenges brought about by responding to the conflict are significant. Our country has never experienced an influx of displaced persons like the one that we have seen over the past months. My Department&rsquo;s role is focused on the immediate, short-term accommodation needs of those who have fled here. To date, more than 34,000 people have arrived in Ireland and just in excess of 25,000 of those have been referred to us seeking accommodation from the State.<\/p>  <p>Within my Department, a dedicated Ukraine Response Division has been newly established. The team includes more than 80 staff. The majority of these staff have moved from within the Department with consequent impacts on ongoing work priorities. The Division also includes new staff and those seconded from other Departments and Agencies.<\/p>  <p>Overseeing provision of accommodation on this scale during this timeframe for all those who require it remains immensely challenging. Due to the urgent need to source accommodation, a broad range of accommodation types have been contracted, including emergency accommodation. While this is not ideal, the priority is to place people fleeing the conflict in safe and secure accommodation. <\/p>  <p>Numbers seeking international protection have also increased adding to accommodation capacity issues.<\/p>  <p>Providing accommodation and supports to displaced persons from Ukraine would not be possible without the whole of society response including the contributions from stakeholders, volunteers and the Irish public in general.  My Department is in regular contact with all the relevant stakeholders to facilitate the provision of supports and services to Beneficiaries of Temporary Protection. <\/p>  <p>This includes the Local Authorities who have stood up the Community Response Forum at local level which brings together organisations, statutory bodies such as Tusla and the HSE, and volunteers at a local level to link services to those that need them. It is within this forum that particular issues relating to needs of displaced persons are raised and brought to the attention of state agencies and voluntary groups who can assist.<\/p>  <p>Furthermore, my Department has regular engagement with NGOs working in this sector. They have been extremely supportive and my Department is committed to continued cooperation and collaboration in assisting displaced persons fleeing conflict in Ukraine, including elderly persons.<\/p>  <p>I have had the privilege in recent weeks to travel around the country to speak with representatives of community groups, family resource centres and youth services as well as those who are on the front line of this engagement.

More than 100,000 children now participate on the universal pre-school programme on an annual basis and the National Childcare Scheme subsidises up to 80,000 children.<\/p><p>To ensure that the supply of early learning and childcare places meets demand, my Department has, since 2015, funded the creation of more than 27,000 new places through an Annual Capital Programme. A particular priority in the Annual Capital Programmes has been the creation of places for children under 3.<\/p><p>Before the onset of Covid-19, national data indicated that, on the whole, supply of early learning and childcare places was meeting demand, with evidence of undersupply for young children.<\/p><p>Lower demand for early learning and childcare owing to Covid-19 gave rise to unprecedented vacancy rates in 2020 and 2021, with data from June 2021 revealing an overall vacancy rate of 21% and vacancy rates for children under 1 and children aged 1-2 years of 20% and 10% respectively.<\/p><p>Preliminary analysis of the data captured by City and County Childcare Committees (CCC) and Pobal over April and May of this year reveal a drop in vacancy rates across the country &ndash; with the national vacancy rate now averaging at 13% and the vacancy rates for children under 1 and children aged 1-2 years 14% and 6% respectively.<\/p><p>The network of 30 CCC across the country are in a position to match children and families to services operating with vacant places. CCC are also proactively engaging with early learning and childcare services to explore the potential for services in increase capacity where there is evidence of undersupply. <\/p><p>Currently, there is no specific data on the number of early learning and childcare providers that have reopened baby rooms. In addition, there is no requirement for providers to offer places to children under 2. Recent data from the Annual Early Years Sector Profile reveal just 15% of all services cater for children under 1, while 27% of services cater for children aged 1-2.<\/p><p>A range of steps are being taken by my Department to address issues of under supply. Some &euro;70m  has been allocated for early learning and childcare under the National Development Plan, the majority of which has been earmarked for new places. Work is underway to update the 2001 Planning Guidelines for Early Learning and Childcare Services, in collaboration with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The new Core Funding Scheme, to roll out in September, will provide funding for services aligned to costs of delivery.

The second reduction was in 2018 whereby the number of points at which a child could become eligible for the programme was reduced down to one (September) and the age of eligibility was further reduced. <\/p><p>A child must now have turned 2 years and 8 months on or before the 31st August of a given programme year in order to be eligible (and cannot turn 5 years and 6 months during the programme year). This has allowed children to avail of a full two years of the ECCE programme. This change was based on national experience and a review of international practice. It also had regard to the regulatory requirements for early learning and and care. <\/p><p>There is no situation in which a child is only entitled to one year of the ECCE programme and the current arrangements ensure that all children have the same entitlement, unlike the 3 entry point system. It should also be noted that whilst there is one point at which the child becomes eligible, eligible children can enter the ECCE programme at any time during the 2 year cycle.<\/p><p>I would also highlight the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) provides financial support to help with early learning and childcare costs. There are two types of subsidy for children over 6 months of age:<\/p><p>- A <b>universal <\/b>subsidy for children under 3.

The report of the advisory group published in October 2020 (also known as the Catherine Day report) fed into the creation of the White Paper. In the fourteen months since its publication my department has placed a significant focus on delivering the new model of accommodation and supports for International Protection applicants. The progress made has included: <\/p><p>- Establishment of a dedicated transition team to drive implementation of the programme.<\/p><p>- Development of a detailed implementation plan including inputs from other key stakeholders who have a responsibility for delivering services to International Protection applicants. <\/p><p>- Governance structures established to oversee transition to the new model in the form of a Programme Board and an External Advisory Committee. The membership of the Programme Board includes a representative with lived experience of International Protection and representatives of non-governmental organisations. The Board has met regularly over the past twelve months to review progress. The board most recently met on the 28th April and are due to meet again in July to review project timelines in light of the Ukraine Crisis. A Risk Committee to oversee the management of risks as part of the Programme Board governance framework has also been appointed.<\/p><p>- Significant progress has been made on the establishment of the new accommodation model.  This work has involved working very closely with the Housing Agency in the development of detailed policy advice papers including an acquisition policy, an ownership model and a funding model. Proposals in relation to the ownership model were brought to the Programme Board in November 2021 and approved by myself in January 2022. Work is also ongoing to develop a funding model for Approved Housing Bodies to support them in building a pipeline of Phase Two accommodation. The funding model will be launched in the coming months. <\/p><p>- The County and City Management Association has developed and approved a Local Authority allocation key. The key allows for a distribution of applicants across the country according to population criteria.

Work to source and acquire properties will continue for the remainder of 2022.<\/p><p>- Work is also moving ahead on developing the system of income support that applicants will receive when moving into Phase Two accommodation. A policy paper has been developed and work is now proceeding to design the operational structures for the payment. <\/p><p>- The Transition Team is also developing an integration programme to support the principle of &lsquo;integration from day one&rsquo; as set out in the White Paper. In collaboration with the Local Authorities there has been a focus on designing the supports that will be required at a local level. The proposal is to expand the current model of interagency working groups and resettlement and intercultural workers that is in place for the Irish Refugee Protection Programme.  The aim is to establish a permanent integration system at local level that will provide support both to programme refugees and to applicants for international protection. Work is being finalised to determine the respective roles of Local Authorities and NGOs in delivering the new integration model<\/p><p>- Work is ongoing to launch an integration fund in the coming months which will fund civil society organisations to support the integration of International Protection applicants;<\/p><p>- A number of stakeholders meetings were held in the early part of 2022 including a briefing of the NGO sector which I was delighted to attend.

The NCCIS has greatly improved the integrity of the data collected. It has facilitated greater consistency to the interpretation of data and has provided scope for additional data to be gathered. However, there are some limitations to how the data can be interpreted, given the relative newness of this national system.<\/p>  <p>  Looking across the years 2014 to 2021 there has been a notable increase in the number of referrals received by Tusla. Referrals rose by 30% from 2014 to 2019, however there was very little increase across the years 2017 to 2019. This is of interest as mandated reporting commenced in December 2017. The introduction of the NCCIS in 2017 and 2018 may explain some of the increase observed between 2016 and the years 2017 &ndash; 2019. During that time, and with the NCCIS being new, areas were counting referrals differently. Some areas were counting all referrals received, even if they were deemed not to require a social work response, while other areas were only counting referrals that required a social work response following screening. <\/p>  <p>  There was a significant increase in referrals between 2019 (56,561) and 2020 (69,712). It is also likely that fewer referrals than expected were received in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the associated closure of schools and other services for certain periods of time. However, to understand this increase it is important to highlight the change in the methodology for counting of referrals that was introduced in 2020. This change means that since then all areas now count all referrals, including those which are screened out. This provides a better account of activity and demand on child protection and welfare services but has inflated the number of referrals. <\/p>  <p>  Analysis of the source of referrals shows an increase across the majority of sources between 2020 and 2021 and although it is difficult to say for certain, there may be particular reasons as to why. For example, an increase in referrals from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may be due to Garda&iacute; being more attuned to the issues of domestic and gender-based violence leading them to increase the number of referrals made. Increases from safeguarding officers, psychologists, teachers and some others are likely due to the increasing awareness and understanding of abuse combined with the obligations under mandatory reporting.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla has begun to collect data on re-referral and this data indicates a re-referral rate of approximately 20%, which is in line with international trends. This data indicates that for the vast majority of children and families referred to Tusla, once their interaction with the Agency is completed no further intervention is required or requested.<\/p>  <p>Given the nuances of referral data and significant changes which have occurred in recent times (i.e., introduction of NCCIS and the Covid-19 pandemic) it is difficult to comment with any certainty on the reason for increase in referrals at this time.

My Department has been allocated some &euro;70m in the National Development Plan for early learning and childcare, the majority of which has been earmarked for new places. Work is underway to update the 2001 Planning Guidelines for Early Learning and Childcare Services, in collaboration with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The new Core Funding Scheme, to roll out in September, will provide funding for services aligned to costs of delivery. This means higher levels of funding will be available to services that cater for younger children where costs of delivery are higher. I am hopefully this new approach to funding will encourage services to operate baby and toddler rooms, where demand exists. With regard to home-based early learning and childcare specifically, the National Action Plan for Childminding 2021-2028, which I published in 2021, sets out a plan for extending State support and regulation to childminding on a phased basis by 2028, with accelerated access to subsidies for childminders through the National Childcare Scheme. The Action Plan will involve opening up funding schemes to childminders, minding children in their own homes as well as providing dedicated funding to support childminders to meet registration and regulatory requirements. <\/p><p>Parents currently experiencing difficulty in relation to their early learning and childcare needs should contact their local City\/County Childcare Committee (CCC) for assistance.

Foster carers are paid a weekly allowance, which is a payment to meet the needs of the child in their care. The foster care allowance is currently &euro;325 per week for a child under 12 years of age and &euro;352 per week for a child aged 12 years and over. It is paid in respect of the child and provided in order to allow foster carers to meet all of the child's daily living needs, including food, clothing, basic travel, education costs and hobbies and sports activities. The allowance is not considered as means for social welfare purposes, and is not subject to tax. <\/p>  <p>  If required, Tusla can also provide additional financial supports to foster carers through either additional or enhanced payments. Additional payments refers to any payment made to a foster carer that exceeds the standard rate of the fostering allowance.  Such additional payments may be made in respect of children or young people who have additional needs that are not covered by the standardised fostering allowance.  Additional payments can only be made where a child has additional medical or educational needs and when authorisation has been received from the Tusla Area Manager.   Each application for an additional payment will be accompanied by supporting documentation evidencing the need.<\/p>  <p>  Enhanced allowances for foster carers can be made when a longer term financial need is identified for additional supports for the child. A maximum of twice the weekly allowance may be paid in respect of children aged between 0-18 years if they require significant care over and above the needs of other children in foster care. This includes children who have been diagnosed with significant special needs and require a high level of personal care and supervision. The purpose of considering an enhanced allowance in these cases is to support foster carers in providing care to these children who have additional needs. <\/p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is in respect of and for the benefit of the foster child and therefore must be used to meet the day to day costs associated with looking after the foster child. In considering any enhanced allowance the assessing social worker is required to evidence that the standard fostering allowance does not adequately provide for the cost of caring for the child.<\/p>  <p>  A request for enhanced supports must certified by the Principal Social Worker and approved by the Area Manager following submission of an assessment of the child&rsquo;s needs and supporting documentation.  A review arrangement for the enhanced allowance must be part of the submission for approval.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the foster care allowance, foster carers receive a number of targeted supports to ensure they continue to function as a recognised and valued part of the alternative care system. Key elements of this support include a link social worker, access to training and support group meetings and the allocation of a social worker for each child in care. Respite care for children may be arranged if it is part of their care plan.<\/p>  <p>  Pre-assessment and ongoing training are compulsory for foster carers in order to equip them with the skills and knowledge to provide high quality care. Recognising the specific dynamics and the personal nature of relative care, Tusla addresses the training needs of relatives who are foster carers separately. In addition, Tusla provides funding for the Irish Foster Care Association which offers a range of supports to carers, including advocacy, mediation, training and a telephone advice service.<\/p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is one element of the support that Tusla provides to carers when they offer a home and care to children some of whom may have additional, and sometimes significant, needs. <\/p>  <p>  The rate of the foster care allowance is kept under review by officials within the Department and at present there are no plans to change the rate. However, the Department is undertaking an extensive review of the Child Care Act 1991 and the provisions in relation foster care will form part of this review.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla have advised that they have recently engaged with foster carers in a consultation to inform the development of a Strategic Plan on Foster Care. Through this consultation, foster carers highlighted their view that the foster care allowance should be reviewed in light of inflation and increases in social welfare allowances. When the Strategic Plan on Foster Care is finalised by Tusla, it will then be considered by the Department. Any decision to review the current rate of the foster allowance shall be informed by the Tusla Plan and the consultations that have preceded it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400111#WREEE04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Childhood Care and Education","counter":2992,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400111#WREEE04600"},{"type":"question","counter":2993,"qnumday":1186,"qnumall":"[29999\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400111#WREEE04700","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"if he will advise on the assistance that can be offered to a family (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1493","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":2994,"content":"<p>The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme is a universal two-year pre-school programme available to all children within the eligible age range.

Inspection reports are published on www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/534c2-ipas-inspection-reports\/. <\/p>  <p>  As you may know, a vulnerability assessment pilot programme is overseen by a dedicated Resident Welfare Team within the IPAS of my Department. IPAS makes a written offer of a vulnerability assessment to all persons who make an application for international protection to the International Protection Office (IPO). Applicants in IPAS accommodation centres are assisted in filling out and returning letters by support services working on site, such as the Peter Mc Verry Trust and DePaul. <\/p>  <p>  Assessments begin with an initial interview with a Vulnerability Assessment Officer from the Resident Welfare Team. The purpose of these assessments is to determine if, by virtue of a particular category of vulnerability, an applicant is deemed to have special reception needs, what those needs are and what actions are required to address those needs. <\/p>  <p>  IPAS endeavour to accommodate the needs of applicants who have been deemed vulnerable within the meaning of the reception recast conditions in so far as possible, and to take all appropriate actions required to address those needs. It is the policy of IPAS to consider any identified vulnerabilities in allocating accommodation to applicants, within the overall constraints of the accommodation available. This means that it is not always possible for IPAS to address all identified vulnerabilities optimally when allocating accommodation, however where possible, IPAS will improve the alignment between accommodation and vulnerabilities as more appropriate accommodation becomes available. <\/p>  <p>  As vulnerabilities can manifest themselves at any stage of the international protection process, all applicants are advised that they can contact IPAS to discuss their needs at any stage, even if a vulnerability assessment has previously been conducted. Although the International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS) accommodation portfolio is currently operating at full capacity, IPAS is always available to deal with any complaints from residents. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, if a resident wishes to make a complaint that person should email the IPAS helpdesk directly at ipasinbox@equality.gov.ie. Where a complaint is significant in nature or a resident is not comfortable raising a complaint with a centre manager, they may make the complaint directly, or through a representative authorised to act on their behalf, to the IPAS Customer Service Team.<\/p>  <p>  There is an open and fair complaints procedure set out in the House Rules &amp;amp; Procedures Booklet for International Protection applicants. In the event that a resident is not satisfied with how their complaint is dealt with, they have full access to the services of the Ombudsman. In addition, a dedicated Customer Services Team has also been established in IPAS and, as well as strengthening the existing resident complaints system, this team will be taking a more proactive approach to dealing with residents' issues, actively engaging with residents through customer feedback mechanisms and focus groups in the months ahead.<\/p>  <p>  To provide further support to all residents, a confidential Freephone telephone support service is available. The Freephone helpline is operated by the Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS). If a resident wishes, a complaint made through this service may be passed, in confidence, to IPAS for investigation and resolution. All residents have access to this independent support helpline. IPAS is working to facilitate clinics at centres, in line with public health restrictions. The Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) helpline contact number is 1800 929 00 or you can email: info@jrs.ie.<\/p>  <p>  While the system is under considerable pressure because of accommodation scarcity, IPAS is working actively to seek to mitigate negative impacts for those currently accommodated by it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400112#WRFFF01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services","counter":3019,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400112#WRFFF01900"},{"type":"question","counter":3020,"qnumday":1195,"qnumall":"[30210\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400112#WRFFF02000","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 14 of 2 June 2022, the expected timeframe for the conclusion of the review of existing transport schemes for disabled persons including the drivers and\u00a0passengers\u00a0with\u00a0disabilities scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1513","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":3021,"content":"<p>The Transport Working Group of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS) commits that a review will be conducted of existing transport schemes, and a coordinated plan will be developed to enhance the options for transport to work or employment for people with disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  Following engagement from my colleague the Minister of Finance Paschal Donohoe T.D. last year, it was decided to use the Transport Working Group to assist with the review of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers Scheme.

A recent review of the NCS showed that: <\/p>  <p>  - 38% of families had more than half of their early learning and childcare costs covered by the NCS; <\/p>  <p>  - 56% of families had more money to spend due to the scheme; and  <\/p>  <p>  - 28% of families were working more because of NCS, with 8% reporting that they would not be in work without it. <\/p>  <p>  I recognise however that the burden on some families remains high and we need to do more to ensure affordability and accessibility. The major programmes funded by my Department that contribute to affordability and accessibility for parents include the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Programme, the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) and the National Childcare Scheme (NCS).<\/p>  <p>  The universal ECCE pre-school programme provides for free access to early learning and childcare for 15 hours per week for the two years before children start primary school.  This significantly offsets the costs to parents of early learning and childcare at this stage.<\/p>  <p>  An estimated 95% children in the relevant age cohort participate in this programme.<\/p>  <p>  The Access and Inclusion Model provides a range of both universal and targeted measures, to support children with disabilities to take part in the ECCE pre-school programme in mainstream settings, and to help make pre-school services more accessible and inclusive &ndash; benefiting all children in those services.<\/p>  <p>  The NCS provides universal and income-assessed subsidies to parents. A universal subsidy for children up to three is available for up to 45 hours per week.  An income-assessed subsidy is available for children of all ages for up to 45 hours per week, the level of which is determined by the family&rsquo;s income.  The NCS is designed to be highly inclusive and to meet the needs of those families who need it the most. The NCS is based on the principle of progressive universalism and has regard to the best interests of children.<\/p>  <p>  An Expert Group to develop a new funding model for the early learning and childcare sector examined the current model and made recommendations to Government in December which were accepted in full. This new funding model is now beginning to be implemented to improve quality, affordability, sustainability and accessibility of services.<\/p>  <p>  The package of measures for the sector announced in Budget 2022 was informed by the Expert Group recommendations. The package includes a new Core Funding stream valued at up to &euro;221 million in a full year. Making early learning and childcare more affordable to parents and improving quality including through better terms and conditions for the workforce are key objectives of Core Funding, along with improving services' sustainability. <\/p>  <p>  A central condition of Core Funding is that providers agree not to increase fees above those which were charged last year. This will give parents greater certainty about what they will be charged and ensure that increases to NCS subsidies are not absorbed by fee increases. The approach to fee management will be developed further over time. <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2022 extended universal NCS subsidies for children of all ages up to 15 and this will come into effect for the new programme year.  Budget 2022 also changed how &lsquo;wraparound hours&rsquo; for NCS subsidies are determined, essentially offering greater numbers of subsidised hours to families where not all parents are in work or study.

Foster carers are paid a weekly allowance, which is a payment to meet the needs of the child in their care. The foster care allowance is currently &euro;325 per week for a child under 12 years of age and &euro;352 per week for a child aged 12 years and over. It is paid in respect of the child and provided in order to allow foster carers to meet all of the child's daily living needs, including food, clothing, basic travel, education costs and hobbies and sports activities. The allowance is not considered as means for social welfare purposes, and is not subject to tax.  <\/p>  <p>  If required, Tusla can also provide additional financial supports to foster carers through either additional or enhanced payments.<\/p>  <p>  Additional payments refers to any payment made to a foster carer that exceeds the standard rate of the fostering allowance.  Such additional payments may be made in respect of children or young people who have additional needs that are not covered by the standardised fostering allowance.  Additional payments can only be made where a child has additional medical or educational needs and when authorisation has been received from the Tusla Area Manager.   Each application for an additional payment will be accompanied by supporting documentation evidencing the need.<\/p>  <p>  Enhanced allowances for foster carers can be made when a longer term financial need is identified for additional supports for the child. A maximum of twice the weekly allowance may be paid in respect of children aged between 0-18 years if they require significant care over and above the needs of other children in foster care.  This includes children who have been diagnosed with significant special needs and require a high level of personal care and supervision.  The purpose of considering an enhanced allowance in these cases is to support foster carers in providing care to these children who have additional needs.  <\/p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is in respect of and for the benefit of the foster child and therefore must be used to meet the day to day costs associated with looking after the foster child. In considering any enhanced allowance the assessing social worker is required to evidence that the standard fostering allowance does not adequately provide for the cost of caring for the child.<\/p>  <p>  A request for enhanced supports must certified by the Principal Social Worker and approved by the Area Manager following submission of an assessment of the child&rsquo;s needs and supporting documentation.  A review arrangement for the enhanced allowance must be part of the submission for approval.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the foster care allowance, foster carers receive a number of targeted supports to ensure they continue to function as a recognised and valued part of the alternative care system. Key elements of this support include a link social worker, access to training and support group meetings and the allocation of a social worker for each child in care. Respite care for children may be arranged if it is part of their care plan.<\/p>  <p>  Pre-assessment and ongoing training are compulsory for foster carers in order to equip them with the skills and knowledge to provide high quality care. Recognising the specific dynamics and the personal nature of relative care, Tusla addresses the training needs of relatives who are foster carers separately. In addition, Tusla provides funding for the Irish Foster Care Association which offers a range of supports to carers, including advocacy, mediation, training and a telephone advice service.<\/p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is one element of the support that Tusla provides to carers when they offer a home and care to children some of whom may have additional, and sometimes significant, needs. <\/p>  <p>  The rate of the foster care allowance is kept under review by officials within the Department and at present there are no plans to change the rate. However, the Department is undertaking an extensive review of the Child Care Act 1991 and will examine foster care arrangements as part of this review.   <\/p>  <p>  Further, Tusla has advised that they have recently engaged with foster carers in a consultation to inform the development of a Strategic Plan on Foster Care. Through this consultation, foster carers highlighted their view that the foster care allowance should be reviewed in light of inflation and increases in social welfare allowances. Once the Strategic Plan on Foster Care is finalised by Tusla, it will then be considered by the Department. Any decision to review the current rate of the foster allowance shall be informed by the Tusla Plan and the consultations that have preceded it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400112#WRFFF03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mother and Baby Homes Inquiries","counter":3039,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400112#WRFFF03900"},{"type":"question","counter":3040,"qnumday":1204,"qnumall":"[30718\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400112#WRFFF04000","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"if there are plans to make the enhanced medical card scheme available for those who spent time in mother and baby homes (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1600","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":3041,"content":"<p>In March, I secured Government approval for the Heads of Bill for the Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme.

The decision to provide an enhanced medical card to those who spent 6 months or more in an institution was taken by Government as it is felt that those who spent longest in these institutions will likely have endured more negative impacts on their health and wellbeing and are also more likely to be at the older end of the broad spectrum of survivors.

We recognise that the quality of our researchers is fundamental to the quality of our research system and its collaboration with partners in industry and policymakers, both in Ireland and abroad. The strategy also highlights the need to foster an environment within the research and innovation community that supports our ambition to be an Island of Inclusion and Engagement.<\/p><p>A stipend is a well-established feature of funded postgraduate awards globally, providing an income to the awardee in recognition of the need to devote themselves on a full-time basis to their research. My Department&rsquo;s agency, the Higher Education Authority (HEA) does not currently collect data on the costs of PhD stipends to higher education institutions. <\/p><p>With regard to the total cost of stipends to higher education institutions and their average value, there are many ways in which PhD education is financed. By way of illustration, the most recent Higher Education Expenditure on Research and Development (HERD) Survey 2018\/19 carried out by my Department, found that there were 10,044 research students (doctoral and masters by research) in 2018, of which 3,901 (39%) were fully self-funded. The majority of PhD students are in receipt of grants from their individual institutions and other research funders such as the Irish Research Council (IRC), Science Foundation Ireland (SFI).  <\/p><p>Our priority under <i>Impact 2030<\/i>is to ensure a consistent research student experience, regardless of funding source.  This reflects the National Framework for Doctoral Education which is being advanced by the associated National Advisory Forum which is co-chaired by two of my agencies: the Higher Education Authority and Quality and Qualifications Ireland. <\/p><p>My Department monitors the issue of stipends, in the context of the resources available to the competitive research funding agencies under the aegis of my Department and the competing needs to which they can be allocated. In that regard, I was pleased to be able to allocate additional funding to the IRC in 2021 to enable it to increase postgraduate scholarships by &euro;2,500 per annum, or 16%, from &euro;16,000 to &euro;18,500. This was made effective from 1 January 2021 and, together with an increase to funding for postdoctoral salaries, benefited close to 1,300 early-career researchers in the system. The move also aligned the stipend level for both competitive funding agencies within my Department, i.e. the IRC and SFI.<\/p><p>Under the Student Grant Scheme 2021, a student in receipt of a postgraduate research award where the stipend portion of the award does not exceed &euro;18,500 may apply to the centralised student grant awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) for financial assistance under the Student Grant Scheme 2021.<\/p><p>Other research funders in the national system include the Health Research Board and Teagasc. There are also typically a number of PhDs funded through European Programmes and individual HEI schemes. My Department allocates recurrent funding to the HEA for direct disbursement to HEA designated higher education institutions. The HEA allocates this funding as a block grant to the institutions and as autonomous bodies, the internal disbursement of this funding is a matter for the individual institution.<\/p><p>Research students in receipt of grants must comply with the terms of their funding award from these bodies, which can vary from funder to funder.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400116#WRKKK04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Justice and Equality","counter":3240,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400117#WRLLL00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residency Permits","counter":3239,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400117#WRLLL00150"},{"type":"question","counter":3240,"qnumday":1280,"qnumall":"[31147\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400117#WRLLL00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of persons who exited Ireland's ports and airports in the past month that were stamp 2 visa holders and whose permissions were due to expire at midnight 31 May 2022; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The scope of the Treatment of Persons in Custody Regulations in 1987 was focused on the creation and maintenance of the custody record. The regulations provide that a parent, guardian, spouse, relative or other responsible person can be contacted, where appropriate, when a person with a disability (as referred to in the Regulations) is arrested.<\/p>  <p>  In order to safeguard the rights of adult detainees who the member in charge suspects or knows to have an invisible disability, Regulation 22(2) expressly provides that where the member in charge arranges for the presence of &ldquo;some other responsible adult other than a member&rdquo;,\u00a0the responsible adult should, where practicable, be a person who has appropriate experience.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that the Garda Human Rights Section conducted a review of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Custody Record Risk Assessment Form to evaluate its effectiveness.\u00a0The recommendations made following this review have been considered in line with the obligations of Ireland pursuant to Article 13 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), to furnish persons with a disability with effective access to justice on an equal basis with others, and to provide them with appropriate special facilities where necessary to allow them to realise this right.<\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently in the process of compiling a revised Risk and Vulnerability Assessment to further their commitment to safeguarding the rights and needs of any person who is vulnerable or has a disability. This will ensure a consistent approach to the provision of supports and services for vulnerable people interacting with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, protecting their Human Rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400118#WRMMM04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"question","counter":3332,"qnumday":1311,"qnumall":"[29568\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400118#WRMMM04200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will report to the Houses of the Oireachtas the number of persons under the age of 18 years in 2019, 2020, 2021 and this year to date who informed the arresting member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and-or the member-in-charge of the Garda station that they were transported to, that they had ADHD or that they were a vulnerable person, were strip searched without the presence of an appropriate adult; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1452","askee":"1502"},{"type":"question","counter":3333,"qnumday":1312,"qnumall":"[29569\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400118#WRMMM04300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will report to the Houses of the Oireachtas the number of persons under the age of 18 years in 2019, 2020, 2021 and this year to date who informed the arresting member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and-or the member-in-charge of the Garda station that they were transported to, that they had ADHD or were a vulnerable person, were strip searched in the presence of an appropriate adult, and can the breakdown of the information be provided per Garda division; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1452","askee":"1502"},{"type":"question","counter":3334,"qnumday":1313,"qnumall":"[29570\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400118#WRMMM04400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will report to the Houses of the Oireachtas the number of persons under the age of 18 years in 2019, 2020, 2021 and this year to date who informed the arresting member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and-or the member-in-charge of the Garda station that they were transported to, that they had ADHD or were a vulnerable person, were assaulted while in the custody of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, by Garda division; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1452","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":3335,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1311 to 1313, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware there are a series of procedural safeguards in place with regard to the treatment in custody and questioning of children under the Criminal Justice Act 1984 (Treatment of Persons in Custody in Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Stations) Regulations, 1987, and the Children Act, 2001.<\/p><p>Any breaches of these provisions would be a very serious matter and if the Deputy is aware of any individuals who have been subject to such breaches, I would strongly encourage them to contact either the Garda Commissioner or the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda Commissioner is responsible by law for the management and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including operational policing matters.

If at any time a prisoner displays any signs and symptoms of hepatitis they are reviewed by a member of the Prison Healthcare Team and managed appropriately. <\/p>  <p>  The National Hepatitis C Strategy and Treatment Programme aims to provide fair and equitable treatment in a timely manner to all those who require Hepatitis C treatment. In that regard, a number of treatment models have been developed, including\u00a0a hospital treatment model and a community treatment model. If a prisoner, in any prison, requires treatment for Hepatitis C they are referred to specialist services in the acute hospital sector and necessary treatment is provided under the hospital treatment\u00a0model, by relevant specialist clinical teams.<\/p>  <p>  To support this model of service for those in the custody of the Prison Service, specific arrangements for the screening and treatment of Hepatitis C are in place in a number of prisons (Wheatfield, Cloverhill, Mountjoy, Dochas Centre\u00a0and Midlands), whereby in-reach Hepatology services are provided on site in those prisons, by specialist teams from St James&rsquo;s Hospital. In the remaining prisons, those requiring treatment attend the specialist services in the hospital setting.<\/p>  <p>  The Prison Service\u00a0continues to work with the HSE and the National Clinical Hepatitis C Lead to develop and implement\u00a0a prison treatment model of care, which will replicate the community treatment model in\u00a0a prison setting, initially in those prisons where this service is currently not available. This will facilitate the provision of treatment, to those who meet the criteria for that model of care, by the primary healthcare team in the prison. <\/p>  <p>  Arrangements were agreed to progress a pilot prison treatment model in Cork Prison but unfortunately, due to resource issues, it was not possible to progress the pilot as planned.

However, my Department endeavours to deal with them as closely as possible to chronological order. The initial registration and assessment of applications are dealt with chronologically, however, depending on the information provided and the timing of responses for additional or missing documentation, applications may not then be concluded chronologically. <\/p><p>Given the volume of new applications received in the last two and a half years and the issues caused by the pandemic, the volume of cases backlogged had increased exponentially. However, steps have been taken by my Department to address this and to mitigate the risk of something similar happening again. <\/p><p>The EU Treaty Rights Division of my Department have implemented a two pronged approach, whereby one team processes backlogged cases as a priority and a second team processes new applications chronologically to ensure they do not add to the backlog. This ensures that older cases are getting resolved as quickly as possible, while ensuring new applications received, where all information is provided, do not exceed the six month statutory time limit. <\/p><p>This new approach has led to a marked increase in decisions made by the Permanent Residence Unit and a significant reduction in backlogged cases and the number of days applicants are waiting for a decision.<\/p><p>Applicants for Permanent Residence are advised to submit their applications six months before the expiry date of their current permission. Therefore, in most cases, the issue of a temporary stamp 4 is not necessary immediately. However, in cases where an applicant requires a temporary stamp 4 while their application is being considered, this will issue within two weeks of receipt of the application and is valid for an initial period of nine months. <\/p><p>Applicants who hold a registered temporary stamp 4 are eligible to leave and re-enter the State, subject to any visa requirements that may be attributable either in the State to which they are travelling or on their return to this State. Applicants should advise the EU Treaty Rights Division of any intended absence from the State during this period as correspondence may issue or further documents may be sought in relation to their application. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400120#WROOO01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3411,"content":"<p>Question No. 1339 answered with Question No. 1338.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3412,"content":"<p>Question No. 1340 answered with Question No. 1338.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3413,"content":"<p>Question No. 1341 answered with Question No. 1338.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na","counter":3414,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400120#WROOO01900"},{"type":"question","counter":3415,"qnumday":1342,"qnumall":"[30307\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400120#WROOO02000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of garda&iacute; assigned to three garda stations (details supplied), broken down by rank in each of the years 2016 to 2021, respectively.","asker":"1466","askee":"1502"},{"type":"question","counter":3416,"qnumday":1343,"qnumall":"[30308\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400120#WROOO02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of garda&iacute; currently assigned to three garda stations (details supplied), broken down by rank.","asker":"1466","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":3417,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1342 and 1343 together.<\/p><p>The Government is committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources it needs, with the unprecedented allocation provided in Budget 2022 of over &euro;2 billion.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which includes decisions on the deployment of personnel among the various Garda Divisions.

Feedback from applicants is taken on board and, as a result, a much more simplified, customer-focused and streamlined mechanism for applicants to provide their proofs of residence has recently been introduced.\u00a0<\/p><p>To further speed up the processing of applications, a number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times. Additional staff have also been assigned to the citizenship team.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>Since the beginning of this year, new applicants for citizenship no longer have to submit their original passport with their application. Instead, they can provide a full colour copy of their entire passport, including the front and back covers. This change in practice is welcomed by our customers and is also freeing up valuable staff time that up to now has been engaged in returning passports to applicants.<\/p><p>I am also pleased to confirm that my Department will host the first in-person citizenship ceremony since the pandemic on 20 June 2022, with further ceremonies scheduled in December 2022, in Killarney. <table>    <tr>

","asker":"1584","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":3514,"content":"<p>The continued disruption of the supply of all illicit drugs remains a priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the other State agencies tasked with responsibilities in this regard. A concerted effort has been made over the past two years to ensure that the detection and prevention of these types of criminal activity have not been adversely affected by the unprecedented demands placed on policing services by the vital enforcement of public health restrictions.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including Garda operations aimed at preventing and countering criminal activity, and the enforcement of legislation pertaining to illegal drugs. As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters.<\/p>  <p>  Given the global nature of the drugs trade, international law enforcement co-operation remains a key element in the overall response. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has strong and strategic partnerships in place at international level targeting drug trafficking, including working closely with relevant law enforcement agencies such as INTERPOL and Europol and participating in the Maritime Analysis Operations Centre for Narcotics (MAOC-N) based in Lisbon.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard,\u00a0I also wish to acknowledge the work of the Garda&iacute; in harnessing an international coalition of support to tackle the criminality associated with the Kinahan Organised Crime Group. The enforcement of sanctions demonstrates the tremendous value and power of international co-operation in tackling organised crime and the actions taken recently send a very clear message to those involved in the gang, or associated with the gang, that criminality will not go unnoticed or unpunished.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GNDOCB) is having significant success in disrupting drug trafficking and the supply of illicit drugs by organised crime groups.\u00a0The success is evident by the nationwide results of Operation Tara,\u00a0which has a focus to disrupt, dismantle and prosecute drug trafficking networks at all levels - international, national and local - involved in the importation, distribution, cultivation, production, local sale and supply of controlled drugs. The Bureau&rsquo;s work is supported by Divisional Drugs Units nationwide, and by all Garda&iacute; working in local communities. GNDOCB also works closely and productively with international law enforcement partners.\u00a0Garda&iacute; continue to work closely with local authorities, the HSE, NGOs, community groups and other State agencies to tackle drug related harms.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that the Department of Health leads on Government policy in the area of drugs, including drug rehabilitation programmes, and this policy is guided by the\u00a0national drugs and alcohol strategy\u00a0\"Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery - a health-led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017-2025\". This strategy represents a whole-of-Government response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland. While implementation of the strategy is led by the Department of Health, the strategy includes actions for all stakeholders, including my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The strategy recognises the need for a balanced health-led approach\u00a0- reducing demand, while also reducing access to illegal drugs - and is aimed at\u00a0reducing the number of people criminalised for the possession of drugs for personal use.\u00a0While this strategy supports vulnerable people who use drugs, it is also matched with strengthened enforcement measures across Government to tackle the supply of illegal drugs. Sustained action by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continued unabated throughout the pandemic,\u00a0bringing\u00a0significant\u00a0convictions and ongoing seizures of drugs, firearms and ammunition.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, my Department is also taking a range of actions designed to break the link between criminal gangs and the children they seek to recruit. This includes the enactment of new criminal legislation which will outlaw the grooming of children to commit crime. I also intend to bring forward legislation shortly which will increase the sentence of conspiracy to murder from ten years to life in prison. These new laws will ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and our Courts have the tools they need to take firm and decisive action to deal with our most serious criminals.\u00a0In addition, we will continue to roll out the Greentown initiative\u00a0which is designed to target those children most at risk of being recruited by criminal gangs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400122#WRQQQ02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":3516,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400122#WRQQQ02300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services","counter":3515,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400122#WRQQQ02200"},{"type":"question","counter":3516,"qnumday":1378,"qnumall":"[29593\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400122#WRQQQ02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of staff employed in the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Youth Programme in Dublin 22; and the number of children who have accessed this service in 2019, 2020, 2021 and to date in 2022.

The NMBI has a number of statutory obligations to protect the integrity of the practice of the professions of nursing and midwifery, and to protect the public.  These obligations include:<\/p><p>- maintaining the Register of Nurses &amp;amp; Midwives, <\/p><p>- setting the standards for the education and training of nurses and midwives, <\/p><p>- approving programmes of education necessary for registration and specialisms and monitoring of these programmes on an ongoing basis, <\/p><p>- supporting registrants by providing appropriate guidance on professional conduct and ethics for both registered nurses and midwives, and <\/p><p>- conducting inquiries into complaints about registrants. <\/p><p>On 1 November 2021, there were 81,331 nurses and midwives on the NMBI Register.  This is the highest ever number and is 2,003 or 2.5% above the 01 November 2020 figure of 79,328 registrants. NMBI intends shortly to publish more granular details from the Register based on the data from the 2021 renewal cycle. This will provide the most up-to-date and accurate view of the Register.<\/p><p>In recent years, the NMBI had been dealing with an increasing volume of overseas applications to the Register. This, along with the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic and the work involved in transitioning to a new digital registration system (MyNMBI) had led to a backlog in processing overseas (non-EU) registration applications. <\/p><p>Over the past number of months, my Department has been actively engaged with the NMBI to reduce this backlog and to ensure a more streamlined process for managing overseas applications. A key milestone in the registration process is the applicant attaining a Decision Letters (DLs) from the NMBI. This allows the applicant to apply for the necessary visa, required so that they can take the final steps to secure registration. <\/p><p>The NMBI recognises the importance of prompt processing of all applications for registration, particularly in the current climate where additional staffing is required around the country. Intensive efforts are continuing to expedite the processing of these overseas applications and several new measures are being undertaken by NMBI including: <\/p><p>- Additional resources, including staffing. Currently, there are 26 staff in the NMBI&rsquo;s Registrationdepartment; in 2021 there were 14 staff members,<\/p><p>- Process improvements, <\/p><p>- Applicant input and collaboration, <\/p><p>- Updated NMBI guidance, and <\/p><p>- Stakeholder communication and collaboration.  <\/p><p>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that these measures are having a positive effect across the various stages of the process with the increase in the number of DLs in particular demonstrating this.  In 2021, 2,430 DLs issued to overseas applicants, and year to date in 2022, NMBI has issued 2,253 DLs. This means that the backlog in processing overseas applications has been greatly reduced. The NMBI is now forecasting that it will issue over 5,000 DLs in 2022.  The NMBI has now reported to my Department that currently, complete applications can be processed within 90 days, which is in accordance with its key performance indicator for these applications.<\/p><p>Along with the NMBI, I welcome registration applications from those nurses and midwives who were educated overseas as they seek to join the health service workforce in the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400123#WRRRR01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Practitioner Services","counter":3562,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400123#WRRRR01700"},{"type":"question","counter":3563,"qnumday":1393,"qnumall":"[28909\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400123#WRRRR01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the rules that are in place in relation to general practitioners charging medical card holders to conduct blood tests; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1469","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3564,"content":"<p>Under the terms of the current GMS contract, GPs are required to provide eligible patients with ''all proper and necessary treatment of a kind usually undertaken by a general practitioner and not requiring special skill or experience of a degree or kind which general practitioners cannot reasonably be expected to possess\".

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Omicron variants.<\/p><p>The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.<\/p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.<\/p><p>The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, which was launched on the 25th of February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists.<\/p><p>The plan builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly.<\/p><p>This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting Lis Task Force. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.<\/p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list programme, which is currently under development in the Department of Health.

This increase ensures that a greater proportion of those aged 70 and over now qualify for a medical card.<\/p>  <p>  In certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. <\/p>  <p>  In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card. Since 2015, every individual aged 70 and over has automatic eligibility for a GP visit card.<\/p>  <p>  It is my intention that the next stage of the phased expansion of GP care without fees to all children aged 12 years and under, namely, the provision of GP care without fees to all children aged 6 and 7, will be commenced this year.

The DPS is not means tested and is available to anyone normally resident in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  On 1 January 2022, the DPS threshold was reduced to &euro;100 per month. On 1 March 2022, the DPS threshold was further reduced the DPS threshold to &euro;80. The DPS significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines. The combined effect of those two reductions in the DPS threshold will be an annual minimum saving of &euro;408, or 30%, for any individual or household that regularly exceeded the 2021 threshold of &euro;114. In addition, there have been almost 37,000 additional claimants under the DPS since these reductions were introduced.<\/p>  <p>  The Long Term Illness (LTI) scheme was established under Section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970 (as amended). Regulations prescribed 16 illnesses covered by the scheme. Under the LTI Scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. Prescription charges do not apply to persons who qualify for the LTI scheme.<\/p>  <p>  A review of the current eligibility framework, including the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, is to be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy.

The report, &ldquo;National Approaches to Regulating Health and Social Care Professions&rdquo;,  examines the approaches to the regulation of health and social care professionals internationally and is publicly available on the Department&rsquo;s website  (www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/ea62b-national-approaches-to-regulating-health-and-social-care-professions\/). <\/p>  <p>  My officials are in the process of drawing from this report and other relevant sources in the development of policy for the regulation of health and social care professionals into the future.k<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400126#WRUUU04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff","counter":3759,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400126#WRUUU04200"},{"type":"question","counter":3760,"qnumday":1454,"qnumall":"[29186\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400126#WRUUU04300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 740 of 10 May 2022, if he will provide a breakdown of vacant posts by profession and by detail of area\/team which these 16 vacancies relate to within the four children&rsquo;s disability network teams in County Wexford in tabular form.","asker":"1621","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":3761,"qnumday":1455,"qnumall":"[29187\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400126#WRUUU04400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 740 of 10 May 2022, the number of the 26 new posts for children&rsquo;s disability network teams in CHO5 will go to teams in County Wexford; the professions to be included in the allocation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1621","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3762,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1454 and 1455 together.<\/p><p>As these are service matters, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400126#WRUUU04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3763,"content":"<p>Question No. 1455 answered with Question No. 1454.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dental Services ","counter":3764,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400126#WRUUU04700"},{"type":"question","counter":3765,"qnumday":1456,"qnumall":"[29196\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400126#WRUUU04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the actions that he is taking to ensure that persons with an intellectual disability and who are medical card holders have access to dental services; the reasons that some dental practices in County Kilkenny are refusing medical card holders; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1496","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3766,"content":"<p>I am aware that over the last couple of years a number of contracted dentists have chosen to opt out of the Dental Treatment Services Scheme and that medical card patients in some parts of the country have been experiencing problems in accessing dental services. <\/p>  <p>  In order to address these issues I secured an additional &euro;10 million in Budget 2022, which has provided for expanded dental health care for medical card holders. To address the concerns of contractors about the viability of the Scheme, I am also using an estimated &euro;16 million of an underspend in this year&rsquo;s estimate allocation (&euro;56 million) to award fee increases across a number of items including fillings and restorations. These measures, introduced on 1st May, are designed to address immediate concerns with the Scheme, pending a more substantive reform of dental services to align with the National Oral Health Policy. I hope that this substantial additional investment in the Scheme will encourage more and more dentists to provide care to medical card patients.

This will greatly improve the potential to monitor rare-disease prevalence in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The General Scheme is currently being prepared for submission to Government in October 2022. Although national registries are envisioned as a function of the National Health Information Centre (NHIC) for secondary data purposes, no costings have as yet been completed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400128#WRWWW03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products","counter":3863,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400128#WRWWW03600"},{"type":"question","counter":3864,"qnumday":1489,"qnumall":"[29414\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400128#WRWWW03700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the estimated cost of making dexcoms or similar continuous glucose monitors available on the long-term Illness scheme for all those living with type 1 diabetes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1507","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3865,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400128#WRWWW03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Cards","counter":3866,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400128#WRWWW03900"},{"type":"question","counter":3867,"qnumday":1490,"qnumall":"[29417\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400128#WRWWW04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question Nos. 195 and 196 of 1 June 2022, the range of services for which a medical card provides a discount but does not cover fully, such as but not limited to diagnostic services to which a patient is referred; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3868,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400128#WRWWW04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":3869,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400128#WRWWW04200"},{"type":"question","counter":3870,"qnumday":1491,"qnumall":"[29422\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400128#WRWWW04300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when an urgent hospital appointment for a person (details supplied) will be facilitated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3871,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

Ireland views Hepatitis C as a public health threat and is committed to the WHO target of eliminating it by 2030. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE established a National Hepatitis C Treatment Programme (NHCTP) in 2015 and began the process of providing treatment for Hepatitis C using Directly Acting Antivirals to patients prioritised according to clinical need. <\/p>  <p>  Since 2016, the HSE in its National Service Plans has committed to the continued implementation of a multi annual public health plan for the therapeutic treatment across a range of healthcare settings to all persons living with Hepatitis C in Ireland. The NHCTP goal is to make hepatitis C a rare disease in Ireland by 2026, and in accordance with the WHO target, to eliminate it in Ireland by 2030. In order to achieve this, the NHCTP has been allocated funding of &euro;25m each year.<\/p>  <p>  The NHCTP works in partnership with the Irish Prison Service nationally, and with Hospital and community teams, to provide outreach to all prisoners that require treatment for Hepatitis C.<\/p>  <p>  Since its inception in 2015, the NHCTP has treated over 6,600 patients with Hepatitis C virus. The focus has been in the east of the country as the evidence to date has indicated that this is where the highest population needing Hepatitis C treatment has resided. The NHCTP&rsquo;s Community Prescribing Project has been developed to widen the availability of the Hepatitis C treatment to enable GPs to treat people who are on opioid substitution treatment across the country. The Community Prescribing Project will expand in the future to be available for people not on the opioid substitution treatment scheme. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, an online home testing option is currently being scoped by the NHCTP and will expand the testing and treatment to people who are currently undiagnosed. It is anticipated that this will be available later this year. The NHCTP will utilise all possible treatment options and the medical needs of individuals identified will dictate which care pathway is best. Treatment will remain free to people regardless of where the service is delivered. The NHCTP will develop a communication plan to support the rollout of the home testing service later this year.  This communication plan will also aim to destigmatise the testing and treatment associated with Hepatitis C.<\/p>  <p>  The NHCTP reports that it is very much still on track to eliminate the Hepatitis C virus in Ireland by 2030. <\/p>  <p>  The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) conducted a Health Technology Assessment regarding the feasibility of national birth cohort screening for the Hepatitis C virus. HIQA published the results of that Health Technology Assessment in 2021. It recommended a national program of birth cohort testing for Hepatitis C for people in Ireland born between 1965 and 1985.<\/p>  <p>  In collaboration with HIQA, the NHCTP is currently carrying out a national sero-prevalence study to estimate the prevalence of Hepatitis C virus infection in that Irish birth cohort (i.e., those born between 1965 and 1985).  The study is being carried out using residual sera from tests sent in by general practitioners (GPs). To date 6,000 samples have been analysed and the results are expected by the end of July 2022. This study will give indications of what percentage of the population have the Hepatitis C virus, but all indications are that the remaining number of people to be treated are low.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400129#WRXXX01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":3897,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400129#WRXXX01400"},{"type":"question","counter":3898,"qnumday":1500,"qnumall":"[29469\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400129#WRXXX01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress in implementing social prescribing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":3899,"qnumday":1501,"qnumall":"[29470\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400129#WRXXX01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will implement a self-referral system for social prescribing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":3900,"qnumday":1502,"qnumall":"[29471\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400129#WRXXX01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will implement a digital solution for social prescribing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3901,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1500, 1501 and 1502 together.<\/p><p>Social prescribing is a means of enabling healthcare professionals and other professionals to refer people to a range of local, non-clinical services provided by the voluntary and community sector.

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975, prescribing 16 illnesses covered by the scheme. These are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.<\/p>  <p>  Under the LTI scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge.<\/p>  <p>  While there are no current plans to extend the list of illnesses covered, the LTI scheme will be included in a review of the current eligibility framework, including the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, to be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy. It is not possible to say at this juncture what the results of this review will be.<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, for those who are not deemed eligible for the LTI scheme, there are other arrangements which protect them from excessive medicine costs.  <\/p>  <p>  Under the Drugs Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;80 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.<\/p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. Medical card eligibility is primarily based on an assessment of means and is not granted on the basis of any particular condition.<\/p>  <p>  In certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge.  <\/p>  <p>  Individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses. This includes medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant.

However, Section 39 organisations are privately owned and run, and staff in these organisations are not public servants. Their terms and conditions of employment, once in line with employment legislation, are strictly between the employer and the employee. <\/p>  <p>  In 2018, the HSE conducted a data gathering exercise in relation to an agreed list of 50 pilot organisations. The results of this analysis formed the basis of an engagement, facilitated by the Workplace Relations Commission. It showed that of those that returned data, different measures were taken in different organisations to achieve savings &ndash; in some places pay was cut, in others pay was not cut. In a number of instances, pay had already been restored.<\/p>  <p>  An agreement was reached by the parties in October 2018, in relation to a process of pay restoration for staff employed by the 50 pilot agencies. Pay restoration commenced in April 2019 with an annual pay increase of up to &euro;1,000.  Any outstanding balance was paid in 2020 and 2021. A further WRC engagement followed in December 2020 in relation to a final phase of 250 organisations who were identified as part of the earlier agreement. A payment arrangement consisting of three phases was agreed with the first two payments to be made in 2021, and the third and final payment due to be made in 2023.<\/p>  <p>  Pay restoration was applicable to Section 39 organisations who met certain criteria, rather than types of individual workers that are employed in them. Eligible Section 39 organisations included only agencies that had service arrangements in place back in 2013 and that were still under service arrangements in 2019. Only organisations who received in excess of an agreed, specified amount from the HSE by way of the Service Level Agreement process were included.  <\/p>  <p>  Pay restoration is absolutely limited and only applicable to those included in the initial WRC agreement. There is no scope to revisit the eligibility criteria for the process and that the process has reached a final resolution.

Ireland views Hepatitis C as a public health threat and is committed to the WHO target of eliminating it by 2030. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE established a National Hepatitis C Treatment Programme (NHCTP) in 2015 and began the process of providing treatment for Hepatitis C using Directly Acting Antivirals to patients prioritised according to clinical need. <\/p>  <p>  Since 2016, the HSE in its National Service Plans has committed to the continued implementation of a multi annual public health plan for the therapeutic treatment across a range of healthcare settings to all persons living with Hepatitis C in Ireland. The NHCTP goal is to make hepatitis C a rare disease in Ireland by 2026, and in accordance with the WHO target, to eliminate it in Ireland by 2030. In order to achieve this, the NHCTP has been allocated funding of &euro;25m each year.<\/p>  <p>  The NHCTP works in partnership with the Irish Prison Service nationally, and with Hospital and community teams, to provide outreach to all prisoners that require treatment for Hepatitis C.<\/p>  <p>  Since its inception in 2015, the NHCTP has treated over 6,600 patients with Hepatitis C virus. The focus has been in the east of the country as the evidence to date has indicated that this is where the highest population needing Hepatitis C treatment has resided. The NHCTP&rsquo;s Community Prescribing Project has been developed to widen the availability of the Hepatitis C treatment to enable GPs to treat people who are on opioid substitution treatment across the country. The Community Prescribing Project will expand in the future to be available for people not on the opioid substitution treatment scheme. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, an online home testing option is currently being scoped by the NHCTP and will expand the testing and treatment to people who are currently undiagnosed. It is anticipated that this will be available later this year. The NHCTP will utilise all possible treatment options and the medical needs of individuals identified will dictate which care pathway is best. Treatment will remain free to people regardless of where the service is delivered. The NHCTP will develop a communication plan to support the rollout of the home testing service later this year.  This communication plan will also aim to destigmatise the testing and treatment associated with Hepatitis C.<\/p>  <p>  The NHCTP reports that it is very much still on track to eliminate the Hepatitis C virus in Ireland by 2030. <\/p>  <p>  The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) conducted a Health Technology Assessment regarding the feasibility of national birth cohort screening for the Hepatitis C virus. HIQA published the results of that Health Technology Assessment in 2021. It recommended a national program of birth cohort testing for Hepatitis C for people in Ireland born between 1965 and 1985.<\/p>  <p>  In collaboration with HIQA, the NHCTP is currently carrying out a national sero-prevalence study to estimate the prevalence of Hepatitis C virus infection in that Irish birth cohort (i.e., those born between 1965 and 1985).  The study is being carried out using residual sera from tests sent in by general practitioners (GPs). To date 6,000 samples have been analysed and the results are expected by the end of July 2022. This study will give indications of what percentage of the population have the Hepatitis C virus, but all indications are that the remaining number of people to be treated are low.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400131#WRZZZ06400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":4046,"content":"<p>Question No. 1549 answered with Question No. 1548.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":4047,"content":"<p>Question No. 1550 answered with Question No. 1548.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":4048,"content":"<p>Question No. 1551 answered with Question No. 1548.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff","counter":4049,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400131#WRZZZ06800"},{"type":"question","counter":4050,"qnumday":1552,"qnumall":"[29702\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400131#WRZZZ06900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason that Beaumont Hospital is short five neurology nurse specialists (details supplied);

Further guidance issued on the delivery and provision of healthcare matters in a pandemic and in long-term residential care services include <i>Ethical Considerations Relating to Long-Term Residential Care Facilities in the context of COVID-19<\/i>; <i>Preliminary Clinical and Infection Control Guidance for COVID-19 in nurse-led Residential Care Facilities (RCF)<\/i>; and <i>Anticipatory Prescribing in the Last Hours or Days of Life<\/i>. The purpose of these guidance documents is to support clinicians in their care of patients and service users, including in respect of the making of appropriate clinical decisions. Such decisions, on the provision of healthcare or the transfer to another healthcare facility, are arrived at in consultation between the clinical experts and the resident or his or her representative, and in recognition of the needs and wishes of the resident. This is in line with the relevant guidance which notes that the transfer of residents to hospital is only appropriate where this will confer additional benefit and that decisions to transfer should be made in conjunction with the person, their families and their advanced care plans.<\/p><p>All grades of nursing work within a Scope of Practice Framework, set out by the regulator of the profession (the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland - NMBI). The scope of practice sets out the procedures, actions and processes that the registered nurse is allowed to perform. Scope of practice for nurses and midwives in Ireland is determined by legislation, European Union (EU) directives, international developments, social policy, national and local guidelines, education and the individual practitioner&rsquo;s levels of competence. There have been many changes and developments in the Irish health service and in nursing and midwifery roles. These include changes in systems of care provision, reforms in professional education and expansion of the scope of nursing and midwifery practice roles to meet patient needs. Factors such as the practice setting and collaborative practice can influence a nurse&rsquo;s scope of practice.<\/p><p>The prescribing of medicinal products is an expanded role that nurses and midwives undertake following successful completion of an approved education programme and having regard to legislation, professional regulation and national and local health service provider policies, procedures and guidelines. Each registered nurse must prescribe within their scope of practice and is individually accountable to keep up-to-date with advances in medicinal product prescribing and clinical practice and must acknowledge any limitations in their competence. The scope and context of practice should be determined with reference to the Scope of Nursing and Midwifery Practice Framework (NMBI, 2015) and the Practice Standards and Guidelines for Prescriptive Authority (NMBI, 2019) that a registered nurse should adhere to as part of their professional responsibilities. The relevant medicines legislation, associated regulations, national and health service provider policies, procedures and guidelines must inform prescribing practice of the registered nurse. The clinical governance for the prescribing of medicinal products is now determined by the local health service provider.<\/p><p>Finally, nursing home providers have a legal duty to ensure the provision of appropriate medical and health care to residents, and to ensure appropriate care and comfort is provided to a resident approaching the end of his or her life. This is set out in the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013, under Regulations 6 and 13 respectively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400132#WRAAAA03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":4091,"content":"<p>Question No. 1565 answered with Question No. 1564.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":4092,"content":"<p>Question No. 1566 answered with Question No. 1564.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":4094,"qnumday":1567,"qnumall":"[29741\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400132#WRAAAA03400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the amount of temporary assistance payment funding that has being given to nursing homes to date by nursing home or company.","asker":"1628","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":4095,"content":"<p>As this is an operational matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400132#WRAAAA03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Inquiries","counter":4096,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400132#WRAAAA03600"},{"type":"question","counter":4097,"qnumday":1568,"qnumall":"[29742\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400132#WRAAAA03700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will meet with a group (details supplied) in relation to the reason that it is calling for an immediate public inquiry.","asker":"1628","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":4098,"content":"<p>As Minister for Mental Health and Older People, I met with the Care Champions group on the 12th July 2021, and heard the concerns as set out at the meeting and in further correspondence received.

Both current and capital funding totalling &euro;17.43 million has been approved for this initiative. The plan will result in an additional 67 spinal fusions and 28 spinal other procedures for children with Scoliosis, as well as an additional 141 procedures for children with Spina Bifida. The plan also allocates substantial paediatric orthopaedic procedures at Cappagh orthopaedic hospital, with 720 additional procedures planned for the year.<\/p><p>By using the capacity provided by Cappagh for less complex orthopaedic patients, including routine scoliosis procedures, CHI can free up space in order that complex orthopaedic procedures, including scoliosis spinal fusions, can be carried out centrally at CHI sites. The impact of the plan has already been recorded with increased activity year to date. Year to date by the end of May 2022, 197 scoliosis procedures had been carried out, compared to 156 for the same period in 2019.

Taking place within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms, this work encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme; the examination of the options for the financing model for the scheme; and the development of a reformed model of service-delivery.<\/p>  <p>  With the aim of ensuring that all service-users are provided with a standard, high-quality level of care which is safe, effective, and person-centred, it is envisaged that the regulatory framework will comprise: (i) primary legislation for the licensing of public and private home-support providers; (ii) minimum requirements (i.e., regulations); and (iii) HIQA National Standards for Home Support Services.<\/p>  <p>  In April 2021, Government gave approval to draft a General Scheme and Heads of a Bill to establish a licensing framework for home-support providers. This is being progressed by the Department with a view to bringing it through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity. It is expected that the primary legislation will give the Minister for Health the power to make regulations in respect of minimum requirements which will form the criteria against which a provider&rsquo;s eligibility to hold a licence will be determined. A regulatory impact analysis will be undertaken by the Department in 2022 to ensure effectiveness and mitigate risks.<\/p>  <p>  In collaboration with HIQA and in consultation with the Health Service Executive and other key informants, the Department developed draft regulations and a targeted stakeholder consultation was undertaken in January 2022. Evaluating the feedback of this consultation is informing amendments in the draft regulations in advance of a public consultation planned in Q2 2022.<\/p>  <p>  On 24th February, the ESRI published a report on the demand for and cost of home support. This is the final output from a programme of research that the ESRI has undertaken to support the Department of Health to progress the development of the new home support scheme.  This research will form an important part of the evidence base for the development of a sustainable funding model for home support services in the context of our ageing population.  Government approval will be sought in due course on any proposed legislation to provide for a financial support scheme, taking into consideration the cost associated with the various options.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, work is ongoing in relation to the development of a reformed model of service delivery for the new scheme. In 2021, funding was secured for the Health Service Executive to: (i) progress the roll-out of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs in the community; (ii) pilot a reformed model of service-delivery for home-support; and (iii) establish a National Office for Home Support Services.<\/p>  <p>  The Pilot for testing of a reformed model of service for the delivery for home-support is fully operational. It commenced in November in CHO 8, which is the first of the four pilot sites. The three other sites CHO2, CHO 4 and CHO 7 became operational in January 2022. Funding has been approved for 128 interRAI Care Needs Facilitators to progress the national rollout of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs.  The interRAI outputs and pilot site evaluation will be critical to the development of the new home-support scheme.

In determining the services covered by the NHSS it was considered very important that the care recipient and the taxpayer would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice. <\/p>  <p>  Although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing. In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income. The minimum amount that is retained is the equivalent of 20% of the State Pension (Non-Contributory). An operator should not seek payment from residents for items which are covered by the NHSS, the medical card or any other existing scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is an independent statutory body with a dual mandate to enforce competition and consumer protection law in Ireland.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:<\/p>  <p>  - Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person<\/p>  <p>  - Bed and board<\/p>  <p>  - Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living<\/p>  <p>  - Laundry service<\/p>  <p>  A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home.  In determining the services covered by the NHSS it was considered very important that the care recipient and the taxpayer would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice. <\/p>  <p>  Although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing. In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income. The minimum amount that is retained is the equivalent of 20% of the State Pension (Non-Contributory). An operator should not seek payment from residents for items which are covered by the NHSS, the medical card or any other existing scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health is currently reviewing the available evidence and considering various policy options with relation to nursing home charges.<\/p>  <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is an independent statutory body with a dual mandate to enforce competition and consumer protection law in Ireland.

I have met directly with Nursing Homes Ireland, the representative organisation for private and voluntary nursing homes, to discuss this issue, and have written to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to request that they consider the matter alongside departmental officials. Nursing Homes Ireland has recently responded to a request for further information from the NTPF, this response is currently being considered.<\/p>  <p>  Funding to support people to access services in the sector continues to be provided in line with the long-established statutory mechanisms under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. This is the mechanism established by the Oireachtas to provide for the processes relating to funding under the NHSS and the negotiation of prices for services for private and voluntary providers with the designated State agency, the National Treatment Purchase Fund.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health has also provided significant specific supports to the private and voluntary nursing home sector over the course of the pandemic. As you are aware, the COVID-19 Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme, also known as TAPS, was established as part of a package of support measures for nursing homes at the start of the pandemic. &euro;134.5 million was made available under the scheme from March 2020 to June 2021. The outbreak assistance element of the scheme is still in payment. In addition to TAPS, direct support has been provided by the HSE to private nursing homes in many areas, including the provision of PPE, serial testing and support with staffing.<\/p>  <p>  The Department published a review of the NTPF pricing system in June 2021. This review was conducted by the NTPF with input from stakeholders and external experts. It recommended several actions to improve the pricing system. These are now being taken forward by the Department and NTPF. Given the size and scope of the NHSS, which is expected to cost the State more than &euro;1.053 billion this year, any changes must be delivered carefully and with due consideration to their impact and any unexpected consequences.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is also taking forward the 9 recommendations of the Value for Money Review on Nursing Home Costs, which was published in December 2021. The purpose of the VFM Review was to identify, quantify and analyse the reasons for any cost differential between private\/voluntary and public nursing homes and, following analysis, to make recommendations for improving the value for money obtained by the Health sector.<\/p>  <p>  To continue the substantial progress being made on implementing the recommendations of the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel report, nearly &euro;18 million euro was allocated in Budget 2022 including investment in Community Support Teams and Safeguarding supports.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, in response to the strategic workforce challenges in the nursing home and home care sector, a Cross-Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group has been established.

I have met directly with Nursing Homes Ireland, the representative organisation for private and voluntary nursing homes, to discuss this issue, and have written to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to request that they consider the matter alongside departmental officials. Nursing Homes Ireland has recently responded to a request for further information from the NTPF, this response is currently being considered.<\/p>  <p>  Funding to support people to access services in the sector continues to be provided in line with the long-established statutory mechanisms under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. This is the mechanism established by the Oireachtas to provide for the processes relating to funding under the NHSS and the negotiation of prices for services for private and voluntary providers with the designated State agency, the National Treatment Purchase Fund.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health has also provided significant specific supports to the private and voluntary nursing home sector over the course of the pandemic. As you are aware, the COVID-19 Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme, also known as TAPS, was established as part of a package of support measures for nursing homes at the start of the pandemic. &euro;134.5 million was made available under the scheme from March 2020 to June 2021. The outbreak assistance element of the scheme is still in payment. In addition to TAPS, direct support has been provided by the HSE to private nursing homes in many areas, including the provision of PPE, serial testing and support with staffing.<\/p>  <p>  The Department published a review of the NTPF pricing system in June 2021. This review was conducted by the NTPF with input from stakeholders and external experts. It recommended several actions to improve the pricing system. These are now being taken forward by the Department and NTPF. Given the size and scope of the NHSS, which is expected to cost the State more than &euro;1.053 billion this year, any changes must be delivered carefully and with due consideration to their impact and any unexpected consequences.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is also taking forward the 9 recommendations of the Value for Money Review on Nursing Home Costs, which was published in December 2021. The purpose of the VFM Review was to identify, quantify and analyse the reasons for any cost differential between private\/voluntary and public nursing homes and, following analysis, to make recommendations for improving the value for money obtained by the Health sector.<\/p>  <p>  To continue the substantial progress being made on implementing the recommendations of the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel report, nearly &euro;18 million euro was allocated in Budget 2022 including investment in Community Support Teams and Safeguarding supports.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, in response to the strategic workforce challenges in the nursing home and home care sector, a Cross-Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group has been established. The Group is working to a tight timeline and is committed to providing a set of recommendations to me by September 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400138#WRGGGG00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"question","counter":4522,"qnumday":1718,"qnumall":"[30102\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400138#WRGGGG00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide an update on the report on the response to Covid at St. Mary's Nursing Home in the Phoenix Park; when it will be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1469","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":4523,"content":"<p>As this is a matter for the Health Service Executive (HSE), I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400138#WRGGGG00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Overcrowding","counter":4524,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400138#WRGGGG00900"},{"type":"question","counter":4525,"qnumday":1719,"qnumall":"[30107\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400138#WRGGGG01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide an update on emergency department activity at University Hospital Limerick in 2022; the number of presentations and admissions; the average patient experience time to admission; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":4526,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400138#WRGGGG01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":4528,"qnumday":1720,"qnumall":"[30108\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400138#WRGGGG01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to expand capacity to manage the high volume of unscheduled care at University Hospital Limerick; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":4529,"content":"<p>In recent years, there has been significant investment and development in the University of Limerick Hospital Group to improve access and patient flow and to provide additional infrastructure and services right across the Group.

This is key to delivering on the Sl&aacute;intecare vision. <\/p><p>A Government Decision on RHA Implementation was approved on 5 April. This will provide policy direction and a clear mandate for the work programme. Concurrent with this a Business Case detailing the selection process for this policy direction was published and is available here: www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/4eda4-slaintecare-regional-health-areas-rhas\/. <\/p><p>The recommended policy option is one in which the six new RHAs are implemented as separate branches of the HSE. RHAs will be set up internally as formal regional structures within the HSE to ensure national policies can be implemented consistently and disruption to the system will be minimised as we make this transition. This is in line with core Sl&aacute;intecare principles.<\/p><p>In keeping with lessons learned from previous health system reforms, the option approved by Government balances the need for national consistency with more regional autonomy and associated accountability closer to the frontline.<\/p><p>While this option does not see RHAs established as separate legal entities, RHAs will have their own budgets with the power to determine their own hiring needs. While they will operate within a national policy context, this plan seeks to devolve decision making to RHAs and their leadership teams as much as possible.<\/p><p>The HSE is already a legal entity with a Board under the 2004 Health Act and it is not envisioned that this will change with the introduction of RHAs. <\/p><p>As we seek to better integrate acute and community based care, listening to health and social care system staff will be key. I established an independent RHA Advisory Group of patient and staff representatives from across the health and social care sector. This Advisory Group will provide guidance, support, and advice on the design of an implementation plan for RHAs to the Department of Health and HSE officials charged with implementing this work programme under Sl&aacute;intecare. In addition to this group, a number of engagements with stakeholders have taken place over the past several months. More health and social care sector engagements are planned over the summer months.<\/p><p>All of the insights gained from these engagements will inform the overall design of RHAs. My Department is drafting a detailed implementation plan in partnership with the HSE and other key stakeholders which will cover how RHAs will impact finance, clinical and corporate governance and accountability, digital and capital infrastructure, workforce &amp;amp; HR and change, communications &amp;amp; culture. The implementation plan will set out the key objectives, actions, and deliverables for the successful implementation of RHAs. The implementation plan is currently in draft and will be finalised by the end of the year.<\/p><p>The high level timeframe for the establishment of RHAs is as follows:<\/p><p>- A detailed implementation plan will be developed in partnership with stakeholders in 2022. Implementation work will be taking place in tandem in some instances.<\/p><p>- A shadow budget using population-based resource allocation will be developed in 2022.<\/p><p>- Corporate and clinical governance frameworks will be developed and finalised in 2022.<\/p><p>- Transition to RHAs will begin in 2023.<\/p><p>- A population-based resource allocation funding model will be used as part of Estimates 2024 to allocate funding by RHA.<\/p><p>- By Q1 2024, the expectation is that RHAs will be fully operational.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400138#WRGGGG02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":4544,"content":"<p>Question No. 1723 answered with Question No. 1722.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":4545,"content":"<p>Question No. 1724 answered with Question No. 1722.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":4546,"content":"<p>Question No. 1725 answered with Question No. 1722.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Data","counter":4547,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400138#WRGGGG03200"},{"type":"question","counter":4548,"qnumday":1726,"qnumall":"[30115\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400138#WRGGGG03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of net additional staff employed by the HSE as part of the target of 10,000 additional staff posts funded in Budget 2022, in tabular form; if he will provide a breakdown of the 10,000 funded posts by health area and speciality; the number of additional staff employed to date broken down by health area and speciality and further broken down by hospital, hospital group and CHO area and HSE centre; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":4549,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400138#WRGGGG03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":4550,"content":"<p>Question No. 1727 answered with Question No. 1381.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":4551,"content":"<p>Question No. 1728 answered with Question No. 1401.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":4552,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400138#WRGGGG03700"},{"type":"question","counter":4553,"qnumday":1729,"qnumall":"[30119\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400138#WRGGGG03800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of children and young people on the waiting lists in University Hospital Limerick for various assessments needs within the UL group; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1499","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":4554,"content":"<p>It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.

The Report contains a plan to address a range of matters in relation to psychology through the establishment of a placement office and a workforce plan for psychological services.  <\/p><p>Implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations and the creation of a National Psychology Placement Office are a matter for the HSE to prioritise in the context of available resources and as part of the wider HSCP practice placement challenges in the context of their service planning processes for 2022 and beyond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400140#WRJJJJ01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Aids and Appliances","counter":4675,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400140#WRJJJJ01300"},{"type":"question","counter":4676,"qnumday":1774,"qnumall":"[30244\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400140#WRJJJJ01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a replacement wheelchair will be expedited for a child (details supplied) given that the child has outgrown their current chair for a period of two years.","asker":"1460","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":4677,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400140#WRJJJJ01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Procedures","counter":4678,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400140#WRJJJJ01600"},{"type":"question","counter":4679,"qnumday":1775,"qnumall":"[30245\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400140#WRJJJJ01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) will receive treatment in Letterkenny University Hospital;

It is important we have rigorous processes in place to ensure our screening programmes are effective, quality assured and operating to safe standards, and that the benefits of screening outweigh the harms. <\/p>  <p>  It may be of interest to note that the NSAC held its first 'Annual Call&rsquo; in 2021, which gave the public an opportunity to suggest new screening programmes or modifications to existing ones and the Committee are currently reviewing the submissions received.

These are provided through community services known as Community Funded Schemes and play a key role in assisting and supporting people to maintain everyday functioning, and to remain living in their homes and local community.<\/p>  <p>  Applications within Community Health Organisations (CHOs) are assessed by the local Resource Allocation Group and a determination is made regarding approval based on clinical priority and the funding available.  At times, due to the demand for resources exceeding the available capacity, waiting lists may apply for some categories of items but CHOs undertake a range of initiatives to ensure optimum use of resources. <\/p>  <p>  Amputees, whose amputation arose from either a traumatic or elective event, usually have their primary prosthesis fitted at the hospital where the surgery was undertaken. Subsequent prostheses are provided to eligible clients through the Community Funded Schemes. Rehabilitation services are provided by the National Rehabilitation Hospital (NRH) primarily at their site in Dun Laoghaire and augmented by a number of satellite clinics that they operate throughout the country. There are also a number of smaller services operated at regional level that provide assessment and fitting clinics along with prostheses at a local level.<\/p>  <p>  A HSE Primary Care led National Service Improvement Programme has the aim of improving the equity of access, value for money, and functional processes of the Community Funded Schemes through the establishment of national guidelines for the provision of medical and surgical aids and appliances. While this work was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Programme has recommenced. A review of the current prosthetics service is underway and is due to be completed by early 2023.<\/p>  <p>  The Long Term Illness (LTI) scheme was established under Section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970 (as amended). Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975, prescribing 16 illnesses covered by the scheme. These are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. <\/p>  <p>  Under the LTI scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. <\/p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. Medical card eligibility is primarily based on an assessment of means and is not granted on the basis of any particular condition.<\/p>  <p>  In certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. The HSE afford applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting documentation to determine whether undue hardship exists and to fully take account of all relevant circumstances that may benefit them in assessment, including medical evidence of costs and certain expenses. In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge.  <\/p>  <p>  In terms of reducing the cost of other medications, under the Drug Payment Scheme (DPS), no individual or family pays more than &euro;80 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.

Nursing Homes Ireland has recently responded to a request for further information from the NTPF, this response is currently being considered.<\/p>  <p>  Funding to support people to access services in the sector continues to be provided in line with the long-established statutory mechanisms under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. This is the mechanism established by the Oireachtas to provide for the processes relating to funding under the NHSS and the negotiation of prices for services for private and voluntary providers with the designated State agency, the National Treatment Purchase Fund.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health has also provided significant specific supports to the private and voluntary nursing home sector over the course of the pandemic. As you are aware, the COVID-19 Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme, also known as TAPS, was established as part of a package of support measures for nursing homes at the start of the pandemic. &euro;134.5 million was made available under the scheme from March 2020 to June 2021. The outbreak assistance element of the scheme is still in payment. In addition to TAPS, direct support has been provided by the HSE to private nursing homes in many areas, including the provision of PPE, serial testing and support with staffing.<\/p>  <p>  The Department published a review of the NTPF pricing system in June 2021. This review was conducted by the NTPF with input from stakeholders and external experts. It recommended several actions to improve the pricing system. These are now being taken forward by the Department and NTPF. Given the size and scope of the NHSS, which is expected to cost the State more than &euro;1.053 billion this year, any changes must be delivered carefully and with due consideration to their impact and any unexpected consequences.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is also taking forward the 9 recommendations of the Value for Money Review on Nursing Home Costs, which was published in December 2021. The purpose of the VFM Review was to identify, quantify and analyse the reasons for any cost differential between private\/voluntary and public nursing homes and, following analysis, to make recommendations for improving the value for money obtained by the Health sector.<\/p>  <p>  To continue the substantial progress being made on implementing the recommendations of the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel report, nearly &euro;18 million euro was allocated in Budget 2022 including investment in Community Support Teams and Safeguarding supports.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, in response to the strategic workforce challenges in the nursing home and home care sector, a Cross-Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group has been established.

These aids and appliances are provided by the HSE through community services known as Community Funded Schemes.<\/p>  <p>  Each Community Health Organisation (CHO) operates processes for the allocation of funding for medical and surgical aids and appliances. Each application within a CHO is assessed by the local Resource Allocation Group and a determination is made regarding approval based on clinical priority and funding availability within local budgets.<\/p>  <p>  At times, due to the demand for resources exceeding the available capacity, waiting lists may apply for some categories of items provided through the medical and surgical aids and appliances budget in a particular CHO. Waiting times for items approved for funding vary depending on the priority rating and priority is given to clients with the greatest level of clinical need. The HSE have advised that clinical demands on local budgets remain high.<\/p>  <p>  The Long Term Illness (LTI) scheme was established under Section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970 (as amended).

These are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.

In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. Medical card eligibility is primarily based on an assessment of means and is not granted on the basis of any particular condition.<\/p>  <p>  In certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. The HSE afford applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting documentation to determine whether undue hardship exists and to fully take account of all relevant circumstances that may benefit them in assessment, including medical evidence of costs and certain expenses. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400143#WRMMMM07300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Cards","counter":4968,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400143#WRMMMM07400"},{"type":"question","counter":4969,"qnumday":1875,"qnumall":"[30613\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400143#WRMMMM07500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of medical cards that the HSE has granted in cases where the applicant exceeds the income guidelines in each of the years 2017 to 2021 and to date in 2022, in tabular form.","asker":"1698","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":4970,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400143#WRMMMM07600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Healthcare Infrastructure Provision","counter":4971,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400143#WRMMMM07700"},{"type":"question","counter":4972,"qnumday":1876,"qnumall":"[30621\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400143#WRMMMM07800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that Gortnahoe health centre, County Tipperary, has no waiting room or reception area meaning that patients have to wait in their cars for their appointments and nurses often treat patients in their cars rather than the centre itself for tests such as blood pressure; his plans to address this lack of infrastructure; if he will include such works in the next round of HSE capital projects; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1611","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":4973,"content":"<p>I understand that the health centre in question is not owned or run by the HSE.

While every sector has specific safeguarding responsibilities for adults at risk within their remit, currently no one Department has an assigned lead or coordinating cross-sectoral role, and I note that Safeguarding Ireland&rsquo;s report suggests a central role in this regard for the Department of Justice and supportive roles for the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, my Department and the Departments of Social Protection, Finance, and Housing, Local Government and Heritage. <\/p><p>I and my Department take the risk of abuse of vulnerable adults in healthcare and social care contexts very seriously.  In the health and social care sector, various structures and processes, including legislative and policy measures, are available to protect against abuse and ensure prompt action, including legislative and policy measures.  My Department will carefully examine Safeguarding Ireland&rsquo;s important report with a view to identifying and considering its potential implications for agencies and services within the remit of my Department.

With this data, it\u00a0examines the risk and protective factors that may encourage or discourage young people to begin using such substances, which may lead to problematic use, it also examines the consequences of drug and alcohol use, such as hospitalisations, death and crime.<\/p>  <p>  This important research provides valuable insights into drug and alcohol use amongst our children and young people. An understanding about the alcohol and drug use among this cohort is key to providing evidence-based prevention and education to young people at this critical juncture in their lives.<\/p>  <p>  The misuse of drugs and alcohol by all across society is concerning, but particularly so by young people of those of school going age. The National Drugs Strategy, Reducing Harm Supporting Recovery, promotes prevention initiatives regarding our young people and the misuse of drugs and alcohol. It recognises that substance misuse prevention strategies need to be evidence based and target families, schools, and communities in order to be an effective way of promoting health and well-being among the general population.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The consequences of drug use can affect our young people&rsquo;s health, undermine academic engagement and, sadly, may result in serious injury and death. We know that young people are the most likely to experiment with drugs, and therefore it is important that we collectively address these issues.<\/p>  <p>  It is a strategic priority for the remaining period of the National Drugs Strategy to strengthen the prevention of drug and alcohol use and the associated harms among children and young people. An implementation group has been established to focus on the progression of this priority, under the auspices of the national oversight committee.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health is developing a Prevention and Education Funding Programme which will support evidence-based prevention measures. Education and awareness programmes that are delivered alongside other measures, and which build life skills and confidence, are far more likely to be effective in encouraging protective and healthy behaviour than stand-alone measures. <\/p>  <p>  I am committed to expanding prevention and education initiatives which support young people to lead healthy and fulfilling lives and protect them from the dangers of drug and alcohol use.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400145#WROOOO03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1608"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Homes","counter":5091,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400145#WROOOO03700"},{"type":"question","counter":5092,"qnumday":1919,"qnumall":"[30850\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400145#WROOOO03800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide support for an application for the fair deal scheme (details supplied); the estimated timeline for completion of the application; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1480","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":5093,"content":"<p>As this is an operational matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400145#WROOOO03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":5094,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400145#WROOOO04000"},{"type":"question","counter":5095,"qnumday":1920,"qnumall":"[30854\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400145#WROOOO04100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a hospital appointment for a child (details supplied) will be expedited; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":5096,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

It's focus is on prevention, education and awareness of drugs and alcohol use by building the skills and confidence in young people and by encouraging healthy choices and behaviour. Furthermore, the Department of Health is developing a prevention and education funding programme to encourage the development of evidence-based prevention measures on issues relating to drugs and alcohol and young people. <\/p>  <p>  Other measures are also being progressed.

It is a statutory levy on all thoroughbred foals registered in Ireland in the General Stud Book through Weatherbys Ireland. The scheme is administered by Horse Racing Ireland (HRI) and provides a secure financial footing for the breeding industry and essential support structures <\/p><p>The levy was introduced specifically to address the need for predictable funding for essential infrastructure in the thoroughbred industry, namely the Irish Equine Centre (IEC), Irish Thoroughbred Marketing (ITM) and the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association (ITBA).  The levy is applicable on all thoroughbred foals registered in the Republic of Ireland whether or not a siring fee is paid.<\/p><p>HRI has informed my Department  that the levy relates to the nomination fee of the foal&rsquo;s sire and varies between &euro;35 and &euro;650. In 2021 38% of foals were charged a levy of &euro;100 or less, 51% of foals paid between &euro;150 to &euro;300 and 11% of foals paid between &euro;350 and &euro;650. HRI has advised that the levy has  a compliance rate of 98%.<\/p><p>HRI has advised that it has a dedicated Foal Levy Committee comprising three representatives from HRI, three from the ITBA and one member nominated by the Irish Farmers Association (IFA).  The HRI representatives are appointed by the Board of HRI which comprises fourteen members including representatives from all industry sectors and three Ministerial appointees. The Committee is an advisory Committee and all  final decisions on funding  are taken by the Board of HRI.<\/p><p>HRI has advised that the deadline for foal registration is the end of July 2022, therefore, the figures to date in 2022 are not yet available.  HRI does not have information on the total sale value of foals.<\/p><p>The information the Deputy has requested in relation  to PQs 29054\/22, 29055\/22, 29056\/22 and 29088\/22 is detailed in tabular form below.<\/p><p><b>Total Registered foals by foal levy income.<\/b><\/p><p><b>Average levy per registered foal 2017 - 2021<\/b> <table>    <tr>       <th><\/th>       <th>2017<\/th>       <th>2018<\/th>       <th>2019<\/th>       <th>2020<\/th>       <th>2021<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Foals Registered<\/td>       <td>9689<\/td>       <td>9569<\/td>       <td>9295<\/td>       <td>9182<\/td>       <td>9155<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Foal Levy Income<\/td>       <td>&euro;2,141,746<\/td>       <td>&euro;2,037,486<\/td>       <td>&euro;2,027,070<\/td>       <td>&euro;2,097,468<\/td>       <td>&euro;2,261,186<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Average Levy per Foal<\/td>       <td>&euro;221<\/td>       <td>&euro;213<\/td>       <td>&euro;218<\/td>       <td>&euro;228<\/td>       <td>&euro;247<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Grant Bodies<\/th>       <th>2018<\/th>       <th>2019<\/th>       <th>2020<\/th>       <th>2021<\/th>       <th>Totals<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>ITM<\/td>       <td>450000<\/td>       <td>450000<\/td>       <td>450000<\/td>       <td>475000<\/td>       <td>1825000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>IEC<\/td>       <td>900000<\/td>       <td>900000<\/td>       <td>900000<\/td>       <td>900000<\/td>       <td>3600000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>ITBA<\/td>       <td>475000<\/td>       <td>450000<\/td>       <td>450000<\/td>       <td>425000<\/td>       <td>1800000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><\/td>       <td>weatherbys 30 day notification a\\c<\/td>       <td>65000<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>65000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>IEC Kingfisher Machine<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>132990<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>132990<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>IHWT<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>50000<\/td>       <td>25000<\/td>       <td>75000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>ITBA<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>26000<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>26000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Totals<\/td>       <td>1825000<\/td>       <td>1997990<\/td>       <td>1876000<\/td>       <td>1825000<\/td>       <td>7523990<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p><b>Funds Raised by rate bands 2014-2021<\/b> <table>    <tr>       <th colspan=\"11\">Total Income (&euro;)<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>YEAR<\/td>       <td>2014<\/td>       <td>2015<\/td>       <td>2016<\/td>       <td>2017<\/td>       <td>2018<\/td>       <td>2019<\/td>       <td>2020<\/td>       <td>2021<\/td>       <td>Total<\/td>       <td>%<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>A<\/td>       <td>&euro;

While formal approval for the draft CSP is awaited and aspects of the draft Plan may be subject to change, please note that it is proposed, as was the case in GLAS, that all farmers, who apply for the Basic Payment Scheme, will have access to the new AECM. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400147#WRQQQQ04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Industry","counter":5249,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400147#WRQQQQ04900"},{"type":"question","counter":5250,"qnumday":1976,"qnumall":"[29672\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400147#WRQQQQ05000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on the provision of agricultural internships within the State for those from other European Union states and non-European Union states; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1451","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":5251,"content":"<p>EU citizens have the right to work within the State and enjoy the same employment rights as Irish citizens.

A full breakdown by county is not readily available within BIM, but I have asked BIM to see if this can be prepared and to forward it directly to the Deputy. <table>    <tr>       <th>FLAG <\/th>       <th>2017 Grant Aid<\/th>       <th>2018 Grant Aid<\/th>       <th>2019 Grant Aid<\/th>       <th>2020 Grant Aid<\/th>       <th>2021 Grant Aid<\/th>       <th>Total Spend<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>North<\/td>       <td>&euro;     315,739.69<\/td>       <td>&euro;     249,458.97<\/td>       <td>&euro;     488,513.53<\/td>       <td>&euro;     419,896.80<\/td>       <td>&euro;673,252.27<\/td>       <td>&euro;2,146,861.26<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>North East<\/td>       <td>&euro;     226,559.10<\/td>       <td>&euro;     249,075.04<\/td>       <td>&euro;     523,592.01<\/td>       <td>&euro;     569,296.21<\/td>       <td>&euro;284,471.53<\/td>       <td>&euro;1,852,993.89<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>North West<\/td>       <td>&euro;     244,669.47<\/td>       <td>&euro;     188,774.15<\/td>       <td>&euro;     223,937.61<\/td>       <td>&euro;     380,035.36<\/td>       <td>&euro;257,793.03<\/td>       <td>&euro;1,295,209.62<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>West<\/td>       <td>&euro;     388,960.11<\/td>       <td>&euro;     405,409.69<\/td>       <td>&euro;     392,050.31<\/td>       <td>&euro;     641,327.31<\/td>       <td>&euro;147,673.39<\/td>       <td>&euro;1,975,420.81<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>South<\/td>       <td>&euro;     278,478.69<\/td>       <td>&euro;     273,778.66<\/td>       <td>&euro;     447,094.83<\/td>       <td>&euro;     603,111.20<\/td>       <td>&euro;105,487.40<\/td>       <td>&euro;1,707,950.78<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>South East<\/td>       <td>&euro;     164,543.08<\/td>       <td>&euro;     312,092.24<\/td>       <td>&euro;     526,281.63<\/td>       <td>&euro;     774,247.25<\/td>       <td>&euro;330,532.22<\/td>       <td>&euro;2,107,696.42<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>South West<\/td>       <td>&euro;     155,612.83<\/td>       <td>&euro;     266,161.11<\/td>       <td>&euro;     127,581.14<\/td>       <td>&euro;     154,182.93<\/td>       <td>&euro;27,277.51<\/td>       <td>&euro;730,815.52<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Total<\/td>       <td>&euro; 1,774,562.97<\/td>       <td>&euro; 1,944,749.85<\/td>       <td>&euro; 2,729,051.05<\/td>       <td>&euro; 3,542,097.06<\/td>       <td>&euro;1,826,487.35 <\/td>       <td>&euro;11,816,948.28<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400147#WRQQQQ07800","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fisheries Protection","counter":5280,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400148#WRRRRR00200"},{"type":"question","counter":5281,"qnumday":1986,"qnumall":"[30638\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400148#WRRRRR00300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the steps that he has taken since being appointed to implement the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority capability review, with a view to enhancing governance issues and considering any other measures that may be necessary; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1463","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":5282,"content":"<p>Responsibility for the  implementation of the recommendations of the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority capability review rests with the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, which is an independent agency as set down in the 2006 Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 2006.  <\/p>  <p>  The review report was published by the SFPA  in April 2020.

This demonstrates the Government's commitment to this policy area, with schemes such as Town and Village Renewal, the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund and the Local Improvement Scheme all benefiting from these funding increases and supporting rural development throughout the country.\u00a0 <table>    <tr>       <th>&euro;, m<\/th>       <th>Total allocation<\/th>       <th>Cost of increase<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2022 Estimate<\/td>       <td>202.255 <\/td>       <td>n\/a<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>5% Increase<\/td>       <td>212.368 <\/td>       <td>10.113 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>10% Increase<\/td>       <td>222.481 <\/td>       <td>20.226 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>20% Increase<\/td>       <td>242.706 <\/td>       <td>40.451 <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400148#WRRRRR04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":5326,"qnumday":2001,"qnumall":"[28954\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400148#WRRRRR04800","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the estimated full-year cost of increasing funding for the local improvement scheme by 10%.","asker":"1604","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":5327,"content":"<p>The Local Improvement Scheme (LIS) supports the improvement of rural roads and laneways that are not normally maintained by local authorities.\u00a0 As part of Our Rural Future, the Government is committed to ensuring that the Scheme\u00a0is funded into the future.<\/p>  <p>  From 2017 to 2021, my Department allocated &euro;80 million towards improvement works on over 3,000 non-public roads and lanes benefiting over 13,300 landowners and residents in these rural areas.

This reserve fund currently stands at &euro;108.4 million, leaving a total of &euro;171.8 million available for future disbursements through the Dormant Accounts Annual Action Plan process. There are approvals of &euro;63 million currently in place through Annual Action Plans, including the 2022 Action Plan, and this funding will be drawn down from the &euro;171.8 million available.

Future disbursement levels depend on the inflows into the fund, which are difficult to predict. However, given very strong recent expenditure, it is expected that over time disbursement levels will need to gradually reduce to around &euro;40 million per annum, which is a current average rate of net inflows into the fund.  This will ensure a continued long term positive impact in terms of addressing disadvantage through the fund.
