Their deaths are a huge loss to us all, or as Theo Dorgan - the Taoiseach is aware he is an another Corkman - so eloquently put it, we are so much poorer for their absence and so much richer for their lives and for their work.<\/p>  <p>  Today, the Cabinet has announced plans for further easing of restrictions.  Covid is a horrendous virus and it is still with us.  Thankfully, our population is largely vaccinated and this should allow us to proceed safely back to normal, but our healthcare capacity leaves us vulnerable.  The crisis that we face now is a hospital bed and capacity crisis.  Science has done its bit, medical professionals have done more than their bit, but the Government has failed to step up.<\/p>  <p>  Here are the facts.  Hospitals across the State are seeing record levels of overcrowding.  Emergency departments are overflowing.  The trolley count is rising.  It is 416 today.  Health waiting lists now stand at almost 1 million waiting for care, and almost a quarter of a million of those have been waiting for more than 18 months.  Yet, in the face of this crisis, and increasing Covid numbers, the response of the Government in the budget was not one single additional inpatient bed.  Not one.  How are we to make it through the winter?  How will burnt-out, front-line workers cope?  How will the health service survive?  The Government's approach means that for the remainder of this year and the entirety of next year, we will have no additional inpatient hospital beds.  Is the Taoiseach seriously suggesting that no additional inpatient beds are needed until 2023?<\/p> <p>The crisis is now, the overcrowding is happening now, the trolley count rises now and waiting lists are growing.  Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha of the INMO has said of our hospitals: &ldquo;They cannot cope today, they won't be coping tonight and they won't be coping tomorrow.\"  This is a very stark warning and the Taoiseach needs to listen.<\/p> <p> None of this has come out of the blue.  The Taoiseach has to have known that this crisis would hit our hospitals hard in the wintertime.  Indeed, last July, Sinn F&eacute;in and our colleague, Deputy David Cullinane, called for planning for the winter to start then.  We urged the Government to prepare for what was to come.  We called for an additional 600 inpatient beds and the recruitment of staff to service those beds and we repeated that call in our budget.  The Taoiseach chooses to ignore those calls.  He chooses not to properly invest in and resource our hospitals, and that leaves us exposed again.  So, now, the chickens come home to roost, and it is patients, hospital staff and wider society who pay the heavy price.  T&aacute; &aacute;r n-ospid&eacute;il faoi bhr&uacute; ollmh&oacute;r.

I want him to provide the investment needed, increase the number of beds in our hospitals, relieve the overcrowding and lift the intense, unbearable pressure on front-line staff, who are now beyond breaking point.  This must be a central plank in the Government's response to the Covid-19 crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900003#A00200","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634648700,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue.  I also join the House in expressing our sympathies to the families of the late M&aacute;ire Mhac an tSaoi - b'fhile den scoth &iacute; a rinne an-chuid ar son &aacute;r dteanga dh&uacute;chais - Brendan Kennelly, Paddy Moloney and Tony MacMahon, artists and musicians who enriched our lives in a wonderful way.<\/p>  <p>  I think the fundamental premise of the Deputy&rsquo;s question is wrong.  The driver of our responses over the last two years in terms of health, and public health in particular, has been the Covid virus itself and the various mutations.  The Alpha mutation earlier this year had a devastating impact on us.  Likewise, now, the Delta variant is even more transmissible than the Alpha variant, and it has had a very significant impact globally and in this country in terms of the incidence of cases in terms of hospitalisation, ICU admissions and mortality.<\/p>  <p>  Thankfully, because of vaccination and a very effective, efficient and well-run vaccination programme, we have achieved up to 93% vaccination.  The vaccines are very effective in preventing severe illness, hospitalisation and admission to ICU, and in terms of mortality and preventing death.  However, over time, in terms of protecting against infection itself, it is not as strong as it would be in terms of the cases I have just outlined.  Therefore, there is a need for a booster campaign.  That was the key recommendation from NIAC yesterday, which the Government will implement immediately.  It will be the administration of the booster vaccine to the over-60s which will help us in holding back the impact of Covid.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of hospital beds, close to 938 beds are due to be delivered by the end of this year.  The Deputy has ignored completely in her presentation the fact that well over 900 beds have been budgeted for and have been provided for, with the follow-through provided for this year in terms of the staffing, for example.  That was the largest bed increase ever in one year in terms of hospital capacity.  Likewise, in terms of ICU, again, there has been a substantial 25% increase in ICU beds over the last two years.  It is close to 300 now and it will get to 321 by the end of this year or, at the latest, very early next year.  These are very substantial increases both in ICU and bed capacity.<\/p>  <p>  The situation as advised to us by NPHET is that, in all age groups now, people are getting infected.  While we are reopening, we are doing so in a very cautious way, with the vaccination certificate at the heart of the protective measures that need to be taken.<\/p> <p>The Deputy opposed tooth and nail the vaccination certificate provisions that were introduced the previous time in this House to facilitate access to hospitality.  She and her colleagues very strongly opposed that, yet it was the key to opening hospitality and it was advised by NPHET that this was what we should do.  NPHET is now advising the same in respect of the remaining elements of hospitality.  Conscious of the growth in incidence levels, it is very anxious that, where practical, appropriate and where it makes sense, a range of protective measures be introduced, the most critical being that the vaccination certificate be applied across the board, together with due diligence by operators and consumers.  That is the key issue.  We will be increasing staff in the health service by another 8,000 this year.  There is going to be no let-up in the investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900004#B00200","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634649000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Covid is a terrible virus and sickness, and it is with us to stay.  The level of vaccination, at more than 90%, is extremely high.  As I said, science has done its job and the medical professionals have done theirs.  The Government now needs to do its job.  The fact is that the lack of capacity within our health service leaves us vulnerable still.  It means there is a panic right across society when infection levels, hospitalisations and ICU admissions rise.  That is all down to capacity.<\/p>  <p>  I put it to the Taoiseach that the Government did not make additional provision for as much as one new inpatient bed in the budget.  That is a fact.  Provision was made for 19 new ICU beds, but that is a drop in the ocean.  Everybody knows that at the heart of our dilemma, with a highly vaccinated population and people doing their best and being very thoughtful and cautious, we are still left with this huge vulnerability in terms of healthcare and hospital capacity.

With just three days to go before many businesses that have been closed for nearly two years are due to open, the rules are being rewritten.  We all accept that the rates of Covid transmission can surge very quickly and can be unpredictable.  What is predictable, however, is that we know without a shadow of doubt how the disease is spread.  It is airborne.  Businesses have been given absolutely no guidance on the manner in which they can improve ventilation and make their premises safer.  Air filtration units, for example, could be rolled out to schools for as little as &euro;12 million, but they have not been issued.  Nightclub and music venue owners are going to get advice at the last possible moment on how they can open their businesses.<\/p> <p>All indoor businesses where people congregate should have been given guidance on ventilation months ago.<\/p> <p> The Taoiseach said yesterday that he is a great fan of antigen testing and that came as a surprise to many of us because there is no evidence that anyone in government is a fan of such testing.  We are told that the continued reopening is to a large extent contingent on antigen testing being rolled out to scale.  Why was that not done before?  How will this massive surge in the use of antigen testing work, given that almost zero prior planning has been done for that?<\/p> <p> We are told that people can dance in nightclubs, for example, but that they cannot go to the bar for a drink.  It is confusing; people could probably dance to the bar.  In his address earlier the Taoiseach attempted to defray the blame by talking about personal responsibility.  Irish people have been brilliant in what they have done and we would all agree on that.  They got vaccinated in their droves and stayed at home when they were told to do so.  There are other issues of planning at play and we have always been in an emergency.  There is also the issue of the creaking hospital capacity.  We are 20 months into the disaster and there is a modest target of an increase of 66 ICU beds this year.  That target has not been met and there has been no mention of additional capacity in this year's budget.<\/p> <p> Would the Taoiseach accept that there has been a failure to plan and that we are back at an emergency stage in the opening of businesses and the criteria being applied?  There has been a failure to accept that this is an airborne virus.  The ads that are being shown at the moment instruct people to wash their hands.  The evidence is not that the virus is transmitted by touch but that it is an airborne virus.  Why has the necessary attention not been placed on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900005#C01900","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634649600,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Every debate we have when restrictions come in or go out is the same.  I recall a debate in the D&aacute;il before the summer on the measure that enabled us to open hospitality, namely, the vaccination service.  It was a heated debate with Members opposite saying it was the worst thing we could possibly do, yet it enabled the reopening of hospitality, including restaurants and pubs.  Has anybody on the Opposition side said we got that wrong or have they said they were confused or that they gave an incoherent message?  The Opposition always tries to pick holes although I acknowledge that there are difficulties and challenges, particularly for the sectors concerned.<\/p><p>Covid does not respect weekly decision-making on a precision basis.  In our conversations with public health officials two weeks ago, this scenario was not on the horizon.  The case numbers have taken a turn for the worse and we have to respond.  It is as simple as that.  We could have decided to pause everything and not open anything afresh.  NPHET stated that it:<\/p> <blockquote> \tDid not believe it tenable that any pause now would result in a further easing of measures in November.  The NPHET has therefore recommended that on balance:<br \/><br \/>... the remaining aspects of the hospitality, entertainment and night-time economy sector can reopen only with the full range of protective measures in place and the wide and robust implementation of the COVID-19 pass.  In this regard, guidance should be developed or updated as appropriate by the relevant sectors. <\/blockquote>  <p>NPHET goes on to list all the various measures and uses the phrase, &quot;including the appropriate use of masks, physical distancing, ventilation, and mitigation measures&quot;.  That is what is in NPHET's letter and it is now saying it does not see those measures being removed until February 2022.  The measures must be implemented where appropriate and there has to be practical application of this in different settings.<\/p><p>Members will raise all the anomalies and ask why one thing can be done in one setting and another thing cannot be done in another setting.  Those anomalies will arise in scenarios like this but the key point is that anything we have reopened so far has stayed open.  Despite what some lobbies are saying, these restrictions have not inhibited a lot of activity because the Revenue and the VAT receipts are showing that a lot is going on in many sectors because of the reopening of society and the economy.  It is better to try to proceed with reopening, albeit with restrictions that people will find frustrating.<\/p> <p>It is because of the virus's turn for the worse that there is a timeline problem for the sector.  I acknowledge that and the need for guidance and the need to engage with the sector and to do practical, sensible things to enable reopening and to enable the facilitation of plans that sectors that up to now had been closed have in place.  We have got to work with sectors to do that.  The same applies to the return to work.

That is an incredible fact for a publicly owned agency.  This report confirmed and provided further detail on information that I had received in reply to a parliamentary question recently.  When it is all added together, the situation is even more shocking and disgraceful.  NAMA is still in possession of 577 acres of residential land that is suitable for delivering housing.  In the answer to my question, it was confirmed that NAMA was in possession of 50 units that were sitting vacant and that it also had 1,400 units under construction, 4,600 units with planning permission, 7,500 where planning applications had been submitted or were in preparation, and 8,500 units at pre-planning stage.

How can the Government possibly allow a situation where a public agency is contributing to the housing crisis, is facilitating the property developers and, in some cases, as also confirmed in the response to the parliamentary question, is selling houses to these property investors who then lease them back to the local authorities, for which the Government is paying astronomical amounts of public money to these entities?

NAMA has in the past offered social housing to the State through the local authorities and so forth, some of which was taken up by local authorities and some of which was not taken up because of the local authorities' views in terms of the suitability of the particular housing that might have been offered by NAMA at that time.<\/p>  <p>  The Housing for All strategy commits approximately &euro;4 billion per annum by the State.

The Government refuses to tell NAMA to deliver all it can, namely, 24,000 homes, which would contribute enormously to alleviating the housing crisis.  It refuses also to tell the agency that it must deliver all that as exclusively public and genuinely affordable housing, instead of what it is currently doing, which is selling it to profit-hungry investors who are driving the price of property and rent through the roof and contributing to the housing crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900008#F00300","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634650500,"counter":38,"content":"<p>NAMA represents the taxpayer.

I used to think the oft-quoted Fianna F&aacute;il reflection on Government as \"senior hurling\" was about political competition, the training and effort taken, the resilience and gumption required and the skill of our national sport, not that our Cabinet members tog out in their individual county jerseys.  The mean-spirited question I have for the Taoiseach, for which I apologise in advance, is whether he is a Cork Taoiseach or a Taoiseach who just happens to be from Cork.<\/p>  <p>  I ask this grim but important question because we are now half way into his term as Taoiseach and in that time we have seen two budgets and the revised national development plan.  I remind the Taoiseach of a pre-election promise he made to the people of the south east in 2016.  He promised to provide 24-7 cardiac care to the south east region.  That year he stood for a picture on the grounds of University Hospital Waterford, UHW, with his candidate and all his Fianna F&aacute;il councillors and committed to delivering 24-7 services.  That picture was at the centre of the Taoiseach's 2016 campaign.  It was the photo that restored a seat to his party in Waterford.  The Taoiseach did not stand and promise another study, review or investigation.  He deliberately stood on the grounds of UHW and committed to deliver a long-promised life-saving service and one which is available to people in every region of the country except those of us in the south east.<\/p>  <p>  In the preceding general election of 2011, Enda Kenny pledged the south east a full university and with that promise he took half of the seats in the region, that is, seven out of 14.  However, in power, he resiled from that promise.  His party, Fine Gael, now has just two of those 14 seats while we in the region were left pick up the massive economic and social costs of that lost decade.  This is heartbreaking when we see Grangegorman springing to life.<\/p>  <p>  At this point in time, the Taoiseach's legacy in the south east is from his time as Minister for Education when, under pressure from Cork, he undid the institute of technology upgrade in 1997.<\/p> <p>In the south-east region and in Waterford, Enda Kenny's legacy is entirely framed by his unkept promise, his broken word.  I have a simple question for the Taoiseach.  Will there be a 24-7 cardiac care service, a service available in every other region in Ireland, in the south east before he leaves the Taoiseach's office?  Will he be keeping his promise?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900009#G01000","speaker":"1616","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634650800,"counter":48,"content":"<p>When I was a history student, the first thing I was told was that one should always endeavour to be objective in terms of one's historical narrative, to try to see all sides of the story and the equation and not to view things through the prism of one's own narrow perspective or partisan view of things.  I recall that when I was the Minister for Education and Science, many of the institutes of technology or the then regional technical colleges were looking for status upgrades and so on.  I recall looking at the plant, at the actual buildings, and saying that it would be better to invest substantially in the capacity of the colleges.  My legacy in Waterford was buying the additional land which has guaranteed, since the late 1990s, the very significant expansion of Waterford Institute of Technology to such an extent that, under international peer review, it can compete to be a university and will become a technological university.  That is the way universities should become universities.  It should not be at the whim of politicians arriving at some platform and announcing that they are going to make a body into a university, with no regard for capacity or a whole range of investments that should happen in advance.  That is the approach I took as Minister for Education and Science.  We had a binary system but we set up a peer review and have provided for technological universities to happen.  Successive Ministers have progressed the idea of developing institutes of technology into technological universities and doing so in a way that is fair and that has credibility internationally.  When it has credibility internationally, the region benefits in terms of more investment.  The Waterford Institute of Technology has really advanced over the last decade or two and has developed significant specialties, not least in the areas of enterprise and industry and quite a number of foreign direct investments have occurred as a result of that.<\/p>  <p>  I would say that the time has come to talk up Waterford and its third level institution because it has a lot to commend itself.  That is what I would do.  I have great belief in that institute and I believe that along with Carlow Institute of Technology, it is going to become a technological university, which is great for the region.  We are committed to doing that and to the consequential investments that will be required of the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of the hospital, Deputy Shanahan's constituency colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Butler, has been tenacious and alongside the Deputy and others, is determined to advance the situation with regard to the cath lab and cardiac cover.  The programme for Government commits to the delivery of a second cath lab in University Hospital Waterford.  Funding has been allocated and the contractor for the construction of the new lab was formally appointed in March.  The project commenced in May of this year, with a work programme of around 13 months.

Other promises in the programme for Government are being kept, despite the incredible challenges of Covid but if the Taoiseach's promise on 24\/7 cardiac care for the south east is not kept then politics in this country is broken, frankly.  There are huge swaths of the country that feel unrepresented by the current Cork-Dublin Cabinet.  Reasonable and necessary things, life-saving things like 24\/7 cardiac care in the south east, are not being delivered and cannot get done.  The Taoiseach is halfway into his term at this stage but he still has time if he decides to take action.

Sir David was so needlessly murdered while meeting with and serving his own constituents last Friday in Southend-on-Sea.  Holding clinics is something we as elected representatives do as part of our public service to the communities we serve.  Face-to-face interaction with constituents is what makes our job worthwhile and fruitful.  It is a crucial part of our democracy and we should do our utmost to protect and continue it.  Sir David's murder was an attack on democracy.  I was struck at how all Members of Westminster spoke so highly and kindly of Sir David, at how he had numerous friends across all parties and was described as someone who was exceptionally decent, down to earth and hard-working.  One could not but be moved by the extraordinary expressions of solidarity and friendship from his constituents and the people he served, who spoke about him so eloquently.  It is a wonderful legacy as a politician to have that.

More than 8,000 people are living in emergency accommodation.  If we were in a situation where we had enough zoned land to provide 253,000 homes for people, that would be very significant.  In fact, there is enough zoned land to provide homes for 250,000 people.  According to the Government, we have more than 8,000 ha of such land.  What we do not have are proper measures in place to facilitate the provision of housing there.  For example, we do not have an effective tax on land-hoarding, although the Government has undertaken in the budget to introduce a tax of 3% on zoned land.<\/p><p>Without proper data on land, including who owns it, what price they paid for it, how much it has increased in value before they sell it, and how long they hold or hoard it for, it is not possible for the best and most effective measures to be introduced by the Government and this House.  A land price register would provide that information in order that the most effective measures could be taken.  It would also create transparency around land, including a particular insight into the costs of land, which is very important in terms of construction costs.  We know we have some of the most expensive construction costs in Ireland.  We also know that the cost of building materials here is in line with that in comparable European countries, the cost of labour is slightly lower than in some of those states and professional fees are on a par.  What we do not know is what is happening with land prices, which means we do not know what is happening in terms of developers' profits and margins.  We are not in a position to assess that information independently; instead, we are entirely reliant on industry and development sources.<\/p><p>This Bill, if introduced, will give clarity around developer profits and construction costs.  That will be important not just for taking effective measures but also for reducing the cost of housing and making it more affordable.  It is an important measure in terms of the tools we need to address housing provision and affordability.  It will create a publicly accessible land price register, much like the residential property price register, and that information will be important.  The Government's decision as to whether it backs this Bill on Second Stage and facilitates its progression through the Houses quickly and efficiently will show which side it is on.  If the Government is serious about addressing housing, including issues around land-hoarding, prices and speculation, then this Bill offers a ready-made measure.

The shared island unit in my Department acts as a driver and co-ordinator of this whole-of-government initiative.  On 4 October, as part of the revised national development plan, NDP, the Government announced significant additional funding and an increased level of ambition for collaborative cross-Border public investment.  The shared island dimension of the NDP sets out our investment priorities for the decade ahead to work through all-island partnerships and build a more connected, prosperous and sustainable island for all.<\/p><p>Under the plan, total all-island investment through the extended shared island fund, the Project Ireland 2040 funds, the Government's annual funding for North-South co-operation and the PEACE PLUS programme, delivered with the EU, UK and Northern Ireland Executive, is more than &euro;3.5 billion.  Under the NDP, the Government has committed to allocate ring-fenced, multi-annual capital resourcing for all-island investment out to 2030, at least at the current level of the shared island fund.  The Government is making allocations from the fund to deliver our commitments and objectives on a shared island.  Progress so far this year includes funding to deliver phase 2 of the Ulster Canal and commence development work on phase 3, commencement of an all-island strategic rail review, shared island funding to progress the Narrow Water Bridge project to tender stage, and the launch and commencement of the new North-South research programme.  The latter will see &euro;40 million allocated from the shared island fund over five years to support the deepening of links between higher education institutions, researchers and research communities.  As part of my visit to Belfast on 8 October, I heard from research leaders at Queen's University about the strong interest in, and beneficial all-island impacts we will see from, the programme.  The Government will continue to develop investment and co-operation initiatives to enhance our shared island, implementing our objectives as set out in the programme for Government and the NDP.<\/p><p>To support the Government's agenda for deeper co-operation and connection on the island, the shared island unit in my Department has commissioned a comprehensive research programme, working with the Economic and Social Research Institute, the National Economic and Social Council, the Irish Research Council and other partners.  Research will be published in the final quarter of this year and in 2022, focused on opportunities to deepen co-operation across a range of economic, social and environmental domains.  At the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, in July, it was agreed to commence a work stream on shared island issues of interest for trade unions and employers within LEEF's remit of economic and employment issues relevant to the labour market.<\/p><p>I initiated the shared island dialogue series to foster inclusive civic dialogue on our shared future that engages all communities on the island.  I addressed the first shared island dialogue with young people in November.  Dialogues on climate and environment, civil society engagement, equality, economic recovery on the island, and health have been held this year, with participation by Ministers.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>On 1 October, a dialogue was held on the future of education on a shared island, with participation by the Minister for Education, the Minister of State at the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, and more than 130 education and civil society stakeholders.  The dialogues are bringing together more than 1,000 civic representatives this year in different sectors and across all regions, communities and traditions to discuss how we can better work together for a shared future.  Further dialogues will be announced shortly and the series will continue next year. <\/p><p>These dialogues are proving to be positive, practical, forward-looking discussions on the opportunities and challenges we face in striving for a more reconciled future on the island.  They are also affirming the breadth of common ground, solidarity and readiness to work together there is in communities across this island, while not shying away from hard questions.  Exciting projects are emerging from the dialogues, such as a newly established all-island women's forum, bringing together women leaders from across the island to address under-representation and further develop women's role in peacebuilding and civic society.<\/p><p>The Government will continue to prioritise and resource our shared island agenda for ambitious, practical co-operation, investment and civic engagement, focused on common concerns for the people of this island and building a shared future, underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900019#R02800","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1634654700,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.

There needs to be a particular focus to ensure we get a fair drawdown from the shared island fund.  Those counties, both North and South, face particular challenges due to Brexit that are well documented in research and they also face challenges due to the pandemic that we have not seen the downside of yet.

There is a great opportunity for the State to lead here based on the generous proposals of the European Commission last week on the Northern Irish protocol and the withdrawal agreement and to harness the true potential of the shared economic opportunities available to the entire island.  That is crucially important.  More practically, there is a political role to be played here due to the abdication of responsibility by certain parties in Northern Ireland towards the North-South Ministerial Council.

In the South we are governed by the Industrial Relations Act 1990, which banned political strikes, solidarity actions, solidarity strikes and secondary picketing, and which restricted workers' rights to organise.  In the North, workers and trade unionists face Thatcher era legislation with similar effect.  The power to change these laws has been devolved to Stormont for more than 20 years but none of the parties in the Executive has attempted to change them.  This is why People Before Profit MLA, Gerry Carroll, has introduced the trade union freedom Bill, which would scrap those restrictions and give power back to workers to organise.  It would allow workers to take solidarity action, make it simpler for workers to take industrial action and give workers greater rights to organise in trade unions.  It is mirrored by the similar Bill that People Before Profit has introduced on First Stage in the D&aacute;il, the Trade Union Recognition Bill.

The establishment of the all-Ireland women's forum is welcome, as is the diversity of its membership.  The shared island unit could play a role in addressing what was described by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, as the scourge of domestic and gender-based violence, which is a particular issue for Border counties.  There are purpose-built refuges for victims of domestic violence in Cavan or Monaghan, for example.  Last week, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, conceded that he does not know if a refuge will be established next year in either county.  Without a budget provision, we can be sure that it will not be delivered.

The first question from Deputy Brendan Smith was on the central Border area and the need for the shared island fund to focus on that area.  The Deputy has spoken to me about the geopark and I have asked my officials to investigate that and to engage with him.  We are open to projects in the area of climate change and biodiversity and this project would add value to the dialogue series we have already had on those issues.  It is in the arena of initiatives that have been undertaken by the unit, working with local interests in Cavan and Fermanagh and across that central Border area that the Deputy so consistently raises.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Richmond raised the economic recovery dialogue and the protocol.  We have identified a potential partnership between Derry and Letterkenny in respect of city deals and enterprise parks on both sides of the Border that would be joined and that would have a common governance oversight which could create jobs and facilitate economic development in that area.  The North West Strategic Growth Partnership is strong and it acts irrespective of politics across all divides and I met the group.  Both county councils are on it and they are focused on an economic agenda in the north west.  We are anxious to support them in any way we possibly can and one of those areas is the common enterprise park in that locality.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the protocol, and Deputy Alan Farrell also raised the lack of participation between the North and the South.  The shared island unit is without prejudice to people's constitutional positions and, therefore, it has received a broad welcome.  Some parties are cautious in their engagement but there is no such caution in civil society and those in business and industry are also engaging.<\/p>  <p>  On industrial relations, the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, had a plenary meeting on 5 July.  That is the forum for Government to engage with representatives from employers and trade unions.  It has developed a work stream to look at shared island issues, labour market dynamics and deepening understanding of all-island labour market issues.  These issues include: opportunities and impediments for firms; issues facing frontier workers such as remote work and related issues; further and higher education; training and skills; and so on.  There is a healthy workers' agenda in place there.<\/p>  <p>  On Deputy Durkan's point, I see huge potential.  I met representatives of Queen's University Belfast last Friday week, which was interesting.  It has an all-island tissue bank as well as the all-island cancer consortium and a whole range of research that has an all-island relevance.  That means the more than &euro;40 million funding we have allocated has an all-island benefit.  It will knit together academics and researchers on the entire island, irrespective of geography, with a common pursuit to develop science for the benefit of all.<\/p> <p> In terms of domestic and gender-based violence, which Deputy Carthy referenced, we have had some outcomes through the dialogue series.  One of the existing projects that has emerged from the dialogue on women is the newly established all-island women's forum.  That is bringing together women leaders from across the island to address under-representation and further develop women's role in peace building and civic society.  I would like to think that there is an opportunity in this to look at the domestic and gender-based violence issue as well and come forward with proposals around it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900020#S00700","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements","time":1634655900,"counter":186,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900021#T00200"},{"type":"question","time":1634655900,"counter":187,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[43741\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900021#T00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his recent visit to Oxford to meet with the British-Irish Association, BIA.

That is a welcome move away from the use of terms such as \"divisive\" in respect of those who advocate that we should be moving towards Irish unity.  The Good Friday Agreement provides for that and discussions are already taking place across civic society.  In this the centenary year of the absolute disaster that was partition, there is a particular onus.  Will the Taoiseach allow for a citizens' assembly to take place that would allow people of all backgrounds and views to come together and discuss how we can capture the full potential that Irish unity presents?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900021#T00900","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1634655900,"counter":194,"content":"<p>First, I thank the Deputies again for their interest and for raising these issues.  In respect of Deputy Haughey's points, every political party and movement has its aspirations in terms of the constitutional future of the island, including Northern Ireland, and that is as it should be.  I have no issue at all in articulating that.  Our party, which is the party that I lead, has a clear view in terms of the unity of the people of Ireland, and we have shared that on numerous occasions.  Equally, we have been a party that has been to the forefront in advancing progress, particularly throughout the totality of relationships - the British-Irish relationship, the North-South relationship and the relationships between the different traditions on the island - and culminating in the Good Friday Agreement, which is an agreement that we still need to maximise the potential of on a whole range of fronts.<\/p>  <p>  The main point, which Deputy Haughey referenced in his question, that I wanted to get across was the need for an absence of unilateralism in terms of any one party's approach to legacy issues or, indeed, the protocol.  I made that point specifically to the British Government during that speech and through the medium of that speech.  There cannot be unilateralism in respect of legacy issues because there was agreement between all parties and Governments in respect of legacy issues.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of the protocol, there is a facility within the withdrawal agreement for that to be resolved through joint committees and so on.  We have worked hard.  Vice President &Scaron;ef\u010dovi\u010d of the Commission has worked very hard and has come forward with what I think is a very imaginative set of proposals that has the potential to unblock the issues around the operation of the protocol.  I think it is in the best interests of all in Northern Ireland that the talks be progressed now in a proactive and constructive way to make sure that we can get the best outcome for the people in Northern Ireland in respect of the operation of the protocol.  That means continued access to the Single Market of the European Union, which is a huge prize for everyone living on the island.  North-South trade is very important and has continued to grow in the aftermath of the protocol.  Equally, businesses in Northern Ireland should have access to the UK and the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of amnesties, I agree with what has been said by Deputy Brendan Smith.  The perpetrators of violence, particularly those who were engaged in the murder and maiming of people, cannot get away with it and they must know that they will be subject to investigation.  Some of these cases are still being pursued and people can still bring forward information that would lead to a resolution of these cases.  I would urge people to come forward with information in respect of a lot of the unsolved cases where the families of victims, including the families who have lost loved ones, eagerly seek closure.  Different models are being discussed.  The British-Irish Council discussed this.  People have mentioned Operation Kenova.  I met all the parties last week, and some of them were instancing that as a useful model, but what is important is that whatever emerges be done in agreement between all parties and the two Governments without any unilateral move.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the issues Deputy Carthy raised, I will come back to him.  I do not know why my officials have not been in touch, but I will follow that up.  Regarding the idea of a citizens' assembly, these questions relate to the British-Irish Association and I have had a long engagement with the association since I was a backbench Deputy many years ago.<\/p> <p>I have spoken on many occasions of my experience at Corrymeela, for example, meeting with politicians from different traditions.  The citizens' assembly is a representative forum, in respect of which a particular number of people from different strata of society are selected by poll.  That is not how we will resolve Northern Ireland's issues.  I mean that genuinely.  We need constant, consistent engagement with people to work out issues.  A citizens' assembly, on its own, will not achieve this.  We need a constant interaction between Parliaments, community groups and political parties to get these issues resolved.  I genuinely believe that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900021#T01000","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634656500,"counter":196,"content":"<p>That is happening already.

During that time, even one weekend in Oxford, I would have met more people and professionals who had different perspectives and different experiences on the North.  That educated and informed me.  It gave me a broader breadth of experience and expertise.  I do not think anything can replace that.  If anything, as a Parliament, we should intensify our engagement on those fronts.

What will be Ireland's approach to the strategic compass, having regard to our traditional policy of military neutrality?<\/p>  <p>  I would also like to ask the Taoiseach about rule of law issues, particularly following the rejection of Poland's constitutional court of the supremacy of EU law.  This is certainly a threat to the European Union given that EU law has primacy over national law, including constitutional provisions.  What can be done about this?  For example, can Covid recovery funds be withheld from Poland?  In my view, it would not be in the interests of the EU were Poland to leave the European Union.

That was very significant.  The motion set out where the democratic majority in the North stands when it comes to these matters.  The motion, as adopted, acknowledged the support of MLAs for the inclusion of the views of the North's elected representatives and stakeholders' views on matters relating to the protocol and the broader peace process.<\/p>  <p>  Following on from the Taoiseach's previous response to me, one of the issues Sinn F&eacute;in has been consistently raising is the need for Northern voices to be heard throughout the Brexit process.  The Taoiseach will recall that in the post-Brexit scenario we argued for political representation in the European Parliament for the North.  Unfortunately, this was rejected by the previous Government.  We have made a number of practical proposals for the here and now, such as securing observer status for MEPs from the North, representation at the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee, the ability of Executive members to participate in meetings of the Council of Ministers as part of the Irish delegation and the ability of civil servants from the North to participate in Council working groups where there are very clear all-Ireland dimensions.  The European Commission proposals for a more structured dialogue with the North and its political leaders is very welcome.

The Archbishop of Krakow has described it as \"a rainbow plague that is worse than Bolshevism\".  There is a certain trend in terms of analogies.  At a national level, there have been restrictions on the right of LGBTQ people to adopt, but the latest is a series of attacks at a regional level, whereby regional councils, overwhelmingly including the ruling party, Law and Justice, have passed resolutions declaring themselves so-called LGBT ideology-free zones.
