Their deaths are a huge loss to us all, or as Theo Dorgan - the Taoiseach is aware he is an another Corkman - so eloquently put it, we are so much poorer for their absence and so much richer for their lives and for their work.<\/p>  <p>  Today, the Cabinet has announced plans for further easing of restrictions.  Covid is a horrendous virus and it is still with us.  Thankfully, our population is largely vaccinated and this should allow us to proceed safely back to normal, but our healthcare capacity leaves us vulnerable.  The crisis that we face now is a hospital bed and capacity crisis.  Science has done its bit, medical professionals have done more than their bit, but the Government has failed to step up.<\/p>  <p>  Here are the facts.  Hospitals across the State are seeing record levels of overcrowding.  Emergency departments are overflowing.  The trolley count is rising.  It is 416 today.  Health waiting lists now stand at almost 1 million waiting for care, and almost a quarter of a million of those have been waiting for more than 18 months.  Yet, in the face of this crisis, and increasing Covid numbers, the response of the Government in the budget was not one single additional inpatient bed.  Not one.  How are we to make it through the winter?  How will burnt-out, front-line workers cope?  How will the health service survive?  The Government's approach means that for the remainder of this year and the entirety of next year, we will have no additional inpatient hospital beds.  Is the Taoiseach seriously suggesting that no additional inpatient beds are needed until 2023?<\/p> <p>The crisis is now, the overcrowding is happening now, the trolley count rises now and waiting lists are growing.  Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha of the INMO has said of our hospitals: &ldquo;They cannot cope today, they won't be coping tonight and they won't be coping tomorrow.\"  This is a very stark warning and the Taoiseach needs to listen.<\/p> <p> None of this has come out of the blue.  The Taoiseach has to have known that this crisis would hit our hospitals hard in the wintertime.  Indeed, last July, Sinn F&eacute;in and our colleague, Deputy David Cullinane, called for planning for the winter to start then.  We urged the Government to prepare for what was to come.  We called for an additional 600 inpatient beds and the recruitment of staff to service those beds and we repeated that call in our budget.  The Taoiseach chooses to ignore those calls.  He chooses not to properly invest in and resource our hospitals, and that leaves us exposed again.  So, now, the chickens come home to roost, and it is patients, hospital staff and wider society who pay the heavy price.  T&aacute; &aacute;r n-ospid&eacute;il faoi bhr&uacute; ollmh&oacute;r.

I want him to provide the investment needed, increase the number of beds in our hospitals, relieve the overcrowding and lift the intense, unbearable pressure on front-line staff, who are now beyond breaking point.  This must be a central plank in the Government's response to the Covid-19 crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900003#A00200","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634648700,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue.  I also join the House in expressing our sympathies to the families of the late M&aacute;ire Mhac an tSaoi - b'fhile den scoth &iacute; a rinne an-chuid ar son &aacute;r dteanga dh&uacute;chais - Brendan Kennelly, Paddy Moloney and Tony MacMahon, artists and musicians who enriched our lives in a wonderful way.<\/p>  <p>  I think the fundamental premise of the Deputy&rsquo;s question is wrong.  The driver of our responses over the last two years in terms of health, and public health in particular, has been the Covid virus itself and the various mutations.  The Alpha mutation earlier this year had a devastating impact on us.  Likewise, now, the Delta variant is even more transmissible than the Alpha variant, and it has had a very significant impact globally and in this country in terms of the incidence of cases in terms of hospitalisation, ICU admissions and mortality.<\/p>  <p>  Thankfully, because of vaccination and a very effective, efficient and well-run vaccination programme, we have achieved up to 93% vaccination.  The vaccines are very effective in preventing severe illness, hospitalisation and admission to ICU, and in terms of mortality and preventing death.  However, over time, in terms of protecting against infection itself, it is not as strong as it would be in terms of the cases I have just outlined.  Therefore, there is a need for a booster campaign.  That was the key recommendation from NIAC yesterday, which the Government will implement immediately.  It will be the administration of the booster vaccine to the over-60s which will help us in holding back the impact of Covid.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of hospital beds, close to 938 beds are due to be delivered by the end of this year.  The Deputy has ignored completely in her presentation the fact that well over 900 beds have been budgeted for and have been provided for, with the follow-through provided for this year in terms of the staffing, for example.  That was the largest bed increase ever in one year in terms of hospital capacity.  Likewise, in terms of ICU, again, there has been a substantial 25% increase in ICU beds over the last two years.  It is close to 300 now and it will get to 321 by the end of this year or, at the latest, very early next year.  These are very substantial increases both in ICU and bed capacity.<\/p>  <p>  The situation as advised to us by NPHET is that, in all age groups now, people are getting infected.  While we are reopening, we are doing so in a very cautious way, with the vaccination certificate at the heart of the protective measures that need to be taken.<\/p> <p>The Deputy opposed tooth and nail the vaccination certificate provisions that were introduced the previous time in this House to facilitate access to hospitality.  She and her colleagues very strongly opposed that, yet it was the key to opening hospitality and it was advised by NPHET that this was what we should do.  NPHET is now advising the same in respect of the remaining elements of hospitality.  Conscious of the growth in incidence levels, it is very anxious that, where practical, appropriate and where it makes sense, a range of protective measures be introduced, the most critical being that the vaccination certificate be applied across the board, together with due diligence by operators and consumers.  That is the key issue.  We will be increasing staff in the health service by another 8,000 this year.  There is going to be no let-up in the investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900004#B00200","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634649000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Covid is a terrible virus and sickness, and it is with us to stay.  The level of vaccination, at more than 90%, is extremely high.  As I said, science has done its job and the medical professionals have done theirs.  The Government now needs to do its job.  The fact is that the lack of capacity within our health service leaves us vulnerable still.  It means there is a panic right across society when infection levels, hospitalisations and ICU admissions rise.  That is all down to capacity.<\/p>  <p>  I put it to the Taoiseach that the Government did not make additional provision for as much as one new inpatient bed in the budget.  That is a fact.  Provision was made for 19 new ICU beds, but that is a drop in the ocean.  Everybody knows that at the heart of our dilemma, with a highly vaccinated population and people doing their best and being very thoughtful and cautious, we are still left with this huge vulnerability in terms of healthcare and hospital capacity.

With just three days to go before many businesses that have been closed for nearly two years are due to open, the rules are being rewritten.  We all accept that the rates of Covid transmission can surge very quickly and can be unpredictable.  What is predictable, however, is that we know without a shadow of doubt how the disease is spread.  It is airborne.  Businesses have been given absolutely no guidance on the manner in which they can improve ventilation and make their premises safer.  Air filtration units, for example, could be rolled out to schools for as little as &euro;12 million, but they have not been issued.  Nightclub and music venue owners are going to get advice at the last possible moment on how they can open their businesses.<\/p> <p>All indoor businesses where people congregate should have been given guidance on ventilation months ago.<\/p> <p> The Taoiseach said yesterday that he is a great fan of antigen testing and that came as a surprise to many of us because there is no evidence that anyone in government is a fan of such testing.  We are told that the continued reopening is to a large extent contingent on antigen testing being rolled out to scale.  Why was that not done before?  How will this massive surge in the use of antigen testing work, given that almost zero prior planning has been done for that?<\/p> <p> We are told that people can dance in nightclubs, for example, but that they cannot go to the bar for a drink.  It is confusing; people could probably dance to the bar.  In his address earlier the Taoiseach attempted to defray the blame by talking about personal responsibility.  Irish people have been brilliant in what they have done and we would all agree on that.  They got vaccinated in their droves and stayed at home when they were told to do so.  There are other issues of planning at play and we have always been in an emergency.  There is also the issue of the creaking hospital capacity.  We are 20 months into the disaster and there is a modest target of an increase of 66 ICU beds this year.  That target has not been met and there has been no mention of additional capacity in this year's budget.<\/p> <p> Would the Taoiseach accept that there has been a failure to plan and that we are back at an emergency stage in the opening of businesses and the criteria being applied?  There has been a failure to accept that this is an airborne virus.  The ads that are being shown at the moment instruct people to wash their hands.  The evidence is not that the virus is transmitted by touch but that it is an airborne virus.  Why has the necessary attention not been placed on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900005#C01900","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634649600,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Every debate we have when restrictions come in or go out is the same.  I recall a debate in the D&aacute;il before the summer on the measure that enabled us to open hospitality, namely, the vaccination service.  It was a heated debate with Members opposite saying it was the worst thing we could possibly do, yet it enabled the reopening of hospitality, including restaurants and pubs.  Has anybody on the Opposition side said we got that wrong or have they said they were confused or that they gave an incoherent message?  The Opposition always tries to pick holes although I acknowledge that there are difficulties and challenges, particularly for the sectors concerned.<\/p><p>Covid does not respect weekly decision-making on a precision basis.  In our conversations with public health officials two weeks ago, this scenario was not on the horizon.  The case numbers have taken a turn for the worse and we have to respond.  It is as simple as that.  We could have decided to pause everything and not open anything afresh.  NPHET stated that it:<\/p> <blockquote> \tDid not believe it tenable that any pause now would result in a further easing of measures in November.  The NPHET has therefore recommended that on balance:<br \/><br \/>... the remaining aspects of the hospitality, entertainment and night-time economy sector can reopen only with the full range of protective measures in place and the wide and robust implementation of the COVID-19 pass.  In this regard, guidance should be developed or updated as appropriate by the relevant sectors. <\/blockquote>  <p>NPHET goes on to list all the various measures and uses the phrase, &quot;including the appropriate use of masks, physical distancing, ventilation, and mitigation measures&quot;.  That is what is in NPHET's letter and it is now saying it does not see those measures being removed until February 2022.  The measures must be implemented where appropriate and there has to be practical application of this in different settings.<\/p><p>Members will raise all the anomalies and ask why one thing can be done in one setting and another thing cannot be done in another setting.  Those anomalies will arise in scenarios like this but the key point is that anything we have reopened so far has stayed open.  Despite what some lobbies are saying, these restrictions have not inhibited a lot of activity because the Revenue and the VAT receipts are showing that a lot is going on in many sectors because of the reopening of society and the economy.  It is better to try to proceed with reopening, albeit with restrictions that people will find frustrating.<\/p> <p>It is because of the virus's turn for the worse that there is a timeline problem for the sector.  I acknowledge that and the need for guidance and the need to engage with the sector and to do practical, sensible things to enable reopening and to enable the facilitation of plans that sectors that up to now had been closed have in place.  We have got to work with sectors to do that.  The same applies to the return to work.

That is an incredible fact for a publicly owned agency.  This report confirmed and provided further detail on information that I had received in reply to a parliamentary question recently.  When it is all added together, the situation is even more shocking and disgraceful.  NAMA is still in possession of 577 acres of residential land that is suitable for delivering housing.  In the answer to my question, it was confirmed that NAMA was in possession of 50 units that were sitting vacant and that it also had 1,400 units under construction, 4,600 units with planning permission, 7,500 where planning applications had been submitted or were in preparation, and 8,500 units at pre-planning stage.

How can the Government possibly allow a situation where a public agency is contributing to the housing crisis, is facilitating the property developers and, in some cases, as also confirmed in the response to the parliamentary question, is selling houses to these property investors who then lease them back to the local authorities, for which the Government is paying astronomical amounts of public money to these entities?

NAMA has in the past offered social housing to the State through the local authorities and so forth, some of which was taken up by local authorities and some of which was not taken up because of the local authorities' views in terms of the suitability of the particular housing that might have been offered by NAMA at that time.<\/p>  <p>  The Housing for All strategy commits approximately &euro;4 billion per annum by the State.

The Government refuses to tell NAMA to deliver all it can, namely, 24,000 homes, which would contribute enormously to alleviating the housing crisis.  It refuses also to tell the agency that it must deliver all that as exclusively public and genuinely affordable housing, instead of what it is currently doing, which is selling it to profit-hungry investors who are driving the price of property and rent through the roof and contributing to the housing crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900008#F00300","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634650500,"counter":38,"content":"<p>NAMA represents the taxpayer.

I used to think the oft-quoted Fianna F&aacute;il reflection on Government as \"senior hurling\" was about political competition, the training and effort taken, the resilience and gumption required and the skill of our national sport, not that our Cabinet members tog out in their individual county jerseys.  The mean-spirited question I have for the Taoiseach, for which I apologise in advance, is whether he is a Cork Taoiseach or a Taoiseach who just happens to be from Cork.<\/p>  <p>  I ask this grim but important question because we are now half way into his term as Taoiseach and in that time we have seen two budgets and the revised national development plan.  I remind the Taoiseach of a pre-election promise he made to the people of the south east in 2016.  He promised to provide 24-7 cardiac care to the south east region.  That year he stood for a picture on the grounds of University Hospital Waterford, UHW, with his candidate and all his Fianna F&aacute;il councillors and committed to delivering 24-7 services.  That picture was at the centre of the Taoiseach's 2016 campaign.  It was the photo that restored a seat to his party in Waterford.  The Taoiseach did not stand and promise another study, review or investigation.  He deliberately stood on the grounds of UHW and committed to deliver a long-promised life-saving service and one which is available to people in every region of the country except those of us in the south east.<\/p>  <p>  In the preceding general election of 2011, Enda Kenny pledged the south east a full university and with that promise he took half of the seats in the region, that is, seven out of 14.  However, in power, he resiled from that promise.  His party, Fine Gael, now has just two of those 14 seats while we in the region were left pick up the massive economic and social costs of that lost decade.  This is heartbreaking when we see Grangegorman springing to life.<\/p>  <p>  At this point in time, the Taoiseach's legacy in the south east is from his time as Minister for Education when, under pressure from Cork, he undid the institute of technology upgrade in 1997.<\/p> <p>In the south-east region and in Waterford, Enda Kenny's legacy is entirely framed by his unkept promise, his broken word.  I have a simple question for the Taoiseach.  Will there be a 24-7 cardiac care service, a service available in every other region in Ireland, in the south east before he leaves the Taoiseach's office?  Will he be keeping his promise?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900009#G01000","speaker":"1616","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634650800,"counter":48,"content":"<p>When I was a history student, the first thing I was told was that one should always endeavour to be objective in terms of one's historical narrative, to try to see all sides of the story and the equation and not to view things through the prism of one's own narrow perspective or partisan view of things.  I recall that when I was the Minister for Education and Science, many of the institutes of technology or the then regional technical colleges were looking for status upgrades and so on.  I recall looking at the plant, at the actual buildings, and saying that it would be better to invest substantially in the capacity of the colleges.  My legacy in Waterford was buying the additional land which has guaranteed, since the late 1990s, the very significant expansion of Waterford Institute of Technology to such an extent that, under international peer review, it can compete to be a university and will become a technological university.  That is the way universities should become universities.  It should not be at the whim of politicians arriving at some platform and announcing that they are going to make a body into a university, with no regard for capacity or a whole range of investments that should happen in advance.  That is the approach I took as Minister for Education and Science.  We had a binary system but we set up a peer review and have provided for technological universities to happen.  Successive Ministers have progressed the idea of developing institutes of technology into technological universities and doing so in a way that is fair and that has credibility internationally.  When it has credibility internationally, the region benefits in terms of more investment.  The Waterford Institute of Technology has really advanced over the last decade or two and has developed significant specialties, not least in the areas of enterprise and industry and quite a number of foreign direct investments have occurred as a result of that.<\/p>  <p>  I would say that the time has come to talk up Waterford and its third level institution because it has a lot to commend itself.  That is what I would do.  I have great belief in that institute and I believe that along with Carlow Institute of Technology, it is going to become a technological university, which is great for the region.  We are committed to doing that and to the consequential investments that will be required of the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of the hospital, Deputy Shanahan's constituency colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Butler, has been tenacious and alongside the Deputy and others, is determined to advance the situation with regard to the cath lab and cardiac cover.  The programme for Government commits to the delivery of a second cath lab in University Hospital Waterford.  Funding has been allocated and the contractor for the construction of the new lab was formally appointed in March.  The project commenced in May of this year, with a work programme of around 13 months.

Other promises in the programme for Government are being kept, despite the incredible challenges of Covid but if the Taoiseach's promise on 24\/7 cardiac care for the south east is not kept then politics in this country is broken, frankly.  There are huge swaths of the country that feel unrepresented by the current Cork-Dublin Cabinet.  Reasonable and necessary things, life-saving things like 24\/7 cardiac care in the south east, are not being delivered and cannot get done.  The Taoiseach is halfway into his term at this stage but he still has time if he decides to take action.

Sir David was so needlessly murdered while meeting with and serving his own constituents last Friday in Southend-on-Sea.  Holding clinics is something we as elected representatives do as part of our public service to the communities we serve.  Face-to-face interaction with constituents is what makes our job worthwhile and fruitful.  It is a crucial part of our democracy and we should do our utmost to protect and continue it.  Sir David's murder was an attack on democracy.  I was struck at how all Members of Westminster spoke so highly and kindly of Sir David, at how he had numerous friends across all parties and was described as someone who was exceptionally decent, down to earth and hard-working.  One could not but be moved by the extraordinary expressions of solidarity and friendship from his constituents and the people he served, who spoke about him so eloquently.  It is a wonderful legacy as a politician to have that.

More than 8,000 people are living in emergency accommodation.  If we were in a situation where we had enough zoned land to provide 253,000 homes for people, that would be very significant.  In fact, there is enough zoned land to provide homes for 250,000 people.  According to the Government, we have more than 8,000 ha of such land.  What we do not have are proper measures in place to facilitate the provision of housing there.  For example, we do not have an effective tax on land-hoarding, although the Government has undertaken in the budget to introduce a tax of 3% on zoned land.<\/p><p>Without proper data on land, including who owns it, what price they paid for it, how much it has increased in value before they sell it, and how long they hold or hoard it for, it is not possible for the best and most effective measures to be introduced by the Government and this House.  A land price register would provide that information in order that the most effective measures could be taken.  It would also create transparency around land, including a particular insight into the costs of land, which is very important in terms of construction costs.  We know we have some of the most expensive construction costs in Ireland.  We also know that the cost of building materials here is in line with that in comparable European countries, the cost of labour is slightly lower than in some of those states and professional fees are on a par.  What we do not know is what is happening with land prices, which means we do not know what is happening in terms of developers' profits and margins.  We are not in a position to assess that information independently; instead, we are entirely reliant on industry and development sources.<\/p><p>This Bill, if introduced, will give clarity around developer profits and construction costs.  That will be important not just for taking effective measures but also for reducing the cost of housing and making it more affordable.  It is an important measure in terms of the tools we need to address housing provision and affordability.  It will create a publicly accessible land price register, much like the residential property price register, and that information will be important.  The Government's decision as to whether it backs this Bill on Second Stage and facilitates its progression through the Houses quickly and efficiently will show which side it is on.  If the Government is serious about addressing housing, including issues around land-hoarding, prices and speculation, then this Bill offers a ready-made measure.

The shared island unit in my Department acts as a driver and co-ordinator of this whole-of-government initiative.  On 4 October, as part of the revised national development plan, NDP, the Government announced significant additional funding and an increased level of ambition for collaborative cross-Border public investment.  The shared island dimension of the NDP sets out our investment priorities for the decade ahead to work through all-island partnerships and build a more connected, prosperous and sustainable island for all.<\/p><p>Under the plan, total all-island investment through the extended shared island fund, the Project Ireland 2040 funds, the Government's annual funding for North-South co-operation and the PEACE PLUS programme, delivered with the EU, UK and Northern Ireland Executive, is more than &euro;3.5 billion.  Under the NDP, the Government has committed to allocate ring-fenced, multi-annual capital resourcing for all-island investment out to 2030, at least at the current level of the shared island fund.  The Government is making allocations from the fund to deliver our commitments and objectives on a shared island.  Progress so far this year includes funding to deliver phase 2 of the Ulster Canal and commence development work on phase 3, commencement of an all-island strategic rail review, shared island funding to progress the Narrow Water Bridge project to tender stage, and the launch and commencement of the new North-South research programme.  The latter will see &euro;40 million allocated from the shared island fund over five years to support the deepening of links between higher education institutions, researchers and research communities.  As part of my visit to Belfast on 8 October, I heard from research leaders at Queen's University about the strong interest in, and beneficial all-island impacts we will see from, the programme.  The Government will continue to develop investment and co-operation initiatives to enhance our shared island, implementing our objectives as set out in the programme for Government and the NDP.<\/p><p>To support the Government's agenda for deeper co-operation and connection on the island, the shared island unit in my Department has commissioned a comprehensive research programme, working with the Economic and Social Research Institute, the National Economic and Social Council, the Irish Research Council and other partners.  Research will be published in the final quarter of this year and in 2022, focused on opportunities to deepen co-operation across a range of economic, social and environmental domains.  At the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, in July, it was agreed to commence a work stream on shared island issues of interest for trade unions and employers within LEEF's remit of economic and employment issues relevant to the labour market.<\/p><p>I initiated the shared island dialogue series to foster inclusive civic dialogue on our shared future that engages all communities on the island.  I addressed the first shared island dialogue with young people in November.  Dialogues on climate and environment, civil society engagement, equality, economic recovery on the island, and health have been held this year, with participation by Ministers.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>On 1 October, a dialogue was held on the future of education on a shared island, with participation by the Minister for Education, the Minister of State at the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, and more than 130 education and civil society stakeholders.  The dialogues are bringing together more than 1,000 civic representatives this year in different sectors and across all regions, communities and traditions to discuss how we can better work together for a shared future.  Further dialogues will be announced shortly and the series will continue next year. <\/p><p>These dialogues are proving to be positive, practical, forward-looking discussions on the opportunities and challenges we face in striving for a more reconciled future on the island.  They are also affirming the breadth of common ground, solidarity and readiness to work together there is in communities across this island, while not shying away from hard questions.  Exciting projects are emerging from the dialogues, such as a newly established all-island women's forum, bringing together women leaders from across the island to address under-representation and further develop women's role in peacebuilding and civic society.<\/p><p>The Government will continue to prioritise and resource our shared island agenda for ambitious, practical co-operation, investment and civic engagement, focused on common concerns for the people of this island and building a shared future, underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900019#R02800","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1634654700,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.

There needs to be a particular focus to ensure we get a fair drawdown from the shared island fund.  Those counties, both North and South, face particular challenges due to Brexit that are well documented in research and they also face challenges due to the pandemic that we have not seen the downside of yet.

There is a great opportunity for the State to lead here based on the generous proposals of the European Commission last week on the Northern Irish protocol and the withdrawal agreement and to harness the true potential of the shared economic opportunities available to the entire island.  That is crucially important.  More practically, there is a political role to be played here due to the abdication of responsibility by certain parties in Northern Ireland towards the North-South Ministerial Council.

In the South we are governed by the Industrial Relations Act 1990, which banned political strikes, solidarity actions, solidarity strikes and secondary picketing, and which restricted workers' rights to organise.  In the North, workers and trade unionists face Thatcher era legislation with similar effect.  The power to change these laws has been devolved to Stormont for more than 20 years but none of the parties in the Executive has attempted to change them.  This is why People Before Profit MLA, Gerry Carroll, has introduced the trade union freedom Bill, which would scrap those restrictions and give power back to workers to organise.  It would allow workers to take solidarity action, make it simpler for workers to take industrial action and give workers greater rights to organise in trade unions.  It is mirrored by the similar Bill that People Before Profit has introduced on First Stage in the D&aacute;il, the Trade Union Recognition Bill.

The establishment of the all-Ireland women's forum is welcome, as is the diversity of its membership.  The shared island unit could play a role in addressing what was described by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, as the scourge of domestic and gender-based violence, which is a particular issue for Border counties.  There are purpose-built refuges for victims of domestic violence in Cavan or Monaghan, for example.  Last week, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, conceded that he does not know if a refuge will be established next year in either county.  Without a budget provision, we can be sure that it will not be delivered.

The first question from Deputy Brendan Smith was on the central Border area and the need for the shared island fund to focus on that area.  The Deputy has spoken to me about the geopark and I have asked my officials to investigate that and to engage with him.  We are open to projects in the area of climate change and biodiversity and this project would add value to the dialogue series we have already had on those issues.  It is in the arena of initiatives that have been undertaken by the unit, working with local interests in Cavan and Fermanagh and across that central Border area that the Deputy so consistently raises.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Richmond raised the economic recovery dialogue and the protocol.  We have identified a potential partnership between Derry and Letterkenny in respect of city deals and enterprise parks on both sides of the Border that would be joined and that would have a common governance oversight which could create jobs and facilitate economic development in that area.  The North West Strategic Growth Partnership is strong and it acts irrespective of politics across all divides and I met the group.  Both county councils are on it and they are focused on an economic agenda in the north west.  We are anxious to support them in any way we possibly can and one of those areas is the common enterprise park in that locality.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the protocol, and Deputy Alan Farrell also raised the lack of participation between the North and the South.  The shared island unit is without prejudice to people's constitutional positions and, therefore, it has received a broad welcome.  Some parties are cautious in their engagement but there is no such caution in civil society and those in business and industry are also engaging.<\/p>  <p>  On industrial relations, the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, had a plenary meeting on 5 July.  That is the forum for Government to engage with representatives from employers and trade unions.  It has developed a work stream to look at shared island issues, labour market dynamics and deepening understanding of all-island labour market issues.  These issues include: opportunities and impediments for firms; issues facing frontier workers such as remote work and related issues; further and higher education; training and skills; and so on.  There is a healthy workers' agenda in place there.<\/p>  <p>  On Deputy Durkan's point, I see huge potential.  I met representatives of Queen's University Belfast last Friday week, which was interesting.  It has an all-island tissue bank as well as the all-island cancer consortium and a whole range of research that has an all-island relevance.  That means the more than &euro;40 million funding we have allocated has an all-island benefit.  It will knit together academics and researchers on the entire island, irrespective of geography, with a common pursuit to develop science for the benefit of all.<\/p> <p> In terms of domestic and gender-based violence, which Deputy Carthy referenced, we have had some outcomes through the dialogue series.  One of the existing projects that has emerged from the dialogue on women is the newly established all-island women's forum.  That is bringing together women leaders from across the island to address under-representation and further develop women's role in peace building and civic society.  I would like to think that there is an opportunity in this to look at the domestic and gender-based violence issue as well and come forward with proposals around it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900020#S00700","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements","time":1634655900,"counter":186,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900021#T00200"},{"type":"question","time":1634655900,"counter":187,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[43741\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900021#T00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his recent visit to Oxford to meet with the British-Irish Association, BIA.

That is a welcome move away from the use of terms such as \"divisive\" in respect of those who advocate that we should be moving towards Irish unity.  The Good Friday Agreement provides for that and discussions are already taking place across civic society.  In this the centenary year of the absolute disaster that was partition, there is a particular onus.  Will the Taoiseach allow for a citizens' assembly to take place that would allow people of all backgrounds and views to come together and discuss how we can capture the full potential that Irish unity presents?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900021#T00900","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1634655900,"counter":194,"content":"<p>First, I thank the Deputies again for their interest and for raising these issues.  In respect of Deputy Haughey's points, every political party and movement has its aspirations in terms of the constitutional future of the island, including Northern Ireland, and that is as it should be.  I have no issue at all in articulating that.  Our party, which is the party that I lead, has a clear view in terms of the unity of the people of Ireland, and we have shared that on numerous occasions.  Equally, we have been a party that has been to the forefront in advancing progress, particularly throughout the totality of relationships - the British-Irish relationship, the North-South relationship and the relationships between the different traditions on the island - and culminating in the Good Friday Agreement, which is an agreement that we still need to maximise the potential of on a whole range of fronts.<\/p>  <p>  The main point, which Deputy Haughey referenced in his question, that I wanted to get across was the need for an absence of unilateralism in terms of any one party's approach to legacy issues or, indeed, the protocol.  I made that point specifically to the British Government during that speech and through the medium of that speech.  There cannot be unilateralism in respect of legacy issues because there was agreement between all parties and Governments in respect of legacy issues.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of the protocol, there is a facility within the withdrawal agreement for that to be resolved through joint committees and so on.  We have worked hard.  Vice President &Scaron;ef\u010dovi\u010d of the Commission has worked very hard and has come forward with what I think is a very imaginative set of proposals that has the potential to unblock the issues around the operation of the protocol.  I think it is in the best interests of all in Northern Ireland that the talks be progressed now in a proactive and constructive way to make sure that we can get the best outcome for the people in Northern Ireland in respect of the operation of the protocol.  That means continued access to the Single Market of the European Union, which is a huge prize for everyone living on the island.  North-South trade is very important and has continued to grow in the aftermath of the protocol.  Equally, businesses in Northern Ireland should have access to the UK and the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of amnesties, I agree with what has been said by Deputy Brendan Smith.  The perpetrators of violence, particularly those who were engaged in the murder and maiming of people, cannot get away with it and they must know that they will be subject to investigation.  Some of these cases are still being pursued and people can still bring forward information that would lead to a resolution of these cases.  I would urge people to come forward with information in respect of a lot of the unsolved cases where the families of victims, including the families who have lost loved ones, eagerly seek closure.  Different models are being discussed.  The British-Irish Council discussed this.  People have mentioned Operation Kenova.  I met all the parties last week, and some of them were instancing that as a useful model, but what is important is that whatever emerges be done in agreement between all parties and the two Governments without any unilateral move.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the issues Deputy Carthy raised, I will come back to him.  I do not know why my officials have not been in touch, but I will follow that up.  Regarding the idea of a citizens' assembly, these questions relate to the British-Irish Association and I have had a long engagement with the association since I was a backbench Deputy many years ago.<\/p> <p>I have spoken on many occasions of my experience at Corrymeela, for example, meeting with politicians from different traditions.  The citizens' assembly is a representative forum, in respect of which a particular number of people from different strata of society are selected by poll.  That is not how we will resolve Northern Ireland's issues.  I mean that genuinely.  We need constant, consistent engagement with people to work out issues.  A citizens' assembly, on its own, will not achieve this.  We need a constant interaction between Parliaments, community groups and political parties to get these issues resolved.  I genuinely believe that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900021#T01000","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634656500,"counter":196,"content":"<p>That is happening already.

What will be Ireland's approach to the strategic compass, having regard to our traditional policy of military neutrality?<\/p>  <p>  I would also like to ask the Taoiseach about rule of law issues, particularly following the rejection of Poland's constitutional court of the supremacy of EU law.  This is certainly a threat to the European Union given that EU law has primacy over national law, including constitutional provisions.  What can be done about this?  For example, can Covid recovery funds be withheld from Poland?  In my view, it would not be in the interests of the EU were Poland to leave the European Union.

The motion, as adopted, acknowledged the support of MLAs for the inclusion of the views of the North's elected representatives and stakeholders' views on matters relating to the protocol and the broader peace process.<\/p>  <p>  Following on from the Taoiseach's previous response to me, one of the issues Sinn F&eacute;in has been consistently raising is the need for Northern voices to be heard throughout the Brexit process.  The Taoiseach will recall that in the post-Brexit scenario we argued for political representation in the European Parliament for the North.  Unfortunately, this was rejected by the previous Government.  We have made a number of practical proposals for the here and now, such as securing observer status for MEPs from the North, representation at the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee, the ability of Executive members to participate in meetings of the Council of Ministers as part of the Irish delegation and the ability of civil servants from the North to participate in Council working groups where there are very clear all-Ireland dimensions.  The European Commission proposals for a more structured dialogue with the North and its political leaders is very welcome.

The Archbishop of Krakow has described it as \"a rainbow plague that is worse than Bolshevism\".  There is a certain trend in terms of analogies.  At a national level, there have been restrictions on the right of LGBTQ people to adopt, but the latest is a series of attacks at a regional level, whereby regional councils, overwhelmingly including the ruling party, Law and Justice, have passed resolutions declaring themselves so-called LGBT ideology-free zones.  In reality, they mean LGBT-free zones, which means that for LGBTQI+ people who are inevitably still there and present, being out would represent a serious danger to their health and their lives, that danger effectively being State-sanctioned violence.<\/p>  <p>  I want to send People Before Profit solidarity to LGBTQ+ activists in Poland and to socialists who are fighting against these attacks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900022#U01800","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1634656500,"counter":213,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Deputy Alan Kelly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900022#U01900","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speech","time":1634656500,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I am most definitely not Deputy Alan Kelly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900022#U02000","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1634656500,"counter":215,"content":"<p>My apologies; Deputy Kelly was next on the list.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900022#U02100","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speech","time":1634656500,"counter":216,"content":"<p>I just want to put that on the record.  When will the European Council set aside time to discuss an action plan to combat femicide?  In Ireland, the death toll mounts.

In Europe, in just 20 countries more than 1,000 femicides took place in 2018.  There is a shadow pandemic of violence against women.  How many femicides will Europe count when 2021 is done?  Action is being taken, but it is taking place from below.  Last Thursday, workers at a Mercedes plant in the Basque Country took strike action to protest the murder of their work colleague, Erika Tavares.  This was an inspiring act of worker solidarity.  I hope it provides an example for others to follow.  What action is the European Union establishment taking?

Deputy Haughey raised a range of issues in respect of the strategic compass, Afghanistan, cybersecurity and Slovenia and the western Balkans, which reflects his deep interest in European affairs.<\/p> <p> On the strategic compass, security and defence issues are still under consideration.  Deputy Haughey is correct to identify those issues as having caused significant debate at European level.  Indeed, at the dinner in Slovenia, the entire debate was about the role of Europe in international affairs.  The sudden pull-out from Afghanistan and the lack of proper dialogue with partners was one subject matter.  The AUKUS decision on nuclear submarines involving France, the US and the UK was another issue.  Therefore, there is a growing sense within some European Union member states of the need - France in particular advocates this - to develop a greater self-reliance within Europe.  That is not agreed.  Other member states, especially on the eastern European side, are very conscious of the benefits of NATO to their security given their history with Russia and so on.  They have NATO troops on the ground and were very clear in their articulation of the importance of that.  A discussion of a draft of the strategic compass is scheduled for a meeting of foreign and defence ministers in November.  It is expected to be on the agenda of the European Council in March 2022.<\/p> <p> On the security and defence policy more broadly, it provides the EU with the capacity to conduct peacekeeping and conflict prevention missions and to strengthen international security in accordance with the principles of UN Charter.  We have participated in and will only participate in Permanent Structured Cooperation, PESCO, projects, for example, that contribute to the enhancement of capabilities for UN mandated missions engaged in peacekeeping, conflict prevention or the strengthening of international security in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.  Ireland is currently participating in one PESCO project, the Greek-led upgrade of maritime surveillance, and we have confirmed observer status on a further nine projects, including military mobility, cyber threats and incident response information sharing platforms.  We will keep that under ongoing review.<\/p> <p> As the Deputy knows, we have a legally binding Irish protocol to the Lisbon treaty which states the treaty does not affect or prejudice Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality.  That continues to be our policy but that does not mean we should not or cannot take a position in the face of, for example, cyberattacks, terrorism or extremism.  We need to share knowledge and expertise on those threats and so we must work in co-operation with EU partners in that context.<\/p> <p> On the rule of law issue Deputy Haughey and others have raised, it is a very serious issue that the Polish Constitutional Tribunal ruled that aspects of Articles 1 and 19 of the Treaty of the European Union are incompatible with the Polish Constitution.  The Union is a union of law and values.  Acceptance of the primacy of European Union law is an essential criterion for membership of the EU and the existence and prosperity of our Single Market and upholding of our common values are both predicated on respect for this core principle.  It is important for the EU to have the necessary tools to monitor the rule of law across member states and respond effectively to challenges where they arise.<\/p> <p> The multi-annual financial framework, MFF, Next Generation EU recovery fund package finalised last December requires member states allocated funding from the EU budget to respect the rule of law.  We have consistently expressed the view the conditionality regulation to protect the EU budget is fair, proportionate and serves a legitimate, important purpose.  We respect the decision of Poland and Hungary to request the Court of Justice review the conditionality mechanism's compatibility with EU law but we do not share their view on this.  We believe the regulation was adopted on a correct legal basis and achieves necessary balance between fairness to member states and installing a more rigorous regime for proper disbursement of the EU's budget.  Ireland is one of ten EU states to have made an intervention in the case in favour of the regulation's validity.  The point is that this is the mechanism by which we can get some traction on adherence to the rule of law within the European Union.<\/p> <p> Proceedings in relation to Hungary and Poland under Article 7 of the Treaty of the European Union are ongoing and there have been a number of hearing at the General Affairs Council.  Ireland supports the continuation of Article 7 proceedings.  We hope discussions at Council level can continue towards a constructive resolution.  I believe this will come up at this week's meeting.  It would be improbable that it would not.  That will be an issue for our agenda.<\/p> <p> On the western Balkans, we agree on the accession programme.  It has gone on for too long and too slowly.  We have benefited from the European Union journey.  We formally joined the EU in 1973 and we have benefited enormously from it.  We believe the western Balkan countries deserve the same.  I had bilateral meetings with Prime Minister Edi Rama of Albania and Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of North Macedonia.  Both are very frustrated or disappointed that the summit did not open the way for accession talks with their countries to begin.  There is an issue between Bulgaria and North Macedonia.  We hope that can get resolved before Christmas.  The electoral cycle might have had an impact there.<\/p> <p> We are a long-standing supporter of an EU pathway for the western Balkan countries.  I agree with the Deputy that it would be transformative for stability and peace in the region and also transformative for the countries concerned.  We were unequivocal in our articulation of that at the meeting in Slovenia, which was held last week or the week before.  The weeks are coming fast.  That is what we did in relation to that.<\/p> <p> I appreciate Deputy Carthy's providing information on the Assembly.  Vice-President &Scaron;ef\u010dovi\u010d's proposals are very generous and imaginative.  He listened to people on the ground.  He also has provision in his proposals for greater stakeholder involvement and engagement in relation to the protocol issue into the future so that people can have access to Europe and European institutions so that people can hear the on-the-ground concerns people have, particularly in relation to the operation of the protocol itself.<\/p> <p> Brexit was a mistake in our view.  We respect the decision of the United Kingdom to secede from the European Union but we think the repercussions were not fully thought through and have had damaging consequences.  Potentially, in respect of the island of Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement, Brexit has created difficulties and challenges.  In that respect, we need to resolve this issue and then, in the aftermath of resolving it, we need to develop a sensible post-Brexit relationship and a framework for that bilateral relationship between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  That is an objective of ours.  It is important we get the protocol issue resolved and then move on from that.  I appeal to the UK Government and the EU to do everything they possibly can to get this resolved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900022#U02300","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634657100,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach.

EU-Singapore relations go back several decades and are built on a long history of friendship and close historical, political and economic ties.  This partnership and co-operation agreement, PCA, will strengthen the EU's partnership with Singapore, providing the basis for more effective bilateral engagement by strengthening political dialogue and enhancing co-operation across a broad range of areas, of both agreement and friction.  It should be noted that the PCA is a separate agreement to the EU-Singapore free trade agreement, FTA, and the EU-Singapore investment protection agreement, IPA.  I ask Deputies to bear this in mind in their consideration of this motion.  I will now take some time to outline the nature of our partnership with Singapore before discussing the PCA and its benefits in greater detail.<\/p> <p> As small, outwardly focused countries with strong commitments to multilateralism and the rule of law, Ireland and Singapore are natural partners.  The Ireland-Singapore trading relationship is particularly strong.  Having successfully positioned itself as the gateway to south-east Asia and an attractive location for foreign direct investment, FDI, in the region, Singapore has an exceptionally high level of human development and is considered one of the Asian tiger economies.  As a founder member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN, Singapore has advanced the cause of regional multilateralism in south-east Asia.<\/p> <p> Singapore's relationship with the EU goes back decades and the EU views the city state as central to its engagement in south-east Asia.  This partnership, built on shared values and a commitment to a peaceful and prosperous world, is one that both sides have sought to strengthen in recent years.  In the context of increasing great power competition and tension, the EU is appreciative of Singapore's contribution to regional and global security.  Singapore and the EU are like-minded on issues such as supporting freedom of navigation and overflights in the South China Sea, through which one third of global shipping passes.  Singapore is a key partner in responding to humanitarian disasters in south-east Asia and shares many of the EU's approaches to issues such as the humanitarian and political crisis in Myanmar.<\/p> <p> Ireland and Singapore have a long history of diplomatic relations and co-operation dating back to 1974.  Trade and economics also feature prominently.  The importance of the Asia Pacific region to Ireland is evidenced by the Government's Asia Pacific strategy to 2025 which sets out the framework for growing our political, economic and people-to-people relationships in the region.  The Asia Pacific region is home to more than 4 billion people and is the primary engine of the global economy, contributing more than 60% of global growth.  Between 2008 and 2018, Ireland's two-way trade with the Asia Pacific region more than doubled from &euro;23 billion to &euro;56 billion and despite the impact of Covid, we are on course to increase this to more than &euro;100 billion by 2025.  <\/p> <p> Singapore is an important economic partner and priority market for Ireland in Asia, with just under &euro;1 billion in two-way merchandise trade last year, a figure which increased in comparison with 2019 despite the impact of Covid.  Ireland has continued to maintain a trade surplus with Singapore.  The latest figures on trade in services show exports to Singapore in the region of &euro;2.7 billion which is more than our exports of services to Canada and only marginally less than our export of services to the whole of the African continent.<\/p> <p> Singapore is also an important base for Irish companies and our State agencies operating in this dynamic and opportunity filled region.  Currently 120 Enterprise Ireland client companies have operations in Singapore, mainly in sectors such as ICT, financial services, pharmaceuticals, food and beverages, and aviation.  Our embassy in Singapore operates alongside Bord Bia, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.  With this strong team Ireland presence, I am optimistic we will see continued growth in our relationship in the coming period.  Finally, it is worth noting that approximately 4,000 to 5,000 Irish people are resident in Singapore.<\/p> <p> The PCA is a mixed-competence agreement which was negotiated alongside the EU-Singapore FTA and IPA.  The FTA entered into force in November 2019 following its endorsement by member states.  The IPA will enter into force following ratification by each EU member state according to its own procedures.  As such, the D&aacute;il will have an opportunity to discuss all aspects of the IPA when it is brought for consideration in due course.<\/p> <p> The PCA is a separate agreement which covers a much broader range of issues in the EU's relationship with Singapore.  The PCA will be an important bilateral framework agreement between the EU and Singapore.  The agreement builds on the extensive political, economic and sectoral co-operation between the EU and Singapore and will serve as a platform for closer co-operation and dialogue across a broad range of bilateral, regional and multilateral issues.<\/p> <p> The PCA will provide a legal foundation for improving bilateral co-operation as well as co-operation in international and regional organisations and forums.  It will help to promote shared values and principles, particularly democracy, the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms.  It also encompasses co-operation in areas such as health, climate change, energy, the environment, natural resources, tax, education, culture, labour, employment, social affairs, science, technology and transport.  The agreement further addresses legal co-operation, money laundering, terrorist financing, security, non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, organised crime and corruption.  The agreement establishes a joint committee with the objective of co-ordinating the overall partnership built upon this agreement.  The joint committee may set up specialised sub-committees to provide dedicated space for co-operation in some of these areas.  <\/p> <p> The PCA will allow more effective bilateral engagement with Singapore on issues of human rights.  Although Singapore is, as outlined already, a natural partner of both Ireland and the EU, there are certainly areas of divergence between us in respect of human rights.  Specific concern exists with regard to the death penalty, judicial corporal punishment, freedom of speech and public assembly, as well as the rights and protections afforded to the LGBTI+ community, among others.  Ireland and the EU have never shied away from having difficult discussions with Singapore on issues of tension and the closer structured engagement that the PCA will precipitate will serve to create a platform for progressing discussions on human rights.  Furthermore, this agreement, similar to those concluded by the EU with other partner countries, contains binding political clauses based on the shared values of both parties.  As such, the Government warmly welcomes the conclusion of the PCA and endorses its approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900023#V04700","speaker":"1596","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634657700,"counter":265,"content":"<p>First and foremost, I have significant concerns in relation to this proposed agreement and I outlined some of those last week in committee.  In the first instance, there are serious and long-standing concerns shared by all democratic states at the appalling human rights record of the Singapore Government.  Second, there are very serious concerns surrounding the similarities between the Singapore agreement and the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, particularly the investor court system, ICS, provisions and how they relate to our rights as a sovereign nation.  While I note what the Minister of State said about the terms of the trade agreement, there is provision and specific mention in this agreement also.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland stands on its record as a neutral, non-aligned nation with a long history of participation in UN peacekeeping missions across the globe.  That record formed part of the arguments put forward for consideration of Ireland's election to the UN Security Council.  Ireland also stands as an independent nation that works, as a member of the EU and of the international community, to place the human rights agenda at the very centre of international discourse.<\/p> <p>The record of Singapore on human rights is a serious cause of concern as regards our acceptance of this agreement.  South Korea, the United States, Switzerland, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Norway, Portugal, Mexico and, indeed, Ireland all raised concerns relating to human rights issues in Singapore during a UN review in May of this year by the UN Human Rights Council.  Areas of specific concern include freedom of the press, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and a failure to comply with relevant human rights standards.  Government opponents and critics continue to be persecuted under repressive legislation in Singapore and there are strict attempts to control media coverage, from the targeting of journalists to the blocking of news sites and social media through the repressive Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act 2019.  NGOs, including Amnesty International, have raised concerns about the treatment of migrant workers, over 300,000 of whom were forcefully quarantined during Covid in overcrowded conditions.  There are also significant concerns relating to the targeting of human rights defenders in Singapore.  There are incidences of journalists being targeted for activity on social media.  One human rights defender was charged with illegal assembly for posing for a selfie on his own.  There is also continued persecution of the LGBTI community, the practice of flogging and the death penalty.  These are but a few instances that must be a matter of concern for the Government.  If they are not, this House is entitled to an explanation for that very worrying development.  The overall attitude and ambition of the EU, in which I of course include Ireland, stands in stark contrast to the obliviousness and lack of commitment shown by the EU towards attempts by the UN to introduce binding and enforceable obligations in the area of business and human rights on multinational businesses to abide by a set of urgently needed international laws, which would make them accountable for their actions and the actions of subsidiaries throughout the world.<\/p> <p> The other area of concern relates to our rights as a sovereign and independent nation and the privileged position that we are surrendering to multinational companies under the ICS.  I champion the right of this country to secure trade agreements and encourage investment within the State but some of the language of this agreement is taken straight from the ICS playbook.  We need to be very clear.  We need to have a Government that retains the autonomy to develop its own policies, not one hamstrung by the investor court system that is dedicated to the interests of corporations.  We need a balance, we need stability, and we need to ensure that the public interest is at the forefront of all our international agreements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900024#W00200","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634658300,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Chair for the opportunity to speak on this important motion.  The trade agreement between EU member states and the Republic of Singapore has been in place for some time now.  I know from observation of the debate on this agreement in the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence last week that the Minister of State believes it to be working very well.  As with all trade agreements, I hope it will be continuously monitored to ensure that it delivers for this State and that it upholds fair trade, human rights, workers&rsquo; rights and environmental rights.  A number of Deputies have previously raised the matter of human rights in relation to this particular deal.  When trade deals like this are entered into, are human rights concerns taken into account in a serious way?  During the committee meeting last week, an Teachta Stanton raised concerns regarding human rights, the suppression of media, freedom of expression and LGBTI rights.  These have been raised already by an Teachta Brady.  Then there are concerns over the death penalty in Singapore and the very high rates of execution.  Indeed, caning and public flogging are still allowed in Singapore, which really shocked me.  Are such issues taken into account by our State and by the EU when negotiating trade agreements, and specifically this trade agreement?<\/p>  <p>  The trade nature of this agreement expands the trading remit available to indigenous companies, especially SMEs.  It is important for jobs and growth but we must always ensure that this growth is sustainable and that the jobs that are created are sustainable long-term jobs.  I understand that the agreement includes many priorities for Ireland in the region such as health, climate change, energy, education, science, technology and transport.  I also understand that trading goods and services with Ireland in the region in 2019 was worth more than &euro;10 billion.  I ask the Minister of State to give an update on the overall balance of trade going both ways.  It would be very interesting and informative for us to have these figures.<\/p>  <p>  While we are talking about trade agreements, it would be remiss of me not to mention the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA.  This was discussed recently at the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, where the Government&rsquo;s defence of the investor court system was unconvincing to say the least.  The core of our opposition to CETA is due to the investor court system, a new court that is only accessible to foreign multinational corporations.  That should worry all of us.  It is a brand new court system and the only people who can access it are these global multinational corporations with deep pockets.  Yet the Government does not seem to be at all concerned about this and I was quite disturbed by the session we had at the committee last week.  As to how this relates to the trade deal with the Republic of Singapore, my colleague, an Teachta Brady, has already raised this on a number of occasions with the Minister of State directly and as part of his ongoing work.  I note that the agreement mentions encouraging open and non-discriminatory rules for investors.  This is very similar language to that used to promote investor courts.  What are the procedures around the ICS?  Are they implicated in the European Union-Singapore free trade agreement?  We need to know that and we need to hear from the Minister of State in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  The Singapore agreement talks about the promise of demand-side management of energy.  I know from engagement with Senator Boylan that Singapore has strong demand-side management in the form of a moratorium on data centre development, an issue that we have debated in the House.  Senator Boylan has asked the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action to write to the Singaporean authorities about the impact of the moratorium on energy and climate targets, on FDI and on business and consumer use of data services.  Such information would help pave the way for a similar moratorium on data centres in this State.  If we can learn something from what has been done in another state, it behoves us to do exactly that.  I sincerely hope the Minister of State will be able to provide some answers to the queries I have raised.  If he does not have them here I would be happy to receive them in writing. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900025#X00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1634658300,"counter":268,"content":"<p>The Select Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence discussed this issue last week, as we have previously heard, and my colleague, Deputy Stanton, raised significant issues at that committee.  My understanding is that there were no significant objections to the agreement but a number of issues were raised.  For a small country like Ireland that has focused on growing our trade around the world, an agreement like this offers many opportunities.  Our trade with the Association of South East Asian Nations, ASEAN, region amounted to more than &euro;10 billion in 2019.  It is also essential that the EU maintains a strong relationship with countries in the Pacific region as China aggressively expands its influence.  That is why the EU recently published its Indo-Pacific strategy on how it will engage with the region.<\/p>  <p>  However, these statements on the agreement also offer us a chance to be very clear about our values and what we stand for as a trading bloc.  In many ways, Singapore is a major competitor of Ireland&rsquo;s, as it has also positioned itself as a hub for global trade and commerce.  However, we have concerns about human rights and the protections available in Singapore.  The Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act 2021 that was passed just two weeks ago is deeply concerning because it targets so-called \"foreign influence\" and many think it will be used to stifle dissent.  It gives the home affairs minister the power to investigate individuals suspected of being foreign agents engaged in \"hostile information campaigns\".  An independent panel chaired by a judge will consider appeals against the minister's findings, although persons marked as \"politically significant\" will not be allowed to file such appeals.<\/p> <p>What does \"politically significant\" mean?  Is it someone campaigning against the laws and rules of Singapore, for example?  Authorities will also be allowed to compel social media platforms and website operators to hand over user data without any justification in select instances.  In 2019, it also passed a law giving authorities the power to police online platforms and even private chat groups.  This does not sound in line with EU values.<\/p> <p> The Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act, FICA, is a deeply chilling law that will impact on freedom of expression, association and privacy and we should be very concerned about its implications, especially for those campaigning to strengthen human rights.  Eleven organisations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have called on Singapore to withdraw the law because it contravenes international legal and human rights principles.<\/p> <p> The treatment of migrant labour in Singapore is also an area of major concern.  The rights of workers and the conditions they have to work under in a tropical climate is deeply concerning.  As for the retention of capital punishment, including the death penalty and public flogging, four people were executed in 2019, including two for drug-related offences.  There is a mandatory death sentence for importing or exporting certain quantities of drugs.<\/p> <p> Another major concern is about LGBTI rights in Singapore.  The Minister of State might make clear to the House how we intend to ensure that we defend and promote the rights of members of the LGBTI community, an area in which Ireland has been a world leader, and how they will be protected and enhanced.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State will also be aware that in February 2019, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on this agreement calling for LGBTI rights in Singapore through the free trade deal.  The European Parliament condemned the lack of such rights and protections and called for the abolition of laws penalising same-sex relationships and for full protection of LGBTI and women's rights through anti-discrimination legislation.  It is important also to note that Singapore retains a colonial-era law from the 1930s.  Section 377A of the Penal Code continues to criminalise sex between men.<\/p> <p> The question for Ireland must be how we leverage our trade relationship and position within the EU to influence and change this.  Passing this agreement despite all these human rights issues is deeply problematic.  That is why before we in the Labour Party can agree to support this motion, therefore, we ask the Minister of State to outline what Ireland and the EU will do about these deeply concerning matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900025#X00300","speaker":"1514","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634658900,"counter":270,"content":"<p>The Minister of State got two words into what I believe was the final page of his speech before he mentioned some areas of the divergence between Ireland and Singapore.  Let me be very clear that there are very significant areas of the divergence between Ireland and Singapore, which make the passing of a trade agreement difficult.<\/p><p>I will say some words on them because I, like my colleagues across the Chamber, believe it is very important that we highlight these areas of quite significant human rights abuses and violations.  It is very difficult, as we approach an EU summit where we will attempt once again to place the rule of law.  We will talk of rule of rule of law violations from Poland and Hungary, while at the same time placing a velvet glove on trade associations with Singapore.<\/p><p>Let me, therefore, talk about some of the violations of freedom and peaceful assembly as taken from the Human Rights Watch report of 2021 on Singapore.  The report states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA), which came into effect in October 2019, allows a minister to declare that online content is &ldquo;false&rdquo; and order a &ldquo;correction notice&rdquo; to be placed on the relevant [social media] pages.  Failure to comply with a correction order can be punished with the shutdown of social media pages in Singapore, up to 12 months in prison, and a S$20,000 ... fine.  While those receiving a correction notice can appeal to the minister and then to the Singapore High Court, one High Court judge has ruled that the burden is on the appellant to prove that the statement is true, while another high court judge has ruled that the burden of proof falls on the government, as international law requires. <\/blockquote>  <p>Another excerpt states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tSingapore&rsquo;s Administration of Justice (Protection) Act contains overly broad and vague powers to punish for contempt, with penalties of three years in prison or a fine of S$50,000 ...  In March, the Court of Appeal upheld the conviction of activist Jolovan Wham under that law for stating on Facebook that &ldquo;Malaysia&rsquo;s judges are more independent than Singapore&rsquo;s for cases with political implications.&rdquo; <\/blockquote>  <p>A further example states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tOn July 28, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong&rsquo;s nephew, Li Shengwu, was found guilty of contempt and fined S$15,000 ... for a 2017 private Facebook post in which he said the Singapore government is &ldquo;very litigious and has a pliant court system.&rdquo; <\/blockquote>  <p>There are far more significance and gross violations of human rights, no less than the death penalty.  The report states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tSingapore retains the death penalty, which is mandated for many drug offenses and certain other crimes. However, under provisions introduced in 2012, judges have some discretion to bypass the mandatory penalty and sentence low-level offenders to life in prison and caning.  There is little transparency on the timing of executions, which often take place ... [at] short notice.  After a halt in executions due to Covid-19, in September 2020 authorities began notifying death row inmates of scheduled execution dates. ...<br \/><br \/>Use of corporal punishment is common in Singapore.  For medically fit males aged 16 to 50, caning is mandatory as an additional punishment for a range of crimes including drug-trafficking, violent crimes such as armed robbery and even some immigration offences.  The caning, which constitute torture under international law, is allegedly of those caned where permanent injuries. <\/blockquote>  <p>There are far more examples of discrimination when it comes to the LGBTQI+ community, such as: <\/p> <blockquote> \t[rejected] challenges to criminal code section 377A, which makes sexual relations between two male persons a criminal offense.  There are no legal protections against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity [in Singapore].  Singapore law precludes LGBT groups from registering and operating legally. <\/blockquote>  <p>At the same time, we are going to rightfully reprimand Poland for its cruel discrimination against the LGBT community while we are shaking hands with Singapore.<\/p><p>There are significant issues with regard to migrant workers and labour exploitation.  The report states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tForeign migrant workers are subject to labor rights abuses and exploitation through debts owed to recruitment agents, non-payment of wages, restrictions on movement, confiscation of passports, and sometimes physical and sexual abuse.  Foreign women employed as domestic workers are particularly vulnerable to abuse. foreign women employed as domestic workers particularly vulnerable to abuse.<br \/><br \/>In September 2020, an Indonesian maid was acquitted of stealing from the family of the Changi Airport Group chairman, four years after her employment was terminated and the family brought charges against her, with the court finding that the employer acted with the improper motive of preventing her from filing a complaint with the Ministry of Manpower. <\/blockquote>  <p>There are significant violations, which go on repeatedly.  I will not continue.  I accept the fact that we have to trade but as we do so, we should also be willing and ready to call out human rights violations where we see them.  I accept that the Minister of State will tell me that is catered for in the provision of the Act but that actually has to mean something.  What does the Government intend to do to ensure that we are not shaking hands with people who at the same time are executing, caning and prohibiting the human rights of people in the LGBTQI+ community?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900026#Y00300","speaker":"1560"},{"type":"speech","time":1634658900,"counter":271,"content":"<p>We are being asked to ratify the partnership and co-operation agreement with Singapore today.  Only 15 days ago, Singapore passed the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act.  It is legislation which allows the authorities to force social media platforms and Internet service providers to hand over user data, to block contacts and remove applications that share information considered by the authorities to be anti-state.  Ms Emerlynne Gil, Amnesty International's deputy regional director for research, said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe passing of Singapore&rsquo;s foreign interference law constitutes a brutal attack on the rights to freedom of expression and association, creating yet another tool that can be used arbitrarily by the authorities to stifle government critics and crush dissent in the country. <\/blockquote>  <p>It is a brutal attack on the rights of freedom of expression and association and the Government wants us to send a signal, 15 days later, that it is no problem and we are happy to ratify a partnership and co-operation, PCA, agreement with Singapore.<\/p><p>Last week, Mr. Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division, commented that, &quot;It&rsquo;s hard to believe that the Singapore government could make the laws against fundamental freedoms even worse than they already are, but the Foreign Interference Act manages to do that&quot;.  He went on to say that, &quot;Failure to withdraw the law would reinforce Singapore&rsquo;s international reputation as a human rights disaster, both online and off.&quot;<\/p><p>One would presume so, but then the actions of the Irish Government and the EU in pushing ahead with this PCA agreement with Singapore suggests that trade and profit are being put ahead of solidarity and human rights by them.  In Singapore, capital punishment is mandatory for certain drug offences and is in effect for a wide range of other crimes.<\/p> <p>The use of corporal punishment, including caning, continues to be a standard practice within the Singapore criminal justice system and in many instances is mandatory.  Singapore also continues to criminalise consensual sexual relations between men, under criminal code section 377A.  Associations of more than ten people are required to register with the government and the registrar of societies has broad authority to deny registration if he determines the group could be \"prejudicial to the public peace, welfare or good order\".  The Societies Act makes explicit reference to gender, sexual orientation and human rights as grounds for denying the registration of a group.  The registrar has refused to allow any LGBTQ organisation to register as a society on the grounds \"it is contrary to the public interest to grant legitimacy to the promotion of homosexual activities and viewpoints\".  On the one hand, rightly, one has the European Commission criticising the Polish Government for doing precisely that by seeking to outlaw LGBT in whole areas of Poland but proceeding to ratify a PCA with a country which proceeds and continues to do this on the other.<\/p> <p> The state-owned media development authority effectively prohibits all positive depictions of LGBTQ lives on television or radio.  In June 2017, the advertising standards agency asked a shopping centre to remove the phrase \"supporting the freedom to love\" from a promotional ad for a 2017 Pink Dot festival on the grounds it \"may affect public sensitivities\".  We are being asked to ratify a partnership and co-operation agreement with a government and state with this track record, which is not only appalling but which is getting worse by the week.  In effect, this will be an encouragement to continue along these tracks.<\/p> <p> It is also worth mentioning the PCA comes together with the EU-Singapore investment protection agreement.  The latter includes notorious investment court system provisions and as with the CETA, and the attempted Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, before it, these provisions will establish a permanent, institutionalised, alternative legal system; a parallel justice system set up exclusively for corporations, enabling them to sue the State, not in the Irish courts but in special parallel courts, basically for anything that interferes with their right to profit which can be determined as indirect expropriation.  The T&aacute;naiste recently admitted to me in committee that if we ratified CETA, the Canadian company which owns IRES REIT could sue the State in a special investor court, were we to introduce further rent controls.  The EU-Singapore investment protection agreement would mean the same would apply to any Singapore company or one able to say it has a headquarters or base in Singapore.  For all those reasons, we should not be ratifying this agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900026#Y00500","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634659500,"counter":273,"content":"<p>I am delighted to be here today to speak on this motion.

I have listened very carefully to what the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, said and have listened carefully to the alternative views expressed, which I take on board.  I will make one point on the alternative views, which I fully respect.  I am old enough to remember what Ireland was like in the 1980s and 1990s.  I am familiar with the extensive shortcomings and serious imperfections we had and am glad the European Union did not prevent us from joining the European Union on that basis.  In fact, the European Union allowed us to join knowing fully that we had imperfections.  It was the influence of the European Union that was a catalyst to promote our prosperity and social progress.

There are many positives.  It was never meant as a <i>fait accompli <\/i>or a final document.  It specifically states that it is as stepping stone.  It is a first step that allows for further engagement and influence thereafter.  I am conscious of the clock and will summarise.  I am very much in favour of this, recognising the imperfections of the situation out there.  It is an initial step that allows for further dialogue and development.  I have seen the progress Singapore has made in the past 50 years, from being a country that was very poor - which is the ultimate human rights violation - to being a country that is at peace and is prosperous, open-minded and open to influence from the European Union.  I look forward to the concerns my colleagues have raised being addressed over time.

There are many human rights issues with regard to Singapore and its government in comparison to our country.  We are a neutral country, which is different to what Singapore stands for.  We have freedom of the press, even though it is sometimes stifled a bit, but it is a freedom as good as we can expect and far better than what Singapore has.  We have freedom of expression, of which Ireland is proud and in which Singapore has an appalling record.<\/p>  <p>  Many believe and I have heard some speakers here state that it creates money opportunities but I fear it could create many difficulties.  One is also talking about a free trade deal and I would like to look into what that stands for in more detail, because we are not far away from a Brazilian Mercosur trade deal, through which most political parties in this country are throwing Irish agriculture under the bus.  Will they consider doing the very same thing here?  Is this what we are facing?  The devil can be in the detail.  One of the biggest offenders in respect of climate action, the Brazilians, will be able to bring their beef into this country and all over the world and sell it because of the trade deal that has been done out there with little or no concern for the worries of Irish farmers and agriculture.<\/p>  <p>  Will we be facing the same here if a trade agreement made with Singapore?  Does this include Irish agriculture and the beef trade deals that can be done behind the scenes?  There are no concerns about climate action when it comes to other countries with this Government but there is a severe worry about climate action when it comes to our country.  Due to the human rights issues and because we need further clarity on the trade agreement, I have serious concerns over it.<\/p> <p>I will be opposing this every step of the way until we have further clarity on many those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900027#Z01000","speaker":"1461","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634660100,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I welcome this debate but I too have concerns on the following grounds.  When studying another country&rsquo;s history, even if it has been improving in recent times, it is important to look at how it treats people who are less well-off, how it treats people from a health point of view and how it treat different sexes.  In some countries, girls a in family are treated in an awful and horrible way in comparison to the boys.  In some countries, there was the one-child rule.  We know what happened to the girls in those cases.  These are awful and horrible things.  I have concerns about Singapore's track record, and about much of what it has done over the years.  Some people seem to be welcoming of Singapore tonight and are suggesting that it has come on a lot.  I, however, would be slow to comment from a political point of view.  Every one of us here is an individual when it comes to voting and when it comes to expressing his or her viewpoint.  My viewpoint is one of concern and trepidation.<\/p>  <p>  I am fearful of what this would mean for us in trade.  It is fine to say trade goes both ways, but I am concerned.  At the moment, we seem to be signing up for an awful lot of hurt and for little gain when it comes to trade.  The carbon budget is looming on the horizon.  Its implications will be hard-hitting for business, farming, tourism, sport and in how we go about our daily lives.  I urge caution on this subject.  <\/p>  <p>  I would be mindful and fearful of signing what I consider a blank cheque on behalf of the people.  I would err on the side of caution.

Hopefully, in the short few moments that I have I will be able to address some of the concerns raised this evening.  To go back to the point I made at the beginning, it is important to differentiate between the partnership and co-operation agreement, PCA, and the EU-Singapore free trade agreement, which was enforced in 2019, and indeed from the EU-Singapore investment protection agreement, which has yet to be brought before the D&aacute;il for ratification.  That will be brought before the D&aacute;il in due course, which will enable every Member of the D&aacute;il to debate the investment protection agreement.<\/p>  <p>  With all international trade agreements there is a dispute resolution arrangement in place.  The investment court system that has been proposed in relation to this replaces the old investment state dispute settlement mechanism, which has been in existence since the 1950s.  That is not what is being discussed today.  It will have to come before the D&aacute;il for further discussion before ratification and for a vote of the D&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  The EU-Singapore free trade agreement was passed two years ago.  For the benefit of those who are here, in the past two years, we have seen just under &euro;1 billion in two-way merchandise trade last year.  This figure increased by more than 5% on 2019, despite the Covid-19 period.  The latest trade figures in services show our exports to Singapore were in the region of &euro;2.7 billion.  To put that figure in context for the benefit of Deputies, this is more than our exports of services to Canada.  It is only marginally less than our exports of services to the whole of the African continent.  I hope that gives a flavour of the benefit of the free trade agreement with Singapore.  The people who benefit from that are the Irish companies trading and supporting jobs the length and breadth of this country.  People depend on these jobs to ensure that they have a relevant income.<\/p>  <p>  The other point that was what was raised quite forcefully was on the points of friction we have with Singapore, particularly in the area of human rights.  I have just outlined the area that unites us, which are the economic benefits.  In the area of human rights, however, the PCA we are considering today will provide a legal basis for more effective bilateral engagement with Singapore across a broad range of areas.  It will do this by strengthening political dialogue, enhancing co-operation across areas as diverse as human rights, health, climate change, culture, labour, and security.  The PCA specifically targets the promotion of shared values and principles, in particular, democracy, the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms.<\/p>  <p>  Neither Ireland nor the EU has hesitated to raise human rights concerns with Singapore.  Most recently, on 12 May 2021, Singapore held its third universal periodic review of human rights.  In its intervention, Ireland made clear recommendations regarding the death penalty and freedom of expression.  As noted previously, the PCA with Singapore provides the basis for more bilateral engagement by the EU and its member states with Singapore, including in regard to human rights.<\/p>  <p>  I cite the Philippines as an example because we have a PCA it.  It is a close partner of the EU, but it is a country about which the EU has notable human rights concerns.  The EU-Philippines PCA was signed in 2011 and came into force in 2018.  That PCA has allowed the creation of specialised sub-committees on a range of topics, such as development co-operation, trade, investment and economic co-operation.  It includes a specific committee on good governance, rule of law and human rights.  This committee met for the first time in February of this year.  It is through co-operation like that, and a through a formal arrangement like this, that we will be best placed to raise our human rights concerns.  Everybody shares these concerns.<\/p>  <p>  I will finish by saying the free trade agreement has been in place since 2019.  The investor court mechanism has yet to be debated.  It is not part of this discussion.  This is about the PCA and enabling us to have a formalised relationship with Singapore in which we can raise the concerns raised by so many Deputies today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900028#AA00300","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1634660100,"counter":285,"content":"<p>Question put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Access of Competent Authorities to Centralised Bank Account Registries: Motion","time":1634660100,"counter":286,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900028#AA00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1634660100,"counter":287,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the exercise by the State of the option or discretion under Protocol No. 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, to take part in the adoption and application of the following proposed measure:   \tDirective of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive (EU) 2019\/1153 of the European Parliament and of the Council, as regards access of competent authorities to centralised bank account registries through the single access point,   a copy of which was laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 18th August, 2021. <\/blockquote>  <p>I thank the Deputies for agreeing to debate this motion at relatively short notice and welcome the opportunity to address the D&aacute;il on Ireland's opt-in to a new proposal on facilitating the use of financial and other information for the prevention, detection, investigation, or prosecution of certain criminal offences.<\/p> <p>Ireland has an option, provided for in Article 3.1 of Protocol 21 annexed to the Treaty of Lisbon, to opt in to individual proposals in the area of freedom, security and justice.  The protocol provides that Ireland has three months, from the date a proposal or initiative is presented to the Council, to notify the Presidency of the Council in writing of its wish to take part in the negotiation, adoption and application of any such measure.  The three-month period for this proposal is due to end on 1 November.  The exercise of this opt-in is subject to the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Ireland can also accept a proposal at any time after it has been adopted, but in such a case, it will not have been in a position to vote on the final content of the proposal.  It must also be noted that Ireland made a declaration appended to the Treaty of Lisbon of its intention to opt in to measures in the area of freedom, security and justice to the maximum extent it deems possible.<\/p> <p> This proposal, as published, seeks to extend access to the bank account registers, BAR, single access point, which will be introduced by the sixth anti-money laundering directive, 6AMLD, to the bodies already designated with responsibility for the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of criminal offences under Directive (EU) 2019\/1153, which Ireland has already opted into.  My officials have consulted with the Office of the Attorney General and have been advised that there is no legal impediment to Ireland opting into this proposal.<\/p> <p> This draft EU directive will extend access to the bank account registers single access point by amending an earlier EU directive, Directive (EU) 2019\/1153.  This proposal was published in July together with a new suite of EU proposals reforming anti-money laundering efforts at an EU level.  Those new EU proposals presented an ambitious set of measures which aim to modernise the EU's anti-money laundering and regime to counter the financing of terrorism.  The package comprises four key legislative proposals, which include a regulation on directly applicable rules on anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism, a regulation proposing the establishment of a new EU anti-money laundering authority, a crypto-assets-related amending regulation, and the sixth anti-money laundering directive.  While the proposed directive that we are discussing today is not a core element of the new package, the European Commission has presented this amending directive as corresponding to the other measures on the table.  This amending directive seeks to extend access to the bank account registers single access point which will be introduced by the sixth anti-money laundering directive to the bodies already designated with responsibility for the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of criminal offences under Directive (EU) 2019\/1153.<\/p> <p> Ireland has already opted into Directive (EU) 2019\/1153 and work is in progress to transpose that directive into Irish law.  The directive already requires member states to designate authorities competent for the prevention, detection, investigation, or prosecution of criminal offences in order for them to access and search the centralised, automated mechanisms, which are referred to in Directive (EU) 2019\/1153 as centralised bank account registers.  The BAR-related elements in Directive (EU) 2019\/1153 include a provision of wider access to the bank accounts mechanism to be extended to the Criminal Assets Bureau and a cohort of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at senior level and prescribe that BAR access logs must be kept.  The new anti-money laundering directive will provide access to the BAR single access point only to financial intelligence units, FIUs.  The national bodies which receive suspicious transaction reports are obliged to enter these and forward them as appropriate to criminal investigative authorities.  In the interests of combating serious crime and, in particular, carrying out effective financial investigations, authorities competent for the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of criminal offences also need to have access to the BAR single access point to be able to identify, analyse and interpret the financial information relevant for criminal proceedings.  This is why the proposed amended directive is necessary.<\/p> <p> Looking at the current state of play in Ireland with regard to the bank account register, the fourth EU anti-money laundering directive requires member states to put in place a centralised automated mechanism to allow for the timely identification of any individual or legal person holding or controlling a payment account or bank account identified by an IBAN, or a safe deposit box held by a credit institution within a member state's jurisdiction.  The Central Bank of Ireland was appointed as registrar of the BAR.  The Department of Finance continues to engage with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on drafting secondary legislation to give effect to the BAR.  This legislation will provide access to the FIU in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to allow it to conduct searches in and retrieve information from the BAR.  It is anticipated that the BAR mechanism will go live in the third quarter of 2022.<\/p> <p> The type of information which will be available through the BAR single access point includes names, IBANs, dates of account opening and closing, and the duration of the lease period in the case of a safe deposit box.  The same limitations and safeguards created in the earlier Directive (EU) 2019\/1153 will remain in place.  The benefit of the change contained in the proposed amending directive that we are discussing today is that by interconnecting a national centralised bank accounts register at EU level, authorities with access to the BAR single access point would be able to establish quickly whether an individual holds bank accounts in other member states without having to ask their counterparts in all member states to investigate and report back.<\/p> <p> The basis for the EU anti-money laundering framework, Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, TFEU, relates to the Internal Market.  The aim is to prevent the use of the EU's financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing.  This amending directive complements and builds on the preventative policies to counter money laundering and terrorist financing and reinforces the legal framework for law enforcement co-operation.  That is why this proposed directive has a different legal basis and falls under Title V of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  Therefore Protocol 21 of TFEU applies and Oireachtas approval under Article 29.4.7&deg; of the Constitution is required for Ireland to opt into the measure.<\/p> <p> As I mentioned, the Office of the Attorney General has been consulted on the proposed directive.  That office did not identify any adverse legal or constitutional implication for Ireland of opting into this amending directive.  Under Protocol 21, Ireland has three months to opt into this proposed directive under Article 3.  The deadline for opting into the proposal under Article 3 of Protocol 21 is 1 November 2021, which is why this decision is urgent.  Opting in under Article 3 allows Ireland to fully take part in the adoption and application of the proposed measure and to influence the content of the directive that is to be agreed.  If the House supports opting in, it is my intention to notify the institutions of our participation next Wednesday.<\/p> <p> I reiterate to Deputies that when Ireland signed up to the Lisbon treaty, the Government of the day made a declaration which is attached to the treaty that we would participate to the maximum extent possible in measures relating to police co-operation.  I see no reason to deviate from that position.  Failing to opt in at this stage would weaken Ireland's ability to influence the evolution of this proposal and the rest of the EU anti-money laundering package which is currently being negotiated.  In addition to the operational, practical and policy-level concerns which makes this opt-in important, there is a further consideration of Ireland's reputation.  Not opting in under Article 3 of Protocol 21 would present risks to Ireland's reputation and the perception of Ireland's commitment to the anti-money laundering framework at EU level.<\/p> <p> Money laundering and terrorist financing pose a serious threat to the integrity of the European Union's economy and financial system, and to the security of its citizens.  Given Ireland's status as a hub for companies in the financial services, technological and pharmaceutical sectors, it is important that we commit to alleviating the risks of economic crime by having appropriate preventative measures, including robust legislation in this area covering a suite of interconnected economic crimes such as corruption, fraud and money laundering.<\/p> <p> For the reasons I have outlined, I request the House's approval to opt into this proposed directive.  I look forward to hearing the views of Deputies and I urge them to support the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900028#AA00600","speaker":"1618","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634660700,"counter":289,"content":"<p>We will support this motion.  It is European legislation which is being transposed into Irish law.  The setting up by the Commission of this registry across the whole EU will be positive and will hopefully do a lot to ensure that financial services which are hiding cash, including the ill-gotten gains of criminal gangs, etc., can be found and traced.  While I welcome the powers that it gives to the Criminal Assets Bureau of the Garda, it would be remiss of me not to point out that we are doing something about this at the last minute.  There are just ten days to go.  Why are we in this position?  We always ask these questions with regard to that.  It always seems to be the last minute but we are where we are.<\/p>  <p>  The protocol will certainly assist competent authorities across the EU to trace the proceeds of crime, which is welcome.  The main issue that the protocol will solve is the time delay that many authorities across the EU experience when they are asking for banking information from their counterparts in other countries.  I know that issue has been a difficulty for the Criminal Assets Bureau, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Revenue Commissioners and other agencies of the State when trying to find where money has been or where bank accounts have been opened in other countries.  The time delay is crucial when it comes to tracking and freezing financial assets belonging to gangland figures or to other criminals.  It is also important to point out that hopefully this legislation and the ability to track and trace in this matter will be a deterrent to young people who are often duped into or attracted to this type of thing.<\/p> <p>There have been recent reports in the media of younger people unwittingly taking part in money laundering with their Revolut accounts.  This primarily happens because the accounts are based outside of the State.  What often negatively affects the prosecution or tracing of these funds is the delay.  It is sometimes the case that, when a person decides to launder money across jurisdictions in the EU, the delay works to the benefit of the criminals concerned.  It is important to point out these are not victimless crimes.  They have an impact on communities because much of the money hidden in these criminal bank accounts has been garnered by criminal gangs who have been a scourge in our communities in many urban areas with drugs and all the difficulties around that.  The Minister of State mentioned Ireland has many large multinational corporations and big companies in the financial services sector, technology and so on.  We recognise that tax evasion is also a crime and needs to be examined in this context.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in is in support of removing the barrier to tracing this kind of crime and imposing significant sanctions on those convicted.  It will require allocation of resources and funding from the Minister of State.  CAB will undoubtedly get busier and need to be properly resourced as it does more of this work.  That means human and financial resources and increased capital funding.  It is no surprise to anyone in this Chamber to know money laundering and these types of crimes have picked up significantly, particularly during the pandemic.  This makes the work of CAB all the more demanding and it will require more resources to carry it out appropriately.<\/p> <p> I am concerned there is no discussion on how Britain may or may not feed into this protocol post-Brexit.  That is a serious issue because it is our closest neighbour.  We have a land border, unfortunately, with that jurisdiction and that issue needs to be dealt with.  With all these EU protocols, directives and co-operation in all kinds of fields, we find Britain is stepping outside of those and we need to understand how that works.  Many people legitimately work on the northern side of the Border and live on the southern side.  They may have banking details on both sides of the Border or have accounts in both jurisdictions, and across the water in Britain as well.  There needs to be an idea as to how we can interact and ensure the same co-operation exists between that jurisdiction and this, even though they now fall outside the European Union.  I hope the Minister of State will provide clarity on this and to see a similar framework in place for the other jurisdiction across the water.<\/p> <p> In general, I welcome movement in the direction of greater co-operation and authorities in all states working together to combat criminal activity of this kind and deal with assets of criminal gangs and others, including people who evade tax in every state across the world.  That has an impact on communities who cannot get resources or be looked after properly by legitimate governments who want to do so.  We should be grateful we can co-operate and work to make that happen.  I commend the work of the European Commission in developing this single register of bank accounts across the European Union.  Hopefully it will be up and running as quickly as possible and the assets of criminal gangs and others will be traceable and something that we can put to bed.  I want to commend the legislation and ensure it is, as the Minister of State said, relayed to the European Union as soon as next Wednesday that we are opting in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900029#BB00200","speaker":"1607","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634661300,"counter":291,"content":"<p>There was an interesting article in<i>The Irish Times <\/i>by Conor Lally.  It stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tGarda&iacute; have identified over 50 young people in and around one Co. Kerry town who were recruited as money mules for an international crime syndicate.<br \/><br \/>The Irish Times understands a young man from Munster is believed to be working for the crime gang as a recruiter and his reach into the local population, especially among students, has proven significant. <br \/><br \/>The recruiter, himself an Irish teenager, appears to have been very successful at convincing his peers to allow their bank accounts be used to receive money from the frauds carried out by the gang.<br \/><br \/>Garda sources said they were very concerned such a large number of young people in a relatively sparsely populated part of the Republic were so willing to allow their accounts to be used.  <\/blockquote>  <p>I raise this article in the context of this debate because one of the elements of this is the creation of a bank account register, as I understand it, and that register will provide information through a single access point, including names, IBAN, dates of account opening and closing, duration of the lease period in the case of safety deposit boxes and so on.  The Kerry case is relevant to this.  I do not want to sound like Pollyanna but the fear I have concerns young people, in particular.  We have all made mistakes when we were young.  We were foolish and did stupid things.  People who make mistakes will be subject to the rigours of the law.  Of that there can be no question or doubt.  However, I am fearful that mistakes people make when they are young could follow them throughout life.  How will this new database impact on those young people, for instance?  Will their accounts and names be permanently listed on the database?<\/p><p>There is always an imbalance between the crime lords and the mules.  The mules are always the first to be subject to the rigours of the law and the crime lords walk off into the sunset or Marbella or wherever they happen to be.  I am concerned that there will be a disproportionately negative impact on people who found themselves in the position where their accounts have been used.  If a crime has been committed, they are subject to the rigours of the law but, once that is done, if it is done in this case, I hope this does not follow them for the rest of their lives.<\/p><p>It is an issue that arose in the last 24 hours.  I am hopeful there will be some clarity around how that case in Kerry would be impacted.  It concerns teenagers who may or may not have done something stupidly or in ignorance.  Some will know quite well what they were up to and know the difference between right and wrong but there are always people who will be led on and naive.  I am fearful they could be forever blacklisted in any financial transactions they have.  If they go on to lead good, decent and proper lives and hold accounts, I hope this does not follow them and they are not blacklisted by financial institutions or statutory agencies.  I hope the Minister of State's response will provide some clarity on the simple questions I have asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900030#CC00200","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speech","time":1634661300,"counter":292,"content":"<p>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this legislation.  Following on from the points raised by my colleague, I am in favour of keeping the integrity of the system to the fore at all times.  That encourages investment and helps to create jobs and a society at ease with itself.  However, I have dealt with a number of cases recently wherein it has emerged that politicians and Members of Parliament are identified as potential money launderers.  I do not know where that came from but it is already there.  It is in the banking system here and has been raised on numerous occasions.  A number of colleagues I have spoken with realised for the first time that they are deemed to be in the high risk category, \"people of special interest\" is the phrase, insofar as money laundering is concerned.  I find that objectionable in the extreme, and I am sure that applies to everybody in this House.  It would be extremely unpatriotic if a Member of Parliament were to become involved in money laundering and criminal activity.<\/p> <p>None of us would try to justify that.<\/p> <p> The point raised by my colleague a couple of minutes ago verifies and underlines the concerns I have, in particular at a time when the banking system here has become depersonalised to a great extent.  We do not have the same structure in a bank that was there ten, 15 or 20 years ago.  I do not know, but there may be good reasons for the changeover.  However, I know that there was personal attention available to customers from all banks.  The customer is the most important person.  We all believe that the needs of customers in all such situations must be met if we want to have a satisfactory co-operation between them and banks and lending institutions of all sorts.<\/p> <p> Like everybody else, I have dealt with a number of cases in recent years whereby drug mules were used to carry drugs.  They were invariably people who were identified as having financial difficulties at the time and would do virtually anything to get out of their difficulties.  It was made known to them that if they were to drive a vehicle for a couple of miles along a road somewhere that their financial difficulty would be resolved.  Sums of up to &euro;20,000 or &euro;30,000, and in one case &euro;40,000, were offered for a person to drive a truck.  Invariably again, the mules were caught and put behind bars, rightly so.  The fools went that road without consulting anybody.  They were vulnerable and under financial pressure.  Perhaps they were under family pressure.  A whole lot of situations arose.  I know that they should not have done it and that they deserved to be punished for their crimes, but to a large extent they were innocent.  They did not go that route of their own volition.  They did not set out to do that, but they paid for it.<\/p> <p> I agree that the integrity of the financial services sector musts be protected, especially as the country is an open economy that trades with many countries all over the world.  Citizens of Ireland have invested all over the world and continue to do so.  Similarly, we depend on foreign direct investment, FDI, quite a lot in this country, understandably so.  It is also understandable that we are able to give a clear indication to possible investors that we have a financial sector on which we can base our future with clarity, conviction and confidence.  Any movement otherwise creates a problem.<\/p> <p> The political fraternity seem to be in the front line where this is concerned, and under suspicion.  I do not know of anybody in this House who would have done anything to incur such suspicion.  I deeply resent and reject the notion that somebody sitting in a call centre perhaps 500 miles or 1,000 miles from here could decide that an individual is a person of special interest when it comes to money laundering.  There is a need to come up with something more substantive than that, as it could undermine the integrity of our system.  It could also undermine the basis on which we operate and the people with whom we converse and whom we trust.  If we do not have the trust of the institutions that are around us and that we deal with on a regular basis, then we are lacking in something.<\/p> <p> Last evening, I was making representations to a utility company on behalf of a group of citizens on the one hand and a contractor on the other hand.  I was informed that if I was representing the constituents only, I could do so, but if I was representing the contractor, who was also a constituent, I would have to get permission from the contractor in order to make the representation and get a response to it.  I replied to the effect that, like everybody else in this House, on the day of the election I was given permission and authority by the electorate to represent everybody, regardless of who they were or who they were for or against.  I reserve that right and I reject absolutely any attempt by any utility authority to deny that.  In recent times, there have been a good few that have tried to interpose themselves between the public representative and the system in order to ensure that they did not have to answer the question at all.  That is effectively what it comes down to.  I strongly object to that and I am sure that everybody in this House objects to it.  Unless we raise these questions regularly, they will continue and that vice-like grip will continue also.<\/p> <p> Freedom operates in more ways than one.  We all like to believe that we live in a society that has freedoms.  That is a central part of membership of the European Union.  If those freedoms are being eroded or curtailed in order to deal with lawlessness, forgery or whatever the case may be in terms of breaching the law, then the people who are breaching the law are the first ones who should be faced down and dealt with, not the innocent citizens who are going about their business in their ordinary way.  Even some local authorities ask if we have permission from the constituents to represent them.  What about the situation that is being raised that is against the interests of the constituent?  Is it to be assumed that we will have to go to the person about whom we are to make a complaint and ask if it is all right to make representations against his or her interests?  That is how daft the situation can become at a particular time.<\/p> <p> I agree with the general thrust of the proposal, but I raise serious questions about where we are heading when it comes to the kind of implications that are created for ourselves.  We seem to be in the front line, in so far as being condemned whether we like it or not, to being complicit in international activity of a dubious nature.  I wish to register those few points in the hope that they inform the course of the debate.  This is not in any way a personal attack on the Minister of State.  I know that these things have to be done, but we must also question what we are doing notwithstanding how much we approve of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900030#CC00300","speaker":"1584","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634661900,"counter":294,"content":"<p>This is the latest in a series of motions we have had to consider regarding international co-operation to fight organised crime.  Given the fact that criminal gangs are, like most enterprises, becoming larger, more sophisticated and increasingly transnational, the response to them must also advance in the same respect.  Accordingly, I am happy to speak in favour of the motion.<\/p>  <p>  There remain, however, some aspects of how we deal with money laundering in this jurisdiction that leave something to be desired.  Enabling legislation for other EU directives and regulations in the area of anti-money laundering was slow, such that the State ran the risk of sanction for non-compliance.  The defence for corporate entities inserted into that legislation when it eventually came before the House may be necessitated by case law, but it will be very interesting to see how that may play out.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, there are few chances of banks and other entities being brought before the courts on these charges.  As other speakers outlined, it will be people at the bottom of the chain who will face the rigours of the court.  Given the poor resources offered to some of the institutions, of necessity, it will be the low-hanging fruit that will be picked off.  Let us make no mistake, the Government cannot beat its chest about tackling organised crime until this area is addressed properly.  White-collar crime enables drug debts throughout the State to be collected and laundered and we cannot tackle one without the other.<\/p>  <p>  While anti-money laundering legislation is welcome for the reasons I have outlined, there is an unintended side effect.  Regulation means the likes of the credit unions and post offices must dedicate more resources to this work, hindering the operation of such vital, local institutions.  The fall in the past 18 months in social welfare payments meant their viability was affected and it has not been balanced by any extra commercial activities.  The recent decision to help out the Bank of Ireland is not going to cut the mustard.  The Grant Thornton report must be implemented.  All Deputies probably received an email from the postmasters about a fortnight ago.<\/p> <p>I support them.  The Government should intervene and give the extra investment to the post offices.  As the report suggested, there will be an additional social benefit to the community of between &euro;334 million and &euro;700 million.  It is for that reason that we must not take our eye off the ball.  The Government should act fast in regard to supporting post offices around the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900031#DD00200","speaker":"1488","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634662500,"counter":296,"content":"<p>This motion forms part of the European Commission's new suite of proposals to reform anti-money laundering efforts at EU level.  It will extend across to our national centralised bank account register, allowing it to be accessed through a single access point developed and operated by the European Commission.  All designated authorities across the EU which are responsible for the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of criminal offences will be able to access this registry.  Access to the registry will allow investigators to trace, freeze and confiscate criminal assets quickly before the proceeds can disappear.  Currently, registering this kind of information can take up to 30 days through bilateral agreements, losing the element of speed which is so vital.<\/p>  <p>  That is the positive side of things.  Unfortunately, despite these national registers being required under the fourth money laundering directive, which was published in 2015 by the EU and adopted by Ireland in 2018, we do not have one.  Ireland is still in the process of complying with the fourth directive and has only recently implemented the fifth, while the rest of the EU has already moved on to the sixth.  In July of this year, a spokesperson for the Department of Justice stated that the Central Bank is currently working on a centralised bank account register.  We are leagues behind when it comes to anti-money laundering and financial regulation.  We are adopting these directives years after everyone else in the bloc, and constantly playing catch-up.  I do not think there has been legislation recently in the justice area.  We are not saying the same thing and we are playing catch-up with regard to compliance.  Why are we so unresponsive?  Why are we not out there, being compliant?  We keep talking about being good Europeans but, when it comes to compliance, we very often have to be threatened.<\/p>  <p>  The European Union has made anti-money laundering and terrorist financing a long-standing priority but efforts to tackle the area have met with limited success, which is largely down to inconsistent regulatory environments between member states, and we are certainly a culprit in that regard.  The European Commission summarises the consequences as follows: criminals and terrorists have a sustained means to jeopardise public security and the incidence of money laundering damages the reputation of jurisdictions, resulting in the withdrawal of financial services, which in turn has a negative impact on investment and damages the EU Internal Market.<\/p>  <p>  The amount of money generated through criminal activities is, of course, hard to measure, given fraud is by its nature hidden until it is discovered.  Europol has estimated that 1% of the EU's annual GDP is associated with suspicious financial activities.  In 2020, this would represent a whopping &euro;139 billion, and we can imagine the many things that money could be directed towards.  Annual financial flows due to money laundering are estimated at trillions of euro worldwide.  This highlights the ineffectiveness of the EU efforts so far and the need to close regulatory loopholes across the bloc.  A lack of co-ordination allows money launderers and terrorist financiers to launder money and move assets through the financial system with relative ease.<\/p>  <p>  It is important also to say that, on the other side, limited enough information should be provided, for example, the name and IBAN.  While it is important that everybody's details would be given, these should be limited details.  We also need to be apprised of what level of safety and security is involved, or whether a risk assessment is done in regard to the provision of even that information because, although that information on its own is not going to be problematic, when it is matched with other information, it could be.  There is a need to make sure we are properly considering that aspect.<\/p>  <p>  To pick up on a point made by Deputy Durkan in regard to banks, on the list of institutions that are trusted, banks would not be one of mine, and I suspect that is a view that is shared here.  Increasingly, they do not want the public.  They do not want them coming through the door; they just want their money and they want everything to be automated.  In my and Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s constituency and in others across the country, we are seeing significant changes.  One of the risk areas identified around the time of the crash was that the bank manager did not know the bank customers, so there is a very significant imbalance happening at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900032#EE00200","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1634662500,"counter":297,"content":"<p>As there is no Government speaker present, we move to Sinn F&eacute;in.

The motion, when ratified, will support the Garda and the Criminal Assets Bureau in tracing the proceeds of crime, which will hopefully assist in the conviction of criminals in Ireland.  This is something that needs to be addressed at a European level and also at a national level.<\/p><p>For those who live outside of disadvantaged areas, I want to point out that in areas that are disproportionately impacted by crime, there is a chance people may become desensitised to organised crime.  Hit television shows, which we all see at the moment, only add to the glamour of these organised criminals, with their extravagant lifestyles and even more extravagant nicknames.  Those who live or who have lived in areas targeted by organised crime have a different view.  We have seen parts of our communities ripped apart by drug use and drug crime.  On the one hand, we have seen our neighbours, friends and schoolmates stricken by drug use.  On the other hand, we have seen young people&rsquo;s lives wiped out on the orders of a crime boss.  There are different ways of dying but it is grieving families and communities who are left to pick up the pieces.<\/p><p>Some people say there is an element of choice in how people live their lives, and I would agree up to a point.  However, let me tell the House this.  Part of our cities and counties did not have choice when drugs flooded into our communities, wiping out whole generations of our young people.  Was our young people&rsquo;s ability to make that choice about drug use or criminality impacted by living in areas with high levels of poverty?  I would suggest the answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.<\/p><p>This motion will also support CAB and its ability to seize the proceeds of crime but we must also redistribute the money seized by CAB back into the communities which were damaged most by crime.  Earlier this year, I tabled the Proceeds of Crime (Investment in Disadvantaged Communities) (Amendment) Bill, which has passed Second Stage in this House.  This is legislation that will see money seized by CAB from criminals put into the areas that are most affected and impacted by crime.  Plain and simple, the money that the mother had to borrow from the credit union to pay her child's debts for fear of reprisals will go back into a community that will work to stop young people from falling into a life of crime and drug use.  Communities are not asking for handouts.  They are simply asking that the money is returned to where it originally came from.  Over &euro;5 million was seized by CAB last year and it is really welcome.  I know how community groups in my area and right across the State would spend this to build community resilience to crime and drug use.<\/p><p>Many people have contacted me in regard to my Bill.  They think it is a simple Bill and a great idea, and they cannot understand why it is being delayed.  Perhaps the Government does not value community development or, more likely, it sees community development as a threat to the <i>status quo<\/i>.  I urge the Government not to sit on its hands and to allow the proceeds of crime Bill to progress and become law.<\/p><p>I understand the motion before us was delayed in getting to the House.  We need to get serious about organised crime.

What makes this more difficult is that people have no one they know in the banks to talk to about these scams.  I see at first hand how banks are walking away from the good customer service they used to provide.  The Government reacted without a whimper to the recent Bank of Ireland closures, standing idly by as branches in Bantry, Dunmanway and elsewhere closed their doors to customers last week.  It is angering people that we bailed out the banks over the past 20 years but when those banks were asked to show some bit of loyalty, they turned their backs on people.  AIB is no different.  Its branches in Schull and many more places in west Cork and throughout the country were closed a number of years ago.  These closures make it almost impossible for elderly people to meet or talk to anyone, which is working right into the hands of criminals, who know the customer-staff relationship is now broken.<\/p> <p> It is important to note that customers have a great relationship with the staff in credit unions in west Cork and throughout the State.  People are known by their names, not by a number, and interactions with services do not involve pressing a button on the wall.  Customers are carefully looked after by the credit union officials.  However, the State is doing little to let credit unions compete on the same basis as the banks.  There is no reason that they should not be enabled to do so.  Do the banks have such a monopoly on the State that we cannot move forward with such measures?  We are playing into criminals' hands by not taking any of the various measures that could be used to face up to the situation.  The rebuilding of relationships between banks and customers must be a first step in this regard.  Sadly, that is not happening and it is leading to severe frustration and annoyance for the public.  It is scandalous that the Government stood idly by and let the closure of the Bank of Ireland branches in Bantry and Skibbereen happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900032#EE00700","speaker":"1461","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634663100,"counter":303,"content":"<p>I am glad to speak on this important matter.  When it comes to an issue such as this, people need to have confidence in our banking system.  When it comes to money laundering and all the new types of crimes that are being carried out through the use of bank cards, Internet banking and all of that, the one thing it make us all realise is how important it was to be able to walk through the door of a bank, know the manager and staff and be able to talk to them.  People could trust bank staff to deal with their business.  Unfortunately, banking has become impersonal.  Castleisland, Killorglin and many other places have lost Bank of Ireland branches in recent times.  It is a disgrace that the great town of Killorglin, which I am proud to have represented for many years, both on Kerry County Council and in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, has lost its Bank of Ireland branch.  Likewise, to see Castleisland, a great business and trading town, lose its branch was an awful blow to the bank's loyal customers.<\/p>  <p>  The people who work in our banks are exemplary.  They are great people.  Yesterday, however, and God knows I was not looking for something to be doing, I stood outside a bank for 45 minutes waiting to get as far as the door to join the queue inside to talk to somebody about the few items of business I needed to do.  However, forget about me.  What about a person who is older or anyone with an infirmity or a medical problem, having to stand in the rain for that length of time?  That is not the way to treat customers.  This particular bank was an AIB branch.  What are the banks doing?  They would not still be in existence only for the people bailing them out and backing them up.  It was agreed between a large number of people in this House at the time to bail them out.  This is the thanks they give people.  Customers are left queuing outside in the cold and rain in order to come inside and avail of their services.  As I said, the people who work in our banking institutions are brilliant.  God knows they have more to put up than anyone else because there are fewer of them as their roles are done away with and computers are put in their place.  That has led to the loss of much-needed jobs.

Member states have a duty to set up centralised bank account registries, which must be interconnected, thereby allowing for a single European access point.  The designated authorities will be able to access information from those registries, such as whether an individual has bank accounts in different member states or is moving money across borders.  In the simplest of terms, they will enable authorities to follow the money.<\/p>  <p>  Little did I think when I was reading through the directive last week that I would, a few days later, be reading a headline reporting that 50 young people from a Kerry town were recruited as money mules for an international crime syndicate.  These young people are allowing their bank accounts to be used by criminals to launder and transfer money that comes from criminal activity and causes pain and devastation to individuals and communities.  We are, rightly, discussing legislation here today to prevent cross-border money laundering.  Right in front of our noses, however, second and third level students are involved in exactly such activity by allowing their bank accounts to be used to launder, conceal and move the proceeds of crime across county and national borders.<\/p>  <p>  I have no doubt that we could substitute Waterford, Wexford, Sligo, Donegal or a number of other places for Kerry.  Recruiters are most likely working right across the country right now, perhaps in the Minister of State's town or my town.  I do not know for certain but I suspect that many of these young people do not realise what is happening and just see this activity as a handy way to make a few bob or even do a favour for a mate.  Not only are they actively engaged in criminal activity, some of them will become trapped because the people who want to exert pressure on them, now or later, have leverage on them.  These are our sons, daughters, nieces, nephews and grandchildren.  We have a duty to act now.  Second and third level schools and colleges must immediately and consistently hammer home the message that under no circumstances should students allow their bank account to be used by others for any purpose.  More than that, the Ministers for Education, Justice, and Children, Equality, Disability Integration and Youth, and their Departments, all have a role, as do the banks, to get that message out to people.<\/p>  <p>  We may need to look at some kind of strictly time-limited amnesty to give cover to young people who have been caught up in this web of exploitation.  It was done for people who owed tax.  We should at least investigate whether it can be done now for the young people involved.  The purpose of this directive is to stop cross-border money laundering, but we should act now to stop this particular rot and close down the avenue that is drawing many young Irish people into criminality at this time.<\/p> <p>Let us not wait.  Many young people and their families are under pressure and many of them have and had no notion of the consequences of their actions.  I have no expertise on amnesties but our responsibilities in this House are not just to the operation of a cross-border financial system.  That is right and proper but our responsibilities are also to our young people and to protect them from the claws of criminals and organised crime.  If we do not act now, laws will be broken and more importantly, lives will be destroyed.

I was with National Broadband Ireland and I pointed out all the areas where there is room for speeding up and accelerating the national broadband plan.  I hope I will be taken up on all those points, so remember this.<\/p>  <p>  This is one of the many aspects we have dealt with in recent times in updating our legal framework on banking and finance as we try to deal with the modern world we are operating in.  This is a world where international criminals were far ahead of the legislative process and all that was required.  We are supportive of filling in all these gaps.  It is not that long since a number of us would have spoken here on the anomalies that exist in cybercrime, on the legislation required for dealing with that and on those international financial situations, particularly where criminals would use online currencies, including bitcoin.

When I talk about criminality, I am usually talking about organised drug criminality and it is vital that this is dealt with.  I welcome some of what was announced in the budget for community and voluntary groups but the figure of &euro;2 million worries me somewhat because it is insufficient.  I would be afraid that this would become another element of regular funding and that it does not represent the top-up funding we were looking for.  If we are talking about addiction services, family support services or any of those necessities, such as the family addiction support network in Dundalk, we need to see multi-annual funding that is guaranteed.<\/p>  <p>  There is an onus on us when it comes to the financial sphere.

As my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, made clear, this proposes directive amends a directive we have already opted into, namely, EU Directive 2019\/1153.  The changes included in this directive are minor and practical and will enable us to participate more fully in and reap more benefit from the EU's anti-money laundering framework.  The proposed directive was published by the European Commission together with significant anti-money laundering legislative proposals that are under active consideration.  This proposal fell to be considered in the context of the wider changes envisaged.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, explained earlier, there are clear reputational reasons for opting into this proposed directive.  This opt-in will reflect on Ireland's status as a committed EU member state, our visible commitment to EU anti-money laundering framework and our reputation as an attractive and safe place to invest and in which to do business.  Ireland's opt-in will be an important element for the smooth functioning of our national anti-money laundering framework as it requires that the information from the national centralised bank account registries be available through a bank account register's single access point at EU level, which is to be developed and operated by the European Commission.  EU legislation and the financial action task force recommendations are frequently being updated to reflect new developments and to ensure they are still relevant.  This process of continuous improvement is a feature of the regime and Ireland, together with all EU member states, continues to enhance our anti-money laundering framework.<\/p>  <p>  Money laundering and terrorist financing are global issues.  Criminals routinely move the proceeds of crime from one country to another and exploit inconsistencies and weak links.  Accordingly, a coherent and global approach is needed and the EU has long had legislation in this area.  Ireland and the EU share a strong commitment in the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing.  There should be zero tolerance for illicit money as criminals will exploit all possible avenues to pursue their illicit activities to the detriment of society.  We remain determined to ensure that criminals do not benefit from the proceeds of these crimes.<\/p>  <p>  Targeting money laundering is central to fighting organised crime.  Those who commit crime, such as drug trafficking, human trafficking and fraud, depend on hiding and converting the proceeds of those crimes.  By pursuing those proceeds we can bring those responsible to justice and meaningfully reduce the incentive to commit the crimes in the first place.  This proposal is in line with the action plan for a comprehensive EU policy on preventing money laundering and terrorist financing adopted by the Commission in May 2020.  The action plan emphasises that the Union-wide interconnection of centralised bank account registries is necessary to speed up financial intelligence units, FIUs, and law enforcement authorities' access to bank account information and to facilitate cross-border co-operation.  The EU's security union strategy also stresses that interconnection could significantly speed up FIUs and competent authorities' access to the financial information.  For all these reasons and those outlined by the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, earlier, I again ask Deputies to support this motion and to support Ireland's continued engagement with the EU's anti-money laundering framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900034#GG00300","speaker":"1563"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1634663700,"counter":308,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Message from Select Committee","time":1634663700,"counter":309,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900034#GG00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1634663700,"counter":310,"content":"<p>The Select Committee on Justice has completed its consideration of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Functions and Operational Areas) Bill 2021 and has made amendments thereto.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900034#GG00600","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"\u00c1bhair Shaincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Matters","time":1634663700,"counter":311,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900034#GG00700"},{"type":"speech","time":1634663700,"counter":312,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 29A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Marc MacSharry - to discuss understaffing and under-resourcing of the ambulance service in the north-west and north midlands region;

Excuse me while I catch my breath for a moment.<\/p><p>In the past ten years, the cost of renting in this city and across the State has increased by more than 100%.  Ten years ago, the average cost of renting in parts of Dublin was &euro;800 per month.  Today, it is almost &euro;2,000 for a standard two-bedroom house or apartment.  In the past six years, and starting under the previous Government, rents in Dublin increased by 60% and across the State by 40%.  While there was some indication during the initial stages of Covid that rents were beginning to stabilise, they have started to rise dramatically in the past year yet again.  The most recent Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, rent index shows a 7% State-wide increase in the 12 months to the end of quarter 2.  If one considers the county-by-county breakdown, though, the results are startling.  We have started to see double-digit rent inflation in many county areas.  In every county, rent increases for new and existing properties have exceeded 4% according to the RTB.<\/p><p>A number of months ago, the Minister introduced legislation to amend the rent pressure zones and he decided to link rent reviews to the consumer price index instead of the 4% cap.  At the time, we told him that that was a mistake because rent inflation was already on an upward trajectory from 1.9% to 2.2% and then 3%.  It has now almost hit 4%.  I checked the RTB rent calculator earlier this week and 3.9% is the current rate of inflation.<\/p><p>As the Minister knows, the problem is not just about the significant financial hardship caused for renters.  It is also about all of the other implications for their lives.  Some 20% of households across the State rent and 25% of households in Dublin.  Renters represent a cross-spectrum of society: young people, students, singles and couples desperate to save a deposit for a mortgage, people who lost their family homes following the Celtic tiger due to mortgage repossessions and defaults, people who lost their family homes due to relationship breakdowns and many people who are approaching retirement who have never had the opportunity to buy their own homes and are fearful of what the future may bring.<\/p><p>People had a legitimate expectation in the run up to budget 2022 that, rather than the Government indicating that it would move towards what we believe should be a three-year ban on rent increases, there would be specific measures in the budget to alleviate and reduce the skyrocketing cost of rent.  The Minister will remember that he campaigned in the general election, as did Sinn F&eacute;in, for a refundable tax credit for renters to give them some relief as the easiest and quickest way of reducing the cost of rent.  It speaks volumes about the Government's sincerity when it comes to renters that not a single mention of private renters and not a single measure to alleviate the great difficulty that high rents cause them were included in the budget.  In fact, the only mention of the private rental sector, as the Minister knows, was the extension of his existing tax relief for landlords.<\/p><p>Since the Government has abjectly failed to do anything in budget 2022 to tackle the issue of sky-high rents, let alone standards for renters, we have tabled this motion to have a debate.  The Minister knows our positions, which are longstanding: we want a three-year emergency ban on rent increases, we want to put a month's rent back into every renter's pocket and we want to see the Government not just investing a few tens of millions of euro into affordable cost rental, but hundreds of millions of euro annually to deliver thousands of public homes, including thousands of affordable cost-rental homes annually, starting from next year.  We also want to see action on standards.  We want to see increased resources for local authorities and inspections as well as an NCT-style certification.  We want to see the RTB getting the additional staff it was meant to get almost two years ago to be able to police the rent pressure zones.<\/p><p>I do not believe that the Minister's approach to the private rental sector is working.  I will respond to his comments at the end of the debate in terms of his record to date.<\/p> <p>We urge the Government to stand by renters, to abandon the failed policies it has been pursuing in conjunction with Fine Gael for the past number of years and to do the right thing and ban rent increases, reduce rents and deliver a proper supply of affordable cost-rental accommodation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900035#HH00300","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634664900,"counter":317,"content":"<p>The failure to include any measure for renters in this year's budget speaks volumes about this Government's attitude to renters.

Average rents in County Roscommon are now over &euro;718 per month and in County Galway rents have surpassed &euro;1,000 per month and are now approximately &euro;1,300 per month.  Rents are out of control.  They have been out of control for a long time now and they are only going in one direction.  Yet, this Government is doing nothing.<\/p>  <p>  The Government can reiterate the help-to-buy scheme as many times as it wants but it does not tackle runaway rents and it does not reduce rents.  For the couple who came to my constituency office in Ballinasloe last week, whose landlord is increasing their rent by &euro;200, the extension of the help-to-buy scheme means nothing.  The scheme means nothing to renters.  Budget 2022 came and went.  It did nothing for renters, who are working families and individuals working just to pay rent, skyrocketing energy and food costs and everything else on the increase.  I know so many people in their 20s who emigrated after college because there was nothing here for them.  There are, perhaps, jobs coming on stream now, but they cannot take them because there is nowhere here for them to live.  They will not risk coming home to pay skyrocketing rents that can increase on a whim.<\/p>  <p>  On my way home yesterday I was listening to an interview with a person who is thinking of returning home and was looking at a new rental development in Dublin that is pet-friendly.  This person has two cats.  There is an additional charge of &euro;75 per cat per month, which is an additional &euro;2,000 per annum on top of the rent per annum for himself and his partner.  This is a joke.  It has gone out of all proportions and the Government has not acted.  It needs to act now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900036#JJ00400","speaker":"1604"},{"type":"speech","time":1634664900,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I know from contacts I have daily with constituents in Naas, Celbridge and across north Kildare that there is a direct link between the rental crisis and the mental health crisis.  I have no doubt that if the rental crisis in north Kildare and across this State was addressed many people would no longer need to be treated for anxiety, which so often triggers an episode of depression.  I say that not to downplay that important \"dis-ease\" but to highlight the anxiety that a perfectly normal human will have when faced with a crisis in regard to how and where he or she will live.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, a lady from Galway featured on an RT&Eacute; news report in regard to a home she had just been allocated by a housing agency.  The lady said that she feels she is going to be able for anything that life throws at her now that she has a roof over her head and four walls around her.  She is not wrong.  She most certainly is in a much better position to deal with issues that might arise.  Every day I see how the rental crisis and the lack of a secure home is affecting the mental health of our communities as people are faced with the threat of eviction, constant worry about rising rents, appalling conditions in private rental properties, panic in regard to where they will go if they have to present as homeless, in particular if they have children, where they will end up if they have to go into emergency accommodation and they are away from their supports and schools and without transport and so on.  We all know that mental health is not just the absence of mental illness.  Much of our mental health is a matter of how we feel about ourselves and our place in the world.  Right now, when it comes to housing there are too many people in north Kildare who feel less than and disposable because an extremely small privileged group decides what they deserve.  That extremely privileged group includes members of the three Government parties and their affairs with the cuckoos and vulture funds and all the Independents who vote with them while pretending they care about mental health.<\/p>  <p>  Private rents are out of control.  It costs approximately &euro;2,000 per month to rent a three bedroom semi-detached house in north Kildare.  We need a three-year ban on rent increases and a tax credit that will put approximately one month's rent back into the pockets of renters.  It is time for a change.  It is time for a Government that works for the people.  It is time to support our motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900036#JJ00500","speaker":"1585"},{"type":"speech","time":1634665500,"counter":321,"content":"<p>This Government had the opportunity to seriously tackle the crisis in renting in budget 2022.  However, it chose not to do so.  It is hard to imagine a Government would knowingly and willfully ignore the obvious plight of thousands across the country who are forced each week to put aside greater and greater percentages of their income as they struggle to pay ever-increasing rents.  While the cost of living rises and they are paying more in bills, the cost of putting a roof over one's head is reaching astronomical proportions.  It is also leading to a brain drain from the country as some of our best in medicine and other professions are leaving as they cannot afford to rent a property, never mind buy one.  The high cost of living is also a barrier to recruiting from abroad or indeed enticing people back to our country.<\/p><p>A simple glance at <i>daft.ie<\/i>shows an apartment with two bedrooms and two bathrooms in Dublin North-West can average up to &euro;2,000 per month in rent.  Very few individuals and couples, even when both are in employment, can pay such high rents without having to make major sacrifices in other areas of their lives.  These rents are more often than not what most people pay each month for a mortgage.  Such exorbitant rents, on top of a family having to pay for childcare, school costs, healthcare, transport and so on would clearly leave most with no disposable income as they would be effectively living hand to mouth.  There is a genuine fear from many people that they could end up being homeless if trends in rent rises continue.<\/p><p>The Government is not putting in place measures that can give individuals and families the security of tenure they need.  People are stressed, scared and feel they are in a hopeless situation without any respite or way out of their predicament.  This Government has left them behind and budget 2022 proves that.  We hear every day of the difficulties renters face and we have family members of our own who are going through the same hardships.  Rents are spiralling out of control and this must be stopped.

I think in particular of those in our coastal areas.  We saw during the course of the pandemic that the cost of properties across these areas increased massively.  Just this week a woman come into my office who lives in a coastal area.  She said her landlord is looking to increase her rent by 35%.  I know very few people, indeed I do not think I know anybody, who has disposable income of 35% lying about that they can put towards the cost of their rent.  What is being done for those people?  Report after report has shown there are no rental properties available in Galway that fall within the housing assistance payment limits.  Just this summer, a <i>daft.ie<\/i>report showed rents in Galway had risen by 9% and rents in the county rose by an extraordinary 14%.  Linking rents to inflation at a time of rising inflation will only mean this will continue.  Rents will rise and more and more people will be locked out of the housing market.  Renters need rents to be frozen and they need a tax break to help them with the massive cost of renting.

I do not doubt the sincerity of many of the speakers opposite.  I am acutely aware of the difficulties among renters all across this country.  I am also acutely aware solving the housing crisis is not something that is going to be done in a year or 18 months.  It needs robust and real policies backed by real money.  It needs a bit of honesty too, which is lacking from some of the contributors opposite.<\/p><p>This motion is a tweaked version of previous motions.  We are all acutely aware rents have reached levels that put real families and real people under incredible pressure throughout the country but especially, though not exclusively, in our major cities and urban centres.  We have seen that and this is not just a phenomenon in this country either.  We see in Europe and also in America the effect of inflation as we come out of Covid.  I have said on record a number of times that the rental market is indeed dysfunctional.  I want to greatly improve it for almost 300,000 households and tenancies which exist in this country.  However, we must recognise the fact that whether one likes it or not, we need a private rental market as well.  We have had thousands of mom and pop landlords leave.  We must look at some of the items in the Sinn F&eacute;in motion with respect to what intended or indeed unintended consequences they could actually have.  I remind Deputies opposite - I see Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell is no longer with us and that is fine - that the Government and I have brought forward five different pieces of rental legislation in the period of time I have been Minister.  Four of those Sinn F&eacute;in accepted and supported, which I welcome, including the one last July which I will deal with in a moment.  When we linked rent increases to general inflation in RPZs it meant that if rents need to go up they could only do so in line with general inflation.  However, when I brought forward this legislation - and this is where I would tell Deputy &Oacute; Broin we need a bit of honesty - I said I would keep an eye on it and an overall cap under review because I also said I was aware of where inflation was going at the time.  We brought forward the measures in July speedily and I said that at the time.  We have a further rent Bill I am bringing forward in the autumn, which I also said during the summer will deal again with the issue of rent increases.  I want to see that.  In the coming weeks I am going to introduce tenancies of indefinite duration for the first time, via that Bill which I hope Sinn F&eacute;in will also support.  I expect there will be support opposite, just as Sinn F&eacute;in has supported four of the five tenancy Bills I have brought forward on behalf of this Government.<\/p><p>We have also restricted the amount of upfront costs.  I ask Deputies to look at the amendment I have moved which details the facts of what we have already done for renters in a short space of time.  As part of that, we have restricted the upfront costs that can be sought at the commencement of a tenancy to a maximum of two months' rent, helping thousands of student renters and other renters who were previously expected to fork out deposits of upwards of &euro;3,500 to &euro;4,000.  That has been stopped.<\/p><p>Perhaps most importantly, and something Sinn F&eacute;in wilfully ignores because it might not suit its sound bites or its Facebook and Twitter videos and all the set pieces it has brought forward here, is the fact that for the first time ever we have introduced cost rental and we have tenancies in place already.  We will soon have many more of them.  Others have talked about it but we have delivered it in the Affordable Housing Act, another Act Sinn F&eacute;in supported, for which I am grateful.  These are all pieces of legislation I have brought forward on behalf of the Government, most of which Sinn F&eacute;in supported, and then its Deputies come in here and criticise them because it might suit their narrative.  That is fine.  Between now and the end of 2030 18,000 cost-rental homes will be delivered, including more than 1,500 next year.  It goes without saying that increasing housing supply in this very space will ease affordability constraints, especially on renters.  As the cost-rental sector grows, these consistent and affordable rents, which we want to see more of, which we have legislated for and for which we have, for the first time, a national cost-rental scheme in place, will have a moderating impact on the overall private rental market.  As I mentioned, tenants already in place are availing of rents at approximately 50% below the market rates.  I will be launching another scheme tomorrow where they are 40% below the market rates.  That is what we intend to continue doing right into next year.  We have published a plan with 213 different action points backed by more than &euro;20 billion in real money for real actions that are going to make a real difference for real people.<\/p> <p>Also in Housing for All is a commitment that legislation will be enacted to provide for minimum building energy ratings, BERs, in private rental properties.  Again, this is legislation which I hope Members opposite will see their way to supporting at the appropriate time.<br\/><br\/>When I look at some of the measures on housing Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies have proposed, it seems that they are modern day snake oil salesmen.  They have a cure for all of our ills and there are easy solutions to this.  They say they will build 20,000 public homes next year and I continually ask where they will be, who is going to build them, how long it will take to build them, when they will be occupied and how Sinn F&eacute;in will pay for them.  There are no answers forthcoming; just a figure of 20,000 that is pulled out of the sky.  One thing Sinn F&eacute;in is clear on is that it will abolish the help to buy scheme which has helped nearly 23,000 families to own their own home.  It also says that it will abandon long-term leasing immediately but does not say what that would mean.  I have been extremely clear on behalf of this Government that I want to see an end to long-term leasing.  I will bring it to an end but will do so in a targeted and managed way.  Let us look at what Deputy &Oacute; Broin is proposing.<b><\/b>There are already 1,300 homes in the long-term lease pipeline for 2022, decreasing to 200 in 2025.  We are showing a pathway out of this and there will be no leasing thereafter.  These are real homes ready for real people.  We cannot simply turn off that tap and cancel these homes, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin would do.  He would just scrap them.  What does Sinn F&eacute;in say to the 1,300 families who will be in safe and secure social homes next year?  Which homes would the party cancel?  Would it abandon the 160 one-bedroom homes that will be leased next year for single homeless people?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900037#KK00500","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634666100,"counter":327,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900038#LL00200","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1634666100,"counter":328,"content":"<p>It would do that.

I have shown a pathway out of leasing and I have shown the way in which we are going to increase our social housing delivery to a level never seen before in this State, starting in 2022.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has also said, in predictable criticisms that have been put forward here this evening and previously, that the Government does nothing for renters.  I have covered some of what we are doing already but let us look at what Sinn F&eacute;in is completely ignoring, namely, the 62,000 households in rented accommodation that are supported by the housing assistance payment, HAP, the 18,000 households who are being supported through homeless HAP and the almost 17,500 households supported under the rental assistance scheme, RAS.  This equates to just short of &euro;800 million in real supports for real people and real families.  Sinn F&eacute;in ignored these households and did not even mention them in its budget submission.  I am already reducing the dependency on HAP by reducing the level of increase but Sinn F&eacute;in says that it will cancel it.  What is it going to say to the thousands of families out there?  It does not have a solution for them.<\/p>  <p>  These are very real questions and it is incumbent on the main Opposition party to start to be honest with people and say what it will do.  This is a party that feigns an interest in solving the housing crisis.  It is a party that voted against at least 17 housing motions totalling nearly 7,300 homes right across this country.  Sinn F&eacute;in does not want to see real progress in housing because it does not suit its political agenda but I will not be deterred by its disingenuous and cynical approach.  We have a radical plan that will deliver 300,000 homes between now and 2030, comprising 90,000 social homes and at least 54,000 affordable homes.  These are real homes for real people and our plan is backed by real money and will deliver.  Projections into next year, which might not suit the main Opposition party, are actually positive.  They are positive in relation to housing delivery.  We are going to see significant increases in housing delivery, particularly in social housing delivery, right across this country.  We are going to see affordable and cost-rental homes at scale.

The financial crash that Fianna F&aacute;il caused also destroyed housing in this country.  When we should have kept men and women in this country to build houses, schools and roads, Fianna F&aacute;il drove them out, in their tens of thousands, to every part of the world.  I know because I have family and friends in Australia, America, Canada, England and Germany.  They were my friends.  I remember saying this to the Taoiseach's brother, S&eacute;an Martin, when we were both on Cork City Council.  The response from Fianna F&aacute;il was that \"they'll be back\" but they never came back.  How can we have people building houses when Fianna F&aacute;il drove them out of the country?  That is the truth of it.  Fianna F&aacute;il also backed Fine Gael in power for four years while it destroyed the housing market.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister referred to what he has done for renters but here are the facts.  In Cork at the moment the average rent is &euro;1,344.  Rents have increased by 6% on the Minister's watch.  He can accuse us of being dishonest but the facts are the facts.  Rents are going up every year on Fianna F&aacute;il's watch.  It is its fault because it failed to act.  Surely Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael know that the number one issue at the moment is housing.  Fianna F&aacute;il has been in government for more than a year.  The election was in February 2020 and it took the Government 18 months to produce a plan.  It did not even produce a complete plan because it contains nothing in for renters and does not tackle dereliction or the 90,000 vacant properties around the country.  The plan was introduced on Fianna F&aacute;il's watch but it does nothing to tackle these issues.

In Louth the average rent is &euro;1,148.32 but there are properties in Dundalk for &euro;1,600 or &euro;1,800 if one is lucky enough to find one.  Unfortunately, elected representatives like Sinn F&eacute;in councillors spend so much of their time dealing with rental agencies and local authorities with regard to HAP.  The difficulty is that HAP sets the baseline for rents.  Obviously, the HAP scheme is necessary because we do not have an adequate supply of council houses but it means that families are competing with those in receipt of HAP supports.  They are competing with young people or students who can band together and thus have greater spending power.  They are also competing with people working in the likes of Wuxi or other FDI employers  Louth is lucky enough to have.  We are dealing with an utterly dysfunctional sector and many people are at their wits end.  They cannot make those payments and we need a solution for them.  We tabled this motion this evening because the budget does not contain proposals that will deal with these specific issues.  <\/p>  <p>  I welcome the fact the Minister has interacted with Louth County Council on the issues of maintenance and land banks.  <\/p> <p>That is something I will be chasing up later.  We need to do something.  I know the Minister has to be inundated, the same as everyone else, by people paying rents that they cannot afford.  We need solutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900038#LL01400","speaker":"1498","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634666700,"counter":341,"content":"<p>I commend my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, on his motion on renters.  I also congratulate him and thank him for the work he does advocating for a better, fairer and more just approach to housing.  I represent the constituency of Dublin Bay South, which stands as a prime example of how housing policies developed by Government parties have continually failed the needs of these communities.  Government parties have stood idly by while Dublin City Council flat complexes have been allowed fall into disrepair and neglect.  It is important to remember that those people are renters also.  Issues like dampness, mould, frequent flooding and rat infestation are all common within the State's housing stock in the inner city.  These tenants across the inner city, who pay rent to Dublin City Council, have effectively been abandoned by this Government.  Let us dispel the myth that many pundits and those in the media like to fire out so often about social housing being free.  These residents pay rent.  They contribute to society and keep alive that strong sense of inner city community that makes Dublin what it is.<\/p>  <p>  Not only has this Government failed those renting from local authorities, it has also left many of those renting in the private sector to the mercy of institutional landlords who are trying to squeeze every cent out of ordinary working people and send it to their shareholders, many of whom have probably not set foot in Ireland.  Too often we see landlords who will put two bunk beds in one double room and charge sky-high rents per bed with little or no regard for the quality of life of those who need somewhere to call home.  For these reasons, we need the measures outlined in this motion, such as the NCT-style certification for all rental properties to ensure compliance with minimum standards.  There were zero changes for renters in the budget and no changes to HAP limits at a time of runaway rents.  We need to give renters a break and support this motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900039#MM00200","speaker":"1555"},{"type":"speech","time":1634666700,"counter":342,"content":"<p>Our message is a simple one.  We are asking the Government to acknowledge that there is a crisis in the rental sector and we want actions and not words in regard to this.  Absolutely nothing was done in the budget last week for renters across the State but corporate landlords and institutions were supported.  They are squeezing every last cent out of everyone who is renting.  In my constituency the average increase in rents year to year has been 14.2%.  I am aware that rents in Sligo, Leitrim and generally in many areas in rural Ireland are relatively low compared to those in the large urban centres like Cork or Dublin but it is all relative to those paying because wages and salaries are also lower in many of these areas.  There is no big surplus for anyone renting in rural Ireland, contrary to common belief.  There is still competition for residential rentals in rural Ireland.  The Government had a chance to give renters a fighting chance last week in the budget but failed to do so.  There was no increase in the HAP limits, for instance, which is a huge problem.  There is also no pressure to ensure that people have to accept HAP.  There are hundreds of landlords who simply will not accept HAP and are getting away with it all the time.  There is also no effort to increase the income threshold for people to get on the housing list, which is another issue the Government has failed to deal with.  If the Government had a scintilla of interest in the ordinary working renters across this State it would support my colleague Deputy &Oacute; Broin's motion and would give renters a real break by providing a refundable tax credit and banning increases in rent for three years.<\/p>  <p>  The fact of the matter is we have a situation across the length and breadth of the country where people simply cannot afford to rent.  People in my constituency are coming to me, including families renting small properties who have another child on the way.  There was a family in last week who have three children already and there is a fourth on the way.  They are in a two-bedroom house and they cannot find anywhere else to rent.  They are working and earning a salary and they cannot get on the housing list.  It is absolutely scandalous that in every part of Ireland this is impacting people's lives to such an extent and the Government seems to be oblivious to it.  Everything the Government does continues to make the market the solution and the market has failed in respect of this.  That is very clear.  If the Minister were honest about it, he would have to accept that the market has failed and that what we have to do is provide more houses directly to people, not just local authority residents but also people who are working, people who cannot get on the housing list but cannot afford the rents that are being charged by these corporate landlords.  They are the ones who are squeezing the life out of communities up and down the length and breadth of the country.  The Minister says that Sinn F&eacute;in is coming up with all the problems and none of the solutions.  He is the Minister.  His party has been in government or supporting the Government for the last ten years.  It has allowed this to happen and takes no responsibility whatsoever.  It is absolutely scandalous.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900039#MM00300","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1634666700,"counter":343,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for tabling this motion.  It is difficult to keep track of the number of motions and Bills on housing generated by Deputy &Oacute; Broin, by my colleagues in the Labour Party and other Opposition parties over the last two to three years.  The Minister mentioned that in his earlier contribution.  These are not abstract motions or Bills.  They are drawn up and tabled here today and on countless other occasions to fix a very real problem in our society and our economy.  We take to this House the direct experiences of those we represent and we try as a responsible Opposition party, and I would like to describe the Labour Party as such, to propose real solutions to these problems, as others do too.  I do not say this as a criticism of colleagues beside me but what is proposed in this motion is familiar.  They are not dissimilar to some of the provisions laid down in Deputy Bacik's recent renters' Bill.  The measures are similar because we all know objectively that the measures contained in this motion and in Deputy Bacik's recent Bill will work.<\/p><p>I will take the opportunity to read into the record, while respecting her anonymity, an email from a constituent today.  I will read it out because it is emblematic of the wider problem that we all experience in our constituencies and in our lives.  These are problems that our family members and friends have and, indeed, many in this House may experience them directly.  This email came to me today.  It reads:<\/p> <blockquote> \tMy partner and I are renting an apartment in Drogheda over the past 2 or so years.  The apartment is covered in mould and our health conditions are deteriorating.  My [young] child is always sick from the mould and on antibiotics.  Our bed and my child&rsquo;s cot have mould on it.  Our clothes and shoes have to be always thrown out because mould grows on them.  My mental health is getting worse and worse living here.  My partner also has an illness.  We have never once missed a payment and have asked our landlord when we moved in to sort it out.  This is two years on and it&rsquo;s just getting worse and worse.  We can&rsquo;t afford anywhere else to live as the prices in Drogheda for rent are sky high.  I&rsquo;m so worried for our health especially my 2 year old as I have read what mould can do to your body.  I will attach pictures [and she has done] so you can see what I&rsquo;m talking about.  I would be so grateful if you could get back to me.  <\/blockquote>  <p>I have seen the pictures.  They are emblematic of the problem we are experiencing day in, day out, and all of the cases we get.  I will of course get back to her but we feel powerless to support our constituents in situations like this because of all the reasons outlined by the earlier contributors.  What I just read into the record is a clear depiction of the reality of precarious housing and insecurity in this country and the impact it has on an individual, on children, and on families more generally.  The Minister knows this and I know he knows this.  You cannot be a fully productive, engaged citizen in this country or anywhere else if your life is bedevilled by precarity, whether it is precarious housing, insecure work or uncertain income.  This issue has an impact on our economy.  It has an impact on the finances of the family, on health, on education and on the confidence and development of a child.  Presiding over this situation shames us all.  What is to be done?  Many of the measures contained in this motion can go some way towards fixing the problems that we are experiencing in housing in our country.<\/p>  <p> These are not new problems.  There was a failure of regulation in the case I described a couple of moments ago.  There are needs, as the motion demands and for which the Labour Party legislation has provided.  There is a need for a national car test, NCT, style certification for landlords.  Often, the kinds of slums I described earlier are subsidised by the State through the housing assistance payment or rent supplement.  We cannot stand over that situation.<\/p> <p> The fear of my constituent is ultimately about leaving because she has nowhere else to go.  That is the point; she has nowhere else to go.  This speaks to a failure of supply and a failure to control rents.  She literally has nowhere else to go and no options.  I deal with far too many people who have the same experience day in and day out.  This leaves people especially vulnerable and exposed.  It is a landlords' market and they know it.<\/p> <p> Rents in my area, which was one of the early rent pressure zones, are out of control.  I cannot tell the Minister the number of absolute dumps I have visited with constituents over the last few years that are now on the market for &euro;1,600 or &euro;1,700 per month.  These are two-bedroom apartments and homes that really cannot be described as homes at all.<\/p> <p> Efforts to limit rents to the rate of inflation have manifestly failed, although the objective, as articulated by the Minister, was correct and well intentioned.  What needs to happen is what this motion and what Deputy Bacik's recent legislation call for, namely, that rents be frozen for the next three years.  That is the only immediate solution that will resolve this issue in the short term.<\/p> <p> Even if we believed that Housing for All is the optimum solution to all our housing problems and even we believed its ambitions to deliver the kind of supply it has ambitions to deliver over the next period of years, we should use a rent freeze as a bridge over the next two to three years to allow the market to draw its breath and to allow for the kind of supply anticipated through Housing for All to come on stream.  That in itself, while it would not fix the problem, would certainly contribute to additional supply and, therefore, a reduction in costs.<\/p> <p> It was said earlier that budget 2022 was effectively a non-event for renters.  That is shameful given the scale and extent of the problem that renters are experiencing in society.<\/p> <p> I will refer to two particular issues in the short time I have left.  I am pleased the Minister referred to measures he is considering introducing in respect of tenancies of indefinite duration.  That is key.  Since the eviction ban was lifted, we have seen an ever-increasing number of people entering homelessness.  We know the main reason for homelessness is people exiting the private rental sector for a variety of reasons, for example, use of the home for a wide range of family members.  This demands attention and Deputy Bacik's Bill attempts to address it.  I hope the Government will adopt that measure as well as demands for tenancies of indefinite duration.  Taken together, these steps could resolve many of the issues we experience day in and day out and many of the problems experienced by those we represent.<\/p> <p> Finally, I will refer to the language we use around housing.  We know there are many ways in which households are formed these days.  We should never forget that there are 400,000 single households in this country.  We still constantly use the terminology associated with couples and families.  There are many different ways to form households these days and there are, as my colleague, Senator Moynihan, repeatedly points out, 400,000 people in this country who live alone for a range of different reasons.  We should always be conscious of their concerns, needs and demands when we debate the complexities we face with our housing situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900039#MM00400","speaker":"1599","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634667300,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I will start close to where Deputy Nash finished, namely, with the issue of tenancies of indefinite duration.  I will certainly support such a measure when the Government brings it in.  I was a member of the commission on the private rented residential sector approximately 20 years ago.  I did not agree with the commission's decision to include a get-out clause in respect of the very limited improvements and tenancy rights that it recommended.  That get-out clause was put in place because landlords lobbied very heavily for it.  It meant that some rights would accrue in terms of tenancy but these would be effectively wiped clean after a small number of years.  I was one of a minority of people representing tenants - I represented students at the time - and I did not support that decision.  It is incredible that only now, approximately 20 years later, it is proposed to get rid of that get-out clause.<\/p><p>Let us be clear.  Tenancies of indefinite duration alone are not enough.  No-fault evictions need to be brought in to bring us into line with the European norm.  It should be the case that if somebody is paying the rent and is not in breach of the tenancy agreement or engaged in antisocial behaviour, he or she should not be subject to eviction.  There should be recognition that the property is that person's home.  It may be someone else's investment.  It may well be someone else's pension fund or whatever.  It is, however, the home of the person renting and the primacy of that should be respected.  His or her children will go to the local school, be involved in the GAA club or drama group, make friends and take time to settle into school.  That potentially would be disrupted by the person being evicted for whatever reason.  The primacy of that should be recognised.<\/p><p>This is linked to the whole area of rents and rent regulation.  The rent pressure zones have not worked.  That is not my opinion.  We know categorically that they have not worked.  The Residential Tenancies Board has published its latest data which show that the RPZs have not worked in a single county in which they have been introduced.  They have been breached in all of them.  Those data come from the RTB.<\/p><p>We know that the latest measures brought in by the Government have not worked either.  The Minister stated when he brought in these measures that he would review them in the context of inflation.  It is also true, however, that many Opposition Deputies warned at the time that inflation was increasing and those measures would be insufficient and would not work.<\/p><p>Something else about these measures fundamentally does not work.  There are two issues.  First, with rents here among the highest in Europe, having almost doubled in the last decade, we clearly do not need any rent increases.  Second, there is an issue around allowing for any rent increases and the implementation and enforcement of that.  As previous speakers have said, there are insufficient resources in the RTB.  That issue, which there have been warnings about for years, needs to be corrected.<\/p><p>The more fundamental issue, however, is the power imbalance between tenants and landlords when tenants attempt to assert their rights.  The following are the words of a renter cited in an article compiled by Michelle Hennessy in <i>TheJournal.ie.<\/i><\/p> <blockquote> \tI currently rent in Dublin and live with my partner and two children.  My experience of a power imbalance is that of our landlord attempting to increase our rent by 8%.  When we pushed back to the letting agent they rightly agreed that the rent increase must be in line with inflation.  However the landlord turned up at our home unannounced and demanded that we pay the 8% increase in cash, which he will collect personally, or he would have us and our children evicted. <\/blockquote>  <p>That leaves tenants in an impossible situation when they are trying to assert their legal rights.  They know that if they continue to assert their rights, the landlord can legally turn up and evict them and their family for a whole myriad of reasons, even though they are paying their rent and are fully compliant.  That is the situation we have created.  It makes no sense if we are serious about supporting tenants having a right to live in their homes if they pay their rent and so forth.<\/p><p>If the Government is in any way serious about this, tenancies of indefinite duration, while a start, are nowhere near what is needed to increase security of tenure for tenants just in order that they can assert their minimum and basic rights without the fear that if they try to do so, they will be evicted.<\/p> <p>I was talking to someone else recently who is renting.  The heating in the building is included in the rent.  Does the landlord turn on the heating when it gets colder?  No.  Do the tenants in the building feel they are in a position to strongly assert their rights on this with the landlord?  Of course not because they are living in fear that if they do so, the landlord could evict them on whatever grounds and reasons he or she wants.  That goes to the heart of all of this.<br\/><br\/>When the Minister was in the Chamber he asked for honesty in our contributions.  It is important we are honest in this.  The Minister referred to cost rental and the Government's plans for 18,000 cost-rental homes.  That is a great aspiration but let us be honest about what the Government has delivered.  So far this year, 25 cost-rental homes have been delivered.  The Minister has attacked the Opposition several times, not just tonight, for plucking the number of 20,000 public homes out of the sky.  He said this evening that the number had been &quot;pulled out of the sky&quot;.  That is an interesting phrase because Fianna F&aacute;il, in its election manifesto for the last election, committed the party to deliver in government at least 10,000 social homes and 10,000 affordable homes per year.  That is 20,000 public homes.  Does the Minister believe the figures in the Fianna F&aacute;il election manifesto were pulled out of the sky?  It seems he thinks they were.  If he wants an honest debate about that, he should explain why it was okay for him in his manifesto in the election campaign to commit to 20,000 public homes, while repeatedly attacking the Opposition for having the same aspiration.<br\/><br\/>The new line from the Government side appears to be to ask who will build these homes, as if the skills shortage has nothing to do with the Government.  The Construction Industry Federation has warned for years about the skills shortage and has been crying out for the Government to do something about the lack of support for apprenticeships.  Apprenticeship levels in key construction trades, wet trades, are running at approximately 10% of what they were in 2004.  The Government has a key role to play in this.  It is the largest purchaser of construction contracts in the country, especially through infrastructure and the national development plan.  It spends billions and billions.  The Government should now build a minimum number of apprenticeships into each public procurement contract.  In some other countries, they have insisted that approximately 10% of the labour force on each of these public contracts are apprentices.  That means these countries have an ongoing supply of apprenticeships and skills being built up.  They are building that into their large-scale public spending plans.  There is no reason we should not be doing that as well.  I would much prefer to hear the Government talk about what it will and can do to plug that skills gap than listen to this new line where we are asked who will build the homes and we hear this has nothing to do with the Government and it does not know what will happen or where these people will come from.  The Government has a key role in ensuring that is done.<br\/><br\/>If we look at the newspapers today, two headlines stick out.  In one we learn that one in four households believes they will still be paying rent or a mortgage when they retire.  The second states that renters are being asked to pay extra to keep cats in a pet-friendly Dublin apartment.  A monthly charge of &euro;75 for keeping a pet is now being levied in a new-build apartment complex on Griffith Avenue in my constituency.  That is on top of the baseline rent of &euro;2,250 per month and &euro;50 per month for those who want to park their car.  That is the kind of rental market which has become a reality.  I have to say I feel ridiculous reading out that headline.  What sort of country are we living in when we have that carry-on from these people?  Amy Molloy of the <i>Irish Independent <\/i>told us today that she found on <i>daft.ie <\/i>a &euro;1,000 per month charge for a studio where a wardrobe and bed have to be moved to access the shower.  I appeal to the Government.  It is an utterly unacceptable, ludicrous situation in which renters find themselves.  We need every urgent action taken on this, not a &quot;Who will build the homes?&quot; or &quot;Nothing to do with us&quot; kind of response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900040#NN00200","speaker":"1550","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634667900,"counter":347,"content":"<p>In my area, if you find yourself having to rent a place, you are, by definition, in a housing crisis unless you are very rich.  The average rents are &euro;2,200 per month.  To be honest, you would be lucky to find a place for that and rents continue to rise.  Let us think about that.  You would need after-tax income of &euro;26,000 to pay the average rent in my area.  That is completely unaffordable for the vast majority of people.  Someone on average industrial earnings would have a bit under &euro;30,000 left after tax and might have to pay &euro;26,000 of that on rent, before childcare, bills or anything else.  That is the situation in my area.  That is the worst in the country but it is not far off what we have in the rest of Dublin, which is an average of &euro;2,000 per month.  Some &euro;24,000 of after-tax income is required just to pay the rent.<\/p>  <p>  The highest available HAP rate for those who get homeless HAP - they will only get that if they are staring homelessness in the face - is &euro;1,850.  They are not allowed to look for a place with a rent of more than &euro;1,850 when the average rent is &euro;2,200.  If someone is evicted because a landlord is selling the property, moving a family member in or whatever else, he or she is in serious trouble and facing the extreme likelihood of being homeless and being sent into accommodation.  That is where it is at in my area.  I am sick of it.  This has been going on for as long as I have been in this D&aacute;il, which is a decade, and before that.  Rents never fell in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  I remember when the HAP system - it did not have that name then - was brought in 2011 by Fine Gael and the Labour Party when they said we would stop building direct capital projects.  The Government told us not to worry as rents were falling because they had fallen after the property collapse.  However, we knew in D&uacute;n Laoghaire that rents were not falling and the decrease in rents would not last for long, which it did not, and that a housing crisis was looming because of that decision.<\/p>  <p>  To compound that, a policy was embarked upon under which the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, which had all this property flogged it off to vulture funds, the same people who are now charging these extortionate rents.  In some cases down in the docks, they are charging &euro;3,000 per month and NAMA is still selling property to them.  It is not just history.  As I highlighted today in Leaders' Questions, NAMA is still doing this.  It is touting and advertising the fact that the big corporate investors which can buy this stuff can make a fortune from the high levels of rents that can be charged.  This is a State agency encouraging corporate landlords to screw people with completely unaffordable rents and the Government does nothing about it and does not mention it in the budget.  It continues to allow NAMA to do it and to allow the HAP rates to remain way below the average rent.  The vast majority of people who can even get a HAP tenancy have to top up their rent with money they cannot afford, which is pushing them into poverty.<\/p>  <p>  I will tell the House what this means and describe the harshness of it.  I had a young person come into me in the past ten days who had made an attempt on their life when they got a notice to quit from their landlord.  The person was also struggling to get psychological and social services in that situation and still faces the possibility of homelessness.  That is what is happening to people.<\/p> <p>For four years I have been going on about the people in St. Helen's Court who in the last week got a notice from their vulture landlord who took over their complex and who has been sitting on 13 empty apartments for more than two years and who is trying to evict them.  They got a legal notice saying to get out by this Friday, as in two days from now, by the end of this week or they will be taking legal proceedings to get them out and they will bang them for costs as well.  This is because Government has not taken any action to prevent them from making a no-fault eviction.  We should ban no-fault evictions.<\/p> <p> How can any Government stand by while a vulture fund does that?  I want somebody in Government to tell me what the tenants of St. Helen's Court and other people in similar situations are supposed to do.  I want somebody in the Government to tell me that when they go down to the homeless section of D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council and the homeless section tells them that they can find a place for &euro;1,850 and that the average range is &euro;2,200, what are they supposed to do?  Nobody gives that answer and therefore the families just keep going into homeless accommodation.  They are sent into hostels in town, when their kids are in school in Shankill or D&uacute;n Laoghaire or somewhere nearby and they are supposed to go in and out from the hostel in town.  When are we going to do something about this?  We hear talk, talk, talk and nothing happens.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State asked for honesty.  We have been totally consistent.  We never advocated linking rents to inflation, as some of the Opposition did.  We never agreed with the rent pressure zones.  We have been asking for years for a simple measure, which is to control rents.  Set rents, like they do in places like Austria, Denmark and in a number of places around the world.  They set initial rents.  They do not cap how much they can increase them; they set initial rents.  We should set initial rents.  It is disgusting that the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, is touting these extortionate rents when, as I highlighted today during Leaders&rsquo; Questions, they have thousands of units, mostly apartments, under construction at the moment.  They are going to allow them to go out on the market at &euro;2,000 and &euro;3,000 a month.  They could just as easily, under direction from a Minister tomorrow, charge affordable rents based on a third of average income and make them available to people who cannot afford the market rents.  The Government could do that tomorrow.  There are 24,000 units that they could deliver in the next two to three years.  That would make a big difference to many people.  Moreover, they are sitting on empty properties.<\/p> <p> Another thing we have been saying for a long time - now people in Berlin are talking about this &ndash; is to expropriate the vultures.  Take them out of the market.  They are not contributing anything.  Take them out of the market.  Why will the Government not do it?  I keep asking the Government.  It should not have sold them all the property in the first place.  It certainly should not still be selling the property by NAMA.  At what point do we learn and stop this madness and say that we do not need these people in the market?  They are contributing nothing except misery and making a lot of money for themselves.  Take them out of the market.  Expropriate them, because putting a roof over people's heads is more important than their right to make a profit from their investment.  To me that is simple.<\/p> <p> On empty properties, there should be a six-month rule.  If a property is empty for more than six months, and there is no good reason given by the owner, expropriate it.  Take it over.  I am sorry, but all the interesting excuses and complications are less important than the obscenity of people being homeless on the streets of towns, cities and villages while vacant properties are lining the streets.  Everybody knows it.  You only have to walk around this city and walk out of this building to see the places.  Some of them are in public ownership.  It is shocking.  They are sitting there empty.  There is one building that was not built for accommodation, but it just makes me sick as I see it nearly every day.  If you go past the Merrion gates, you see the Seamark building which was sitting empty for ten years.  I think that it was originally built by Tom McNamara.  It was just sitting there empty.  You could put people who are homeless in there; you could refurbish it; you could put schools in there as we have nowhere for schools; you can do all sorts of things, but it is just sitting there empty.  That is just one example that drives me insane because I see it every day.  Everybody knows this in their own villages and towns.  Why will we not take the measures to expropriate those empty properties, refurbish them and get them to people who need them?<\/p> <p> If there's any lesson from Covid-19, it is that when the Government is faced with an existential crisis it has an obligation to do emergency things that had never been thought possible before.  Covid-19 proved that when we were really pushed, we could actually do it in some circumstances.  We did things that were considered unthinkable.  Is the housing and homelessness crisis not an emergency on such a level that we need to do unprecedented things quickly in order to resolve it?  To my mind it is.  Expropriate the empty properties.  Expropriate the vultures.  Control rents at affordable levels.  Tell NAMA to deliver all its housing as solely public and affordable housing.  Ban no-fault evictions and we would make a difference to the human misery that is out there because of this housing crisis. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900041#OO00200","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634668500,"counter":349,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing the motion which again allows an opportunity to discuss some of the issues of housing and renters.  At the outset, I want to acknowledge that there are some rogue landlords - some rogue landlords - who will do everything possible to get as much money from their property and who will use sometimes illegal and immoral methods to do so.  I do not think the existence of rogue landlords is in any dispute but, equally, I do not believe all landlords are rogues.<\/p>  <p>  We do not have enough houses of the type that people want to buy or rent.  Whether for an individual, a couple, a family, or a student, there is a shortage.  I hate to sound like a broken record, but I do not think it can be repeated enough: supply and demand dictates the price of everything.  When barriers are placed in the way of supply, a product becomes scarcer.  The scarcer something becomes, the more expensive it becomes.  That is what is happening.  Rents will continue to rise until we have a better housing supply.  Part of the reason we have a lack of housing supply is because we have poor planning policy.  Senior civil servants are contacting county managers across the country, telling them to take command of their county councillors in order to push through poorly thought-out and unlawful planning policy, which places barriers in the way of housing supply.  It should be the other way around.  It is time for the elected representatives and county councils to take charge of this situation.  I mentioned previously in this House that continuing professional development, CPD, training needed to be rolled out for our directors of services in planning departments of councils.  As much as I often disagree with the Office of the Planning Regulator, we are in agreement on this matter.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, people are forced into taking judicial review proceedings, because unlawful planning policy is being implemented.  Rather than ridiculing and holding to account those who are making and implementing unlawful planning policy, the powers that be are conspiring against the victims of such unlawful policies.  Successive Governments have been placing barrier after barrier in the way of a person who wants to build a house, or multiple houses.  Every time a new regulation is passed that makes the building of a house more difficult or onerous, it has two simple consequences.  It either means the house will not be built at all or that the cost of the house will increase.  I suggest that a good place to start would be for political parties to stop voting against housing developments for spurious reasons, particularly in our large cities.  Perhaps then we would not have such a shortage of supply.<\/p>  <p>  There was a battle recently with regard to the Wexford county development plan, where the Office of the Planning Regulator wanted to plan only to allow developments of at least 35 dwellings per ha.  That figure is unrealistic for rural towns and it would act as a major barrier to development.  Importantly, nowhere in the guidelines is there a minimum density.  Thankfully, a strong campaign by seven of the eight independent councillors in Wexford County Council set down an amendment that has been accepted by all councillors and will go out for public consultation in the next month, seeing a reduced and acceptable density applied to a rural county such as Wexford.<\/p> <p>Getting the reading of the motion right will rest with the director of services and chief planners.  The independent councillors have performed for their constituents at this stage so we will have to wait for a week or two.  Further to that, there was a recent meeting of Wexford County Council which I attended.  Under Covid regulations, the meeting was limited to one hour and 55 minutes.  Some 20 minutes of that meeting were given to ridiculing my contributions here in the D&aacute;il because I dared to tell the truth and speak up about the implementation of unlawful planning policies.<\/p> <p> We can have all of the motions we like on rent prices, purchase prices or affordable housing but we will continue to have a supply crisis until such a time as the Government corrects its position and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, introduces clear, precise guidelines.  That is exactly what the Minister needs to do to remove barriers.  He needs to provide a policy that can be implemented and stop the sidewinding conversations that are taking place with senior civil servants and county managers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900042#PP00300","speaker":"1622","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634669100,"counter":352,"content":"<p>Phil Hogan and Deputies Kelly and Coveney and now Deputy Darragh O'Brien have all been Ministers who have stood in this Chamber and said that the housing crisis cannot be fixed overnight.  That hackneyed phrase has been trotted out as some kind of defence over and over again for more than a decade.  The truth is that this is not an unfixable problem but there is an issue.  Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il have an ideological objection to taking the necessary steps to fix the issue.  I will give a couple of examples.  Approximately 1 million people are in housing distress in the State.  Either they are grappling with spiralling rents, they are on housing waiting lists or they are trying to buy a home when prices are going nuts.  There are people still in mortgage distress from the last housing crisis who are going around the courts at the moment.  Yet NAMA has 577 ha of land and could be directed to provide for 4,000 cost rental houses and 4,000 affordable houses a year.  The Taoiseach sat roughly where the Minister of State is today and argued against that.  He argued that there is legislation that underpins the mandate which NAMA has to operate and that it was NAMA's job to protect the taxpayer.<\/p>  <p>  Here is the news.  The Government can change that legislation whenever it wants.  Arguing that there is legislation is not an argument at all.  The argument about protecting the taxpayer is incredible.  Some 70,000 families are currently on HAP or RAS in the State.  At least &euro;600 million is spent by the State and given to private landlords.  That money could go to buy or build social housing.  There is no protection for the taxpayer in that type of spending.<\/p>  <p>  I will give another example.  The vacant site tax is a neon light example of this.  When the Government introduced the vacant site levy a number of years ago, I opposed it as strongly as I could because I knew then that it would be a dud tax.  It was a dud tax.  It was never properly implemented.  It never scratched any speculator with regard to the price of land.  Last year, it was reported that it took in &euro;21,000.  Any Government that produces a tax that probably cost more to draft and implement than it takes in in a given year is a Government that does not mean what it says or is actually so useless that it cannot produce that tax properly.  It was replaced by the zoned land tax just a couple of weeks ago.  When we pushed the Minister for Finance on that, he admitted that there would be a tax reduction for landowners and that it would not be implemented for two or three years.  There have been ten years of saying this cannot be fixed overnight, yet the Government is pushing out the implementation of a tax that could motivate landowners into putting land into use.  That shows the Government is not interested in doing it, has an ideological opposition to it or that there is an emergency deficit within the Government.  It is an emergency deficit that is not shared by people staying on the streets.  There are ten hostel beds available tonight for students.  If you are female and do not want to share a room with males, there are two hostel beds available.  There is an urgency among that cohort of people that is simply not reflected in the actions the Government has taken.<\/p>  <p>  On the vacant home tax, I sat in the committee, opposite the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and he said that we should not implement it now because we do not know if it would make any difference, we do not know how many houses are actually vacant at the moment and we do not know their circumstances.  There are 180,000 empty homes in the country today.  If half of those could be used for housing, it would have a significant impact.  A tax could be implemented to get those houses back into use.  That money could be ring-fenced and used as a grant to help to get those houses back into use but the Government is not interested in doing so because it has an ideological block.  Is the Green Party going to go with that ideological block, as a passenger on this bus, or is it ever going to make an impact in the direction it is going with the Government?<\/p>  <p>  There are plenty of other examples.  The capping of rent only happened when the inflation rate got to about 3.5%, which meant that the cap was of no use whatsoever.  That is not the action of a Government that means business.  This issue could be fixed.  The Government is ideologically opposed to the necessary solutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900043#QQ00200","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1634669100,"counter":353,"content":"<p>Rents have gone crazy for those who are trying to rent, as if the Minister of State does not know already.  It traps people who are renting.  They will not be able to afford to buy a home for themselves.  The national average rent is &euro;1,352.  If a family or couple is trying to rent a property at &euro;1,352, they will never be able to own their own home.  They are tied into and trapped into this terrible system.  People have lost their homes due to unscrupulous banks, which have been unwilling to work with them.  Vulture funds are the clever way out for these banks and these vulture funds have ruined many people's lives.  These people wanted to pay when they could afford to but could not do so in a difficult time in their lives, so they were squeezed out of their homes, which is shocking.  This has forced more and more people into social housing or HAP, leaving tens of thousands either being fleeced or simply on the edge of being homeless.  The Rural Independent Group has put forward ways out of this mess for people who sought a home or some place to live.  We have looked for grants and tax relief in our budget submissions for people living over shops in lovely towns and villages throughout the country and rebuilding some of these rural communities.  Instead, the Government is heaping more misery on the ordinary woman or man who works tirelessly day in, day out.<\/p>  <p>  I see first-hand in my constituency clinics every weekend and on my phone during the week that people are tired and angered by the inaction of successive Governments.  For those who are willing to try to turn things around and not be a burden on the State, the Government is creating more pressure by making sure that policies are written to prevent people from getting simple planning permission for their homes.  I know people who want to live in small timber houses, maybe two beds with a back garden.  What about those who want to turn a shipping container into a home but are prevented from doing so?  What about a home on wheels, which is another idea that the local authority should co-operate with?  It would be for people who want to develop small, temporary homes, and the local authority should make sure that they are tucked away on private property.  Instead the answer is always \"No\".  The Government has absolutely no solutions.  It leaves the ordinary, hard-working people not knowing where to turn.

It is a simple, straightforward problem to tackle.  We need to supply more local authority houses.  We need to build more houses and provide more accommodation of all types.  In the county that I represent, we desperately need more one and two-bedroom accommodation.  That is a fact.  I am proud of the work of Kerry County Council's housing department and the work that it does, including Mr. Martin O'Donoghue, and the excellent staff who work with him, whether in the homeless unit, the inspectors who go out to meet applicants, the ladies in the office or the men who work in the department.<\/p> <p>However, we need more resources to be given to us.  It will have the capability then as a local authority to buy the land and build the houses.  There are excellent contractors in County Kerry who will build the houses for us.  We need more funding to be provided.  <\/p> <p> There is something I can never understand.  There has to be a mix with private.  It is not being critical of this Government, the last one or any one before.  Every Government will fail to provide enough housing.  You need the mix.  We have people shouting from different parts of the D&aacute;il and condemning the people who provide private accommodation as if they are criminals.  They are tax collectors.  They give over 50% of whatever they bring in on tax.  They are paying mortgages on the properties and maintaining them.  They are giving a service and it is no crime to do that.  I ask the Government not to neglect that fact.<\/p> <p> Another thing I cannot understand is there are people in here who shout about providing more housing and they are the first to go out and object to housing developments.  I see people in areas throughout the country objecting to people's opportunities of building houses and apartments.  They are denying people family homes and have no right in the world to do so.  People have a right to object if there is a genuine reason but I see noodenaddys objecting because they are good for nothing only objecting and trying to shoot down other people's hopes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900043#QQ00400","speaker":"1487","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634669700,"counter":356,"content":"<p>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm an deis a fh&aacute;il chun labhairt ar an r&uacute;n f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach seo anocht agus ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Teachta &Oacute; Broin a chur an r&uacute;n seo os &aacute;r gcomhair.<\/p>  <p>  The defining issue for an entire generation is housing and increasing rents.  It is a more defining and real issue than all the talk spouted about climate policy because it affects so many people.  We are all aware the current rates of rent are unsustainable for most working families, including those who rely on HAP and other payments.  A recent analysis of trends in the residential sales market showed the biggest year-on-year increase was in my county of Offaly.  I did not need to be told that by the survey because I knew it from the volume of calls I receive into my offices all the time.  We also have a situation in County Laois where the year-on-year increase is almost 10%, I believe.  We need to tackle the issue.<\/p>  <p>  Many people are trapped in the rental sector because of the lack of action on our forestry crisis.  Young couples cannot build homes because of the crisis and the cost of timber and that forces them to remain in the rental sector.  We also have a situation where vulture funds are not regulated and can do as they please with people in terms of repossession of homes.  That is forcing droves of people into the rental market.<\/p>  <p>  The Government needs to be proactive, more compassionate and to take action on regulation of vulture funds and sorting out the mess in our forestry sector.  I am aware that in two towns in my constituency, Tullamore and Edenderry, renters are paying well over &euro;1,000 per month.  That is not sustainable or right.  It was an issue before the pandemic, is still an issue and is becoming a crisis.  I ask the Government to take urgent action because I see the suffering and hardship of my constituents in Laois-Offaly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900044#RR00200","speaker":"1592"},{"type":"speech","time":1634669700,"counter":357,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for giving us the opportunity again this evening to talk about rents.  I declare that people may say I have a conflict of interest because Deputy Michael Healy-Rae is in that business and I am his brother.<\/p>  <p>  I concur with what Members have said.  The cost of rents has become very steep and people cannot meet the amounts being charged.  They are in a desperate way, especially in Killarney, Dingle, Kenmare and other places around the county.  We need to build more social housing.  We have had enough schemes and reports.  Give us the money in Kerry to build more social housing.  That is the answer to it.  We have the land and the builders to build them.  Give us more money and forget about HAP and such schemes.  I look forward to the Government getting rid of those schemes and building social houses for people.<\/p>  <p>  We must help people trying to build their own houses and who are having severe difficulty getting planning.  A lovely young girl got planning permission and some lousy being objected and appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Even though everything was perfect, An Bord Plean&aacute;la dismissed her planning application and she finished up not getting it.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la refuse 90% of all rural planning applications that come before it.  That is some record.  It must be tackled because it is not fair. <\/p>  <p>  I saw a case the other day where someone else objected and the poor young couple have to wait until December and January before they can reopen the holes, so making sure they will not get planning after a year and a half.  To think that has happened in our county and a young couple trying to put a roof over their heads are being denied planning in this way.  We must seek to do something about the levies being charged and the regulations being put on them because the cost of materials has gone out of control.

A key factor in that is the cost of housing, particularly in the private rental sector.  The majority of available accommodation in Dublin is empty luxury apartments, empty because their rents are unaffordable.  This is alongside an oversupply of luxury student accommodation with rents beyond the means of the average student.  Some are now being used, as the Minister knows, for tourist accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  During the pandemic, we discovered that front-line workers were not just staff in health services but also the workers who maintained essential services in retail, public transport, cleaners, care staff and others.  These essential workers are often among the one in five workers in our economy on low pay.  Let us take an essential worker on the minimum wage, which is &euro;10.20 per hour at the moment.  If they work 40 hours, which many do not, they will earn &euro;408 per week, or &euro;1,620 per month.  A so-called studio flat, which is a glorified bedsit, on the North Circular Road costs &euro;1,350 per month.  A one-bedroom flat on the North Strand costs &euro;1,550 per month.  What are they supposed to live on?  How can they buy food, heat the flat, pay bus fares or buy warm winter clothes?<\/p>  <p>  We hear now about a shortage of workers, especially as hospitality reopens.  We apparently have people living it up on PUP and not making themselves available for work.  As the &euro;300 or &euro;350 available to people in receipt of PUP is &euro;50 or &euro;100 less than 40 hours on the minimum wage, how are they paying their rent, never mind feeding and clothing themselves?  They have left and gone home.  That is what has happened.  If you cannot afford to live in Dublin, how can you work there?  We also have a shortage of construction workers, yet we have just 37 apprentices employed by local authorities on a national level.<\/p>  <p>  Last week's budget did nothing to tackling these issues.  We need to reduce rents by 50% and we need a rent freeze of at least three years.  Freezing rents at an average of &euro;1,900 in Dublin is not enough.  Rents will only come down if there is a supply of affordable rental accommodation.  An emergency programme to build cost rental accommodation is part of the solution but the budget reduced the target for delivery of cost rental housing.  The target in Housing for All of 2,000 units per year has been pushed back to 2025 and just 750 are planned for next year.<\/p> <p>The Land Development Agency is supposed to build 1,000 units but it has now said that will not happen until 2023.  There is no increased funding for third-level institutions to build affordable student accommodation.  We are continuing to rely on the failed policies of Rebuilding Ireland, which is what Housing for All does, with a few tweaks.  The priorities remain the same, which is that we must not upset the market and use the tax breaks for landlords to entice in international funds.  The housing needs of the person on low and even average income are simply not a priority.

I recall the former Taoiseach, or perhaps the present Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, declaring the homeless and housing crisis a national emergency over three years ago.  What I want to know is what has been done to address this emergency in the three years since.  We are in the exact same, if not worse, position as we were then.<\/p><p>We all know that high rents have, disgracefully, been a characteristic of the private rental market in Dublin for a long time.  I find it extremely concerning, however, to learn that other counties are also experiencing rent inflation, with increases of more than 10% year on year.  That is where Airbnb has not taken over all the properties.  This is especially concerning when considering mica-affected families, who are being forced into the rental market, in the middle of this crisis, while also paying mortgages on their homes because the Government refuses to address their needs and award them the 100% redress they deserve.  It is a truly shocking situation and it is an unfair stress to put on the people of Donegal, who did nothing wrong.  It is an unfair stress to put on their children too, who should not have to worry about their parents' financial situation or where they will live.  Every child in this country deserves to experience the freedom of childhood without worry or stress.  The Government is taking away this freedom and their childhood by forcing such stress on them at such a young age.<\/p><p>I urge every Deputy, in particular every Government Deputy, to get out and speak to the mica-affected children from Donegal when they make the trip all the way to Dublin to tell them about their experiences outside the gates of Leinster House at 11.30 a.m. tomorrow.  If they are willing to take a day off school and make the four-hour journey to stand outside those gates all day, the very least we can do is come down from our offices to see them, talk to them and listen to them.  We must listen to the stories of how they were forced to grow up too fast and understand what they should not yet have to understand.  We must see how this is affecting them and how every day the Government delays the publication of the redress scheme, weighs on them.  When they see this, then they can come back in here and tell me how these families and these children do not deserve a safe and secure home.<\/p><p>In looking for solutions to the rental crisis, one would think that the Government would use every resource at its disposal.  But, as Dr. Rory Hearne wrote in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>yesterday: &quot;Why is NAMA not being used as a source of affordable housing by the Government?&quot; It is unbelievable to think that there is a wholly debt-free, State-owned agency with &euro;1.2 billion in funding reserves and 577 ha of residential development land that could accommodate 80,000 social and cost rental homes.  Yet, despite the spiralling cost of rents, and the fact that we are facing what has been acknowledged as a national emergency, nothing has been done to utilise this.  The Minister for Finance has the ability to direct NAMA to stop the sale of its land and to build social and cost rental homes.  Why is he not doing this?  I call on the Government to release a map with the details of all the land that NAMA holds.  It would be very interesting to look at it.<\/p><p>While I fully support the introduction of emergency measures to cut rents, the three-year ban on rent increases, the NCT-style certification for landlords, the tenancies of indefinite duration and the delivery of affordable student accommodation, this motion does not go far enough to protect renters and to deliver the large-scale affordable housing that is needed.  The Government will unfortunately not do even what is called for in the motion for ideological reasons.  Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party have an ideological stance that the market will provide and will look after housing.  The market has been doing a great job so far of providing for the vulture funds and the people who are profiting on the backs of those who are unfortunate and who have been left behind.  They will continue to be left behind, because as long as Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party are in government, that is the way it is going to be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900045#SS00200","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1634670300,"counter":362,"content":"<p>In the very limited time available to me, I wish to focus on inspections of private rented accommodation or rather the lack thereof.  The minimum standards for rented accommodation are set out in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations and the responsibility for inspecting houses to ensure that they meet the standards rests with the local authorities.  The recent figures available from the National Oversight and Audit Commission are from 2020.  Six local authorities, including Galway city, where one would expect to find quite a lot of rented accommodation, carried out no inspections whatsoever last year.  In Clare, one in 20 private rented accommodation units were inspected.  The Minister of State might think that is bad but it is good by the standards of all the other local authorities.  In Carlow, the county of the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, there were no inspections at all last year.  In Limerick, one in 18 private accommodation units was inspected.  That is even better than Clare.  In Dublin, one in 34 units was inspected.  The figure in Cork was one unit in 48.<\/p>  <p>  Based on that, if I was a lawyer and I knew somebody who had a hovel that he or she wanted to rent out for a lot of money, I would say he or she should take their chances because the chance of being inspected, certainly in Cork city, are pretty low and in Carlow they are next to non-existent.  I would say they should go and take their chances because nothing will be done about it.<\/p>  <p>  Last year, the inspections were down on the previous year.  Nationally, just 6.7% of tenancies were the subject of an inspection.  That was due to Covid of course.  It is a great excuse for every State failing.  However, in 2019, the year before, it was only 9.9%.  Although it was not mentioned in the Sinn F&eacute;in motion, and it chose for good reason to concentrate on escalating rents and other such matters, the Government did mention it as one of the great things it has done.  It indicated that it had increased funding for inspections by 66%.  If we increase funding by 66% and the number of inspections in Cork increased by a similar percentage, I calculate that we would get a one in 30 chance of being inspected, as opposed to a one in 48 chance.

I thank Members for their contributions.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Nash raises a very valid point on the condition of houses where children are living in housing conditions with mould.  That goes back to the issue of inspections, which is being addressed by the Government through additional resources this year.  He also raised the issue of single households.<\/p>  <p>  In response to the point raised by Deputy Cian O'Callaghan on staffing in the RTB, since 2019 some 41 extra staff have been sanctioned and its powers of implementation and enforcement have been enhanced.  These posts include a number at senior executive level and a new director, a CEO, who will be appointed shortly.  That appointment will be a welcome development.<\/p>  <p>  HAP was raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett.  A flexibility of 20% above HAP limits is available on a case-by-case basis and even more is available for homeless HAP to bridge the gap between &euro;1,800 and &euro;2,200 a month.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy McNamara also raised inspections.  In 2020, Covid restrictions meant that inspections could not take place for six months of the year.  Only since July 2021 have restrictions been lifted.  The target is 25% or a one-in-four chance for 2022.  Additional funding of &euro;10 million is available for that as well.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Joan Collins raises the issue of local authority apprenticeships.  I agree with her.  We always had a very good local government apprenticeship programme.  That is one area that should be given consideration in the new apprenticeship plan.  If it is okay, I will try to address everything else through the closing speech.<\/p> <p> As the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, stated at the outset, to fully debate the wide range of rental issues put forward in the motion would take more time than is available to us this evening, so actions have to speak louder than words.  As the Minister outlined, he plans to introduce urgent rental legislation to address key Government priorities in this area, and the implementation of the actions contained in Housing for All will help to deliver an adequate supply of accommodation onto the rental market and the wider housing market.  The Government believes that everybody should have access to good quality housing to purchase or rent at an affordable price, built to a high standard and located close to essential services, offering a high quality of life.  The programme for Government, Our Shared Future, sets out the priorities in the areas of housing over the next number of years which will be given impetus by a clear plan of action under Housing for All.<\/p> <p> As already discussed, the Minister intends to bring forward urgent rental legislation to enhance tenancy protections and security of tenure for tenants.  In line with the legal advice of the Attorney General, these laws will respect the constitutional property rights of landlords while enhancing the operation of rent control in rent pressure zones and providing for tenancies of indefinite duration.  I wish to put on record that I have been assured by my Department and the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, that the RTB&rsquo;s rent pressure zone calculator operates in accordance with the Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021, which was enacted in July.<\/p> <p> In the time remaining, I will address some of the key topics raised in the debate.  In regard to rental standards, the motion calls for 25% of private rental tenancies to be inspected annually by the local authorities.  As set out in Housing for All, the target for inspection of rental properties is set at 25% of all private residential tenancies.  As I stated, a total of &euro;10 million in Exchequer funding will be made available to local authorities in 2022 to help them to reach this target and, again, this was highlighted by a number of Deputies, including the particular case study highlighted by Deputy Nash.<\/p> <p> The issue of an NCT-type certification for rental dwellings has been raised by a number of bodies in the past, most notably by Threshold.  However, establishing the rolling out of such a certification system for rented dwellings would have very significant resourcing implications for local authorities and the Local Government Management Agency.  Furthermore, the potential impact on the supply of rental accommodation, at least initially, cannot be underestimated.  An unintended consequence of such a system is that it could have a detrimental effect on supply in the rental market, resulting in an increase in rents and homelessness.  However, there are undoubted potential merits in enhancing the current inspection system.  The Department is working continuously with the sector to improve the system so high-quality homes can be made available to rent across the country, and it is investigating the feasibility of a future certification-type system.<\/p> <p> In regard to student accommodation, the motion calls for the Government to work with all higher education institutions to ensure the delivery of affordable student accommodation.  The Government is doing precisely that and is acutely aware of the challenges facing students as they return to third level.  Approximately 40% of students who rent accommodation do so in purpose-built student accommodation, with 60% in the wider private rental market.  Fundamentally, the challenge is one of supply.  As a country, we need to dramatically increase the supply of all types of housing and accommodation, including student accommodation.  That is why the Government has launched Housing for All: A New Housing Plan for Ireland, led by the Minister, Deputy O'Brien.  This plan sets out a series of actions which will be delivered to fix the housing crisis.  Housing for All is backed by the largest ever housing budget in the history of the State to transform our housing system, in excess of &euro;20 billion.  Housing for All contains a commitment to support technological universities to build purpose-built student accommodation, where such requirements exist.  In addition, there is a commitment to legislate to enable technological universities to borrow from the Housing Finance Agency and, again, this will help to increase availability.<\/p> <p> My Department and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science have been engaging on a number of issues, including privately owned student accommodation being used for other purposes.  This is deeply disappointing and runs contrary to the national student accommodation strategy.  There have been a number of incidents where planning permission has been sought and granted which facilitates the change of use of student accommodation on a temporary basis to short-term visitor accommodation.  In response to this, the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, has issued guidance to local planning authorities on this matter by way of a circular letter.  This guidance reminds planning authorities of the critical need for purpose-built student accommodation to be available to serve the needs of the higher education sector.  In essence, student accommodation should be retained for students.<\/p> <p> The Government has also taken measures to address affordability.  Student accommodation rents are controlled in rent pressure zones.  For tenancies created on or after 9 August 2021, the Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 restricts the total amount that anyone is required to pay a landlord by way of a deposit or an advance rent payment to secure a tenancy to no more than the equivalent of two months&rsquo; rent, that is, any deposit cannot exceed one month's rent and any advance rent payment cannot exceed one month&rsquo;s rent.  Previously, families were required to pay a lump sum each term, often in the range of &euro;2,500 to &euro;3,500.  The Act also limits termination notice periods in respect of student-specific accommodation so no more than 28 days' notice is required to be given by students.<\/p> <p> In conclusion, housing supply has unfortunately been impacted by Covid-19.  The periods of lockdown since early 2020 have reduced construction activity and placed limitations on the ability to conduct normal market activity.  However, the ongoing removal of Covid-19 restrictions is supporting a full reopening of the housing market and resumption of construction activity.  This, along with the increases in supply that will be delivered by Housing for All, will ensure that housing market activity normalises and that supply increases to meet the demand as the plan is implemented.  CSO data regarding new completions for quarter 2 of 2021 show that the rate of completions is increasing and the effects of periods of lockdown are abating.  Quarter 2 of 2021 data record 5,021 new dwelling completions, which is 55.5% greater than the 3,229 completions of quarter 2 of 2020.  Data on commencements are also showing significant increases over this period.<\/p> <p> The record investment by the Government will happen in parallel with major measures and reforms committed to under Housing for All, building on the Government's measures to increase the delivery of social, affordable and private market housing over the past 16 months.  Housing for All will transform our housing system and remove the constraints that can lead to delays and blockages in the provision of housing.  In particular, the actions set out under pathway 3 of the plan, the pathway to increasing new housing supply, will create the environment needed to enable the supply of more than 300,000 new homes by 2030, meaning an annual average of at least 33,000 homes.  The &euro;4 billion in Exchequer investment, supplemented by Land Development Agency funding and Housing Finance Agency lending, will ensure that 4,130 homes are made available for purchase and cost rental, a new form of affordable rental tenure in Ireland which was championed by the Green Party, and that 9,000 new-build social homes are provided, meeting the 2022 targets in Housing for All.<\/p> <p> The Government is keenly focused on helping everybody to secure a roof over their head.  Providing enhanced tenancy protections, assistance and considerable funding to help renters feel secure in their homes is uppermost in our priorities and will continue to be into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900045#SS00600","speaker":"1512","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634670900,"counter":367,"content":"<p>One issue that my office in Limerick is contacted about multiple times a day is housing.  People are calling to look for help with their housing issues and help to get on the housing waiting lists, people are in mortgage distress and, more and more, we are seeing people who are struggling to pay their rent.  Those in this category are extremely varied and include students struggling to find a house for a semester and families who have rented for years but the rent just keeps going up and up.  To put it simply, hard-working families cannot keep pace with rising rents.  Rents are out of control.  In the second quarter of 2020, the standard average rent in Limerick was &euro;1,027 per month.  By the second quarter of 2021, it was &euro;1,122 per month, a 9.3% increase year-on-year, which is not sustainable.<\/p>  <p>  Moreover, there are hardly any properties available.  For example, in Limerick today, there are only 12 properties available for rent.  Some of the rents are those we would see in the Upper East Side of New York&rsquo;s Manhattan, not Limerick city.  There are only two family homes available for less than &euro;2,000 a month, and one of them is close to &euro;2,000.  This is a disaster because there is nothing there for people to rent.<\/p>  <p>  The current Government talks about solving the housing crisis but that is all it is - talk.  If the Government was serious about addressing housing concerns, it would have taken decisive action.  One would think the budget was a prime opportunity to do so but not for this Government.  The Government offered renters nothing in the recent budget, nothing to alleviate even a little of the pressure on renters.  If it was an exam, it would have failed.<\/p>  <p>  When there is a crisis that affects so many citizens, an emergency response is needed.  The Government needs to take action to stymie the rising rents.  One option that would surely be welcome is a refundable tax credit that would give one month&rsquo;s rent back to renters.<\/p> <p> Another aspect of dealing with the housing crisis is ensuring that those who rent do so in abodes of a minimum standard.  In the past few weeks, I have been contacted about two properties near the University of Limerick, one of which has a bedroom in the kitchen area and the other a toilet next to the main cooking area.  In both cases, the landlords were seeking &euro;600-plus per month for the pleasure of renting the properties.  Renters need protection.  A useful step would be an NCT-type certification system for properties, under which a certificate would need to be renewed every 12 months.<\/p> <p> Another key problem for people who are renting is the tenuous status of their leases.  Families are being evicted on the basis that the landlord's children are returning home from Australia - for some reason, it is always Australia - and the tenant is informed that the property will not be available for rent much longer.  Section 34 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, as amended, must be amended to remove the provision whereby the use of a rental property by family members is a legitimate reason for eviction.<\/p> <p> Housing is a challenge and we must get our approach to it right.  The Government missed an opportunity in the budget to ease the pressure on renters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900046#TT00200","speaker":"1509","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634671500,"counter":369,"content":"<p>Like Deputy Quinlivan, I have people coming into my office every week who are absolutely distraught because they cannot afford to keep renting where they are currently renting, they have got a notice to quit and are trying to find somewhere else or, for whatever family reason, they have to leave their current accommodation.  I am sure there are many thousands of such people who waited with bated breath for the Minister's budget speech last week, hoping for some type of rent relief measure or, at the very minimum, something to help them in their current situation.  However, the Government completely ignored in its budget the hardships being felt by renters, some of whom are single people expected to pay up to &euro;2,000 per month in my constituency.  This cost is on top of the expense of feeding and clothing themselves and trying to live any sort of life.<\/p>  <p>  A parent came to talk to me last week who was utterly distraught after receiving a notice to quit.  She and her partner have three children and the family has lived in the area for 13 years.  They have sent hundreds of emails to landlords looking for somewhere to live but have not been successful.  Any three-bedroom family home they find costs up to &euro;2,000 and more to rent.  That is way out of reach for these two working people.  They just cannot find anywhere to live but they must leave their current property by March 2022.  Unfortunately, they are faced with going into homelessness.<\/p>  <p>  The Government needs to build social and cost-rental housing.  It must step up to the plate and take action to deal with this problem.  The urgency of the situation has been outlined in the Chamber for weeks.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin has repeatedly set out the measures that are needed to tackle the housing crisis, including a refundable tax credit for private rental tenants that would put a month's rent back into every renter's pocket and deliver at least 4,000 affordable cost-rental homes in 2022.  Unfortunately, those pleas have fallen on deaf ears.  What we really need is action because people cannot take this anymore.  They cannot be faced with a rental market where there is nothing available or whatever is there costs thousands of euro per month.  That is just not acceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900047#UU00200","speaker":"1476"},{"type":"speech","time":1634671500,"counter":370,"content":"<p>The purpose of tabling this motion tonight was to highlight the abject failure of the Government to provide any immediate, urgent relief for those in the rental sector struggling with sky-high rents.  The Government has been in office for nearly 15 months and none of the legislation to which the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, referred has done anything either to stop the upward movement of rents or bring rents down.<\/p>  <p>  I want to respond to some of the comments the Minister made before he left the Chamber.  He is right that landlords are leaving the rental market.  In fact, we have lost more than 20,000 private rental tenancies in four years.  The Government has no plan or strategy to stop this disorderly exit from the rental market.  I have been calling on the Minister, as I called on his predecessor, Eoghan Murphy, to put in place such a strategy and work with the Opposition to achieve it.  To date, our pleas have fallen on deaf ears.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister referred to five legislative measures the Government has introduced.  The purpose of the first of them was to strip the overwhelming majority of renters of the Covid-19 protections introduced by the previous Minister.  Bit by bit, with each subsequent Bill, further restrictions on those protections were put in place.  As a result, the overwhelming majority of private renters now have no protections, even when they are still experiencing difficulties arising out of the Covid-19 crisis.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister also told the House that we supported his move to shift rent pressure zones from the 4% cap to an inflation-indexed basis.  We supported it but we also told him on the floor of the convention centre that it would not work because inflation was already on an upward trajectory.  In fact, I have just checked the Residential Tenancies Board rent review calculator, which shows inflation at 4.3%.  We do not yet have the legislation from the Minister to address that issue and we do not know when it will be introduced.  What we do know is that if another cap of, say, 2% is introduced, that will not work either because it will not apply to tenancies outside RPZs or new rental stock coming into the market and it will not, in the main, be enforceable on existing rental tenancies where a new tenant occupies, both because of the understaffing of the RTB and the lack of empowerment of tenants to make complaints.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is right that he introduced improvements to the deposit regime for all renters.  Of course he forgot to mention that he did so on foot of a USI-initiated Bill tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in and supported by the Opposition and the Government.  It was only after this that he chose to move on the issue.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to cost-rental provision, I accept that the Green Party has long advocated it, as has Sinn F&eacute;in.  The Minister promised to deliver 390 additional cost-rental units this year.  According to the reply to a recent parliamentary question, only 113 will be delivered.  If he could not deliver 390 new units this year, from where will he get 1,500?  There will be additional funding for the approved housing body sector to provide an extra 500 units, as well as the 250 it has not provided this year.  These are appallingly paltry targets.  The idea that the Land Development Agency is going to deliver another 1,000 cost-rental homes seems farcical to me.  It does not have 1,000 such units under construction at present.  The only way it will achieve its target is if it goes out and acquires those units for the market, which means it will be in competition with AHBs for cost-rental units, as well as AHBs and local authorities for turnkey properties.  I do not believe that target will be met.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the comments by the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, on an NCT-style certification system, when the Green Party was in opposition back in 2018, it supported a Sinn F&eacute;in motion on foot of an \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" report called Nightmare to Let.  We have shown that such a system can be implemented in a way that would be cost-effective for the State and impose virtually no extra cost on landlords.  If 25% of rental properties are to be inspected annually, as is proposed, then a landlord would only have to secure an updated certificate every fifth year, at a cost of &euro;100.  I do not see how that would have any negative impact whatsoever on supply.<\/p>  <p>  The most telling remark by the Minister of State was his observation that he hopes market activity will normalise after the Covid crisis.  That means we will go back to the chaos and dysfunction of a housing market, particularly in the private rental sector, that has reined over the past nine years of Fine Gael-led government.  That is not a good thing and it is not where we should want to go.  That is why I am urging the Government to reconsider the measures outlined in our motion to stop rents increasing, reduce rents immediately and dramatically increase affordable, particularly cost-rental, supply, not to a few hundred units a year but to thousands of units every year until the need is met.  I commend the motion to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900047#UU00300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1634671500,"counter":371,"content":"<p>Amendment put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1634671500,"counter":372,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 80(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time tomorrow evening, Wednesday, 20 October 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900047#UU00500","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna - Questions - Ceisteanna ar Sonra&iacute;odh Uain D&oacute;ibh - Priority Questions","time":1634672100,"counter":374,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900048#VV00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","time":1634672100,"counter":375,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900048#VV00300"},{"type":"question","time":1634672100,"counter":376,"qnumday":86,"qnumall":"[50782\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900048#VV00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons on hospital waiting lists, including lists not reported by the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, such as diagnostic lists; his plans for tackling waiting lists; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1634672100,"counter":377,"content":"<p>My question is on hospital waiting lists.

Approximately &euro;9 million has been left aside for that.  That is, by and large, for therapy posts and administrative work.

That is why I want to leave that flexibility.<\/p>  <p>  The other area of significant funding is for the 1,700 school-leavers.  That is part of the transition planning for young people.  This year I also introduced a deferral option for young people, so they have that choice.  The other additional funding of more than &euro;5 million is for under-65s in nursing homes.  It is the first time ever we have had a line in the budget for this.  Some &euro;18 million was allocated for this last year.<\/p> <p>This year, I have allocated four times that amount at &euro;72 million.  This will build up capacity and allow us to do more.

As he mentioned, emergency department attendances have reached 2019 levels and exceeded them in some places.  In 2019, 1.34 million people attended emergency departments and approximately 350,000 of them were admitted.  I acknowledge the work of our front-line staff in keeping the emergency departments open throughout the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  Our figures for attendances underestimate the seriousness of the situation.  Not only are attendances at 2019 levels, but many of the people attending are sicker, they have deferred their care, they now need more treatment and their average length of stay is longer.  All of this is contributing to very significant pressures on our emergency departments.  It is only October and we are facing into a tough time.<\/p>  <p>  Tackling the issue of patients having to wait on trolleys is a top priority.

The NAS has told me that there is an absence of a treat and refer policy that is underpinned by clinical governance and that there needs to be movement in this regard.  Many people are calling ambulances because they cannot get access to GPs, meaning that more people are presenting to emergency departments.

The point I am making is that this is a serious issue, which is very real for the local community.  It is something that has been discussed with me by Oireachtas Members in opposition and obviously, in government as well.  I am aware that the HSE initiated a process of planning for changes to the services at Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Navan.  I am also acutely aware that any proposed changes to health services can be a source of great anxiety and worry for communities affected and for the people we all represent and in this case, the people Deputy Guirke represents.  I am determined that any consideration of changes to services at Navan must be happen in consultation with the local community in the first instance, through their elected representatives.\u00a0 I have, therefore, instructed the HSE to pause any such movements and to engage in a comprehensive manner with the elected representatives on behalf of the community.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to set out for the Deputies the context for the proposed changes.  In 2013, a smaller hospitals framework was published.  It included a list of nine designated model two hospitals, including Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital in Navan.  Eight of the nine have transitioned and Our Lady's in Navan is last on the list.  The HSE has advised that the proposed changes to the services at Navan, in line with the Government decision, are necessary to support safe service delivery on a sustained basis and to address some very real clinical concerns. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE's planning envisages the development of a 24-7 acute medical assessment unit, along with a 12-7 local injuries unit, and an extended role for the hospital in areas such as day and ambulatory surgery.  I am advised that this would see the significant majority of current footfall continue, with the hospital in the future providing more care rather than less.  Of course, this would have to be supported by the necessary investment.<\/p>  <p>  I want to see the details of all of these proposals and I want those details to be shared with the elected representatives.  I also want the proposals to be discussed in detail with the elected representatives.  If it is the clinical view, and I am advised that it is, that what is being proposed will save the lives of the people Deputy Guirke represents, then I want us all to hear that from the senior clinical team on the ground.  I want them to tell us that.  If they believe this is going to save lives, and I am advised that they do believe that, then we need to hear it directly from them.  If part of this is dependent on serious investment, then let us make sure we know exactly what level of investment is being proposed and how it is proposed to spend that investment.  I will then need to make sure that funding is allocated so that these are not promises about things that could happen in the future but are specific, tangible, funded investments.  Ultimately, what we all want is to make sure that if there are to be changes to systems, and healthcare systems go through reconfiguration all of the time, then they must be absolutely and clearly in the interests of the local community, they must be about saving lives as well as improving the quality and accessibility of healthcare.  Critically, any such process must be done in consultation with the people affected through their elected representatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900052#ZZ01800","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1634674500,"counter":442,"content":"<p>I hope consultation with elected representatives includes Opposition Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900052#ZZ01900","speaker":"1506"},{"type":"speech","time":1634674500,"counter":443,"content":"<p>It does.<\/p> <p>We did not get the meeting with the Minister that we were supposed to get.

The Government is firmly committed to developing all aspects of mental health services nationally.  Both the Government and the Department of Health recognise the need for continued service improvement across the country.\u00a0 The Mental Health Commission is the regulator for mental health services in Ireland and is entirely independent in its operation.  As part of its work, the commission&rsquo;s Inspector of Mental Health Services regularly inspects mental health facilities, including those operated by the HSE.\u00a0 As part of the inspection process, the HSE and the inspector may agree on corrective actions to be taken to enable a facility to operate in line with regulations.  Where such actions involve the conditions of facilities, the HSE\u00a0estates department may be engaged\u00a0to inform appropriate responses, in conjunction with senior community health organisation, CHO, management. \u00a0A decision might be made to undertake works to ensure they meet Mental Health Commission standards and regulations and are safe for both residents and staff.\u00a0 For example, the department of psychiatry in St Luke&rsquo;s Hospital Kilkenny has benefited from capital funding upgrades, and works to upgrade Galway CAMHS at Merlin Park will be completed in early 2022.  On occasion, if a facility might be deemed a safety concern, a decision may be taken to close that facility.  At all times, patient safety and dignity is a priority for the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  Sharing the Vision\u00a0recommends that capital investment should be made available to redesign or build mental health units in acute hospitals which create a therapeutic and recovery supportive environment.\u00a0 In 2021, &euro;15 million is available to the HSE for major capital works in mental health, including approved centres, and &euro;13 million is available for minor capital works and refurbishments. \u00a0A national improvement project to develop and roll out a HSE ligature risk reduction policy and audit is also under way.

Those five residents are, therefore, moving to nursing homes under the fair deal scheme.

It is my absolute priority as Minister for Health and a priority for all Ministers of State in their respective areas.<\/p>  <p>  Right now, we have 760,000 patients on the acute hospital inpatient day case, outpatient and gastrointestinal scope lists.  A higher figure of approximately 900,000 is often quoted, although this includes people who have appointments for scheduled care cancellations and suspensions and so forth.  On top of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, list, however, as the Deputy rightly said, there are people waiting in the community.  People are waiting on mental health and disability services and on diagnostics.  The situation is very serious indeed.<\/p>  <p>  At the beginning of this month, I published an acute waiting list action plan.  The plan was drawn up between my Department, the HSE and the NTPF.  It is using the &euro;210 million access to care fund that I allocated for this year to improve access immediately.  The plan is to fund an approximate additional 150,000 interventions for people who are on those lists.  As I know the Deputy will appreciate very well, the waiting lists are continuing to rise and the no-policy change numbers go up a lot.  The first thing we must do, therefore, even though we are dealing with a pandemic and a rise in Covid-19 again, and even though our hospitals are under pressure, is to stop the increase and then use every resource available to the State to bring it down.

We need to see structural reform and not just reward those who work within our private hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  In the programme for Government in 2016, for example, a commitment was secured to look at expanding the Sligo hospital cataract surgery model, which had slashed waiting times by providing the follow-up care in the community by ophthalmologists.  Five years later, the only expansion of that service has been to Letterkenny University Hospital where today, just 32 people are awaiting cataract surgery.

We are taking the learnings from the very successful vaccine task force and bringing them to bear.  As the Deputy quite rightly said, we are going to do this differently.  We are going to use all of the capacity we can, first of all within the HSE but then also within the private sector.  That &euro;350 million is a lot of money and can do a lot of good.  I could not agree with the Deputy more.  It is not enough.  Using that kind of money can be effective in terms of dealing with the backlog but we must bring the day-to-day capacity of our public health system up to a point where it can meet the day-to-day demand.

Look at the state-of-the-art theatre sterilisation room that was constructed in 2016 at RUH.  It has been used for storing beds and wheelchairs for the last five years because the HSE will not approve funding to equip the facility in order that we could fully utilise the two theatres in that hospital and reduce waiting times across the west.  Of course, if we did that and reduced waiting times across the west with regard to our waiting lists, that would undermine the case for the new elective hospital in Merlin Park.

She has raised this issue with me on many occasions.  The Government has prioritised improved access to home support services through an additional investment of &euro;150 million in 2021 for these services, which has been maintained under budget 2022.  Estimated data indicate more than 13.2 million home support hours had been provided between January and August which is approximately 2 million more hours compared against August 2020.  The number of people assessed and waiting on funding has significantly reduced through 2020 and 2021.\u00a0 This has mainly been as a result of validation of waiting lists and availability of funding.  I have the CHO 7 figures.  Some 250 people were waiting for funding approval at the end of August 2021, including 21 from Dublin south city; 98 from Dublin south-west; 53 from Dublin west; and 78 from Kildare and west Wicklow.  However, at the end of June 2020, 1,232 people were waiting, and therefore, there has been a significant reduction.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE will continue to work towards increasing home support provision.<\/p> <p>However, there are difficulties recruit with recruitment and retention of staff, with certain areas experiencing increased pressures.  This can lead to delays between the approval of funding and the delivery of home support hours.  When I came into the post, more than 7,200 people were waiting for approval of funding for home care supports.  That figure has fallen by 88%, but now we have another challenge, which is the recruitment of home care workers.  I am in a situation now where I have the budget to pay for it, but we are having difficulty in recruiting the home care workers.  As a result, the Department is committed to establishing a strategic workforce advisory group with involvement of key stakeholders.

The Deputy will be aware of the significant investment in University Hospital Limerick in recent years to address this, including a new emergency department which opened in 2017.  A total of 132 additional beds have been provided in the past year, which I know the Deputy will welcome.  It includes additional capacity in the new 60-bed ward; a 24-bed, single-room, rapid-build ward; and the reconfiguration of the 14-bed high dependency unit, HDU.  In addition, the new 96-bed inpatient ward block, which is 4 x 24 beds, has now progressed through the detailed design stage and is due to go to tender in the coming weeks.  While this is welcome and is having an impact, the increase in attendance in recent months, along with the challenges of providing Covid-19 care, is challenging.<\/p>  <p>  The hospital is actively managing discharges and using the model 2 hospitals and community facilities to ease the pressure.

He is from a Muslim background.  In 2018, both of his parents were killed in anti-Muslim violence.  Nadim came to Ireland.  He currently lives in Cork city, at the Kinsale Road direct provision centre.  Nadim worked all the way through the pandemic.  He worked in a hospital as a security worker.  He paid his taxes.  Last month, Nadim received a letter from the International Protection Appeals Tribunal, which affirmed a recommendation of the international protection officer, which stated that he should be refused a declaration as a refugee along with subsidiary protection status.  Nadim had provided certificates from his family's doctor concerning the death of his parents, along with a multiplicity of other documentation.  Part of the problem is that Nadim has been unable to provide written documentation from the police outlining the details of the death of his parents.  Anyone familiar with the question of anti-Muslim violence in India these days and the role of the state under the Modi Government will not be surprised by this.  They would not expect someone to get certificates of that kind from the police.  Someone knowledgeable about the situation would say that Nadim is being asked to clear an impossible hurdle.  The appeal to remain is on the grounds that his life would be in danger were he to be deported back to India.  He commenced a hunger strike last Thursday, taking liquids but refusing food.  Tonight is the sixth night of his hunger strike.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister of State knows, physical and mental impairment can begin within two to three days of the commencement of a hunger strike.

Sandeep is studying to be a beautician and wants to start her own business.  Gurcharan plays cricket for Cork County Cricket Club, and aspires to play for Ireland.  Gursewak is a talented member of the Citadel music group.  Like Nadim, they too are in danger of deportation back to India.  The Singh family are well known in Cork.  They made fantastic colourful masks during the pandemic, and distributed them on the main street, St. Patrick's Street, free of charge.

I heard the speeches, met the non-EU fishers and talked to them and they called together in one voice for the end of the atypical scheme that has not served them well.  They called for this because the scheme is flawed.  It is not working.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State to immediately enact the process to end the atypical scheme and replace it with a scheme that works, protects non-EU workers and removes the constant fear of deportation in which they live.  It is so they do not have to go through the bureaucratic, arduous process of reapplying year after year to get back into the atypical scheme or back into contracts and have the same rights as their fellow crew members and friends, with whom they are shoulder to shoulder and side by side on these boats doing quite dangerous, hard work.  Will the Minister of State please listen to the calls of the fishing sector and the non-EU fishers in the industry, who we need because fishing has been seen time and time again as a less viable way of earning an income?  They need to have a scheme that works for them, protects them and serves them.  I ask the Minister of State to begin that process straight away.

The Deputy will be aware that in 2015 the Government established an interdepartmental task force with the objective of formulating a co-ordinated and effective cross-government response to the issues raised on the employment of undocumented non-EEA crew members in the Irish fishing fleet.  It was highlighted at the time by <i>The Guardian<\/i>.<\/p><p>The culmination of the work was the development of a new sector-specific scheme that involved putting in place detailed contracts between the vessel owners and non-EEA nationals with a series of built-in protections and obligations.  This was the atypical working scheme which, at the time, was welcomed as an immediate solution to the risk of exploitation and to guarantee employment rights and protections to non-EEA fishers availing of the scheme while ensuring fisher employers were able to recruit staff.  It set down minimum terms and conditions of employment applicable to non-EEA fishers which are in line with the general statutory terms and conditions of workers more generally in the State.<\/p><p>A memorandum of understanding for the monitoring and enforcement of the scheme was put in place between all relevant parties to ensure that the various bodies with oversight of the sector were part of the solution.  The scheme applies to crew members working on licensed and registered fishing vessels in the polyvalent, beamer and specific segments of the Irish fishing fleet for vessels of more than 15 m in length overall and who are not currently eligible for an employment permit issued by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.<\/p><p>Permission holders under the scheme can make a request to change to a different employer licensed under the scheme at any time during their permission.  They do not need to leave the State in order to do this.  The scheme requires that the new crew member be provided with a copy of their contract of employment in both English and in their native language by their employer.  However, the scheme is now more than five years old.  It was brought in as a response to issues highlighted at the time but a review is timely. <\/p><p>As I said, I have recently discussed the matter with my colleagues, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, and the Minister of State, Deputy English, and we have agreed to carry out a review of the scheme.  Officials from the three Departments met last week.  They are working closely together and will meet again soon to carry the review work forward, agree the terms of the review and look at important issues around the effectiveness of the existing scheme, whether the enforcement is working, whether the scheme has run its course and whether the sector should move to a permit scheme, similar to other sectors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900058#FFF00500","speaker":"1618"},{"type":"speech","time":1634678100,"counter":513,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

He was on Newstalk earlier today.  He has run an ice rink in Limerick for the past 15 years, claim-free, yet he cannot get insurance cover.  That is the case with all ice rinks, which are a traditional feature of Christmas time up and down the country.  Equally, other areas of the leisure sector cannot get cover.  This situation arose for a number of reasons.  It emerged following Covid that the mainstream insurance companies in Ireland are not covering many aspects of the leisure industry.  In many cases, the sector was being covered by insurance companies operating from within the EU with passporting rights, and some from the UK.  Brexit has been a factor also.<\/p><p>I understand there are applications before the Central Bank from insurance providers from Europe and the UK that would provide cover in the leisure sector, but the applications are taking a serious amount of time.  I spoke to some insurance providers in Ireland who are seeking to become registered to provide insurance.  They are going to other countries such as Malta where they are processed more quickly, and they can operate in Ireland with passporting rights.  I would like companies operating in the insurance market in Ireland to be regulated here.  It gives comfort both to the individuals being insured and the entire sector.<\/p><p>I urge the Minister of State to take up the matter with the Central Bank to see what the status of the applications are for these companies.  Following the pandemic, we now need to carry out a proper review of the insurance cover that is being provided.  There is an onus on the main insurance companies in Ireland to provide insurance across all sectors, not just specific sectors, which is the case currently.<\/p><p>The Minister of State is probably aware that the Alliance for Insurance Reform published a survey today and I wish to refer to a number of its features.  First, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, announced a 40% reduction in the average personal injury award.  Second, we must set up a register in the Central Bank or even in the Department.  When the insurance companies were before the finance committee three years ago, the main companies gave me a personal commitment that any reduction in claims and legal fees would be passed on <i>pro rata<\/i>in insurance premiums.  That must be tracked on a daily basis.  That is something we must see happen.<\/p><p>Will the Minister of State contact the Central Bank about companies that are seeking to operate in Ireland to provide insurance cover?

This industry plays a key role, not only from an economic perspective, but more importantly often serves to enrich the quality of life in communities across the country.  Accordingly, I do not take the challenges that these companies and groups have experienced with regard to the obtainability and affordability of insurance lightly.<\/p>  <p>  However, the Deputy will know there is no single policy or legislative initiative which the Government can take to persuade insurers to provide cover for a particular industry.  Moreover, neither I nor the Minister for Finance can direct a company to do so.  Notwithstanding this, we continue to prioritise insurance reform and this work is progressing right across Departments on the timely implementation of all the actions outlined in the Action Plan for Insurance Reform.  As the Deputy knows, the first action plan implementation report was published in July, and 34 of the 66 actions contained therein are now completed.<\/p>  <p>  As part of my intensive stakeholder engagement on the reform agenda, I have for my part met with many groups to discuss the difficulties in obtaining insurance.  I am aware of the exit of a number of UK leisure insurers from the Irish market in recent years.  Furthermore, I also understand that an unstable personal injuries environment was a large factor in those firms making the commercial decision to exit.<\/p>  <p>  The new personal injuries guidelines were a key element of the action plan, which was delivered about six months ahead of schedule.  When we came into government the legislation provided that the guidelines would be published by 31 October 2021, but we did it six months ahead of schedule, with the assistance of the Judiciary bringing forward its work.  Early data published last week from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board shows, as the Deputy indicated, an average reduction of 40%.  This is an encouraging development.  It is my hope that this trend will continue and once bedded in will result in lower costs for businesses.<\/p>  <p>  There should be a pound-for-pound reduction in the premiums based on the savings.  However, it is important that people recognise that while personal injury claims is the single biggest cost affecting insurance companies, it is only one of the costs.  What was covered by the guidelines was the smaller injuries, slips and trips and soft tissue injuries, which only represent a percentage of all personal injury costs. If there is a car accident, there are cars to be repaired and sometimes the personal injury is part of the overall cost of settling a claim.  The very serious injuries that require lifelong treatment are not covered by the recent board because nobody would suggest that the costs of caring for a person in the long term should be reduced by the awards.  While there are cost savings, our job is now to ensure that they are passed on to customers as quickly as possible.  Once that trend gets established, we think it will be important.<\/p>  <p>  The press release from the Alliance for Insurance Reform today acknowledged that there was a reduction of 10% in motor insurance renewal costs.  It did say that some sectors have been very badly hit, despite the recent reform.  That is especially in the area of high risk such as the leisure and entertainment area, and outdoor activities and pursuits.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation dealing with occupiers' liability and the duty of care is being finalised and will be brought forward very soon.  That is a key component and the industry wants to ensure that there is a fair spread of the risk associated with claims.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900059#GGG00400","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1634679300,"counter":518,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

It is generally felt in the insurance market that matters will stabilise next year.  We had Brexit and the pandemic and, as the Minister of State said, we also now have a trend where awards are coming down by 40%.  I ask that the main insurance companies in Ireland would look to provide insurance cover, just as a once-off for this period and particularly over the Christmas period when there are family activities such as ice rinks, which are a tradition in all cities.  Furthermore, we must ensure that the public insurance bodies, with the local authorities, would also look at this issue.<\/p>  <p>  We are in a particular transition period where many of these insurers have left the market.

While I cannot direct them as to what to do, I can certainly pass on the information and the content of this debate.  They may not be sitting up watching the debate at this moment in time, but I will make sure they receive that information tomorrow.<\/p>  <p>  I want to refer to recent developments that will help this sector move forward.  Obviously, we know about the PIAB report in regard to the personal injury guidelines; we made perjury a statutory offence for the first time this year, which will help; and, the Central Bank published a final report on differential pricing.  Today, the Cabinet approved a general scheme for an insurance (miscellaneous provisions) Bill, details of which I expect to be published tomorrow.  That deals with the specific issue of price walking, whereby there was a loyalty penalty for people who had car insurance or home insurance for a long number of years.  We will ensure that is no longer legally allowed from 2022 onwards.  The reform of the duty of care legislation, the Occupiers Liability Act, is progressing very quickly and the enhancement of the enforcement powers of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission is also being dealt with, together with bringing forward the general scheme of a Bill to reform PIAB.  We are reducing insurance fraud through the Insurance Fraud Coordination Office and the Central Bank has issued its report on differential pricing.

This is pregnancy and infant loss remembrance month, a time to mark loss in pregnancy or soon after birth.  This is an incredibly sensitive matter which represents tragedy and bereavement for thousands of families.  Pregnancy loss in the form of miscarriage or stillbirth occurs in up to one quarter of all pregnancies.  This loss can have a devastating impact on parents, other children and family members.  It is vital that this particular form of grief and isolation is recognised and supported.  Last Friday was the global wave of light when candles on monuments and buildings were lit in the colours pink and blue in memory of lost young lives.  I know many families and communities across Ireland marked this day by remembering their own loss or showing solidarity with others.<\/p><p>F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in, the Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Association of Ireland, is a volunteer-led organisation that supports families affected by perinatal loss.  This year, it launched the Remember Our Names campaign, which is calling for an immediate amendment to section 8 of the Stillbirth Registration Act 1994 to make the stillbirth register public.  Under the current Act, only parents can view the details of infants on the stillbirth register.  This register was treated differently to others to protect the privacy of families involved.  Reading over the D&aacute;il discussion of this topic over 25 years ago, the motivation of the Minister and Deputies at the time was to recognise the intense personal nature of this matter.  However, understanding of pregnancy and infant loss has developed since then, and the families directly affected are calling for a change.<\/p><p>F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in&rsquo;s Remember Our Names campaign highlights that a mandatory sealing of this register hides away the details of their lost infants.  Officially, no one besides the parents could find out about them.  F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in is requesting that the 1994 Act be amended to allow families to opt out and to allow their babies' names on the public record.  It is also rightly suggesting that any records for the period prior to any legislative change would remain private unless requested by bereaved parents.<\/p><p>This is an issue that families feel very strongly about, and I am sure the Minister of State has seen the very personal stories that some bereaved parents have shared as part of the campaign.  One of these stories, Liliana&rsquo;s story, describes the shock and pain of a stillbirth.  Her parent details how it is not a tragic event but &ldquo;a life-long process where you learn to live in a world that has shifted and you no longer know your place in it&rdquo;.  They go on to explain the impact of the mandatory privacy around the stillbirth registry.  Again, I quote her parent, who said:<\/p> <blockquote> \t[Liliana&rsquo;s] siblings, nieces and nephews have no right to know about her - future generations will not be able to include her in our family trees, despite the fact that she has had such a profound impact on her family.  I felt it was an insult to her to hide her away like that. <\/blockquote>  <p>There, they sum up the issue.  They illustrate the additional pain that the current system forces on grieving families.  The 1994 Act was passed in the best interests of parents and families and in response to the information available at the time.  We now understand things differently.  Will the Minister of State look into what can be done to amend the law to help families suffering pregnancy and infant loss?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900060#HHH00500","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speech","time":1634679300,"counter":524,"content":"<p>I join with Deputy Cairns and other Deputies in reflecting on the enormous losses of parents as part of this month's marking of pregnancy and infant loss.  I do not think anyone in this House will disagree when I say that a stillbirth must be one of the most traumatic events that parents can experience.  My own experience of engaging with parents is that the loss can be overwhelming, long-lasting and, importantly, very difficult to reconcile.<\/p>  <p>  When legislation to establish a stillbirth register was enacted over 25 years ago, this State was 30 years behind Northern Ireland and 40 years behind England and Wales in giving formal State recognition to a stillborn child.  The Minister of the day, the late Mervyn Taylor, when introducing the Bill in 1994, outlined his approach to the long-awaited legislation.  He explained that his approach was determined by two considerations.  The first was to recognise the therapeutic effect that registration might deliver for grieving parents.  The second was to create a permanent record akin to the register of births within the civil registration system.  While acknowledging the points the Deputy has made in terms of how our understanding has come a long way since then, these two considerations remain as valid today as when the legislation was first enacted.<\/p>  <p>  The recently published eighth report of the national clinical audit on perinatal mortality in Ireland, conducted by the National Perinatal Epidemiology Centre in Cork, provides essential insights into the incidence of stillbirths and perinatal deaths.  The centre has the aim of identifying quality improvement initiatives and proposing recommendations for the improvement of care for mothers and babies in Ireland.  All 19 Irish maternity units reported anonymised data to the centre.  The report details that some 325 deaths occurred in 61,298 births occurring during 2018.<\/p> <p>Stillbirths and early neonatal deaths accounted for 270 and 108, respectively, of those 325 deaths.  In 2019, 360 deaths arising from 59,574 births were reported, of which stillbirths and early neonatal deaths accounted for 242 and 118, respectively, of the total.<\/p> <p> The General Register Office, GRO, is notified of all births that occur.  It reports similar data to those I have indicated, stating that between 300 and 350 families are affected each year by loss due to stillbirth and early neonatal deaths.  The GRO also observes that due to the voluntary nature of the stillbirth registration process, approximately half of parents select to register the event, perhaps reflecting, in part, the huge loss suffered by parents and their wider family.  I encourage parents to register their loss.  The stillbirths register can provide a tangible record and acknowledgement of stillborn children.  As well as serving as a focus for the memories of bereaved parents, it also has the strength of providing familial linkages for future generations, but only if the records can be accessed.<\/p> <p> In her contribution to this debate, Deputy Cairns has conveyed the proposals advanced by advocacy groups that seek legislative change to open the stillbirths register to public access in a way that is similar to the birth, marriage and death registers.  The Civil Registration Act 2004 provides that no person other than the Registrar General or a member of staff of the GRO is authorised to search the stillbirths register.  The GRO provides whatever assistance it can to enable searches.  There are restrictions on providing copies of the information held in the form of a certificate to anyone other than a parent.  My colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, has indicated that she is willing to reassess these restrictions as they are set out in the Act.  Given the sensitivities involved, she has stated that we may not go as far as providing full public access, as in the case of the birth register, but that other, less limiting, forms of access may be considered.  We should recognise, too, the parents who, for their own reasons, choose not to register.<\/p> <p> This discussion is timely given that we are in the month of Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to open a dialogue on how we can better manage the system of registration.  She has asked the GRO to examine the policy and legislative implications involved in making the stillbirths register more open and whether it should be fully open, as with other public registers, as proposed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900060#HHH00600","speaker":"1563","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634679900,"counter":526,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  For the families involved in this campaign, public registration is a means of recognising their children.  It is a relatively minor change in legislative terms but one that can have a major impact.  The Minister of State indicated that the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, will look at the matter with a view to change, but perhaps not to the extent I am proposing.  It is important to highlight that F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in wants to give parents options for how they register their child, rather than there being a blanket approach.  I ask that the Minister consider this suggestion.  I implore her to begin the process of changing the law and giving families a system that better reflects their needs.  It would be great if the Department would liaise with the voluntary organisations on the move to a changed system.<\/p>  <p>  Given the Minister of State's portfolio, I want to raise a related matter that needs some consideration.  Under social protection regulations, mothers of stillborn infants, that is, infants born after 24 weeks of pregnancy, are entitled to maternity leave and maternity benefit.  However, those who suffer miscarriage or loss at under 24 weeks of pregnancy are not entitled to anything.  This means that two families in similar circumstances may be treated very differently, depending on whether tragedy befell them a few days before or after the 24-week mark.  While I understand that regulations sometimes requires a framework such as a sharp divide, the divide, in this instance, does not reflect the reality of pregnancy and infant loss.  I urge the Minister of State to look at how this matter can be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  The UK Department of Heath and Social Care committed recently to a strategy of halving the rate of stillbirths and neonatal deaths in England by 2025.  Will the Minister of State ask his counterpart in the Department of Health to follow that example or look into what exactly is being done in the UK to achieve its target?<\/p>  <p>  It is important to recognise the work of groups such as F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in and the Miscarriage Association of Ireland, which do incredible work supporting families, as well as the Pregnancy Loss Research Group and the National Perinatal Epidemiology Centre in UCC, which provide vital research in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021101900061#JJJ00200","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speech","time":1634679900,"counter":527,"content":"<p>I welcome the short debate on this important matter, which has afforded the House the opportunity to mark the month in which Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day occurs.
