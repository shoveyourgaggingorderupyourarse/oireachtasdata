HIQA is an independent authority established to drive high-quality and safe care for health and social care services in Ireland. HIQA&rsquo;s mandate extends across a range of public, private and voluntary sector services. Reporting to the Minister for Health and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, HIQA&rsquo;s role is to develop standards, inspect and review health and social care services and support informed decisions on how services are delivered.<\/p><p>HIQA operates under the Health Act 2007, which sets out the functions which the Authority is to carry out. HIQA has responsibility for setting standards for healthcare services, and monitoring compliance with those standards. It also regulates facilities providing care for the elderly and those with disabilities, and has a role with regard to inspecting some of the social care services which are accessed by children to determine if they are meeting the relevant National Standards.  In addition, it undertakes functions in relation to Health Information and Health Technology Assessment.<\/p><p>Section 9 of the Act sets out the grounds under which HIQA may undertake an investigation into a particular service, or may be requested to undertake such an investigation by the Minister for Health. <\/p><p>The Act provides HIQA with the power to set standards for the healthcare services delivered by the HSE, and then to undertake monitoring programmes to assess compliance with these standards. In this regard, HIQA published the National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare in 2012; they represent the overarching standard which public health services are expected to meet. Flowing from these themes, HIQA have also developed standards for particular services, e.g. National Standards for the prevention and control of healthcare-associated infections in acute healthcare services. HIQA has in turn conducted a thematic inspection programme against these standards since 2012, which has resulted in the publication of over 300 reports of inspection visits to date. In addition, HIQA has also undertaken thematic inspection programmes in relation to nutrition and hydration in acute hospitals, and in relation to medication safety. <\/p><p>In such cases, HIQA typically undertakes both announced and unannounced inspection of healthcare facilities in order to ascertain the degree of adherence to expected standards. A report of the inspection visit will subsequently be published on HIQA&rsquo;s website, and frequently attracts media attention. In cases where remedial action is required, depending on the severity of the risk identified, HIQA may draw the matter to the attention of hospital management during the inspection and request an immediate response, or in less severe cases, will raise the issue in writing. In either case, an appropriate management response would be expected. <\/p><p>Further standards also continue to be developed i.e. most recently National Standards for Safer Better Maternity Services and National Standards for the Review of Patient Safety Incidents.<\/p><p><b>Extension of HIQA's Remit<\/b><\/p><p><i>Patient Safety Licensing Bill<\/i><\/p><p>The Patient Safety Licensing Bill, in line with the Slaintecare Implementation Strategy, will see HIQA become the licensing authority for all hospitals and certain designated activities. The Bill will, for the first time, introduce a licensing requirement for all hospitals, public and private, and certain designated high risk activities in the community. It was approved by Government in December 2017 and underwent pre-legislative scrutiny at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health on 13 June 2018.<\/p><p>HIQA will be the licensing body, with statutory powers to require hospitals to undertake improvements and the authority to remove a licence from a service which is failing to meet required standards.<\/p><p><b><i>Patient Safety Bill<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>In advance of a formal licensing regime for public and private hospitals it is proposed that the Patient Safety Bill will bring the private\/independent healthcare sector within the remit of the Health Act 2007. The proposed bill will extend HIQA&rsquo;s powers to set and monitor standards, and undertake investigations, where necessary, to the private acute hospital sector. The Patient Safety Bill underwent Pre-Legislative Scrutiny at the Oireachtas Health Committee on 26 September 2018.<\/p><p><b><i>Competent Authority for Medical Ionizing Radiation<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>HIQA has been designated to take on the responsibilities of the &ldquo;Competent Authority&rdquo; for Medical Ionizing Radiation, as is required by European Directive 2013\/59\/Euratom. HIQA will assume regulatory responsibility for Medical Ionising Radiation Protection, e.g. the use of x-ray machines in clinical settings. These functions currently reside with the HSE, however the transfer of responsibility is required in order to ensure Ireland complies with the incoming European regulations. Such a move was also recommended by the International Atomic Agency in its review of Irish regulatory practice in this area. The legislation to transpose the European Directive is almost complete. As such, HIQA has been taking preparations to assume these new responsibilities.<\/p><p>I have set out above the current responsibilities of HIQA, and the additional roles it is expected to acquire in the coming period.

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines. <\/p><p>In line with the 2013 Act and the national framework agreed with industry, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE, it must apply to have the new medicine added to the reimbursement list.<\/p><p>Reimbursement is for licensed indications which have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA).<\/p><p>HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).<\/p><p>Pembrolizumab has market authorisation in Ireland\/the EU for a number of indications. <\/p><p>The HSE has approved the reimbursement of pembrolizumab for the following indications:  <\/p><p>- as monotherapy for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adults; <\/p><p>- as monotherapy for the first-line treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 with a \u2265 50% tumour proportion score (TPS) with no EGFR or ALK positive tumour mutations; <\/p><p>- as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) who have failed autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) and brentuximab vedotin (BV), or who are transplant-ineligible and have failed BV. <\/p><p>It should be noted that the first part of the last indication is not reimbursed because the HSE is already reimbursing another immunotherapy with similar efficacy (nivolumab) at lower cost. Patients who are transplant-ineligible and have failed BV can receive reimbursement support for pembrolizumab, as nivolumab does not have market authorisation for this sub-group of patients. <\/p><p>The HSE Drugs Group are reviewing the indication below: <\/p><p>- as monotherapy for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma in adults who are not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy and whose tumours express PD-L1 with a combined positive score (CPS) \u2265 10.<\/p><p>The following indications are currently under health technology assessment with the NCPE: <\/p><p>- in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy, for the first-line treatment of metastatic non-squamous NSCLC in adults whose tumours have no EGFR or ALK positive mutations;<\/p><p>- as monotherapy for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma in adults who have received prior platinum-containing chemotherapy. <\/p><p>No reimbursement application has been received to date for the following indication:<\/p><p>- as monotherapy for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 with a \u2265 50% TPS and progressing on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy  <b>.<\/b><\/p><p>However, the HSE has approved reimbursement of nivolumab for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic squamous cell cancer of the head and neck in adults progressing on or after platinum-based therapy.<\/p><p>A reimbursement application for the following indication has been withdrawn by the applicant:  <\/p><p>- as monotherapy for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 with a \u2265 1% TPS and who have received at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. Patients with EGFR or ALK positive tumour mutations should also have received targeted therapy before receiving pembrolizumab. <\/p><p>However, the HSE has approved reimbursement of nivolumab, which could also be used in this cohort of patients at a lower cost.<\/p><p>In October 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), which is the European Medicines Agency's committee responsible for human medicines,  adopted a positive opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for pembrolizumab to include a new indication as follows: <\/p><p>- as monotherapy for the adjuvant treatment of adults with stage III melanoma and lymph node involvement who have undergone complete resection. <\/p><p>The HSE has commissioned a rapid review assessment for this indication.<\/p><p>There are no other indications for pembrolizumab approved in the European Union at this time. Clinical trials for various immunotherapies, including pembrolizumab, are ongoing globally for a range of other possible indications, which may receive marketing authorisation in the EU over the next number of years. Each of those indications will be considered for reimbursement as market authorisations are granted and applications received.<\/p><p>A Government decision put in place a package of support measures for the women and families affected by the issues related to CervicalCheck.  As part of this package, all out of pocket medical costs incurred by the women affected will be met to the extent that they are not already covered either under existing public schemes or any private health insurance policy that an individual might hold. This commitment includes medicines which might not be approved for reimbursement, once they are prescribed by the treating clinician. Although not specifically referenced, pembrolizumab would be encompassed under this aspect of the support package.  <\/p><p>The statutory responsibility of the HSE for medicine pricing and reimbursement decisions, in accordance with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, remains unchanged regardless of this support package.  <\/p><p>I am aware of the concerns raised in the D&aacute;il and elsewhere regarding the question of providing medication to other cervical cancer patients on the same basis as encompassed by the Government decision of 11 May 2018.  At my request, the HSE Medicines Management Programme is examining ways in which other woman with cervical cancer could be afforded access to Pembrolizumab if prescribed by their treating clinician.

Progress in this area is reflected in the additional funding made available in recent years with the home support budget growing from a base of &euro;306 million in 2015 with expected expenditure of almost &euro;420 million in 2018. Overall, the 2018 HSE National Service Plan provides for over 17 million home support hours to be delivered to 50,500 people at any time. In addition, a further 156,000 hours, relating to adverse weather funding, were provided from Spring 2018. Intensive Home Care Packages will be delivered to approximately 235 people at any time and will deliver approximately a further 360,000 hours in the full year.  Despite this significant level of service provision, the demand for home support continues to grow. It is important to note that the allocation of funding for home supports across the system, though significant, is finite and services must therefore be delivered within the funding available. <\/p>  <p>  In that context, we are keenly aware and acknowledge that in some cases access to the service may take longer than we would like. People who are on the waiting list for Home Support Services are reviewed, as funding becomes available, to ensure that individual cases continue to be dealt with on a priority basis within the available resources. Priority is determined by local front line staff who know and understand the clients&rsquo; needs, and who undertake regular reviews of those care needs to ensure that the services being provided remain appropriate. Waiting times will vary as some clients are dealt with as a priority depending on individual circumstances, risk assessment and urgency of services required, along with availability of capacity at any given time. <\/p>  <p>  Following the recent Budget announcement, the HSE and officials from the Department of Health are in the process of developing and agreeing the HSE National Service Plan 2019, which will set out, in detail, the type and quantum of services to be delivered in 2019 including in relation to services for older people.While the existing home-care service is delivering crucial support to many people across the country, it needs to be improved to better meet the changing needs of our citizens.  The Programme for a Partnership Government signals the Government&rsquo;s intention to improve home care services and to introduce a uniform home-care service. At present the Department is engaged in a detailed process to develop plans for a new statutory scheme and system of regulation for home support services. The Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy sets a target of 2021 for introduction of the new statutory scheme. <\/p>  <p>  The new scheme will introduce clear rules in relation to the services for which individuals are eligible and in relation to how decisions are made on allocating services. For that reason, developing a new statutory scheme will be an important step in ensuring that the system operates in a consistent and fair manner for all those who need home support services. It will also help to improve access to the home support services that people need in an affordable and sustainable way. The system of regulation for home support will help to ensure that the public can be confident that the services provided are of a high standard.<\/p>  <p>  While the new home support scheme is under development, the Department and HSE are continuing efforts to incrementally improve the existing home support services.  The HSE has begun streamlining home care services by introducing a single funded home support service in 2018. This brings together the funding for home help and standard home care packages which now operates as a single home support service from 2018 onwards.  This new approach is providing significant benefits including making the services easier to understand; streamlining the application and decision-making processes; and facilitating service users to move to changed levels of service as their assessed needs change, without the need for an additional application process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120500082#WRD02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Voluntary Sector Funding","counter":199,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120500082#WRD02100"},{"type":"question","counter":200,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[50613\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120500082#WRD02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason he has not allocated funding to an organisation (details supplied) in view of the essential service it provides to persons with autism in Galway city and county; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":201,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

I am deeply concerned by the continued high level of violence, and by reports of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, which perpetuate the crisis and impact negatively on its scale.<\/p>  <p>  The current conflict began in 2013 and has had devastating consequences for civilians. The war, compounded by drought, has led to severe food insecurity and caused massive population displacement and suffering throughout the country, with women and girls suffering the most. More than 400,000 people have died and an estimated 7 million people are currently in need of humanitarian assistance.<\/p>  <p>  On 12 September last, the President of South Sudan, Salva Kiir, signed a peace agreement with the opposition. While this peace agreement has the potential to mark a new departure, it is critical that South Sudan&rsquo;s leaders implement it without delay. Achieving lasting peace will require sustained effort and commitment as well as a genuinely inclusive approach to building the future South Sudan.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland strongly supports efforts to build peace in South Sudan. In November 2017, during his visit to Addis Ababa, the T&aacute;naiste met representatives of IGAD (Intergovernmental Authority on Development) and the African Union to discuss the situation in South Sudan. On that visit, the T&aacute;naiste announced funding to the IGAD High Level Revitalization Forum, the process which delivered the revised peace agreement. Ireland will continue to support IGAD&rsquo;s work on monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the agreement in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Addis Ababa, which is accredited to South Sudan, monitors the situation and engages with local, regional and international parties on an ongoing basis. The Irish Ambassador in Addis Ababa visits Juba frequently where she meets with key government, UN, NGO, Red Cross and diplomatic partners, including the EU Delegation. Her most recent visit took place last week.<\/p>  <p>  We are committed to supporting efforts towards peace in South Sudan and have contributed to projects aimed at peacebuilding. In 2018, this has included supporting partners&rsquo; meditation efforts and empowering civil society, in particular women&rsquo;s groups, to facilitate their engagement in peace processes.  As well as our direct bilateral support, we are actively involved in the efforts of the EU to support peace in South Sudan. Two officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been seconded to the EU Delegation in South Sudan, including one as head of Mission. The EU Delegation is strongly supportive of the peace process, in particular by providing support to the implementing and monitoring bodies of the peace agreement. The T&aacute;naiste discussed these efforts with the EU Special Representative for the Horn of Africa, Alexander Rondos, when he visited Dublin on 7 November.<\/p>  <p>  While a sustained resolution to the conflict is the ultimate goal, we have a duty now to deal with immediate humanitarian needs. Since 2012, Ireland has provided &euro;61 million in direct humanitarian assistance to South Sudan. Over &euro;10 million in Irish funding has been provided so far this year, including to Irish NGOs to assist them in reaching the most vulnerable. Christian Aid, Concern Worldwide, Oxfam, Tr&oacute;caire and World Vision, with support from Irish Aid, are working in partnership with local organisations and NGO networks to provide lifesaving supplies to meet the basic needs of those suffering from the conflict.<\/p>  <p>  As well as this direct bilateral aid, Ireland has also contributed significantly to humanitarian support in South Sudan through the multilateral system. Ireland is a significant contributor to the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund, which has allocated $187 million to alleviate the crisis in South Sudan since 2011, as well as to the EU, which has provided more than &euro;90 million so far this year.<\/p>  <p>  With humanitarian needs likely to remain acute in 2019, Irish funding will continue to support both those in need inside South Sudan as well as South Sudanese refugees in neighbouring countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120500084#WRF02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1241"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Greenhouse Gas Emissions","counter":327,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120500084#WRF02600"},{"type":"question","counter":328,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[51132\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120500084#WRF02700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the progress his Department has achieved in reducing its carbon footprint; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":329,"content":"<p>Since the baseline year of 2009, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has taken part in the Public Sector National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for reducing energy usage.

These energy efficiencies translate into meaningful power consumption reductions, with consequent benefits in terms of CO2\/kWh emission reductions.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department also engages with OPW&rsquo;s Architectural and Engineering Services Divisions on identification of projects that will assist in achieving additional energy efficiencies and it is an active participant in the Office of Public Works (OPW) &ldquo;Optimising Power @ Work&rdquo; campaign.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department participates in the State-led schemes that assist in reducing Ireland's carbon footprint more generally, including participation in the cycle-to-work and the travel-tax saver schemes, waste management and the promotion of recycling.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, my Department is committed to reducing its carbon footprint through all available options, embedding energy efficiency into the culture of the organisation and continuing to support and progress energy management initiatives across our office locations, including energy awareness activities for staff.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120500084#WRF04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":352,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120500084#WRF05100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Measures","counter":351,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120500084#WRF05000"},{"type":"question","counter":352,"qnumday":160,"qnumall":"[51103\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120500084#WRF05100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if the Public Service Superannuation (Age of Retirement) Bill 2018 will be commenced before the end of 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1304","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":353,"content":"<p>The Public Service Superannuation (Age of Retirement) Bill 2018 passed all stages in the Seanad on 17 July and passed Second Stage in the Dail on 7 November.

Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include not only single parent rate, but those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates. This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.  This data is applied uniformly to all schools in the country in a fair and objective way, to identify the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in each school.  <\/p><p>The calculation of the level of disadvantage in each school is based on the socio-economic background of their pupil cohort using centrally held data as previously outlined.

PDST has developed a resource to support teachers in developing physically literate children through the lens of Fundamental Movement Skills.

This has been the case either in the course of the current grant-aid scheme administered by my Department, in connection with the previous grant-aid scheme operated by Pobal on behalf of the Department, or in connection with schemes funded independently by local authorities. I understand from my Department's engagement with the Local Government Management Agency that the total number of local authorities which have undertaken the role of data controller for these purposes amounts to 28 out of the 31 local authorities nationwide.<\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless, my Department is engaging on an ongoing basis with the Local Government Management Agency and the County and City Management Association, to clarify any queries arising and to assist in resolving any concerns.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to be aware that on 29 November this year the Data Protection Commissioner&rsquo;s Office issued a note (available on its website www.dataprotection.ie) confirming that there is a legal basis for community based CCTV and that the General Data Protection Regulation does not introduce new barriers in that regard.  In particular, the Office in its note confirmed that: &ldquo;Data protection legislation does not stand in the way of the roll-out of Community based CCTV schemes that have been authorised by the Garda Commissioner. Once the local authority in the administrative area concerned is willing to take on and deliver on its responsibilities as a data controller for the schemes concerned, there is no legal impediment under data protection legislation to the scheme commencing.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the question of monitoring, the Data Protection Commission has explicitly confirmed that local authorities are not required, as a result of their role as data controller, to monitor CCTV live feeds on a continuous basis. <\/p>  <p>  The Data Protection Commission is currently conducting an audit of the practice, operation and governance of CCTV as part of a wider inquiry into surveillance through the use of technologies for law enforcement purposes.  We expect the findings from the CCTV module of this process to be of assistance to all concerned and in particular to local authorities. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120500085#WRG05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prison Accommodation","counter":431,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120500085#WRG05800"},{"type":"question","counter":432,"qnumday":189,"qnumall":"[51115\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120500085#WRG05900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 28 of 29 November 2018, the reason for the high numbers sleeping on mattresses in the Midlands Prison which was 674 on nights in July 2018 if capacity is at 92%.","asker":"1259","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":433,"content":"<p>I am advised by my officials in the Irish Prison Service (IPS) that the bed capacity figure for each prison which appears daily on the IPS website represents the maximum number of beds available.

The unit was recently completed at a cost of approximately &euro;2.7 million and is capable of housing up to 10 prisoners, including six violently disruptive prisoners.

NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties from the medical profession (including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health).  The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and informed by public health advice and international best practice in relation to immunisation.  All relevant and appropriate information is taken into account when deciding to make changes to the State's immunisation programmes.  NIAC has made a recommendation that the HPV vaccine should be given to boys. <\/p>  <p>   On foot of NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation, the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) has undertaken a health technology assessment (HTA), at the request of my Department, on extending the national immunisation schedule to include human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination for boys.  The HTA will establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of providing the vaccine to boys.  The decision to extend the current programme which offers HPV vaccination to all girls in their first year of second-level education to a programme that will also offer vaccination to boys will be informed by the evidence contained in the HTA.  HIQA has completed a public consultation on the draft HTA and is expected to submit its final recommendation to my Department next week following its recent sign-off at its Board Meeting in November.    <\/p>  <p>   As I have previously stated, subject to a favourable HTA, I will seek on behalf of the Government to extend this vaccine universally as a priority.  If a positive recommendation is received from HIQA, it is anticipated that the rollout of the HPV vaccination programme for boys would commence in September 2019 for 12\/13 year old boys in their first year of secondary school.  The HSE has included costs of &euro;3.25 million for 2019, &euro;4.41 million for 2020 and &euro;4.65 million for 2021 in their Estimates submission.  Funding has been made available in the budget to facilitate the introduction of this initiative, should it receive a favourable recommendation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120500086#WRH03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Eligibility","counter":477,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120500086#WRH04100"},{"type":"question","counter":478,"qnumday":210,"qnumall":"[51027\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120500086#WRH04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason cancer patients are not automatically entitled to a medical card (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":479,"content":"<p>The HSE's Expert Group on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility examined the issue of awarding medical cards on the basis of illness and concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility.   The Expert Group also concluded that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.  This position remains unchanged.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.  The HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold where they face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services. The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to persons suffering from cancer and other serious medical conditions the HSE also has a system in place for the provision of medical cards in response to emergency situations i.e. in circumstances where persons are in need of urgent or on-going medical care that they cannot afford and also for persons in palliative care who are terminally ill. These medical cards are issued within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and a letter which confirms the medical condition from a doctor or consultant. With the exception of terminally ill patients, all medical cards, granted on an emergency basis, are followed up with a full application within a number of weeks.  <\/p>  <p>   I would also like to note that since 1 July 2015, the HSE adopted the position that all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer are awarded a medical card.

Since Ireland attained officially Brucellosis Free Status herd level testing for Brucellosis is no longer carried out. <\/p><p>In the context of the TB eradication programme, a feedlot&rsquo; herd is a herd that comprises a &lsquo;non-breeding&rsquo; unit which disposes of all cattle direct for slaughter and fulfils at least one of the following three criteria:<\/p><p>(i) the cattle are permanently housed (never on pasture) or<\/p><p>(ii) there are no contiguous holdings\/lands with cattle i.e. must not have any neighbour contacts either through cattle being confined exclusively in yards\/building or if intending to graze cattle the land is secured so there can be no contact with cattle e.g. surrounded by tillage, residential industrial\/recreational units or impenetrable rivers, roads or walls or<\/p><p>(iii) the boundaries are walled, double fenced or equivalent so as to prevent any direct contact with cattle on contiguous lands\/premises\/holdings <\/p><p>Furthermore, there must be no evidence of within herd acquisition or spread of TB.<\/p><p>Thus a Feedlot herd, is a herd that poses minimal risk of infecting other cattle because of effective isolation from other herds.<\/p><p>In addition the following conditions apply:<\/p><p>- The land used to graze animals must be nominated in advance and inspected and passed by a veterinary inspector.<\/p><p>- A Feedlot, being a TB restricted herd, is not permitted to sell cattle on the open market other than directly to slaughter.<\/p><p>- Feedlot herds that fatten females must have the capability of rearing any unplanned calves until slaughtered or the herd has been de-restricted.<\/p><p>- If animals are being put on grass, the herd must be tested before being &lsquo;let out&rsquo;.<\/p><p>- Animal Identification and Movement Notification procedures must be complied with.<\/p><p>- All testing requirements must be complied with.<\/p><p>- If TB is diagnosed but following an epidemiological inspection there is no evidence of within herd spread the feedlot may continue to buy in.<\/p><p>- When TB is diagnosed specific conditions with respect to disinfection of premises and equipment and also storage and spreading of manure\/slurry must be respected.<\/p><p>- Any manure and slurry on the holding must be stored for at least two months prior to being moved off or spread on the holding.<\/p><p>- Manure\/slurry may not be spread on ground to be grazed within the succeeding 4 weeks.<\/p><p>- Test reactor animals are removed for slaughter under permit.<\/p><p>- Inconclusive reactor animals that are being slaughtered before re-test must be moved to slaughter on foot of a movement permit to ensure they are subject to appropriate post mortem examination.<\/p><p>- If it is ascertained that infection was acquired within the holding, permission to buy in is suspended. The herd is only de-restricted and allowed to buy in again if all the animals are free from clinical signs of tuberculosis, cleansing and disinfection of the premises and utensils has been completed and all animals on the holding have reacted negatively to at least two consecutive tuberculin tests, the first no less than 60 days and the second no less than four months and no more than 12 months after the removal of the last positive reactor.

The transport sector has a vital role to play in the national mitigation effort. To address this challenge, we are strongly pursuing emission reductions and energy efficiencies in transport across four key strands. <\/p>  <p>  Firstly, we are increasing investment in public and sustainable transport to support modal shift and accommodate growing travel demand.  An efficient public transport sector is a key priority in meeting our climate change goals.  The National Development Plan has committed &euro;8.6 billion to public transport over the 10 year period from 2018 to 2027.  <\/p>  <p>  Secondly, we are encouraging a transition away from fossil fuels.  In the 'National Policy Framework on Alternative Fuels Infrastructure for Transport in Ireland' Ireland&rsquo;s ambition that by 2030 all new cars and vans sold would be zero-emission capable was clearly outlined. To support this ambition, as well as a Programme for Partnership Government commitment, an interdepartmental Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce was jointly convened by my Department and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to consider a range of measures and options to accelerate the deployment of low carbon technologies.  In addition, under the National Development Plan Ireland has committed to stop buying diesel-only buses for the urban bus fleet from July 2019. To better inform future bus purchasing decisions, my Department is currently undertaking trials on alternatively fuelled buses. <\/p>  <p>  Thirdly, the Biofuels Obligation Scheme plays a major role in decarbonising the road transport sector in Ireland.  The penetration of biofuels as a share of road transport energy has increased significantly over recent years from a share of 4% in 2010 to 8% (by volume) from 2017.  It is intended that the Biofuel Obligation Scheme will be incrementally increased on a sustainable basis to help meet the renewable transport target of 10% by 2020 as set under the Renewable Energy Directive. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, an important role will be played by the introduction of more efficient standards for vehicles.  Ireland continues to push strongly for better EU vehicle standards, seeking greater ambition in regulations that ensure vehicles registered in Europe, including cars, vans and heavy duty vehicles, are increasingly more efficient and less emitting.  It is through better technology and improved efficiency that vehicle emissions can be decoupled from increased economic activity and population growth.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to actively work with other Departments and Agencies to research and develop new measures on a whole of Government and least-cost basis to advance Ireland's decarbonisation and energy efficiency policy pathways.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120500089#WRL01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Capital Programme Applications","counter":669,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120500089#WRL02000"},{"type":"question","counter":670,"qnumday":276,"qnumall":"[51149\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120500089#WRL02100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the position regarding an application by a club (details supplied) for floodlights and ancillary equipment under the sports capital grant scheme.","asker":"1259","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":671,"content":"<p>The 2018 round of the Sports Capital Programme opened for applications on Friday 7 September and the application period closed on Friday 19th October.

Recipients retain the advantages of the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme such as retention of secondary benefits and access to activation programmes.  The 2019 Budget Allocation for the Farm Assist scheme (including fish assist) is some &euro;72 million.  <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2017 fully reversed the previous cuts to the Farm Assist means test.  The changes included that 70% of farm income is now assessed as means, down from 100% being assessed as means (which is equivalent to a 30% income disregard) and an additional annual means disregard of &euro;254 for each of the first two children and &euro;381 for the third and subsequent children.    <\/p>  <p>  The assessment of means for the purpose of qualifying for farm assist is designed to reflect the actual net income from farming.  Income and expenditure figures for the preceding year are generally used as an indicator of the expected position in the following year.  However, account is taken of any exceptional circumstances so as to ensure that the assessment accurately reflects the current situation.  It may also be noted that farm assist customers continue to receive more beneficial treatment than other self-employed persons as payments received under the Agri-Environment Options Scheme (AEOS), Green Low-Carbon Agri-Environment Scheme (GLAS) or Special Area of Conservation (SAC) schemes are assessed separately from other farm income.  With regard to this income the first &euro;2,540 is disregarded, and then 50% of the balance and related expenses are disregarded - with the balance being assessed as means. <\/p>  <p>   It is estimated that the cost of changing the farm assist means testing rules in order that irrespective of the source of income the first &euro;3,000 would be disregarded and the balance would be means tested at 50% would be approximately &euro;13 million for a full year.  This estimate is based on the existing number of recipients and current rates. However, it is envisaged that there may be an increase of new farm assist claims if these measures were introduced.  Therefore, the estimated cost of &euro;13 million should be regarded as a minimum estimate.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2019 provides for a &euro;5 per week increase in the personal rate of payment for FA from &euro;198 to &euro;203 per week from 25 March 2019 with proportional increases for qualified adults and children.<\/p>  <p>  Any further changes to this scheme would have to be considered in a budgetary context and within the scope of the overall resources available for welfare improvements.<\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120500090#WRM02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Invalidity Pension Applications","counter":758,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120500090#WRM03100"},{"type":"question","counter":759,"qnumday":306,"qnumall":"[51190\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120500090#WRM03200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the status of an invalidity pension application by a person (details supplied).","asker":"1328","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":760,"content":"<p>The gentleman referred to has been awarded invalidity pension with effect from 19 July 2018.  <\/p><p>Payment will issue to his nominated bank account on 13 December 2018.
