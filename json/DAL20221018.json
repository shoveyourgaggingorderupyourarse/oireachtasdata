With great courage and dignity, Graham King told how he and his family live in a tent.  They have nowhere else to go.  His wife, Patricia, and his two children, Grayson and Priya, stay in the tent.  He stays in the car.  They live day to day.  Graham said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI&rsquo;m on disability and half carer's.  My wife works.  We have to run a car and feed kids.  The expenses add up. <\/blockquote>  <p>Speaking about the conditions in the tent and how his children are coping, he said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIt was a game at first.  It&rsquo;s not so much anymore.  The last couple of nights haven&rsquo;t been good.  Wind, rain - that type of weather has already destroyed one tent.  This one is holding up, but I don&rsquo;t know how long it will last.  I haven't got much sleep because I still have to be looking after the tent when the rest of them are sleeping in it. <\/blockquote> <p>About his children, he said, \"[The children] know they're homeless but they don't know the meaning of what that entails\" and that they cope by occupying themselves.  There are playgrounds nearby and a walkway, and they feed the ducks,<\/p> <p> For more than a decade, Governments have been telling people that they will fix housing, yet here we are with a father on national television telling his family's story of living in a tent in Ireland in 2022.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, had no answers for Graham.  He and his family are still in that tent today.  It is day 53 for them.  Incredibly, the family have been told that they earn too much to qualify for State housing support.  I have no doubt that viewers last night were looking on with a sense of, \"There but for the grace of God go I\", a feeling that this could happen to anyone, especially in light of extortionate rents, record levels of homelessness and a maxed out emergency accommodation system.  Last Wednesday, in Dublin 7 in my constituency, for example, all emergency shelters bar one were full.<\/p> <p> When a working family, a family trying to do everything right, ends up living in a tent, it is surely a sign that the system is broken beyond recognition.  For months, Sinn F&eacute;in and others have been calling on the Government to introduce a winter eviction ban to halt the flow of people into homelessness.  I welcome the fact that it seems the Government has finally listened and will proceed with a ban.  It is a first step.  This measure must coincide with an accelerated delivery of affordable homes, tackling crisis rents, increasing income thresholds for social housing and an urgent plan to bring vacant homes into use.  In the here and now, though, we must ensure that the eviction ban is done right.

Caithfidh an Rialtas &eacute; a fh&aacute;il i gceart gan aon mhoill.  There are concerns that the eviction ban may not be introduced until December.  That would be far too late.  Such a delay would result in hundreds more adults and children being forced into homelessness but if we work together, we can pass the right legislation very quickly to prevent this from happening.  Will the Government do that?  Will it ensure that the winter ban on evictions is implemented without any further delay?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800003#A00200","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666098300,"counter":8,"content":"<p>First, I have said repeatedly in this House - and I stand by my statement - that, in my view, housing is the single most important social issue facing our country at this moment in time and access to housing is fundamental to our security, our stability, our health and our progress as a nation.  I do not know the individual circumstances in relation to Graham King and his family.  I do not know the full background of the housing that they might have had prior to this, but it is not acceptable that a family would be living in a tent.<\/p>  <p>  Equally, though, we need sustained action on housing.  The Housing for All plan is the only substantive plan I have seen over the past 12 months - it is only a year old - that deals across the board with a whole range of issues to do with housing.  That has been backed up by significant legislation passed in this House, which at times the Deputy's party opposed in vociferously arguing against the retention of the help-to-buy scheme, the first home scheme or affordable housing.  Eventually, when it came to the vote, Sinn F&eacute;in voted some of that through.<\/p>  <p>  I see no alternatives to the key measures we are taking on social homes.  We will have a record number this year in terms of social houses compared with recent times.  The key issue for us will be to deliver more houses than the approximately 25,000 that will be delivered this year, which is on target with what we have identified.  The Government has been in office for just over two years, we have had two lockdowns as a result of Covid and we have had an exponential increase in building costs, the cost of materials and so on because of the war in Ukraine and the bounceback.  Nonetheless, we still have a situation where we have the highest housing delivery now since 2008, the highest commencements on record, the highest planning permissions since 2007, the highest number of first-time buyers since 2007 and the highest number of home buyers since 2008.<\/p> <p>However, that is not enough.  We are having an impact, but we need to build more than those 25,000 houses.  We need to get to 35,000 houses being built, and this means creating the pipeline that can sustain this right through the next number of years.  This is something the Government is very focused on.  This year, in respect of social houses, builds and so on, between approved social housing bodies and local authorities, we will have thousands of new social homes built.  This is the reality.  It will be much higher than previous years because a lot work has gone into this in previous years, which has led us to the stage where we are now building far more social houses for a long, long time.  This will have an impact, but it does take time.  The Housing for All policy is more than a year old.<br\/><br\/>To make one final point in this regard, the Deputy mentioned her own constituency.  For her own reasons, she has decided to oppose a proposal in Clonliffe.  I think more than 1,000 homes were to be provided in the context of that planning application.  The Deputy may have a good reason.  I acknowledge that everybody can find good reason.  Equally, however, if we are all possessed with the urgency of this issue today, and the crisis in housing, do we really have the luxury of opposing projects of this kind?.  The Housing for All strategy refers to 33,000 houses, but I think we have to get to 35,000 homes being built annually.  Collectively, we must get to 35,000 houses being built per annum and I would just query that.<br\/><br\/>On the eviction decision, if we can get this legislation through the House, it can take effect from the beginning of November.  Again, we are <i>in extremis<\/i>concerning the situation with the war in Ukraine.  More than 50,000 Ukrainians have now come into the country, and far more will access the international protection accommodation service, IPAS.  We also have the emergency housing situation.  We are, therefore, in unprecedented circumstances.  In that context, the Government's decision this morning on the eviction ban is positive and necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800004#B00200","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666098600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>There is no disputing that the housing crisis is the single biggest social crisis we face.

It represents a real change since Thursday when I questioned the T&aacute;naiste on it then.  His response was rather lukewarm on the prospect of a temporary eviction ban.  We welcome it but we have to remember that for nearly 11,000 individuals and 3,220 children who are homeless and without a secure home that ban will come too late.  These figures will only continue to grow after the eviction ban has concluded unless the core problem of a lack of social and affordable homes is addressed because all of us know of so many families who are terrified of being evicted, who are in fear of being evicted or who have just been evicted.<\/p><p>All morning we heard loud and clear the voice of property owners objecting to this ban but we have not directly heard the voices of those affected.  One man from my constituency contacted me and he tells me that he is in fear of imminent eviction, he has already been given a notice to quit in the spring and even with a substantial income available to him, he cannot locate an alternative property.  He said that one rental property had 700 applications and another had more than 500.  He said that any type of extension to his eviction would be welcome as he needs time to locate a new place to live for his family of three.  For individuals in that circumstance, including people who are working and people whose incomes may have been sufficient years ago to afford a reasonable rent, a supply of homes is no longer available.  There is clearly a serious housing shortage for those on lower incomes and the winter eviction ban, while welcome, does not address that issue.<\/p><p>As my colleague, our housing spokesperson, Senator Moynihan, said, there are three key measures we are calling on Government to implement to address the issues that will continue to arise for those families in fear of homelessness in the spring, after the ban has been lifted.  First, we are asking Government to rapidly expand the tenant <i>in situ<\/i>scheme.  I am glad that so many houses have been or are in the process of being bought by local authorities; I think the Taoiseach mentioned a figure in excess of 600.  However, we need to see a consistent approach across local authorities and to see the five or six months the eviction ban is in place used to ensure that local authorities will map out housing need and identify those households at risk of homelessness.  Then the Government should provide councils with the necessary resources to cut through the red tape surrounding the tenant <i>in situ <\/i>scheme and ensure we can return houses, many of which were originally council houses, to social housing stock and provide more sustainable futures for those renting.  Second, the Government needs to invest in building more social homes and to ensure targets are met for that.  Third, the Government needs to take on the Residential Tenancies (Tenants' Rights) Bill 2021 Bill that Labour introduced a year ago but which has still has not been progressed and which would have, if adopted by Government, provided much greater security for renters across the country.  In my constituency there are twice as many households as the national average in rental accommodation.  Many people are relying on the mercy of landlords and they need to have a more stable and secure future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800006#D00100","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1666099200,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue, which is more specific to the issue of the winter eviction ban.

Importantly, the Bill applies to licences and tenancies in student-specific accommodation and to student tenancies in the general rental market.  The Bill is required, as I said earlier, due to the ongoing acute supply constraints in the residential rental sector and the increase in homelessness presentations over the winter.  We want to reduce the burden on homelessness services and the pressure on tenants and the residential tenancy market generally.  The Bill is also designed to mitigate moral hazard insofar as the protection will not extend to a tenant who simply chooses not to pay his or her rent or to breach other tenant obligations.<\/p>  <p>  We brought in a similar ban during Covid so it is not the first time we have done this.  There is a context for it, which there has to be, and we are in the middle of a serious energy crisis with an exponential increase in pricing.  There has also been a huge migration flow because of conflict in the world, particularly the war in Ukraine.<\/p> <p>All of this is creating pressures on residential accommodation more generally and on the availability of emergency accommodation that the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage can rely on to house people who suddenly become homeless for a variety of reasons.  That is the context for the intervention.  There has to be balance to it.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Bacik referenced the <i>in situ<\/i>scheme the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, introduced last July, where essentially he said to local authority managers they were free to buy houses if somebody is being evicted because a property is being sold.  As I said, close to 650 properties have been purchased or are in the process of being purchased by local authorities as a result of that.  That tenants <i>in situ<\/i>are at risk of being evicted is a significant issue in itself.  I take the Deputy's point.  We are open to ensuring we can intervene to prevent evictions of this kind.  It is a new departure in respect of local authority discretion.  We are urging local authorities to do this.  Deputy Bacik has called for greater consistency.  The Minister is working on this in his communication.<br\/><br\/>The Minister has met representatives from the homelessness sector, the NGO sector, the Irish Property Owners Association, the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers, the Residential Tenancies Board and the Dublin Region Homeless Executive to get a proper sense of the situation from their perspective and how they see this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800006#D00400","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666099800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>It is welcome to hear more detail of the proposed Bill.

The problems are the red tape, the inconsistency and the fact that last year the State spent &euro;893 million on subsidies to private landlords, such as the HAP.  This is money that could have been better spent by being invested in returning housing to social housing stock.  Many of the homes that were previously council homes went into private ownership and are now in the private rental sector.  We need to see these homes being brought back into social housing.  We could strengthen the tenant <i>in situ<\/i>scheme by, for example, requiring that if landlords want to evict a tenant in order to sell they must notify the local authority first and give it a right to purchase.  This is the type of provision that would make the tenant <i>in situ <\/i>scheme much more meaningful and effective in protecting families from homelessness and ensure we have a more sustainable housing system in future for those on low incomes and those in the squeezed middle who can no longer afford spiralling rents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800007#E00200","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1666099800,"counter":24,"content":"<p>The HAP scheme and the RAS have been there for a long time.

Some national media outlets are reporting the project is now dead in the water.  I note the matter is still before the courts and a judge has to make a determination.  It is important that we respect the judicial process.  The reason I raise this in the D&aacute;il is to ask why it takes so long for a project of this magnitude to go through the planning process.  As I stated previously, I was elected to Galway County Council in June 1999.  The first project before us at the time was to provide a Galway city outer bypass, as it was called then.<\/p> <p>A total of &euro;14.7 million was spent on the initial Galway city outer bypass plan before the project was abandoned after a European court ruling in 2013.  Two years after that, Arup was appointed to come up with a new proposal, which was called the N6 Galway city ring road.  The outlay to date on the current Galway city ring road project is more than &euro;21.3 million.  This means more than &euro;35 million has been spent so far on finding a solution that seems no closer now than it ever was.  Technically, we are back to square one after 23 years.<\/p> <p> The Taoiseach was in Galway last Friday for a number of engagements and he heard about the importance of the road for inward investment.  I was at one such function where this was mentioned.  The Taoiseach saw at first hand the chronic traffic the people of Galway city and county deal with on a daily basis.  Why does it take so long for these major infrastructural projects to get through the planning process?<\/p> <p> An Bord Plean&aacute;la has serious questions to answer about why, as it publicly stated, it did not consider the new climate action plan that was passed before this decision was made.  The people of Galway will now have to endure chronic traffic congestion for many years to come while we try to find a solution to the traffic situation in Galway.  After 23 years and with &euro;35 million spent, what comfort can the Taoiseach give to the people of Galway that this never-ending saga will be brought to an end?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800007#E01200","speaker":"1576","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666100400,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I understand the genuine disappointment with the latest developments in this project.  I was in Galway on Friday and all the engagements regarding the economic development of Galway, including the expansion of Genesys, the expansion of the Galway Technology Centre and the launch of the Irish clinical academic training programme, were very positive.  Many people see the N6 Galway city ring road as being essential for the growth and development of Galway, while others disagree.  However, with the current number of vehicles on the existing network, Galway is suffering extreme congestion in the city centre and increased journey times, as I have experienced myself.  The ring road has the potential to reroute traffic from the city and alleviate capacity constraints.  Galway city and county councils issued a joint statement with Transport Infrastructure Ireland on Friday in which they indicated that they are confident the issues can be resolved and, as a result, they intend to continue to progress to the delivery of the road project.<\/p>  <p>  The Galway city ring road is a proposed project to construct an orbital route around Galway from the N6 to the west of Barna, including a new bridge crossing over the River Corrib.  The project is a component of the Galway transport strategy.  The scheme was submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and was approved by the board with conditions on 6 December 2021.  Subsequently, three applications for judicial reviews were submitted to the High Court, which imposed a stay on progressing the scheme.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la has taken the decision not to oppose the judicial review taken by Friends of the Irish Environment against the decision to grant planning permission for the Galway city ring road.  The decision on whether to grant an order to quash the 6 December 2021 decision of the board lies with the High Court.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la has stated it took this decision on the grounds that it did not consider the Government's 2021 climate action plan before deciding to grant permission.  The next step will be for all parties to consider their positions in light of this development.  There will then be an opportunity to request that the High Court remit the scheme back to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Should the scheme be remitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the board will consider whether further information is required to aid its deliberations.<\/p>  <p>  The review of planning legislation is progressing in line with the timeline set out by the Office of the Attorney General, which is leading on the project, and there is extensive engagement with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on it.  The work of the review is now moving to the drafting stage.  A Bill is expected to be brought to the Government and published by the end of the year.  It would be premature to comment on any potential outcomes of the review until it is complete, but one of its key aims will be to put plan-making at the centre of the planning system.  It will also focus on bringing increased clarity and streamlining to planning legislation and improving the functioning of the planning system for both practitioners and the general public, given that it is 20 years since its enactment.  Public participation, which is a hallmark of the current planning system, will remain a central component of the planning system in the updated legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800008#F00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1666101000,"counter":36,"content":"<p>When the plan for the N6 Galway ring road was first published in 2016, it was proposed that 54 houses be demolished or bought out to facilitate the project if it got the go-ahead.

I want the Taoiseach to reflect on that for a minute.  A group of individuals and families whose homes were crumbling were forced to join together in order to raise awareness about this devastating and extremely dangerous situation, after being ignored and essentially abandoned by the Government.  The last eight years have brought nothing but stress and heartbreak to this group.  After its pleas fell on deaf ears, it became expert on mica and defective blocks.  It gathered its own evidence and carried out testing.<\/p><p>I cannot understand why the Government continues to ignore the Mica Action Group and homeowners of defective properties in Donegal and across the country.  We were told this time last year by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, that we would see a scheme before Christmas 2021.  He waited almost an entire term to then rush legislation through at the last minute before the summer break and allow for very little scrutiny.  We were told by the Minister that he would not engage in pre-legislative scrutiny for the revised scheme as the priority was to rebuild effective houses urgently.  However, we are now coming to the end of October and the scheme is still not in place.  I am not sure if we will see it before Christmas this year.<\/p><p>The Mica Action Group released another letter to the Minister yesterday, which I would like to bring to the attention of the House.  It is very important we all know what is really going on on the ground in Donegal.  Part of the letter reads:<\/p> <blockquote> \tHomeowners are becoming collateral damage.  Their exposure to physical and psychological hazards is being unnecessarily prolonged due to the intransigent, unempathetic and lackadaisical way in which all aspects of the current revised scheme are being handled.  The contrast between government rhetoric and the reality experienced ... in Donegal could not be starker. <\/blockquote>  <p>The Government can come into the Chamber and talk all it likes about how its priority is to rebuild houses, but the reality is that since the launch of the scheme two years ago, only 14 houses have been rebuilt.  It is very clear that the Government's priorities do not lie with affected homeowners.  Not only that, it is clear that the Government is actually trying to shift the blame away from it and light-touch regulation and onto homeowners.  This is shown through the recent concrete levy, for which it has blamed homeowners in a pathetic attempt to divide the public and isolate affected homeowners who had no control over what happened to them.<\/p><p>The truth is that the Government would rather have members of the public turn against each other before admitting it was Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il policies that have created the mica crisis and the current housing crisis.<\/p> <p>We are already paying for defective blocks.  If the Government wants to put a levy on the concrete industry, why not tax the profits the industry makes?  That would at least make it look as though the Government wants to attempt to make the people who are responsible for this crisis pay for it.

This is a new scheme that was introduced, as the Deputy has just said, via legislation in this House.  It is a new scheme because homeowners and representative groups did not believe the previous scheme, which was welcomed by the Deputies in the House at the time, went far enough.  We met residents and representative groups and dramatically improved the scheme with regard to issues around giving financial assistance for all of the pre-costs such as engineering costs and dealing with the rental issue.<\/p>  <p>  I met the representative body well over a year ago and we dealt with all of those issues and that should be acknowledged.  There is no point in creating this sort of narrative that the Government is out to get people or undermine them.  The Deputy used a terrible phrase when he said the Government was blaming homeowners for the levy.  That is a shocking thing to say because it is not what Government is doing.  The Deputy should know that because the Government has, at this stage, signed off on approximately &euro;2.8 billion for the mica scheme.  It has been signed off and provided for now in the finances.  That is not rhetoric.  It is financial provision.<\/p>  <p>  The issue is delivery and getting the houses that need urgent remediation or demolition and reconstruction done.  The regulations and guidance documents are being worked on by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in consultation with the relevant stakeholders, because people want to be involved all along the way in how this scheme will be shaped, designed and progressed.  It cannot be a case of the Department issuing edicts on this and we have further responses that delay it even further.  The ambition is to roll out the new scheme before the end of this year or, at worst, in early 2023.<\/p>  <p>  I continue to put pressure on to see whether we can get this done as quickly as we can while involving all stakeholders because, as far as I am concerned, the houses that are most damaged should be done very quickly.  We will get a sense of timelines over the next years.  Much depends on the acuity of the situation.  Some houses are in a very bad way.  We want those houses replaced.  There is nothing I and the entire Government want to see more than houses being demolished and built, where that is required.  I understand there are approximately 300 in that bracket at the moment, with a further 300 coming on-stream.  It is doable.<\/p>  <p>  The concrete levy was basically that the Government had decided on expenditure of approximately between &euro;4.5 billion and potentially &euro;6 billion into the future involving pyrite, mica and apartment defects, just like the insurance levy of yesteryear when issues arose with the insurance industry.  The mechanism has been used before but it also shows that we have revenue streams to match very significant Government expenditure.  That is the only agenda there which, in the light of what is going on globally with the volatility of markets and all that, has a ring of credibility to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800010#H00400","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1666101600,"counter":45,"content":"<p>The levy the Government is proposing means that people will have to pay twice because they will be paying through general taxation for the renewal of this scheme and the levy will be imposed on people who want to build and need to provide houses for themselves.

Dr. Bambrick from ICTU also noted that the increases in the minimum wage have not kept pace with wage growth in the wider economy in the last two decades.

The T&aacute;naiste has published the details of that and has given a timeline for us to achieve a living wage by 2025.  It is a good initiative and it represents substantial and significant progress on where we were.  It is reasonable and balanced and it is subject to review over the coming years on an ongoing basis.<\/p>  <p>  On Deputy Bacik's point, I will speak to the Minister about where that legislation is.

I will talk to the Minister on the issue of tariffs.  I do not have the details so I ask the Deputy to submit them to us.

Where someone is fully employed, is a citizen of the State, may have been in a position for two or three years to leave direct provision but has chosen not to do so and is on a good salary, as with anyone in social housing or any rental situation, some contribution should be made.  It does not have to be a market rent and no one is suggesting that but making a contribution, given the enormity of the challenges the State is facing, is not unreasonable.<\/p> <p>Those proposals have not yet come before the Government.  There will be further meetings in respect of all of these issues so that we have equity across the board in the treatment of people in different contexts and different situations.  Any contribution would have to take into account the conditions that people are living in.  There are now substantial numbers of people who have been in a position to leave direct provision for quite some time but have chosen not to do so.

Aont&uacute; welcomes that the Taoiseach, during previous questions, said he would be supportive of reform of the institutions sometime in the future.

Section 24(1) of the National Tourism Development Authority Act 2003 gives me, as Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the power to advance moneys provided by the Oireachtas to F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Section 24(2) sets out the amount of money that can be advanced by the Minister to F&aacute;ilte Ireland for capital expenditure.  Assuming that the allocated funding in 2022 is drawn down by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the current limit of &euro;300 million will be reached close to the end of 2022.  No further voted capital funding can then be advanced to F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Accordingly, I put the Bill before the D&aacute;il to provide for the new spending limit of &euro;500 million.<\/p><p>Before speaking on the further details of the Bill, I would like to outline the significant contribution and importance of the tourism sector to Ireland's overall economic performance and the progress made in recent times.  As the House will be aware, this country has been extremely successful in turning the warmth of the Irish welcome and the beauty of the Irish countryside into a success story that we can all celebrate and be proud of.  Tourism is Ireland's most important indigenous labour-intensive sector, generating substantial export earnings and tax revenues.  It is woven into the fabric of Irish cultural and social life and is of critical importance to regional economies, in particular.  <\/p><p>The contribution of tourism is not confined to directly generated employment, economic activity and exports.  The sector has an important multiplier effect on other employment sectors, such as agriculture, transport, retail, food and beverage, which are particularly important to regional economies.  Apart from its economic value, tourism also plays an important role in promoting Ireland's image abroad, generating a positive impression of Irish people and our landscape and culture for our visitors.<\/p><p>The Covid-19 pandemic had a devastating impact on the tourism industry.  As we rebuild this vital sector, we must build it back in a way that ensures the contribution of the tourism sector to our economic recovery and provides sustainable employment across Ireland in a way that protects our unique environment.  Internationally, tourism continues to recover steadily, yet several challenges remain, from geopolitical to economic.  The combination of increasing interest rates in all major economies, rising energy and food prices and the growing prospects of a global recession are major threats to the recovery of international tourism for the remainder of 2022 and 2023.<\/p><p>Budget 2023 has secured continued additional funding of &euro;15 million for overseas marketing of Ireland as a leading holiday destination and the development of the invitation project.  Domestically, continued additional funding of &euro;15 million will deliver a range of measures to support the sector.  The Government also announced a temporary business energy support scheme which will support businesses, including those in the tourism sector.  In budget 2022, the tourism budget included a large capital allocation of &euro;35 million to F&aacute;ilte Ireland for tourism product development.  This level of capital investment will continue in 2023 as budget 2023 has also provided for funding of &euro;36.5 billion.<\/p><p>Ireland's commitment to pursue a climate-neutral economy will help us to realise our ambition to be among the world leaders in sustainable tourism.  My Department has initiated the development of a new national tourism policy that will seek to mainstream sustainability.  The development of this new policy will involve extensive consultation with the tourism industry and our communities to set out a path for the coming years which will support a sustainable recovery in the sector.  This new tourism policy will seek to support sustainable development in communities throughout the country, while protecting our environment and natural resources and with a greater spread of demand across the year.<\/p><p>As a significant proportion of tourists are drawn to attractions and participative experiences that bring local culture and heritage to life, F&aacute;ilte Ireland offers a range of support to help tourism providers across the country to maximise their individual and collective offering in a way that attracts and engages tourists and enhances their overall experience.  Accordingly, F&aacute;ilte Ireland's capital investment in tourism product development is further enhanced by complimentary programme supports, including for festivals and events, business supports and training, and marketing and promotions aimed at enhancing, animating and promoting the overall tourism offering.  Ultimately, in addition to enhancing the overall visitor experience for the benefit of visitors, the intention is to optimise key assets for the benefit of tourism and sustainable development through increasing the geographic spread of visitors, promoting season extension and supporting sustainable growth management.<\/p><p>With specific regard to tourism capital investment, I look forward to the development and enhancement of tourist attractions and activity-based tourism to provide the type and quality of experience that visitors are seeking.  Some examples of these are the C&eacute;ide Fields, an immersive experience in County Mayo, the National Famine Museum at Strokestown Park, which I recently opened, and the visitor experience at Knowth, part of Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne in County Meath.<\/p><p>A highlight this year has been the redevelopment of Avondale House and Forest Park.  This &euro;16 million project, in partnership with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Coillte and EAK, has transformed Avondale into a unique family attraction and a key new destination in Ireland's Ancient East.  It opened this summer and will be a vibrant destination for domestic and international tourists.  Avondale Forest Park is also open to visitors to explore and enjoy the established walking and cycling trails, orienteering courses and recreation area.  Beyond the Trees Avondale won the tourism and hospitality project of the year award at the Irish Building and Design Awards last week.  <\/p><p>In addition, part of F&aacute;ilte Ireland's capital funding programme comprises a large grants scheme, now under the Platforms for Growth investment programme, which targets project categories that have the greatest potential to enhance tourism across Ireland throughout the year.  The first Platform for Growth launched in May 2019 and focused on developing immersive heritage and cultural attractions.  These are attractions that appeal to overseas visitors looking for experiences that help them to connect with Ireland and bring the country's culture, heritage and people to life.  Through this platform, F&aacute;ilte Ireland is investing in heritage and cultural attractions of scale that will motivate visitors to travel, either to and-or within Ireland, but without displacing the existing attractions of a destination or disturbing the competitiveness already in mature destinations.  The overall objective is to deliver brilliant experiences that allow visitors to connect with Ireland and bring the national and local culture, heritage and people to life, while also delivering greater regional and seasonal spread of tourism.<\/p><p>In April of last year, &euro;19 million worth of investment was announced for the second platform, Platforms for Growth 2, to be used to develop world-class facility centres at 22 locations across the country where water-based activities are a key visitor attraction.  This includes locations such as Tipperary, Sligo and Leitrim, to name but a few.  These facilities, designed to serve as a hub in each locality from which multiple watersports operators can base themselves, will provide hot showers, changing and toilet facilities, secure storage, induction spaces, equipment wash-down and orientation points. They will be fully wheelchair accessible and built using sustainability best practice, such as solar heating panels.  This investment scheme was developed in partnership between F&aacute;ilte Ireland and local authorities and will support the local economy.<\/p><p>In addition to funding provided under the Platforms for Growth approach to large grants schemes, F&aacute;ilte Ireland also provides further capital supports to tourism attractions and experiences in Ireland through other channels, including small grants schemes, strategic partnerships with other State bodies and some direct investments.  The strategic partnerships include entities such as Waterways Ireland, the Office of Public Works and the Department of Rural and Community Development.<\/p><p>We are all conscious of the importance of tourism across all regions of the country.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland develops, supports and promotes tourism at regional and county level, in line with the relevant tourism experience brand, which provides the overarching context for related marketing and enterprise supports and tourism product development.  At a regional level, to guide medium to longer term development, F&aacute;ilte Ireland will deliver four new regional tourism strategies in 2022.<\/p> <p>The regional strategies are currently undergoing a public consultation and they will set out a ten-year vision and five-year action plan for each region.<\/p> <p> At a more local level, these four regional tourism strategies will be activated through a series of co-ordinated local destination and experience development plans, DEDPs, developed by F&aacute;ilte Ireland in collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders including local authorities, local development companies, relevant State agencies and local community groups and tourism industry representatives.<\/p> <p> F&aacute;ilte Ireland plans to have a total of 27 DEDPs live by the end of this year.  By 2025, every part of the country will have a destination development plan that is appropriate to its level of tourism maturity.  There are four regional tourism experience brands in total covering the entire country and these are as follows: the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East, Dublin and Ireland's Hidden Heartlands.<\/p> <p> One of the guiding principles of my Department is to deliver high-quality tourism experiences that exceed our visitors' expectations but in a manner that minimises any negative environmental or community impacts.  As custodians of our natural landscape, waterways and oceans and of our historic and cultural assets, we will protect them for the next generation.  I look forward to these future generations enjoying all that Ireland has to offer.  The Government is committed to continuing to support and strengthen the tourism sector which plays such a vital role in our locality and wider society.<\/p> <p> I will now deal with the purpose of the Bill in detail.  The National Tourism Development Authority Act was passed in 2003 to dissolve Bord F&aacute;ilte &Eacute;ireann and the Council for Education, Recruitment and Training, CERT, and establish the national tourism development authority, F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Section 24(1) of that Act gives the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the power to advance, out of money provided by the Oireachtas, such sums as the Minister may determine.  Section 24(2) limits the total amount of money that can be advanced by the Minister to F&aacute;ilte Ireland as capital expenditure on projects or enterprises.<\/p> <p> However, annual funding allocations are made in the normal way through the Estimates and budgetary process.  This limit on total capital funding was originally set at &euro;65 million but was later increased to &euro;150 million and then &euro;300 million under the National Tourism Development Authority (Amendment) Acts 2011 and 2016.<\/p> <p> Taking into account the 2022 capital allocation to F&aacute;ilte Ireland, investment in tourism capital projects is now approaching that limit.  Once the spending limit has been reached, no further voted capital moneys may be advanced to F&aacute;ilte Ireland for tourism capital investment projects.  Accordingly, it is now prudent to legislate for an increase in the limit.  I am introducing this Bill to make the necessary legislative change.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800023#V00900","speaker":"1471","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666110000,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I welcome the chance to speak to this Bill.

Sinn F&eacute;in will support the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is, of course, a very important organisation and is integral to our tourism industry.  Tourism is Ireland's biggest indigenous industry.  Hundreds of thousands of people are employed in tourism and it is especially important in parts of the country that have long been disadvantaged, such as along the west coast.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has played a central role in the development of tourism in Ireland and its work is to be commended.<\/p>  <p>  It would not be possible, however, to speak about tourism without referencing the pandemic and the resultant restrictions.  The years 2020, 2021 and early 2022 were among the most difficult years for the industry.

Some will have warehouse debt to deal with, difficulties with recruitment, as many workers left the sector during Covid, and sky-high energy bills.  It is important to recognise that this is a very wide-ranging industry and different sections will have different experiences.<\/p>  <p>  We all know that hotels, especially those in our cities, engaged in significant price gouging during the summer months of this year.  This has tarnished the entire industry, unfortunately, and it should be said that despite what various Ministers have said in the past about the VAT rate for the industry, it is possible under European law to apply different rates of tax on different sections of the tourism and hospitality sector.  We could have a situation where hotels have one rate of tax and other tourist attractions or restaurants have another.  We need to consider this seriously and I ask the Minister to look into it, given the ongoing price gouging and the damage that it has done not just to domestic tourism but to international tourism.  The reputation is out there now that if you come to Ireland and book a hotel you will come across rip-off rates and unexplainable and inexcusable costs.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue that needs to be addressed is pay and conditions for workers in the industry.  I sit on the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media and we have written a report on this matter which is due to be published soon.  We held hearings which exposed some absolutely outrageous behaviour by certain parts of the sector; hospitality workers being treated terribly, abused, overworked and poorly paid.  It is appalling and needs to be addressed.  There was lots of talk last year about the staffing crisis in the sector.  It should come as no mystery or surprise that retention is such a struggle in the industry when one sees how poor conditions are in some places.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister needs to get involved.  Any time I have tried to raise this with her, my questions are sent to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I understand that he has a role in workers rights but it is not fair that the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media can wash her hands of this issue in its entirety.  It is simply not fair that she will represent big industry lobby groups but not workers.  She needs to go out to bat for them too and I hope that she will consider taking responsibility for this in her own Department and will consider the report that the Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media has compiled.  Some very serious issues were raised in that report and unless action is taken, the situation will remain the same and the industry will suffer from constant staff recruitment and retention problems.  From a workers' rights perspective, I do not think I have come across an industry quite as bad, in places, as that reported by people before the committee.<\/p>  <p>  I will also raise some tourism issues that are important in my own constituency of Louth and east Meath.  From the latest figures I could find, Louth is one of the least-visited counties by domestic tourists in the State, ranking 22nd of 26 counties.  It was also ranked 16th of 26 counties for overseas visitors.  With the Gaelic, Norman and Viking history of the county, Louth should be ranked much higher and would be if it were properly promoted.  Drogheda is currently designated a F&aacute;ilte Ireland destination town.  However, there is no tourism officer or even a heritage officer for the Drogheda and south Louth area.  Putting this measure in place would put additional focus on Drogheda and would be very beneficial to the town.<\/p>  <p>  We have many day trippers visiting Drogheda.  I wish to see F&aacute;ilte Ireland putting together a package for Drogheda and its environs such as Monasterboice and Newgrange.  This would make it easier for tourists to come to visit Louth and stay in the area.  We need more than day trips to sustain tourism in the area.  The proposed Boyne-side trail has not started on the Mornington-Drogheda side while the excellent Carlingford greenway has received significant funding and is one of the premier greenways in the State.  The 17 km cycle way from the Maiden Tower at Mornington to Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne would be the only trail with a UNESCO site at the end of it - if and when it is completed.  The negative perception of Drogheda caused by the feud has not been addressed yet and an increased focus by F&aacute;ilte Ireland to highlight the positive elements, history and heritage of the town would go a long way to addressing this.<\/p>  <p>  With this Bill and the additional funding to be able to stretch to &euro;500 million, it is time for F&aacute;ilte Ireland, as I have raised with it, to focus on areas throughout the country that are less established or less well known to tourists.<\/p> <p>Let us consider the Wild Atlantic Way and the fantastic success that has been.  However, there are other regions that have not been established as tourism destinations.  This is primarily because there has not been proper focus or promotion of them.  These areas should be the ones to have the focus of F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  There should be time invested and they should be promoted.  The focus should be on them because they have just as much to offer to tourists both international and domestic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800024#W00200","speaker":"1497","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666110600,"counter":332,"content":"<p>I support this legislation and the increase in the total capital investment.  I would say that because if I did not, my former colleagues in F&aacute;ilte Ireland who are looking at me would probably be on the phone in a few minutes.<\/p><p>I had the pleasure of being part of the union team that negotiated the creation of F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  I ended up as a manager in the organisation, having previously been with Bord F&aacute;ilte.  I always joked when the negotiations to create Tourism Ireland were under way that we were the only country in the world that brought together two tourist boards, namely Bord F&aacute;ilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, and came out with three. <i>C'est la vie.  <\/i>It was all for the best in the end.  I acknowledge the great work these public servants do across Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland, especially the latter as it an organisation I have a great affection for.  When I was there we created the national tourism database and I registered and helped create <i>discoverireland.com <\/i>and <i>discoverireland.ie <\/i>with fantastic people.  There are too many of them to name and some are still there.  As the Minister will appreciate, I come to this with a bit of knowledge and background.  I support the Bill and the comments I will make will be based on my broad experience in tourism in general.  Then I will raise some specific items I would like her to look into.<\/p><p>Product development used to be under the direction of Paul Keeley.  It is an incredibly important area within the organisation.  It is the future of our tourism development.  There must be a plan for the products and services we are looking at developing.  I am delighted the Minister said that she is going to have four regional plans, that there is going to be a ten-year vision and that there are going to be five years of actions.  However, there is a bit of a joke between the people who have worked in tourism down through the years that when it comes to product development, the spine of Ireland is often forgotten about.  I will give the Minister a phrase she can steal: &quot;hole in the doughnut syndrome&quot;.  It is a good analogy if you think about it.  As a country we have developed our tourism product such that someone arrives in Dublin Airport, goes over to the west coast, comes all the way down, does the Wild Atlantic Way, comes across counties Cork and Kerry and then comes up the east coast again.  The spine of Ireland does not get its fair shake.  It is incredible that to this day we as a country still push almost everything through Dublin Airport.  That is going to continue.  I look forward to seeing the Minister's plans.  There is public consultation and I have told lots of people about that and promoted it because I take such a keen interest in this area.  I hope the plans will help address this situation.<\/p><p>There is great value, products and services in tourism in the spine of Ireland, which is the hole in that doughnut.  I always classify three &quot;A&quot;s and an &quot;E&quot;, namely, accommodation, attractions, activities and events.  The Minister can have that one too.  Add in travel and you have the whole lot.  If we look at some of the golf course offerings down the spine of Ireland compared with the perimeter, they are incredible value.  It is the same with accommodation, food, drink, heritage offerings and everything else.  There are some fantastic towns and attractions and an awful lot of ancient history.  It needs more promotion.  It needs targeted promotion from somebody who has a vision and I hope that someone is the Minister.  Many of the products in those areas are underdeveloped and are not linked in the way they are promoted because, in fairness to those who do the promotion overseas, if there is not enough scale, they are not going to do it.  We need to offer product ranges and service ranges in the spine of Ireland or the hole in that doughnut, that are of such a scale that Tourism Ireland will promote them overseas.  It amazes me, by the way, how many people do not know the difference between the organisations.  Tourism Ireland can only market what is put in front of it as the product development comes from F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  It will take a number of years.  We must put together the ranges to do with food, heritage, built heritage and sport.  There is a fantastic offering from F&aacute;ilte Ireland to promote horse racing and horse breeding in counties Tipperary and Kildare.  It is very specific and it is excellent.  A considerable number of people come to my county, and indeed to Kildare because I have talked to Senator Wall about this, because of that product.  It is very niche but that is what we are strong at, so let us promote it.<\/p><p>The success of the Wild Atlantic Way, which again Paul Keeley was involved with, as well as Ireland's Hidden Heartlands, which was the brainchild of Paddy Matthews, are examples of what can be done.  The Wild Atlantic Way is incredibly successful as a marketing tool.  It should be something we try to replicate as it is fantastic.  Of course, the issue for us politicians from other parts of the country, was it was so good we felt it was almost discriminatory against everywhere else.  Then we had Ireland's Hidden Heartlands, which is an excellent programme as well.<\/p><p>The Minister's opening remarks referenced the DEDPs that are going to be launched as a subsection of the regional plans.  They must be targeted and specific in how they are done because they will apply to local areas.  I will come back to that in a few minutes.<\/p><p>On capital spending, there must be cross-pollination with other Departments.  When I was at the Departments of Transport, and Environment, Community and Local Government I put huge effort into the promotion of greenways.  There is now such much activity going on with the greenways and cycling that it is a product in itself that can be marketed in a different way.  This will be especially so following the commencement of what will be the best greenway in western Europe in south Kerry, which can be built now the go-ahead has finally been given.  However, all of these products need to be pulled together and promoted in a different way.  This is particularly so in areas where tourism is not the main driver, unlike Kerry and similar parts of the country.<\/p><p>There also needs to be collaborative work with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The Minister should look specifically at accommodation provision because we are going have difficulties in the coming years with it, given what is happening in the world.  It is going to have an impact on the domestic market in the next tourism season, which is incredible.  There is not going to be enough accommodation and people are not going to be able to afford what is there because so much accommodation is going to be taken up for such a long period.  We all know that.  We need to look from a planning perspective at how we can accommodate, in cases, temporary accommodation.  I am thinking of pods, modular buildings and all of this sort of stuff across the country.  There is a product range out there that can be put in place quite quickly but the time it will take from a planning perspective means it is not practical.<\/p> <p>There are many places around the country where multiple small buildings would probably be more conducive having accommodation fit into the landscape and countryside than large buildings.  I know a number of people who have tried this but have not been able to due to planning issues.  I think, and would say that the Acting Chair, Deputy Carey, is in agreement with me, that if we could make a small amendment to the planning legislation to provide for this, it would be welcome, particularly in areas where tourism is not as strong or has not received the full necessary development.<\/p> <p> I raise with the Minister the strategy which I launched in 2014.  I know she is working through the four regions and the co-ordinated local destination and experience development plans, DEDPs - I will get that into my head eventually.  I am holding a copy of the strategy, which is about Ireland's hidden secret, Lough Derg.  It is one of the best places to visit.  It spans three counties and almost the city of Limerick.  It is in east Galway, east Clare and north Tipperary.  The biggest issue with access to the area was that it was virtually impossible to get through Ballina and Killaloe because of the traffic situation.  Thankfully, work has started on the bridge there, which means that will be dealt with in three years.  The issue for me is that this is a hidden secret.  When I talked about a hole in the doughnut, that was what I was trying to address.  This is the hole in the doughnut.<\/p> <p> People come to where I live in Garrykennedy, to Portroe, Dromineer and to Ballina.  They say that they never knew these places existed.  They had no idea.  How many people associate Lough Derg with Tipperary?  There are places such as Coolbaun, Puckane and Terryglass, which has been tidy town of the year on a number of occasions.  Many people never think of these places because Tipperary has not been promoted.  Garrykennedy is probably one of the greatest places on Earth.  It is my little hideaway.  Much excellent work was put into this.  Some &euro;2 million was spent.  In her speech, the Minister acknowledged the work on changing facilities, toilets, upgrades to marinas and on walkways.  It has been fantastic.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, was there last year to open a walkway which was built.  She could not get over the place.  It is so central.  This is as much for places such as Portumna, east Clare and Killaloe.<\/p> <p> That area is not promoted to the required level.  There was a budget of &euro;10 million and &euro;2 million was spent.  Joe McGrath is the chief executive officer of Tipperary County Council and was the chair of the working group.  He made the money go far on signage and everything else along the way go far.  Speaking as somebody who knows many people who work in this industry, including in F&aacute;ilte Ireland, they welcome the structures that have been put in place with regard to regionality and substructures, because it gives them a structure to work with.  Previously, it was a case of trying to ensure that everything was stretched out and things were not joined up because there were other considerations about how funding could be spent.  There are now four regional structures and the substructures.<\/p> <p> I would appreciate if the Minister would look at this as an example.  There is a comprehensive report on Lough Derg entitled Life at the Lake &ndash; A Roadmap for Experience Development and Destination Marketing 2014-2017.  I would appreciate if the Minister would look at that as a subset of Ireland's Hidden Heartlands, because there is a crossover between Ireland's Hidden Heartlands and the Wild Atlantic Way, which Clare is part of, though in reality, it is more a part of Ireland's Hidden Heartlands.  Much can be gained from this, including various activities and food and drink.  I ask the Minister to come to Ballina, Killaloe, Portumna, Garrykennedy or Terryglass to experience it.  I am sure the Minister knows many of those parts.  She can see the value that can be had there.  It is so central.  It is just off the motorway in the middle of Ireland, but it does not get the promotion that it deserves.<\/p> <p> There are many activities in the region.  There is a canoe trail, which is the first blueway based on canoes.  There is an ecopark based in Portumna.  There are multiple walking routes.  One passes by my home.  There is a trailhead and discovery point based at one of the best known scenes in Ireland, which is the lookout in my own village, Portroe.  It has a view of all the islands across the lake.  I put all this on the record because I believe, given the structures that the Minister has put in place, that now is an ideal opportunity for her to help it along.  I am not expecting miracles but there is a ten-year vision and a five-year plan of action, so I would appreciate if the Minister and her officials would consider that document again over the coming weeks while plans are being put in place.  As they are watching, I publicly ask my former colleagues in F&aacute;ilte Ireland to do the same, to look at it and to help it along the road, because I am sure they know its value.<\/p> <p> I wish the Minister well with this.  This is important legislation.  It is technical, but the more funding we can put into product development post-Covid to plan for the development of tourism in this country, the better.  I ask the Minister to discriminate positively on those areas that are the hole in the doughnut.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800025#X00200","speaker":"1610","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666111200,"counter":334,"content":"<p>I welcome this Bill, which is about increasing capital investment in our tourism sector from &euro;300 million to &euro;500 million.  This is on top of the investment this Government has made over the last three years to support the tourism sector to survive during the pandemic.  The last three years have not been good for the industry, even if we have achieved a significant recovery in recent months.  Maybe we can learn a few things from these difficult times.  The collapse of air travel in this period should allow us to drive growth in our regional airports, particularly Shannon Airport, and to drive growth in the regions.  We should never again allow one airport to dominate all of our airline traffic.  There is a clear need to amend national aviation policy to provide for growth in airports outside Dublin.  I am pleased that Shannon Airport has developed new routes to Europe, mainly operated by Ryanair.  It now has greater connectivity to the USA, including a new United Airlines route to Chicago, which was announced last week.<\/p>  <p>  We also saw the growth of domestic tourism in this period.  Irish people discovered beautiful places in Ireland that they never knew existed.  We should make strategic investments in growing this market.  Tourism is a vital industry for all of Ireland.  It benefits every part of the island and supports the employment of 10% of our working population.  Fine Gael has supported this industry over the last ten years in government.  This has been reflected in the increasing numbers employed in the sector and the visitors coming to our shores.  There is no doubt that the tourism market is changing.  We must adapt our strategy to reflect this.  I am proud that we are investing another &euro;200 million in the opening of new markets and creating new opportunities in this sector.  This is a result of good planning and research to secure further growth in our tourism sector.<\/p>  <p>  Investments into the Wild Atlantic Way and, as Deputy Kelly mentioned, Ireland's Hidden Heartlands, in areas like the Shannon Estuary Way and events like the Gathering, have caused a huge increase in the number of visitors coming to stay in Ireland.  I strongly support Deputy Kelly in asking for recognition of that Hidden Heartlands brand for Lough Derg and the implementation of the Lough Derg strategy.  It is vital for that region.  I strongly support Clare County Council's application to the rural regeneration and development fund regarding Holy Island.<\/p> <p>I look forward to that receiving funding in the coming weeks.  <\/p> <p> We also need to examine further schemes such as the Wild Atlantic Way to attract even more visitors to Ireland.  There are obvious areas such as outdoor pursuits and travelling along our greenways in which this Government is investing.  We should also invest in sports tourism to host international golf events, for example.  I met the Minister at Dromoland Castle at a wonderful golf event.  I am delighted to have worked closely with the director of golf at Dromoland Castle, Eamonn O&rsquo;Donnell in the early stages of this project.  I was approached by the then captain of the golf club in Dromoland, John Casey.  I worked with Mark Nolan, the then CEO of Sport Ireland, John Treacy and Mark Kennelly of Golf Ireland.  It was a fantastic event.  It shows what can be done.  I look forward to the event taking place there again next year.  We had a good, international winner, the Czech Republic star, Klara Spilkova.  Unfortunately, Leona Maguire came up short but, please God, she will make amends next year.  <\/p> <p> Another scheme that might bring rich rewards would be to encourage all those from other countries working in numerous multinational companies based in Ireland to reach out to their fellow employees, friends and relatives visit Ireland.  Something like that was done for The Gathering and the Minister might keep it in mind.  Along with these events the Government is also encouraging growth in the night-time economy.  I welcome the launch of the pilot basic income scheme for artists in this regard.  Many people have contacted me who were not included in the scheme.  Some 8,206 people applied and only 2,000 were accepted on the scheme.  I appeal to the Government to consider expanding that scheme.  <\/p> <p> Along with major attractions in County Clare such as the Cliffs of Moher, I wish to refer to the Shannon Heritage sites of Bunratty Castle and Folk Park, Craggaunowen Castle and Knappogue Castle.  The Minister will be aware that these sites are currently being transferred to Clare County Council.  An interdepartmental working group has been set up that includes officials from the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  The ask of the council is that &euro;15 million will be made available to the group over the coming three years at &euro;5 million a year for operational and capital investment.  I ask the Minister to become involved in that to ensure that happens.  There is unwelcome uncertainty around this because Bunratty, Craggaunowen and Knappogue castles are iconic tourist attractions.  They act as magnets to bring tourists into the county.  We need to nail down where they are going to sit.  Clare County Council put up its hand.  It will do a good job but it needs assistance.  It made a great job of the Cliffs of Moher.  I encourage the Minister to make sure that transfer happens at the earliest opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800026#Y00200","speaker":"1517","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666111800,"counter":336,"content":"<p>This is a short and technical Bill to provide a statutory basis for allowing the Minister and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to increase the funding that can be made to F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  A previous amendment, the National Tourism Development Authority (Amendment) Bill 2016, increased this amount to &euro;300 million.  This legislation will increase it further to &euro;500 million.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in will support this increased investment in tourism and its promotion.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s role is to support enterprises and projects relating to tourism development in the Twenty-Six Counties.  I commend the work of Into Kildare, Visit Offaly and Laois Tourism on the work they do in promoting the respective counties.  The midlands have so much to offer, from a barge trip on the canal in Monasterevin to a visit to Derryounce Lakes or a walk along Offaly Way.  Many small businesses, however, are struggling to recover from the havoc wrought on them by Covid-19 over the past two years.  We need to ensure these businesses get the help they need and deserve, particularly in the difficult winter season ahead.  Many of them are currently suffering because of the cost-of-living crisis and the energy crisis.<\/p>  <p>  There is also an ongoing issue of a lack of development in certain areas, in particular the midlands and Border regions.  This disparity needs to be addressed.  We expect great things when the Barrow Blueway is finished next year for towns such as Rathangan, Monasterevin and Athy.  That cannot come quickly enough because these towns are dying on their feet.  The dereliction that has been tolerated for the past 20 or 30 years needs to be addressed.  Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe is not good enough.  We must have a carrot-and-stick approach.  Levies on vacant and derelict sites must be followed up and collected.  The owners of buildings that have been left to rot need to be helped, encouraged and, if necessary, forced to bring these buildings back into use or they must sell them to somebody else who will.  Gone are the days of tolerating dereliction, which is a blight on our towns and increasingly so in rural areas.  We are currently crying out for homes in counties Kildare, Laois and Offaly and for local jobs and premises to accommodate these workplaces.  Sinn F&eacute;in in government will address this with a fair approach, more carrot than stick.  It is unconscionable in this day and age that we have 160,000 homes vacant in the State during a housing crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800027#Z00200","speaker":"1588"},{"type":"speech","time":1666111800,"counter":337,"content":"<p>This is a short but technical Bill but it is also important, and we intend to support it.  It gives us an opportunity to talk about all the aspects of tourism.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland recently launched a &euro;600,000 campaign stating, \"Winter in Dublin, it's magic\".  I do not disagree with that in the slightest.  I am an extraordinarily proud Dub but we have issues that may impact on the people who come here to visit.  I want to touch on them.<\/p>  <p>  The magic that F&aacute;ilte Ireland refers to will take the form of live music, events, family and festive occasions and it will focus on cultural traditions.  This is some of what is promised in a bid to encourage visitors to the city throughout the upcoming winter and holiday seasons.  Footfall in Dublin has always been important to the tourism industry but after two years of a global pandemic the need for this is more important than ever.  I am conscious that when I was on Dublin City Council footfall in the city was in decline because of some of the M50 shopping centres that were taking it from the city.  The global pandemic has meant that our other institutions around the city have felt a fall in numbers because people were taking themselves away from the city centre.  <\/p>  <p>  A study by the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation in 2021 stated the cost of Covid-19 to the tourism industry was estimated at a staggering &euro;13.4 billion with more than 100,000 jobs lost.  It is crucial in this bid to revitalise the tourism industry that we should simultaneously seek to expand and develop efforts across Dublin, lest we run the risk of turning the city into some sort of Disneyland -ype of spectacle where we only portray what Irishness is rather than capturing and digging into that culture, and being our best at it.<\/p>  <p>  We eagerly welcome tourists yet struggle to call Dublin a functional city.  What I mean is we have increased hotel prices, and I will talk about that shortly.  The average daily rate for a hotel bedroom in Dublin for April 2022 was &euro;154, which was up 16% on the same month in 2019.  Car rental prices in the city are extortionate.  There are delays, baggage issues and winding queues in Dublin Airport, all due to a lack of staff and resources and all presenting an image to tourists that is perhaps not a fair reflection of the city once they get here.  There are indicators that the most basic necessities when considering successive trips taken by incoming tourists are not functioning as they should.  Headway needs to be made to ensure this funding for the industry is allocated correctly.  Businesses need the support to provide the type of services and standards that tourists expect when they get here.<\/p>  <p>  Four concerns for businesses relate to rising energy costs, other operating costs, the cost of car hire and people lacking disposable income.  Ireland&rsquo;s artists who provide so much to the industry and are vital for the live events and music that F&aacute;ilte Ireland promises in its Winter in Dublin campaign need support.  The minimum basic income scheme will go a long way to do that but we must also remember that for many years how we project ourselves onto the world stage is always through our artists and culture.  Those are the same artists who have been screaming for many years to be respected.  The most basic form of that respect relates to the money they are paid.<\/p><p><i>5 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>Some 2,000 artists will receive the basic minimum income for artists.  We can go a little further than that once the pilot ends.<br\/><br\/>How can a city plagued with issues such as a housing crisis and increased levels of crime claim to provide 100,000 welcomes to those who visit?  I am conscious the image of O&rsquo;Connell Street, Dublin's main thoroughfare, portrayed on the &ldquo;RT&Eacute; Investigates&rdquo; programme tonight will be one of antisocial behaviour in the absence of garda&iacute;.  These are issues that need a multidepartmental approach and we need to get in touch with them.  If we are to invest &euro;500 million, as we should, in the next couple of years and &euro;600,000 for a winter campaign for Dublin, we need to take a multilateral approach.  These enhancements to our city cannot rely on magic to progress.  Funding and effort need to be directed to pushing Dublin forward in its development because in order to provide a welcoming and successful experience for holiday-goers, the experience of Dublin as a city needs to be strengthened.<br\/><br\/>One aspect of Dublin, on which the Minister established a task force, and one that has been talked about by young people in the city for the past decade is the night-time economy, as it is called.  However, it is not only an economy; it is a sense of place and how welcoming a city is both for tourists and residents alike.  A night-time economy and city is at its best when tourists and people who come into the city - either those who live there or those who visit - can feel intertwined.  We only need look at other European holiday destinations for young people to see that Ireland is lagging behind when it comes to its nightlife.  Countless students and young professionals are choosing to fly to Berlin, Amsterdam, London and Barcelona for weekends and holidays where they find a wide range of nightclubs, music venues and creative spaces that cater to their interests and needs.  It has reached the point where people refer to Dublin as a glorified town, devoid of the vibrancy that makes a city stand out as a cultural capital.  The knock-on effects of the limited options facing our young people in the evenings are causing monumental damage.  Along with the sky-high cost of living, many cite a lack of nightlife as a reason for emigrating, leaving us with staff shortages across the hospitality sector and less money spent in the venues that remain, leading to many of them closing.<br\/><br\/>The Covid-19 pandemic caused unimaginable harm to the night-time economy and we have had to say goodbye to countless venues and events that promoted Dublin as a top-class cultural destination.  Long before that, however, successive Governments were driving those spaces into the ground and the failure of local government to take a leadership role in them was also a cause of destinations and venues that people used to visit going out of business.  Late licensing costs have long crippled ambitions, businesses and projects that would have flourished if given the supports they required to grow.<br\/><br\/>As nightlife and arts activists, Give Us the Night, pointed out last month, Ireland has gone from having 328 nightclubs nationally to 85 today.  It is no wonder that our young people fly to cities that sustain an exciting roster of gigs and events of all genres, where they and their interests feel better represented.<br\/><br\/>If thousands of young people are leaving the country for a better quality and more varied lifestyle, why do we expect tourists to flock here?  It is not as if they come here for the weather.  Ireland&rsquo;s greatest strength has always been our culture and the warmth of our people.  However, after 11 p.m. on most weekdays, there is nowhere for tourists to get a taste of the Irish hospitality for which we are so famous.  I am sure we all have seen groups walk from venue to venue in Dublin on a Monday or Tuesday evening, unable to find anywhere that will take them in after 11 p.m.  That is unheard of in most European capitals.<br\/><br\/>Tourists and consumers alike are not the only ones who suffer from the Government&rsquo;s lack of support for the night-time economy.  Ireland&rsquo;s artists are leaving the country in droves due to a lack of spaces where they can perform their craft, whether they be musicians, comedians, actors or otherwise.  <br\/><br\/>On Culture Night, I went down to the old fruit market in Dublin to get a sense, and I think the Minister was there as well.  It was incredible to see young and older people engage in this large venue which lies derelict for most of the year.  Dublin City Council has been talking about reopening it at as a fruit market or some sort of venue since I was on the council six years ago.  It is telling us now it will be 2026 by the time any kind of event is taking place there.  That is a huge loss.<br\/><br\/>Young people are feeling better appreciated elsewhere.  Without our artists, we lose one of our greatest draws as a destination and our soul as a people.  Unaffordable aparthotels will not bring people to Dublin, yet they are starting to dominate our skyline.  These developments have received much greater support from this Government and local government than start-ups, which would attract tourists wanting to experience our unique culture.  During the pandemic, many of us asked when we will dance again.  We are still asking that question half the week as we walk home at 11 p.m., disappointed at what once could have been a great and memorable night.  Nobody wants to travel to Ireland for disappointments such as that.  <br\/><br\/>For the events that do take place, ticket costs price many people out of them.  Tickets for more and more concerts are costing well over &euro;100.  The Government must take action to improve accessibility and affordability.<br\/><br\/>Even on a Friday or Saturday where people might find a few options in Dublin in the early hours, they will be lucky to get a taxi home.  I have countless constituents who will not travel into the city centre, even just across the Liffey, because they know they will have to stand around and be unsafe due to an inability to access a taxi later at night.  That is part of where I see the absence of joined-up thinking.  Despite card payment facilities being made mandatory in taxis since the beginning of September, we all still witness fares being turned down by drivers if they consider the journey too short.<br\/><br\/>We need better lighting around the city and a more effective visible policing to make our journeys home safer and great affordable public transport options to make those nights out possible.  With the rise in energy costs, many businesses are saying they will now turn the lights off when they close up.  What strikes me most is that Dublin comes across as unsafe when the lights go out.  We need to ensure that businesses can be supported to keep them on.<br\/><br\/>The difficulties faced by these small businesses led to soulless multinationals buying out what are essential community spaces that showcase the best areas the country has to offer.  These native businesses need greater backing to survive the coming winter, which promises unthinkable difficulties.<br\/><br\/>We have yet to see many of the consequences of the Government&rsquo;s lack of support for the night-time economy in Dublin or for the arts in general.  Believe me, it is one of the many reasons our young people and artists continue to leave the country in search of a better, more vibrant existence.<br\/><br\/>Another issue that raises its head in the summer - it certainly that pops up with every seasonal event - is price gouging among hotels.  How many of us have gone onto <i>Booking.com<\/i>just to see the cost of hotels in Dublin during the summer months?  For example, in two weeks&rsquo; time, the Dublin Marathon will take place.  Many of the 20,000 people who take part will come into the city and try to find accommodation only to be priced out of it.  At various different points during the summer when any seasonal or important event is taking place, the price of hotel rooms in the city centre increase to between &euro;350 and &euro;500.  That is simply unacceptable.  When the Irish Hotels Federation was asked about this a number of times during the summer it pointed to supply and demand.  It pointed also to the Americanisation of hotels, which no longer show a price on the door but, rather, tell people that if they book long in advance, they will get some deals.  As hotel rooms are taken up, they become more expensive.  That is not acceptable and it also gives the impression to tourists who come here that it is only the wealthy who can afford this city.  This city is always at its best when people can get into the agora of Irish and Dublin society, can afford a hotel, go for a night out, have a drink or go to one of the cultural venues they see and believe they can afford to be here.  For too many, that is not the case.  There is no point to saying to people, &ldquo;Come to Dublin for the winter &ndash; it is magic&rdquo;, when many of the hotel rooms are already booked up and those that are not booked will price out tourists.  That is not even close to being acceptable.  The excuse has been made that some hotels are being given over to meet the needs of those who are suffering at the coal face of the housing crisis or fleeing from war.  They should not be scapegoated for rising hotel prices.  I welcome the investment into portraying Dublin on the world stage.  However, people who will come here for the winter need to know they will be able to afford to do so and that requires thinking across various Departments.  I thank the Minister and her Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800027#Z00300","speaker":"1560","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666112400,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and her officials for being here and the excellent work they are doing.  It means an awful lot to the people working in the industry, particularly in my constituency in County Kerry where the tourism and hospitality sector is so important to the wider economy.<\/p>  <p>  I will raise a couple of issues in the relatively brief time I have.  We could have only have dreamt of this amount of money a short few years ago.  I remember 11 or 12 years ago discussing legislation of this nature and the amount of funding involved was only a fraction of what we have today.  That is a good sign of where we are.  We need to keep reinvesting in the Irish tourism product, which is why this Bill is welcome.<\/p>  <p>  Experiences such as the Wild Atlantic Way, along which I live, and Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East and the Hidden Heartlands are very positive and have been a progressive feature of Irish tourism in recent years.  One of the challenges we have is the car rental market, which I flagged previously.  Many customers had a terrible experience in 2022 as a result of the price gouging that took place.<\/p> <p>There is a further challenge coming down the road in 2023, however.  Much of the stock that is there at the moment comprises cars with 191 or 192 registration plates, many of which will be facing the national car test, NCT, in the new year but simply will not be able to get an appointment for a test.  Hundreds, if not thousands, of 191 and 192 registered rental cars could be taken off the market early in the new year while awaiting an NCT appointment.  That needs to be addressed.<br\/><br\/>Another significant challenge relates to the costs associated with importing new or used cars.  In particular, I refer to UK imports and the vehicle registration tax, customs and VAT prices associated with their importation.  It simply makes them unviable and reduces the amount of stock available.  Many Deputies are trying to push the likes of the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East and the Hidden Heartlands but if people cannot rent cars when they come here, it makes it very difficult for them to access those areas.  Until we get to a point where it can be done more sustainably, car rental will be necessary for the vast majority of people visiting these experiences.<br\/><br\/>I encourage further progress in respect of the development of the Irish Sea way, a matter that I was keen to get onto the programme for Government, and the wild Atlantic walkway.  I regularly raise this issue and seek updates on it, and I thank the Minister for her replies.  I want to keep it on the agenda.  These are important proposals with significant untapped potential that will introduce new elements to Irish tourism in the years and decades ahead. <br\/><br\/>As regards greenways, it is critical that we keep building them, but also keep connecting them.  I had the pleasure of cycling the new Listowel-Limerick greenway last Monday morning.  It was not my typical Monday morning.  I took a couple of hours off to check it out with my former colleague, Jimmy Deenihan, and it was a marvellous experience.  I also did some of the Tralee-Fenit greenway with my children when it opened last Saturday.  Those greenways are beautiful and fantastic experiences that will definitely add to the county.  Greenways are being developed throughout the country.  We hope the south Kerry greenway will be started before the end of the year.  It is important that there is a connection between the greenways so that people can cycle along a network of them.  I welcome the announcements yesterday by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, but we need to keep pushing that and creating as many safe and segregated cycleways as possible, with plenty to see and do, as well as all the other things that we know are needed.<br\/><br\/>I wish to raise the issue of camper vans and the lack of infrastructure for them.  There is an opportunity here for local authorities.  People are coming here in camper vans and camping <i>ad hoc<\/i>.  A regulated and controlled system could turn into an opportunity for local authorities in terms of revenue-raising potential, but also in terms of protecting sensitive areas and ensuring there is a little bit of law and order in the context of how camper vans are dealt with in this country.  There is an economic benefit to be gained from the people who come.  Despite the fact that many people dismiss camper vans, there is an economic benefit to be gained from the people who travel here in them.  However, there needs to be a proper strategy for how to roll this out among local authorities.<br\/><br\/>I am a long-time advocate of retaining the 9% VAT rate.  That is the maximum the rate should be to allow us to compete with our European competitors.  I hope that between now and 28 February the right thing will be done in respect of the 2023 season.  I ask that the many not be punished for the sins of the few in the context of the price gouging that we have seen.  There is excellent value to be had in many places.  I ask that data be provided to the House in respect of accommodation and food services and the VAT breakdown in that regard.  One option that could be considered is the application of a 9% VAT to one of the services if it cannot be done for both.  If that could be done, it would at least be better than a complete reversal.  I feel strongly on that issue.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the extension of the debt warehousing scheme.  It is important for tourism operators, as are the energy support grants that were announced in the budget.  They are massively important as people go into winter, but they will be also be very helpful to businesses, which may otherwise have to close, as they prepare for spring.  We need to keep a close eye on that because 2023 will be a challenging year and it will be difficult for people to recover from what have been, in effect, three extremely challenging seasons.  There is only so much straw the camel's back can take before it finally breaks.  Many operators have been through three really difficult seasons and are finding it difficult to cope.I welcome the extension of those supports but we need to keep a close eye on them to ensure they are not withdrawn too early, before people have a proper chance to recover and to build for the future.  <br\/><br\/>In the few seconds I have remaining, I commend the work of F&aacute;ilte Ireland, but also the work of our colleagues in Tourism Ireland to get people into the country in the first place.  They do vital work, without which we would have far fewer tourists in the country.  Ireland has a relatively small economy and population, so that vital work, in conjunction with the work of F&aacute;ilte Ireland, is welcome.  I encourage every collaboration between those two agencies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800028#AA00200","speaker":"1581","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666113000,"counter":341,"content":"<p>It is good to see the increase in funding, and I welcome it.  Post Covid in particular, we need to rebuild the tourism sector.  I am sure many Deputies are aware of the torrential rain on Sunday night in Cork city and the flooding that affected areas such as Hollyhill, Blackpool, Ballyphehane, Glanmire and other areas across the city.  The flooding had a devastating impact on businesses and homes in the area.  It is really difficult to attract tourism to areas that do not have the shops and facilities to go with it.  Businesses lost floor stock and fittings.  The Government has announced a potential humanitarian fund but the last time such a fund was announced for Cork, it excluded businesses, some of which were in the tourism industry.  I ask the Minister to ensure that businesses affected by the flooding, including those in tourism, are able to access that humanitarian fund.<\/p>  <p>  Almost one in five people who travel to Ireland visits Cork.  Obviously it is a fabulous place, speaking as a Cork man.  It is an incredibly popular spot but it has much more potential.  I want to see more investment to deliver on the potential that we know Cork has.  I will speak briefly about Shandon, an area close to where I live.  Shandon is one of the most iconic areas of Cork and home to one of its most iconic buildings.  It is a hugely historic site, with referencing dating back to the 12th century.  There is not a part of Cork from which Shandon cannot be seen.  It is home to the wonderful Shandon Sweets, run by Tony Linehan, as well as O'Connell Square, which is a prime example of land in the public realm that is ripe for improvement.  There are the Butter Exchange, which dates back to 1770, the Shandon Bells and the church in which they are located, and Shandon cathedral.  The area is so impressive but it needs investment to develop it as a tourist destination.  Unfortunately, there are high levels of dereliction.  The area needs to undergo regeneration to make Shandon the iconic tourist destination that is needed in the heart of Cork.  There have been initiatives through the years, such as an artists' residence, for example, but they were only pilot projects.  We need a long-term project.  The National Tourism Development Authority, working with Cork City Council, could come into Shandon and make a real difference.  We want to see increased funding.  The Minister needs to consider whether it is time to start working to end the dereliction in Shandon that is a barrier to its potential as a centre for tourism.  My office is on Shandon Street.  It is an area that is steeped in history and tradition and has some brilliant people.  With investment, and in conjunction with Cork City Council, we can have a thriving community and really deliver for tourism in Cork.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800029#BB00200","speaker":"1453"},{"type":"speech","time":1666113000,"counter":342,"content":"<p>Our next slot is for Solidarity-People Before Profit.

So I can say with confidence, we were once the capital of this fair land.  Yet we lag behind other counties when it comes to spend.  Carlow is the least visited county in Ireland.  But we have such wealth in tourist attractions, from history, culture, adventure, water activities, castle hotels and luxurious accommodation, to golf and rural sports, the list is endless. <\/p> <p> Capital expenditure on our tourism offering enables the sector to attract a greater number of tourists, both from overseas and domestically.  Every 1,000 additional overseas tourists supports 20 jobs in the domestic tourism industry.<\/p> <p> The domestic visitor is critical to tourism business, especially regional businesses, as domestic consumers will travel all year round and to a much wider breadth of destinations than the typical overseas visitor.<\/p> <p> Recently, I supported my local credit union to undertake a charity walk in the beautiful Milford area of Carlow, an area rich with history, biodiversity and gorgeous scenery right by the river.  Carlow Tourism has a great campaign called Wander off the Track which shows off our beautiful area in Carlow.  One can walk, as I have often done, from Ballinabrannagh down to the great Tinnahinch, which is an area with beautiful scenery, but there needs to be more investment in this attraction.  We are promoting people towards healthy eating and living and we have such wonderful attractions in Carlow, but we need to support more of them.  I noticed myself that there are no toilets and the river track, even though it is beautiful, needs more work to be done on it.  I ask that it be developed.<\/p> <p> Carlow County Council has asked for support for the development of a water activity hub in Carlow Town Park for users of the River Barrow as an amenity and recreational hub for Carlow town and county together with the development of Oak Park into a high value tourist and amenity location with developed walking infrastructure.  They have plans for the connection of the Wicklow Way in Clonegal with the South Leinster Way in Kildavin.<\/p> <p> There are great plans that need our support to be realised for Carlow and there are great things happening with our tourist attractions.  The OPW team at Altamont Gardens in Ballon were recently awarded the prestigious green flag award for 2022&ndash;23, an international scheme that recognises and encourages the provision of good quality parks and green spaces that are managed in environmentally sustainable ways.  Good attractions deserve our support to promote them.<\/p> <p> F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s capital allocation for 2022 is &euro;36.5 million.  To drawdown the full 2022 capital allocation, F&aacute;ilte Ireland would exceed the current threshold by &euro;2.7 million and therefore no allocation can be made to F&aacute;ilte Ireland in 2023 unless the proposed legislation to increase the current threshold from &euro;300 million to &euro;500 million is enacted.  I encourage us all, therefore, to support this Bill to get tourism funded and to support it to grow.<\/p> <p> I am aware that I only have a few minutes speaking time left as I am sharing time but all I can say is that the Minister is welcome to Carlow and Kilkenny any time.  I am so proud to be a Carlovian, we have so much to offer and we would greatly appreciate every piece of funding.

I acknowledge the increase in funding from &euro;300 million to &euro;500 million.<\/p>  <p>  Tourism is one of Ireland&rsquo;s most important economic sectors and its significance as a source of employment and regional development cannot be underestimated.  The substantial increase in funding will allow F&aacute;ilte Ireland to better support tourism, enterprise and projects, as well as the development of tourism facilities and services across our country.<\/p>  <p>  By increasing investment in both F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland, we can continue to improve and promote our overall offering as a top-quality and value-for-money destination.  Covid-19 has had a devastating impact on tourism in the past two years and the focus now must be on supporting the sector as it rebounds by restoring jobs and continuing to promote domestic staycations to make Ireland an attractive place for international visitors.<\/p>  <p>  The tourism sector has proven vitally important in Mayo and this has been shown by the success of the Wild Atlantic Way.  Prioritising continuous investment in the Wild Atlantic Way is a priority of mine, which in turn will bring further sustainable benefits to communities all across our western seaboard.  New innovative tourism projects continue to be developed in our county, including the investment of over &euro;20 million at Westport House.  There is also the development of the Wild Nephin National Park at Ballycroy and a &euro;2.6 million investment in the state-of-the-art visitor centre at the C&eacute;ide Fields which has recently opened.<\/p>  <p>  We are very fortunate also that we have the Great Western Greenway, Ireland&rsquo;s first greenway, running 44 km around the east and northern stretches of Clew Bay with many future plans in place to extend this towards Louisburgh and beyond.  We must, therefore, continue to invest heavily in our greenways and cycle routes to achieve an integrated nationwide network.  With increased funding provided by this Bill, we need to continue to deliver tourism projects which have been earmarked for County Mayo.  These include the outdoor water-based activity centres at Keel on Achill Island and also at Carrowmore Beach in Louisburgh.  I was given a provisional date of 2024 before these projects will be operational, but I believe that we need to revisit or ensure that we have additional focus on the delivery times for these F&aacute;ilte Ireland-supported projects.<\/p>  <p>  Also, we have projects earmarked around the Keem Bay Signature Discovery Point and a 56 km cycle track to the Wild Nephin National Park at Ballycroy.<\/p>  <p>  The collaboration between F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the local authorities needs additional oversight, especially within the Oireachtas, and I would definitely support any call the Minister&rsquo;s Department might make in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800030#CC00200","speaker":"1601"},{"type":"speech","time":1666113600,"counter":348,"content":"<p>As a member of the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill and will support its progress on Second Stage.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has been trying to soften the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic by extending significant financial assistance to the tourism sector.  This includes hospitality, travel and tourism, leisure and sporting sectors coming within the scope of its emergency credit.  However, new figures from the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation ITIC, show that visitor numbers are down 20% so far this year.<\/p>  <p>  The main purpose of this Bill is to increase the aggregate level of advances that may be made to the National Tourism Development Authority, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, out of capital moneys provided by the Oireachtas for the purpose of supporting enterprises and projects relating to the development of tourist traffic and the development of tourist facilities and services.<\/p>  <p>  Festivals and events play a key role in attracting domestic and international visitors to Ireland.  Budget 2023 allowed for continued investment in hosting large-scale events such as US college football and the development of new festivals. <\/p>  <p>  In the past week I had the pleasure of announcing funding for Louth GAA&rsquo;s new stadium project, thanks to a remarkable &euro;14.8 million windfall from the Government&rsquo;s Immigrant Investor Programme.  This funding was very welcome and will certainly attract tourists to County Louth.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the swift recovery from the impact of the pandemic and the war in Europe, the economy still faces major challenges, including rising interest rates and high inflation.  The budget was a mixed one for Irish tourism and hospitality businesses.  The maintenance of the allocation in capital funding of &euro;130 million for tourism development will help F&aacute;ilte Ireland to continue to support and deliver enhanced tourism amenities in line with the objectives of the new National Development Plan 2021-30.<\/p>  <p>  Night-time economy funds were also allocated to drive footfall further into towns to support performances with eight night-time advisors to lead reforms nationwide, while soundproofing grants will help night venues and nightclubs.<\/p>  <p>  The funding for the tourism sector will ensure that F&aacute;ilte Ireland can continue its important work of implementing recovery programmes and campaigns to help deliver the economic growth of the industry and of individual tourism businesses.  That said, there are significant challenges facing the tourism sector and the viability of some tourism businesses is a real concern.<\/p>  <p>  The temporary business energy support scheme was welcomed as an important measure to assist businesses with soaring energy inflation, although concerns have been raised that it does not go far enough.  Meanwhile, Government&rsquo;s failure to use budget 2023 to extend the 9% VAT rate, increasing it by 50% from 1 March next year, was described as disappointing and that the Government has not fully recognised the importance of the tourism industry to every town and county in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  While budget 2023 should rightly be a cost-of-living budget, it should have also formed part of a wider roadmap towards ensuring Ireland is an attractive place to do business and not to be crucifying the tourism and hospitality sectors with a VAT increase come March 2023.<\/p> <p>I support the amendment of section 24(2) of the National Tourism Development Authority Act 2003.  I support the increase in the collective level of advance that may be made to the authority from &euro;300 million to &euro;500 million.<\/p> <p> F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the National Tourism Development Authority, is the statutory body with responsibility for the encouragement, promotion and support of tourism.  The tourism sector has always relied heavily on overseas visitors, especially in my constituency of Louth and east Meath, as we border the North.  However, we need additional supports.  We need to help the hospitality sector, not hinder it.  Domestic and overseas market investment is also essential to promote tourism sales and marketing campaigns to maximise home holidays, which have proven vital in helping businesses to survive and protecting jobs.  Therefore, it is vital that F&aacute;ilte Ireland receives adequate funding to support this investment.<\/p> <p> Other pressures in tourism revolve around staff retention and sustainable tourism to our country.  The budget 2023 measures announced an additional &euro;15 million for a range of industry initiatives, including investment in skills development, recruitment and retention and the building of a pipeline of future employees.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland recently launched a new employers' initiative to help to reposition how the industry is seen as a career choice, to support businesses to consistently drive good employment practices, to build the appeal of the workplace and to show good employers across the industry.<\/p> <p> Additionally, the increase to F&aacute;ilte Ireland, if passed today, will enhance the digital capacity of tourism businesses.  This will be achieved through the tailored digital programme which will provide businesses with tools to boost their online distribution and booking systems to empower them to compete in a highly competitive global marketplace.  The work of F&aacute;ilte Ireland also allows us to ensure the tourism sector plays its part to help deliver Ireland's commitment under the Paris Agreement on climate change and achieve the ambition of the sustainable tourism working groups which aim to place Ireland among the world leaders in sustainable tourism practices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800030#CC00300","speaker":"1600","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666114200,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I want to raise a couple of points with the Minister in regard to tourism in Ireland and this Bill.  First, there is a lot of development that has to happen to increase the benefits to communities and counties with regard to the heritage and tourism sites that they have.  To give an example, in Meath most tourism is currently on the basis of a coach bus out of a Dublin hotel that hits Newgrange and Trim Castle and then returns to the Dublin hotel for dinner.  What I have been trying to do for the last 12 years is to have a greenway going from the source of the River Boyne to the estuary.  I passed a motion in the council 12 years ago and a tiny bit of work has been done in some places in that regard.  Everybody here is, of course, going to sing the praises of their own locality, but the Boyne Valley is very significant in that it is our Valley of the Kings in many ways.  It has the only UNESCO world heritage site in this jurisdiction, it has the Hill of Tara, which has such an international reputation, it has the Battle of the Boyne site and it has Trim Castle and all of the other elements.  This particular greenway would be internationally recognised in terms of bringing tourists to this country yet its development has been pretty much stagnant in the last five or six years.<\/p>  <p>  For me, it is an example of some of the difficulties that I hope Deputy Martin will be able to grapple with in her time as Minister.  We have a dysfunction in how we deal with projects in this country.  It takes forever and an age to deliver some of the simplest things.  I do not know whether it is inertia within the higher echelons of the public service or elsewhere but if this was the private sector, it would not take 12 years to even get a couple of kilometres paved.<\/p>  <p>  Another example is the Hill of Tara, which was the site of the high kings of Ireland and it is our Stonehenge in many ways.  Again, I spoke to previous Ministers in Deputy Martin's position about the development of a plan for the Hill of Tara.  One was published at the start of this month, and I praise the Lord for that and it is good news that it has happened, but it is still a prime example of how slow it is to move projects on in this country.<\/p>  <p>  I want to mention Sliabh na Caill&iacute; at Loughcrew, a 5,000-year-old Neolithic passage grave or cairn which contains Neolithic artwork.  It is being held up by a rusty acrow at the moment.  Any state must be a philistine state to deal with such a level of historic and heritage importance in this way.<\/p>  <p>  Another example of where we are glacially slow in the development of heritage projects is Moore Street.  Again, I have spoken to Minister after Minister with regard to, first, the importance of that battlefield site and, second, its potential in terms of tourism.  Yet, we have this shocking situation where it is now at the centre of enormous and grave allegations around potential corruption, where allegations were made in newspapers and the print media and where it is alleged the traders of Moore Street were pressurised with the attraction of money to vote in favour of the Hammerson planning application on that site.  That was meant to be open in 2016 as a visitor site but it is still lying idle.  Right now, Moore Street is famous for a number of things: defecation, urination and alcohol and drug abuse.  That is what is happening on this battlefield site, the birthplace of this nation.  If the Minister were to leave a legacy, it would be to inject a system into the Department to deliver these projects on time and in a speedy manner.  It is a monument to what is wrong with the delivery of projects in this country.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently three tourism bodies on the island of Ireland, Tourism NI, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland.  To have three organisations working on such a small island is not an efficient use of resources.  I understand the structure is a hangover from the Good Friday Agreement but we really need to get to one tourism body, North and South, with efficiency in terms of staff, offices and the marketing of this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800031#DD00200","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1666114200,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I welcome the Government's proposal to expand the spending limit of &euro;500 million to the tourism sector before the end of the year.  I can promise the Minister it is extremely badly needed.  In her opening address, the Minister highlighted that tourism has been Ireland's most important indigenous labour-intensive sector, generating substantial export earnings and tax revenues, and nobody would disagree with that statement.  She also spoke of it being woven into the fabric of Irish cultural and social life and the critical role it plays in regional economies, and, again, there is no disagreement there.  She also spoke of the multiplier effect on agriculture, the services sector and the indigenous sector in terms of hospitality, beverage, entertainment and so on.  She has rightly identified that this is a very important sector in the country.  I would go as far as to say it is probably most important in the regions of the country, given we do not have the same economies of scale as the large cities and, therefore, many people in rural parts of Ireland depend on some of the revenue that comes from tourism.<\/p>  <p>  It is interesting the way Ireland has changed over the last 30 or 40 years.  I can certainly remember as a youngster that Killarney and Galway were littered with bed and breakfasts and there were very few hotels, and those who went on holidays, by and large, did so in bed and breakfasts.  We have had quite a big turnaround in that sector in recent years and we now have many hotels, but not in all parts of the country.  There is also a real offering for a different type of holiday.  The Minister mentioned the idea of experiential holidays, which is the way a lot of tourism seems to be going, and Ireland can certainly do well in that sector if we have the right product.  However, we have to be able to tailor that to people's needs and to their pockets.<\/p>  <p>  I want to speak about my own county and city, Waterford, the oldest city and the founding city of the country.  Waterford city has had more American visitors this year than Irish visitors, and that is a first in any tourism year.  We have seen the return of luxury liners to Dunmore East, which is very welcome.  However, it has to be noted that we were restricted in the number of liners that we could bring in because the harbourmaster would only allow a certain number.  The Minister's Department needs to talk to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for next year because we cannot have a repeat of that.  We had business coming from liners that could not dock off Dunmore East.  It is a great experience for all involved and it is much needed for the area.<\/p> <p> We have five top-class museums in Waterford, including two new additions over the past two years, those being, the Irish Silver Museum and the Irish Museum of Time, which is recognised as a stand-out world-class museum.  We also have the Waterford Museum of Treasures, which is having its busiest year ever.  What is amazing about this group of museums is that they charge people admission.  I could leave the House tonight and go into the National Museum next door for free, but I cannot go into any museum in Waterford for free.  I have to pay.  This is a serious inequity for the likes of the Waterford Museum of Treasures.  Why are we not giving enough funding to attractions around the country to support them with this?  Most visitors to Waterford do not buy tickets to all five museums.  Instead, they buy one or two tickets because doing otherwise would be too expensive even though they might like to see the other museums.  We are losing out because of this.<\/p> <p> As the Minister knows, we have a great culture festival in Waterford.  She attended Spraoi last year and Winterval will be held at Christmas.  We also have the West Waterford Festival of Food.  We have people who are clued into creating indigenous and foreign tourist appeal in our city and county, but they need support.  Spraoi has pointed out that extra funding was provided during Covid last year, for which I thank the Minister, but we do not do well in the funding stakes overall.  I was on a council for a year and I know it is difficult for the local authority to find funding.  Will the Minister consider this matter, particularly for the coming year, which will be hard on the retail and tourism sectors?<\/p> <p> We have five blue flag beaches in the county.  They are top class in every way, but I am involved in an initiative that is trying to bring beach wheelchairs onto some of them.  These are wheelchairs for disabled people that would run on the beach.  Disabled people who are wheelchair bound cannot get onto the beaches because their wheelchairs' wheels are generally too narrow to travel across the sand.  They certainly cannot get near the water.  Beach wheelchairs would allow for that.<\/p> <p> That is one issue.  Another is that Tramore, which is one of the largest and busiest beaches in Waterford, needs a disability changing room with a hoist.  We need to be able to present ourselves as an inclusive town, city and resort which people in wheelchairs can visit and where, if needs be, they can change and be hoisted.  Otherwise, they cannot come.  There is a significant number of people to whom the seaside experience is not available.  This matter has been raised at council meetings, where funding is always pointed to as the issue, but we are not talking about big money in the grand scheme of things.  Will the Minister consider this matter?<\/p> <p> I wish to address the marketing of Waterford.  I am not a fan of Ireland's Ancient East.  I always thought that we should have been brought into the Wild Atlantic Way, but we were not.  However, we have the Copper Coast, which is a stand-out area of special conservation.  I have a concern about Ireland's policy on wind generation off the south coast, though.  There are three separate wind farms proposed for off the south coast of Waterford and east Cork.  Later this week, a briefing will be given in the AV room by the ESB.  The ESB tells us that it will have wind pylons 12 km from shore, which is approximately 7 miles. Those pylons will be 350 m high and there will be an array of 60 to 70 of them per field.  I ask that the Government take a long, hard look at its wind generation policy before it starts planting a plethora of turbines down in one of the most scenic parts of the country.  We in Waterford are prepared to do our bit to support the national energy crisis and sustainable energy, but not at the cost of our amenities.<\/p> <p> Since the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, is a representative of the Green Party, I will ask her two questions on wind energy.  First, what will the community dividend of these three wind farms be to the coastal communities?  I have met some of the promoters involved and I understand that the community dividend is payable over 15 years, yet the life of these licences will be 25 years and the life of these farms will be 50 years.  Will the Minister examine this matter?  Second, is the Government considering putting a ratchet in place so that we can understand what price the Irish people will pay for our indigenous wind generation as opposed to the price at which we will export it?  If required, the Government could step in whenever it wishes and use a known formula to take ownership by nationalising the wind generation infrastructure.  We must hold off on awarding any of these licences until we review the situation.  I have a strong concern that wind energy will end up in a Corrib-type situation, particularly where wind off the south coast is concerned, in that we will be left looking at the wind turbines blotting our landscape and will be paying more for the energy while getting very little by way of recompense.  I ask that the Minister raise this matter with the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications.<\/p> <p> Our night-time economy is in terrible order.  There need to be supports for business.  The energy situation is critical, but the issue of staffing is also difficult.  We are probably heading into a recession.  We cannot have the vibrant cultural tourism offering that the Minister spoke about if we do not have private businesses that can actually stay in business.  In recent weeks, Revenue has been getting tough on people in the service and hospitality sector in terms of the moneys they owe by issuing demand letters, increasing rates and so on.  We cannot have talk in the House about helping sectors unless we put money on the ground to support business and staffing.  Will the Minister consider this matter?<\/p> <p> I have been trying to help the Government with the insurance sector.  Legislation on occupiers' liability is forthcoming and the reform of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, will pass before the end of the year, but we still need significant pressure from the Government.  Regarding children's activities, for example, bouncy castle operators are now finished, as are people with climbing frames, because they cannot get insurance.  How are we to attract families and small children with our tourism offering if we cannot allow them to play safely because we do not have adequate insurance cover in place or we have not regulated the courts enough to ensure they are not awarding exceptional damages for light injuries?<\/p> <p> I support the additional moneys, which I hope to see allocated fairly once stakeholders in the tourism sector are spoken to.  They can say how best the moneys can be spent and where they will have the most effect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800031#DD00300","speaker":"1616","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666114800,"counter":353,"content":"<p>We recognise that this is a technical Bill and no one will oppose it.  We accept the point that F&aacute;ilte Ireland has a job to do in selling this State and the entire island, which is what we want it to do.<\/p>  <p>  No different from anyone else, I will extol the virtues of the part of the world where I live.  We will start with the wonders of the Boyne Valley and go right through to historic Drogheda, including the horrors of Cromwell.  County Louth is the land of C&uacute; Chulainn - Baile &Aacute;tha Fhirdia to Knockbridge, where I am from, and D&uacute;n Dealgan to the Cooley Peninsula, home of the T&aacute;in B&oacute; C&uacute;ailnge.<\/p>  <p>  We all know that certain actions can be taken to facilitate Louth.  We have never sold our part of the world.  When speaking about the northern part of the island, there must be cross-Border considerations.  Some of the Carlingford-Omeath-Newry greenway, which covers North and South, is already done.  It is to be facilitated.  There are particular safety issues.  Councillor Ant&oacute;in Waters has been dealing with Louth County Council and other stakeholders in that regard.  The greenway must be delivered.<\/p>  <p>  I accept some of what has been said, in that we must get a handle on public liability insurance.  This is an issue for businesses, community groups and anyone who is trying to provide the sorts of service that families and children will be looking for if we get them to this wonderful country.<\/p>  <p>  The Narrow Water Bridge will open up the connection between Omeath and Warrenpoint.  Wondrous things can be done.  There are the glories of the Cooley Mountains all the way through to the Mourne Mountains.  We could put a serious amount of effort into selling that part of the world.<\/p> <p>Covid-19 was probably very useful for many people who lived there because it caused them to suddenly realise the resource on their doorsteps.  We must, however, sell this to a wider audience and there is definitely room to do this.

We know the issues there are with hotels, some of the mitigating circumstances regarding the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the work we are doing in that regard, but we need to get a handle on this situation before it impacts all the other aspects of tourism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800032#EE00200","speaker":"1498","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666115400,"counter":355,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this issue and I welcome the Minister to the House.  This is a technical Bill and will be supported from all sides of the House.  It provides an opportunity for Members to speak about some of the tourism issues affecting their constituencies.  I thank the Government and all the Ministers for the very welcome financial injection it gave to the tourism sector in the recent budget.  It was much needed in the context of the energy crisis.  I have spoken to hoteliers in my constituency.  For those hotels with leisure centres, swimming pools, gyms and the like, especially, energy prices have gone through the roof and this is impacting them greatly.  I would like the Minister and the Government to watch over this sector because it is important to our economy.<\/p>  <p>  This brings me to the rate of VAT in the tourism context.  I understand it was there for a specific reason.  I spoke to hoteliers in my constituency during the summer and leading up to the budget regarding the VAT rate.  Hotel prices in Dublin acted as a major dampener in the context of the way they were running their businesses.  The more they came out to try to defend their position during the summer months, the more infuriated I became.  I refer specifically to the bigger cities and Dublin.  We must examine separating hotel prices in Dublin from those, for example, in Wexford, where I come from.  I will try to defend those in Wexford, where there is fantastic value in most hotels.<\/p>  <p>  I heard some people from the Irish Hotels Federation coming out in recent months and saying that it was possible to get a night in a hotel in Dublin for &euro;140.  Well, I would like to have seen that.  As someone who stays in Dublin from one to three nights weekly, the cheapest hotel it was possible to get during the summer months of June, July and August, or in May, June and July when the D&aacute;il was sitting, was &euro;280 to &euro;300.  Some Members have told me that their rates went up by 200% and more in some of the hotels they were staying in.  Those hotels were sending a clear message that they were making hay while the sun shone.  Fair play to them.  They forgot, though, about the rainy days and there will always be rainy days.  This is why I ask the Minister to examine the VAT rate in Dublin.  I spoke to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, about this point.  I know it is difficult to do.  More importantly, however, I ask her to look at the VAT rate in the hotel sector and in the restaurant sector.  Our restaurants are really under pressure.  I genuinely make this point to the Minister.  I have no vested interest in any restaurant or anything like that, but speaking to restaurateurs in my constituency and here in Dublin, in the context of energy prices and everything like that having gone through the roof, I genuinely ask the Minister to look at this VAT rate.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, I wish to talk about its process, system and criteria.  There is a shortage of hotels here.  Representatives of An Bord Plean&aacute;la should be hauled in and asked what they are playing at.  I have a perfect example of what I am talking about in Wexford town.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la has refused a hotel planning permission on two occasions now.  All the issues originally raised by the board have been fully addressed, and I mean fully addressed, and yet the hotel got a second refusal in this regard.  I just cannot understand this.  I see the situation with the ring road in Galway, and I know there are specific issues there, and it is nothing to do with me because it is not in my county, but I feel that what is happening in An Bord Plean&aacute;la means its representatives should be brought in and asked what their game is, what they are playing at and what is going on in that organisation.  I will say no more.<\/p>  <p>  The last Deputy spoke about the Ukrainian crisis and the refugee crisis we have.  The Government must get a handle on this for next year's tourism market, specifically regarding the hotel sector.  Ireland is becoming a very costly destination.  Regarding the number of hotels that have closed their doors to take in Ukrainian refugees, that is their own business.  We have a crisis and we must handle it.  At the same time, however, we cannot forget about our domestic tourism market.  We do not want to overprice and destroy ourselves for many years to come in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to the Rosslare-Waterford greenway, I am aware that a rail review is being undertaken now.  I am not sure where the publication of that report stands.  Talk about the western rail corridor has been going on as long as I have been in Government, since 2011, and it is still going on.  I do not believe that a railway will ever again run between Rosslare and Waterford.  If it does, however, I will have no problem with it.  I believe we can also look, however, at having a greenway running in parallel with the Rosslare-Waterford line.  Greenways are a fantastic tourism magnet for every county.  We see that in the south east.  I differ with my colleague regarding the Ireland's Ancient East marketing initiative.  I think it is doing a fantastic job.  I would, though, like to see us get the same marketing as the Wild Atlantic Way gets.<\/p>  <p>  The other issue I wish to talk about concerns car rental.  This is a major issue and there is a great shortage in this regard.  The cost of car rental is extremely high and this is driving away tourists from our American and other markets.  I am also delighted that \"Prime Time\" is going to do a programme on O'Connell Street this week.  As an Irish person, it is a street I am ashamed of.  It is full of druggies, crime, antisocial behaviour, robberies, takeaways and alcohol.  This is the main street in our national capital.  If Dublin City Council does not address what is happening on O'Connell Street, and the streets surrounding it, then I would not send a tourist there-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800033#FF00200","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1666115400,"counter":356,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

Urban areas are also important in the tourism trade.  In Dublin West, and in Dublin 15 in particular, we have many tourism opportunities.  We have the old Castleknock Castle and Mulhuddart Cemetery.  The Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies observatory at Dunsink is one of the potential jewels in the crown for tourism not just in Dublin but in Ireland.  Anyone who has visited it will have seen the massive potential it has.  To mention just one site in particular, I refer to the old Porterstown National School, which opened its doors in 1854.  In many urban areas, unfortunately, developers come in, outbid local authorities and buy land.  This is what has happened with the old Porterstown school site.  Over the years, as developers sit on sites like this, important protected structures, such as the old Porterstown National School, get damaged and vandalised.  Windows are broken, the roof gets damaged and suddenly there is also water and fire damage.  Many protected structures like this then get destroyed over time.<\/p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>This has been put up for sale in recent weeks, which is important because the developer has tried to do a huge build-to-rent redevelopment and has not succeeded and, therefore, he has decided to cut his losses.

We have to remember that this is part of a jigsaw because we have the Royal Canal greenway coming along in the next few years.  Most of the greenway is built and the last section of it is coming along Clonsilla.  This is a real opportunity for Dublin 15 and Clonsilla to be provided with some capital funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800033#FF00500","speaker":"1476","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666116000,"counter":360,"content":"<p>It is fitting that we are discussing this topic of tourism and development as a wonderful organisation called Munster Vales today held a sustainable tourism event in Caiseal Mumhan, Cashel, County Tipperary, which I, unfortunately, could not attend due to being here.  From what I heard it was an excellent event and I want to compliment Tr&iacute;ona O'Mahony and her team for that.  Munster Vales is doing fantastic work promoting the region of Tipperary, north Cork, Limerick and down to the Copper Coast in Waterford.  It is great to see these local authorities working together - n&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile - to promote tourism in the region.<\/p>  <p>  For far too long these regions have been left behind but it is great to see a real effort to promote the natural beauty and amenities we have in these areas.  I hope that through this Bill we will be able to go further with that.  For far too long those areas were left behind by the National Tourism Development Authority and we had to rely on volunteers, whom I salute.  I particularly want to pay tribute to Knockmealdown Active, a wonderful voluntary community organisation that celebrated its tenth anniversary two week's ago in the community hall of my village of Caisle&aacute;n Nua na Si&uacute;ire.  The brain behind that was Kevin O'Donnell, who had Kilmaneen Farmhouse.  It brought all the local communities together under Knockmealdown Active on the slopes and at the foot of the Knockmealdown Mountains.  This includes my home village of Newcastle, Ardfinnan, Goatenbridge, Clogheen, Ballyporeen and Araglin.  It also extends trasna na sl&eacute;ibhte to Mount Melleray and its famed abbey and to Lismore.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to compliment the founding members of Knockmealdown Active: Billy Hale, Mark Rylands and Marian O'Dwyer, an r&uacute;na&iacute;.  They have done tremendous work, it has been an outstanding success and I salute them.  I salute the way they brought together representatives of each of the communities in an effort to work together to promote tourism and improve the quality of life in our communities by introducing outdoor amenities.  They have worked hard to manage our waymarked trails and hold guided walks and kayak trips on our Suir blueway.  Most notably they have organised the Knockmealdown challenge, which brought 600 participants to An Caisle&aacute;n Nua, Newcastle, this year, for an adventure race comprising cycling, trail running through the Knockmealdown Mountains and kayaking in the famous Bay Lough, where Petticoat Loose was renowned to reside.  This event is a wonderful success in its sixth year and it is an example of how successful community events can be run.  The organisation has operated without any significant State funding and its success is down to the commitment of the committee members, and all of the different committees and clubs in the area joined in this year.  It was wonderful and the true spirit of the meitheal was active in organising that.<\/p>  <p>  It is also hugely involved in the development of the fantastic St. Declan's Way project, which is a wonderful 116 km waymarked trail stretching from Caiseal Mumhan through Tipperary to Ardmore, County Waterford.  Bh&iacute; an tAire ann leis an bprionsa.  The Minister was in Cashel earlier this year during the royal visit.  Many years ago, Knockmealdown Active and Kevin O'Donnell in particular came to me with a proposal to hugely increase the tourism potential in the Knockmealdown region but unfortunately at the time F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the other agencies could not fund it.  Hopefully, the Bill will change that.  Thankfully during Covid, people began to see the value and the asset of where they are living.  We have to be careful going forward as tourism faces challenges with the cost of living so we do not know if people will be able to travel to our area.  It is important that F&aacute;ilte Ireland gets behind and supports these forgotten areas.<\/p>  <p>  I also want to pay tribute to Munster Vales, under the guidance of Tr&iacute;ona O'Mahony and to Tipperary Tourism, under the guidance of Marie Phelan, who does an excellent job, for all their wonderful work in the presentation of Tipperary and the Munster vales as an attractive outdoor destination.  I acknowledge the work of Tipperary food producers for their massive efforts in promoting the county as a top destination for food tourism.  We have so much to offer in Tipperary with the Knockmealdown Mountains, the Galtee Mountains, the Vee valley and the Glen of Aherlow, stretching up to the Lough Derg region.  We have the best castles and heritage buildings with the Rock of Cashel, Cahir Castle and the Swiss Cottage, all in Cashel, Carrick-on-Suir and so on.  We have the heritage and culture and we want to promote it.  We look forward to engaging with the Minister.

It is probably the most beautiful part of the entire western world.  County Kerry is the tourism capital of the world and Killarney is the finest destination that any person could ever want to go to.  It is a privilege, therefore, to be here talking about tourism and promoting what is good in Kerry in tourism.<\/p>  <p>  The tourism sector in Ireland is considered to be a labour-intensive one, providing employment opportunities for a range of skills and work patterns, with strong regional disparity.  The strength of the tourism sector is also seen as important to the protection and development of rural economies.  The distinction between F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland is that the latter is solely responsible for marketing the island of Ireland overseas as a holiday, business and tourism destination.  Tourism Ireland's primary objective is to increase visitor numbers to the island of Ireland, whereas F&aacute;ilte Ireland is focused on product development.  All the agencies of the State have to work together as a team, whether they are the ones I am after mentioning, us as politicians or the excellent county councillors we have in all our local authorities up and down the length and breadth of the country from all parties and none, including in County Kerry.  Our job as a team is to bring as many people as possible from all over Europe and the world and let them see, taste feel and enjoy what it is to come to Ireland.  That is what it is all about.<\/p>  <p>  They need only come here once and see what we have to offer.  Once they see the beautiful scenery and enjoy our hospitality, eat the food, meet the locals and experience what it is to have a holiday in Ireland they will continuously want to come back.  They will be our ambassadors, as they have been with the past 100 years, because word of mouth is the best thing in the world.  People will tell other people that they went to Ireland, that it was great and they will explain all the good things we have to offer.  We do tourism better than anyone else.<\/p>  <p>  We can fight about different things but I want to thank present and past Governments for the work they have put in to promote tourism.  Like everything, we cannot sit down; we have to do more.  We have to send people abroad to sell Ireland.  I will use Kenmare as an example, where we have the Brennan brothers.  At this stage anybody who knows anything about tourism knows about Francis Brennan and his explaining of selling Ireland, Kerry and Kenmare as a tourism destination that is second to none.  We need more people to be our ambassadors and to promote all the things that are good about Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I want to thank the business people, whether they are the small shop owners, the small hoteliers, the big hoteliers, the guest house owners, the bed and breakfast accommodation providers or the Airbnb providers.  The Government seems to have its sights on Airbnb providers in a desire to shut them down, which is stupid beyond belief because we have to allow for all the different categories of people who are coming here to be catered for.  They could be coming to stay in a budget hostel, which is excellent if that is what they want, and if they are coming with a knapsack and a bicycle under them they are welcome.<\/p> <p>If they are coming in a tour group they are welcome as are those hiring a car.  All of the different categories of people are welcome and we want to be able to cater for all of the financial ranges.  The beauty of Ireland is that we can take care of all the layers of tourists who come.  We have to ensure the businesses can stay open.  On behalf of the businesses of Kerry I want to say they are under so much pressure.  We have ever-increasing energy costs, rates are going up to an enormous cost and labour is expensive.  They are finding it very difficult to continue after Covid.  I am pleading with the Minister.  I thank the Government for the Covid supports.  They were very important.  Now people in business are finding it harder than ever before.  We have to promote business.  We have to support it in every way we can.  We must always remember there is no better place in the world for tourism than County Kerry and that is a known fact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800034#GG00300","speaker":"1487","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666116600,"counter":363,"content":"<p>After Galway that is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800035#HH00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1666116600,"counter":364,"content":"<p>Maith an bhean.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800035#HH00300","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1666116600,"counter":365,"content":"<p>We will not fight about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800035#HH00400","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1666116600,"counter":366,"content":"<p>And of course west Cork.  I am glad to have an opportunity to speak about the Bill.  I met the Minister several years ago in Ballydehob.  I hope she enjoyed her break in west Cork at the time.  A holiday in west Cork is a unique tourism experience.  We have places such as Kinsale, Clonakilty, Bantry, the Beara Peninsula, Baltimore, Union Hall, Schull, Skibbereen and the stunning islands.  We have Dursey Island, Bere Island, Whiddy Island, Long Island, Sherkin Island, Cape Island and Hare Island.  It is a unique experience.<\/p>  <p>  I met people from the hotel sector just before the budget and I have spoken to them since the budget.  I plead with the Minister to concentrate very strongly on this area.  There are many very successful hotels in west Cork, such as the Celtic Ross Hotel, the Fernhill House Hotel, the Emmet Hotel, O'Donovan's Hotel in Clonakilty, the West Cork Hotel in Skibbereen, the Westlodge in Bantry and the Schull Harbour Hotel to name a few.  If the VAT rate goes from 9% to 13.5% next year it will have a devastating effect on these hotels and the hotel sector.  This is also the case for the tourism sector.<\/p>  <p>  These hotels are top class.  They have not cashed in.  They have not increased their prices over the years.  They have been loyal.  Most of them are family-run hotels.  They told me the VAT rate going from 13.5% to 9% could be the difference between some of them working in their hotels for free and not making any income to keep the door open.  This cannot be allowed to happen.  They have to live.  These hotels, whether they are on Mizen Head or in Bantry, Clonakilty or Kinsale, have to survive.  The difference between 9% and 13.5% could be the difference in survival.  I ask the Minister to work on it.  I know she has to fight her corner at the Cabinet table.  There are many hotels and I have named only a few of them that would be in serious trouble.  They told me about the energy costs with the price of electricity and oil going out of control.  They said they would not even apply for a solar panel given the complications.  They would put it in and pay for it themselves if it would help to bring down the energy costs.  There is very little between the door staying open and the door closing.  Some hotels in west Cork are shut three or four days a week which is quite serious.  This is because it is a difficult area and a very difficult time.<\/p>  <p>  I mentioned the Celtic Ross Hotel and I congratulate all the chefs who will graduate on Friday.  They are involved in a new west Cork chef academy training programme in conjunction with Cork Education and Training Board.  I wish them the best of luck.<\/p>  <p>  Another area in the tourism sector is the pub sector, which has been forgotten about.  If we are selling west Cork or anywhere the pub tends to be a place for people to go.  I speak to a lot of publicans and I do a lot of clinics in public houses over the weekends.  I meet a lot of publicans and I speak to them.  Many of them are struggling.  They are also wondering whether they can keep the doors open.  Recently I was in a public house when the electricity bill was being opened.  It had increased from &euro;700 to &euro;2,300 or &euro;2,400.  There was a gasp when it was opened.  There was also a gasp from the other side of the bar where I was drinking a cup of tea.  I was concerned as to whether they can keep the doors open.  It is a massive struggle and an area that has probably been forgotten.<\/p>  <p>  We recently spoke about nightclubs and applications for licences.  The fees have been cut and this will save a few hundred euro.  One time there were seven or eight nightclubs in west Cork and I do not think there are any now.  I asked my children and they told me there is no nightclub at the weekends.  When we were young there were six or seven to choose from.  We used to wonder whether we would go left, right, east, west, south or north.  We had Clonakilty, Skibbereen and Bantry.  There was a huge number of choices.<\/p>  <p>  Walking has been a brilliant success in west Cork with the Sheep's Head Way and the Beara Way.  While progress has been made on the Mizen way proper compensation for farmers must come into play.<\/p>  <p>  I want to speak about visitor centres.  I could be here for a week talking about tourism.  The Michael Collins visitor centre on the Timoleague road is outstanding.  I hope it can be further developed.  It was a great year for Michael Collins.  I thank Tim and Dolores Crowley who run a very informative centre where people will get information with 100% perfection on the history of Michael Collins.  Tourism offices need to be looked at.  I plead that they be independently funded through the Minister's Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800035#HH00500","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1666116600,"counter":367,"content":"<p>Last week I mentioned in the D&aacute;il that we may not have places for tourists in this country next year.  Figures from F&aacute;ilte Ireland for 2019 show international and Irish tourist yielded an estimated &euro;9.5 billion.  Tourism gives employment to 270,000 people.  The industry must be supported and protected.  A total of 70% of these jobs are outside Dublin.  Tourism is a huge regional employer.  It provides employment for students and there are spin-offs for local retailers, suppliers and the agri-marine community.<\/p>  <p>  While there was a great rebound in 2022 the industry is very nervous of the winter ahead.  The escalating costs, hyperinflation and economic slowdown are not helping.  The VAT rate must be retained at 9%.  We need to stay in line with our European neighbours to remain competitive.<\/p>  <p>  According to the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation 75% of Ireland's tourism economy is made up of international tourists.  Affordable access to our country through air and sea is vital as we are an island nation.  Support for our airports in a meaningful way is critical to this end.  Dublin Airport had 86% of the country's passengers in 2019.  All other airports in the whole of Ireland had only 14% of the passengers.  The spare capacity at State airports such as Shannon Airport needs to be utilised.  This would not only alleviate the congestion in Dublin Airport but also benefit the local economy and the entire economy of the country.  Shannon Airport is an underutilised resource.  Will anyone here explain the reason for the imbalance if the current trend continues?  Will the Minister explain this to me?  Ireland is unique with the concentration of traffic into one dominant airport, which is Dublin Airport.  This is something the Minister can take back to the Cabinet.  Throughout Europe no other national airport accounts for such a high proportion of traffic.  In the whole of Europe, where the Government goes to listen, Ireland is the only place where most of the traffic goes through the national airport even though we have alternatives.<\/p>  <p>  There are huge concerns about our accommodation crisis for Ukrainians and asylum seekers in the season ahead.  Hotels and guest houses cannot be the only solution as otherwise we will not have the capacity for the tourism sector.  The Government needs alternatives to hotels in our tourist areas to meet the accommodation demand.<\/p>  <p>  I have just said that 70% of tourism goes through the hotels in Ireland.  When I leave Limerick city I go through Patrickswell to Adare, which has Fitzgerald's Woodlands House Hotel and the Dunraven Arms Hotel.<\/p> <p>If I head west, I have the Rathkeale House Hotel on to Longcourt House Hotel in Newcastlewest and Leens Hotel in Abbeyfeale.  If I turn east and head towards Kilmallock, I have Deebert House Hotel as well as all the hostels, bed and breakfast accommodation, and different accommodation centres around the country.  However, the exchange rate for the dollar has never been as good for American and other tourists coming to this country, which makes it affordable for them to do so.  I am conscious of where we are going to put them if we do not have alternatives.  Not only that, it will have a knock-on effect on all the shops used by tourists, such as bike shops and coffee shops, and all the knick-knacks supplied around the country.<\/p> <p> Members have talked about other counties.  They have to travel through Limerick to get to most of them and, therefore, I believe Limerick is the best county in Ireland for anyone to start off and they can go to the other tourist destinations thereafter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800035#HH00600","speaker":"1499","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666117200,"counter":369,"content":"<p>Limerick, you&rsquo;re a lady.

I am informed there is a drinking game: any time I mention &quot;west Cork&quot; during my D&aacute;il contributions, a drink should be taken.<\/p><p>I welcome the Bill and the provision of funding, and I say &quot;Well done&quot; to the Minister for all the work she is doing in this regard.  I want to be parochial, like everyone else, and talk about west Cork.  Everyone, or certainly those who live there, knows how wonderful west Cork is and I am sure the Minister is tired of hearing this but I know she is a fan of the entire area.  From a marketing and branding point of view and trying to sell the regions internationally, west Cork is often overlooked.  The recent &euro;1 million campaign by Tourism Ireland aimed at marketing Ireland in the US is very much focused on Shannon and County Clare, but there is a missed opportunity in that regard.  I understand the rationale in that Shannon Airport has transatlantic flights, but we have had this debate previously about where the gateway to the Wild Atlantic Way is.  Efforts were made by F&aacute;ilte Ireland to brand Killarney as the gateway, which we debated and contested because it is clear that the most obvious gateway to or starting point of the Wild Atlantic Way is Kinsale and west Cork.  There are some good and obvious reasons for this, first of which is Cork Airport.  I commend management at the airport who are ramping up efforts to increase connectivity and the number of flights to what is repeatedly regarded as the best and easiest to use airport in Ireland, as well as one of the easiest to use in Europe.  It has a fantastic brand-new runway, which required the airport to close recently.  That runway is capable of taking transatlantic flights and I would love the Minister's Department, in conjunction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland, to help the management of Cork Airport in their efforts to secure transatlantic flights so we can market the real gateway to the Wild Atlantic Way, which is west Cork.<\/p><p>West Cork is the obvious start to the Wild Atlantic Way.  Nowhere else boasts beautiful headlands such as the Old Head of Kinsale, where the<i>Lusitania<\/i>commemoration is, or the stunning seaside villages like Courtmacsherry, and Clonakillty with its nearby beaches and heritage, as well as Skibbereen, Glandore, Union Hall, and the Beara and Mizen peninsulas.  I could go on.  The product is there.  It does not need further development and it just needs to be sold internationally.<\/p><p>I would love to see a concerted effort over the winter and into the spring to market and promote our regions.  I acknowledge an effort will be made but it has to be concerted because something has happened over the past two years, of which I am sure the Minister will be aware.  The months of July, August and September 2021 generated a bumper season for the regions, including west Cork, Kerry and along the western seaboard.  This was because we were in a pandemic and people were discovering parts of Ireland they had not discovered before.  As overseas travel was not an option, people were discovering places such as west Cork, Waterford, Wexford, Galway, Clare - you name it - and they loved it.  Talking to the industry, hoteliers, caf&eacute; owners, and people involved with amenities, they say it was a bumper year.  However, for the same period this year, there was a definite drop-off.  In many ways, it can be explained by the fact we had a bit of a passport crisis, with approximately 1.6 million passport applications being made.  There was pent-up demand for travel and we cannot blame people for that, but it means we need to make a concerted effort to attract people back to the regions, both in the context of domestic tourism where we remind people of the amazing scenery they saw and experiences they had in the summer of 2021, and internationally, where we remind the world of what an amazing place Ireland is, particularly those regional areas, with a focus on west Cork.  That strategy needs to be put in place for the winter and spring.<\/p><p>I support the calls in the debate to retain the 9% VAT rate, and I noticed the word &quot;review&quot; may have been used in the budget.  I do not want to be disingenuous and give people a false sense of hope, but there is an opportunity to review that decision, especially in light of spiralling energy costs.  It does not only affect hotels.  We are all contacted by hoteliers, but caf&eacute;s and small business owners are under pressure too when it comes to energy bills.  We need to make Ireland competitive internationally.  Now that people can travel again and international flights are back on the agenda, it is about making us competitive internationally.  We saw what happened mainly in Dublin.  I underline the calls made not to paint everyone with the same brush.  West Cork and the regions did not experience the same price hikes.  Prices remained stable and competitive as opposed to what we witnessed in Dublin with hotel rates of &euro;400 and &euro;500 per night.  That has to be recognised.  The Minister fought hard to get the 9% VAT rate in the first place, and she is to be commended on that, but I urge her to continue that fight when it is proposed to revert the VAT rate to 13.5% early next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800036#JJ00600","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speech","time":1666117200,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute on the Bill.  I commend the work of F&aacute;ilte Ireland, but I want to say to the Members from rural Ireland, some of whom spoke before me, that I am not certain of the benefit of a ramble around their own county, listing bed and breakfast accommodation, because I do not know how many international tourists tune in here to get their travel advice.  I am sure if they did, it would be beneficial to them but perhaps their time could be better utilised, although that is a matter for themselves.<\/p>  <p>  I commend the work of F&aacute;ilte Ireland on the establishment of the employer excellence programme, which seeks to support businesses to drive great employee engagement and continuously build the appeal of their workplace is a welcome one.  It is clear there are serious issues within the sector in attracting and retaining staff.  This attempt to help the sector reposition itself as an appealing and rewarding place to work, in the highly competitive labour market is welcome.  It reminds me of a campaign run by my former employer, SIPTU, and other unions - the Fair Hotels campaign.<\/p> <p>One of the things we noticed at the time was that people want to stay, engage, eat, drink and socialise in places where workers are treated with decency and respect.  It is not always about the bottom line for the consumer, although very often it is.  The two should not be put in competition with each other; decent wages should not compete with affordable experiences.<\/p> <p> Many in the sector have scoffed at the employer excellence plan.  They are the ones who want to use the employment permit system to hire from outside Ireland, the EU, the EEA, Britain and Switzerland.  If workers cannot be attracted from such a massive pool, then to my mind the problem has to be pay and conditions in the sector.  Sinn F&eacute;in totally opposes any moves to open up the possibility of an exploitative employment model in the tourism and hospitality industry which is neither an ethical nor sustainable solution for the sector.  We know from countless pieces of academic research and data from the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, that there are issues in regard to the treatment of workers in the sector.<\/p> <p> Dr. Deirdre Curran of NUIG recently appeared before Oireachtas committees to relay the findings of her research, which found that 70% of the workers she surveyed did not get a Sunday premium, 63% witnessed or experienced bullying, 55% witnessed or experienced harassment, 43% did not have a proper contract of employment, 77% experienced verbal abuse sometimes or often, and 64% experienced psychological abuse and 52% did not get their entitlement to rest breaks.  This is backed up by data from the WRC, which told us in its 2020 report that 24% of hotels, 27% of beverage service activities and 32% of food service activities were found to be in breach of employment rights.  Almost &euro;500,000 of unpaid wages was recovered for these categories.  Therefore, while we welcome the employer excellence programme, the reality is, and the facts bear this out, that what is really needed is trade union recognition, collective bargaining and rights for trade unions to organise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800036#JJ00700","speaker":"1467","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666117800,"counter":376,"content":"<p>As a rural Deputy, I thank Deputy O'Reilly for her advice on how I should spend my time.  Notwithstanding her advice, I wish to raise the ongoing controversy regarding Shannon Heritage sites.  There is a difficulty at a national level in that they fall between a number of different Departments.  It seems to me that the issue of what is going to happen to them is being shuttled between various Departments, with very few concrete decisions having been made to date.  If I am wrong on that, I would be delighted to receive confirmation that a decision has been made.<\/p><p>Shannon Heritage is a component part of the recently renamed Shannon Airport Group.  It has three component parts, namely, the airport, Shannon Commercial Properties and Shannon Heritage, which comprises the former Shannon development sites which are tourist attractions in Clare and throughout the mid-west.  These sites include Bunratty Castle, Craggaunowen Castle and Knappogue Castle in County Clare, Dunguaire Castle in Galway Bay, which is in County Galway, and King John's Castle in Limerick, which was always under the ownership of the old Limerick Corporation and its successor-in-title, Limerick City and County Council.<\/p><p>When Shannon Heritage was part of the Shannon Group in 2019, there were proposals for a rather large investment in the sites, in particular Bunratty Castle.  I note <i>The Irish Times<\/i>ran with a figure of &euro;8 million and I had heard &euro;10 million was to be invested.  It was to be a joint investment by the Shannon Group on the one hand and F&aacute;ilte Ireland on the other.  There is a tacit acknowledgement that there is a need for capital investment in Bunratty Castle.  I understand F&aacute;ilte Ireland had agreed in principle, at least, to obtain an application for the investment.  My understanding is that it was pretty much agreed that it would proceed.  Covid intervened of course.  The Shannon Group's finances were greatly affected by Covid, as Shannon Airport is one of its component parts.  Like other airports in the State it was devastated, perhaps even more than other airports, due to the tendency of airlines to concentrate their activities in the major hubs which, in the Irish context, for now at least, is Dublin Airport.<\/p><p>As Shannon Heritage seeks to find a home for itself, given that Shannon Airport Group does not seem to have any great interest in it and is seeking to divest itself of the Shannon Heritage site, Clare County Council expressed an interest in it.  In general terms, I have reservations about county councils running tourism businesses.  However, it should be said that Clare County Council is already running the Cliffs of Moher site very effectively.  It has a large number of visitors and is a huge tourist attraction.  If I am not mistaken, it is the second biggest tourism attraction after the Guinness Hop Store.  It is successful in that regard.  The county council has worked to develop the Vandeleur Walled Gardens, which is part of the Vandeleur estate in west Clare, as well as Loop Head.<\/p><p>The problem is that a large number of people fly to Dublin Airport because in Ireland all roads lead to Dublin.  Everybody flies into Dublin Airport and then gets a bus to the Cliffs of Moher for a day and a bus back to Dublin.  Apart from the carbon footprint that involves, it also results in a concentration of activity around the Cliffs of Moher and not enough footfall in the rest of County Clare.  If only on that basis, whoever is running the Cliffs of Moher would be an ideal person to run these sites.  The track record of Clare County Council means I would support its interest in acquiring the sites, notwithstanding my general reservations about county councils running tourism sites.<\/p><p>The primary focus of county councils should be on providing local government services.  There is an increasing tendency of national government to strip those services away from them, whether it is in planning and the degree of autonomy councils once enjoyed being eroded by recent developments in that regard or Irish Water and water services.  Employees of Clare County Council who work in the water services division are, like those in every other county council in the country, wondering what is going to happen and who they are going to work for next.<\/p><p>We are here to talk about the Bunratty sites.  There are many workers there who are also wondering who they will work for next, what their status will be and what will happen to their careers.  A number of those staff are extremely dedicated.  Any I have met are very dedicated to these sites and have worked in them all of their lives.  The political pass-the-potato is unhelpful.  The Minister might ask what this has to do with her Department.  She may or may not be aware, but I hope she is, that I recently sent her a copy of a letter I sent the Taoiseach to ask that somebody be appointed to head this up.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, heads the Department of Transport, and Shannon Group falls within that Department.  Clare County Council is under the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, headed by the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien.  The Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, has line responsibility for F&aacute;ilte Ireland which had already agreed in principle that a large investment in Bunratty was appropriate.<\/p><p>The issue is now the funding of the transfer.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland and, I believe, Shannon Heritage have accepted the capital investment is required in these sites, in particular in Bunratty but perhaps also the other sites.  If the money was forthcoming in 2019 for a capital investment to bring it up to the required standard, one of the fears of Clare County Council is that if it takes it over, it would have to put significant capital investment into it.  Why is it not being transferred with the benefit of that funding?  Can the Minister confirm that the F&aacute;ilte Ireland funding is still available?  <\/p><p>I see no reason that Shannon Airport should not have to invest the sum of money it previously proposed to invest.  If it wishes to divest itself of the site, perhaps it needs to divest itself of some of the money that would be required to bring it up to the necessary standard and put up that money by way of the capital investment that Clare County Council is to require.  I have asked other Ministers questions and have received various responses to the effect that it should get on with it and that things are not over.  The one-liners are wearing a bit thin.  I am getting a bit tired of them.  I can only imagine what the staff of Shannon Heritage are feeling at the moment as their livelihoods are dependent on this.<\/p> <p>I can also only imagine what the broader tourism sector in Clare is feeling when we talk about all of our attractions.  I did not hear all of the contributions but I heard Deputy Kelly's and I have to agree with him as somebody who is on the other side of Lough Derg.  Clare County Council is talking about a very significant investment in Inis Cealtra, Holy Island, which I welcome.  Bunratty Castle is a national site everyone knows.  It has been very heavily promoted over the years and it is kind of important to our tourism sector, or at least it should be.  Allowing this issue to linger is not beneficial.<\/p> <p> I support the Bill that the Minister is putting before the House because it is about investment and it would be slightly hypocritical of me to call for the investment that F&aacute;ilte Ireland said it was prepared to make in Shannon Airport and vote against providing the funding that is required to do so.  I ask the Minister, even if she would not be very popular for doing so, to raise this at Cabinet as one of the four line Ministers with the Taoiseach and the Ministers for Transport and Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  They have some responsibility towards Bunratty Castle to make sure that we do not enter another tourism season with that degree of uncertainty hanging over it and other such sites.<\/p> <p> I support the Minister's Bill and I acknowledge the necessity to invest in F&aacute;ilte Ireland in order that it has sufficient funding to provide the capital investment required in all sorts of sites across the country, including the Shannon heritage sites.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800037#KK00200","speaker":"1518","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666118400,"counter":378,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy McNamara for sharing time.<\/p>  <p>  In principal, this will be a very worthwhile Bill if it results in the strengthening of the capacity of F&aacute;ilte Ireland to support, promote and create employment actively in the tourism sector within the regions.  There has to be balance and fair play.  Some regions are certainly still developing their tourism strategy.  They are very much in the early stages and need more assistance.  One region is my own region in the midlands where there is huge potential to be tapped into but it just needs more supports and, indeed, more of a focus.  There is more to Ireland than just Dublin - we all know that.  That certainly needs to be realised and captured in various strategies and supports.<\/p>  <p>  The budget increase for the national tourism development authority is already quite substantial, as the Minister knows, and this is merely an enabling Bill with no direct budgetary consequences as of yet.  My understanding is that it will allow capital moneys provided by the Oireachtas to be increased by &euro;300 million to &euro;500 million.  It makes sense to create such flexibility in funding.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the hard work in my constituency, over many years, by Offaly County Council which works continuously to promote tourism in Offaly.  We have had our own tourist office in Tullamore for the past few years which is great to see.  It is also great to see that progress is being made but that is down to the work of Offaly County Council.  I commend each and every one of its staff and, indeed, the county councillors who are constantly advocating for the county and promoting it in every way they can.<\/p>  <p>  We have tourism treasures in Offaly that deserve every support they can get from F&aacute;ilte Ireland or elsewhere.  We have Clonmacnoise, Lemanaghan monastic site, Kinnitty Castle, Birr Castle, gardens and science centre and, of course, the Tullamore Dew centre.  There are considerable options to attract tourists and the potential is certainly there.  We also have Lough Boora discovery park which is increasing in popularity.  The increase in visitors is very visible and welcome.<\/p>  <p>  We also have the Slieve Bloom mountains and, of course, the River Shannon where one can start a riverside adventure in Banagher and cruise on one of the finest natural inland waterways in Europe.  There is a lot there with huge potential to be tapped into but we need supports at national level in order to make things happen.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the treasures that we possess, the tourism sector and the coach sector, in particular, have been crippled in the past number of years.  Our rural transport infrastructure remains disjointed and it is not served by adequate levels of trains or buses.  My colleagues and I have had a number of engagements with the largest representative body for commercial bus operators.  Its members are the leading providers of scheduled services, international and domestic coach tours and school transport.  As a collective, it carries more than 75 million passengers per year while supporting 11,000 regional jobs and contributing more than &euro;600 million annually to the Irish economy and yet it is on its knees and needs urgent supports.<\/p>  <p>  What is a point in promoting tourist destinations if people struggle to get to them and there is such a disconnect and a lack of infrastructure and supports for the coaches which are up and running and willing to play their part in promoting tourism and meeting the needs of the region?<\/p>  <p>  The decision to increase the VAT rate for hospitality from 9% to 13.5% will add to the massive financial burden under which many businesses and hotels find themselves.  I am especially concerned about this because one cannot compare a region such as the midlands to Dublin.  One cannot compare a small, family-run hotel in Offaly to a hotel here in the city and it is unfair to do so.  I believe the fair way to do it, if everyone will be treated the same, is to reduce this VAT rate to 9% or we will see many hotels having to close their doors.  We will then see a loss of jobs and I am very concerned about that.  I ask for an immediate intervention.<\/p>  <p>  The Government talks a good game with regard to tourism ambition for the regions but this has to be matched by actions and outcomes.  Perhaps it would have made more sense to set aside the additional &euro;200 million proposed under this Bill and offer it instead as a help towards maintaining the VAT rate at 9%.  I ask whether that could be looked at.  I agree with F&aacute;ilte Ireland with regard to the midlands.  We need to drive growth in international visitor numbers with regard to tourism, revenue and the associated tourism employment and the regional enterprise plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800038#LL00200","speaker":"1592"},{"type":"speech","time":1666118400,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I am glad to get the opportunity to talk on this very important topic.  I welcome anything that would help tourism in the country and, indeed, in Kerry.  All of us are privileged to be elected to this Chamber to represent the people who elected us from whatever part of the country.  However, I feel that being a Deputy from Kerry, I have an advantage because I am representing the best county in the country and in the world as far as tourism is concerned, because as has been said before Kerry is the tourism capital of the world.<\/p>  <p>  Whether one meets someone from China, Hong Kong, Japan, Kansas or wherever, they all know about Kerry and they know about Killarney.  We have that advantage but we cannot stand still.  We need to advertise, emphasise and tell the people.  We need to treat the people who come today properly and hospitality in Kerry does just that whether one is in Killarney, Ballybunion, Dingle, Kenmare or Cahersiveen.  We have hotels, guesthouses and pubs and we do it very well.<\/p>  <p>  I thank all the owners, proprietors and managers and the workers for the extra care they take of the visitors who come to Kerry, because they know what it is about in that if one does a good job, one will reap the rewards because people will come back.  That is what we wish to ensure.  We also thank the coach operators who had such a tough time over the past two or three years, for the way they do their job and treat the people who travel with them so well.<\/p>  <p>  We have restaurants, cafes and pubs and we have the INEC events centre in Killarney which is second to none.<\/p> <p>It is a town within a town given what it offers.  Last Saturday night, the Kilfenora C&eacute;il&iacute; Band was playing in one part of it and Gina and the Champions in another.  It just shows in the middle of October what kinds of attractions are being provided.  Bing Crosby, the famous crooner, said when he sung of Killarney, and it was the same of Kerry, that day-time or night-time, he liked to be there.  We are very proud of Kerry and all it does.<\/p> <p> Tourism is so important.  I am sad that Airbnbs are going to be blown out of it.  People are concerned their incomes will be nullified because of what is happening.  These people provided a type of accommodation that was needed for people who could only spend so much on it.  They were providing an excellent service.  I worry for the Killarney electoral area.  As it is a rent pressure zone, it is being said that people can no longer advertise Airbnb accommodation, which will have a disastrous effect on Killarney and County Kerry in general.<\/p> <p> I am also worried because so much of our hotel and guesthouse accommodation taken up by refugees.  While we want to see after those who are there, there must be a cap put on the numbers.  We cannot see after the refugees we have already and we cannot see after our own people.  If take the social welfare offices and the doctors, there is more to seeing after these refugees and asylum seekers than just putting them into a bed and putting a roof over their heads.  There is so much more involved and we need to have a proper debate in this Chamber on the number of refugees and asylum seekers we are accepting because in Killarney we are full.  That is the word that is coming back from there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800038#LL00300","speaker":"1580","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666119000,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate and offered their views on the overall development of Irish tourism.  It is proof of the importance of the industry, which reaches into all parts of the country, both rural and urban.  Many of them have been named in the last 30 minutes in particular.  Tourism is a valuable source of employment for many thousands of people.  I have no issue with towns, communities and regions.

I do not know if ten minutes will suffice to address them but I will attempt to do so.  If I do not respond to any Deputy, I will ask my officials to follow up.  <\/p><p>Deputies Christopher O'Sullivan and Nolan raised regional development, which is at the heart of F&aacute;ilte Ireland's remit.  The organisation has created four regional brands, namely, Ireland's Hidden Heartlands, Dublin, Ireland's Ancient East and the Wild Atlantic Way.  To guide medium to longer range development, I understand F&aacute;ilte Ireland aims to deliver four new regional tourism strategies in 2022.  These will set out a ten-year vision and five-year action plan for each region.  At a more local level, these four regional tourism strategies will be activated through a series of co-ordinated local destination and experience development plans developed by F&aacute;ilte Ireland in collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland's focus on promoting the regions has included significant investment into brand-building through individual Keep Discovering campaigns for each of the four regional experience brands as well as media, publicity, digital channels and online sales platforms, and that will continue.  Looking forward to 2023, F&aacute;ilte Ireland will continue to focus on building the regional brand.  It will encourage domestic visitors to visit destinations across the country and through online booking and sales and marketing supports, it will work with the local industry.<\/p><p>Deputy Gannon spoke about the development of Dublin as a brand.  The Dublin Regional Tourism Development Strategy 2023-27 is the roadmap for the tourism industry and all stakeholders involved in tourism in the region to navigate the current challenges and steer a course towards sustainable recovery and continued success.  Over the course of this strategy, in addition to the activation of the Dublin coastal trail and the ongoing implementation of the docklands destination experience development plan, two other DEDPs will be developed, namely, the Dublin City DEDP starting in 2022 and the mountains DEDP commencing in 2023.<\/p><p>The night-time economy was also raised by Deputy Gannon and also Deputy Shanahan.  It will continue to be supported and developed.  That change is coming.  Deputy Gannon asked when we will dance again and my answer is we will be dancing more often and much later into the night.  That is the plan but the sector needs to be supported and that is why we got &euro;6 million in the budget for the night-time economy and also &euro;7 million in additional capital funding for artists' spaces and climate adaptation.<\/p><p>Deputy Gannon also spoke about joined-up thinking.  The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, and I hosted a meeting before the summer recess attended by officials from my Department, the Departments of Transport and Housing, Local Government and Heritage, as well as representatives from the Garda, vintners' organisations, Give Us the Night and residents' associations.  There is, therefore, joined-up thinking on the development of the night-time economy.<\/p><p>Deputy Gould referred to the flooding in Cork.  I will raise that issue with my Government colleagues and refer his suggestions on Shandon and Cork city to F&aacute;ilte Ireland for further consideration.<\/p><p>I agree wholeheartedly with Deputies Griffin and Dillon on the value of our greenways.  Other Deputies referred to them as well.<\/p><p>Deputies Carey and McNamara spoke about Shannon Heritage.  I am aware of the proposed transfer of properties, including Bunratty Castle, from Shannon Heritage to Clare County Council.  My officials are participating in an independent group, chaired by the Department of Transport, which is examining the issue.  While I am of course supportive of any initiative to enhance tourism options in the area, this is ultimately a matter for the Minister for Transport.  I will be happy, as requested, to speak to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien.<\/p><p>Deputy Carey raised the Gathering, which made me think of the other programme for Government commitment.  While the tourism sector continues to emerge from the impact of Covid, we will help with further recovery and rebuilding.  The programme for Government includes a commitment to introduce a new tourism initiative to aid recovery in the sector.  This initiative will seek to promote and build on the warmth of our welcome, the beauty of our landscape and the richness of our culture.  I secured a &euro;5 million allocation in the most recent budget to continue the development of the invitation initiative which provides an excellent opportunity to advance the recovery in multiple sectors that have been significantly impacted by Covid.  I hope to bring proposals to the Government in the near future outlining my full ambition for the project and providing further detail on the work under way.<\/p><p>Deputies Nolan and Kelly raised Ireland's Hidden Heartlands.  Since its launch in 2018, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has been working with the local authorities, other State agencies such as Tourism Ireland and the tourism industry to raise awareness of the new Hidden Heartlands brand and to grow the visitor economy.  Tourism Ireland promotes the Hidden Heartlands directly to overseas visitors and the region now features prominently on the <i>Ireland.com<\/i>website.  The local authorities are key partners and F&aacute;ilte Ireland has been building partnerships with Waterways Ireland, Coillte, Bord na M&oacute;na and the Office of Public Works to optimise the tourism potential of their natural and heritage assets in a sustainable manner.  Recent highlights included the launch of the tourism master plan for the Shannon, which saw &euro;2.3 million invested by F&aacute;ilte Ireland in two new projects last year alone.<\/p> <p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>Some &euro;3.9 million was invested in the revamped National Famine Museum in Strokestown Park, which I had the honour to open last week.<\/p> <p> Deputy Shanahan raised issues regarding docking.  I think that is a matter for the Minister for Transport and his officials.  In response to Deputy Dillon, I know F&aacute;ilte Ireland is very active in Mayo.  The Deputy referred to a number of projects.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland will continue to focus on their continued development.  Deputy Paul Donnelly raised a specific issue which I will ask my officials to raise with F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  That might be under the remit of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n raised Moore Street, which is also a matter for the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, since these are heritage functions.  I will raise the issues Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n brought up during this debate with the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, and the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan.  In response to Deputy Shanahan, two sites, Ardmore and Tramore, have been selected under Platforms for Growth 2.  I will ask my officials to raise any issues regarding accessibility and inclusivity with F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  I will ask my officials to discuss with F&aacute;ilte Ireland the issues that Deputy Mattie McGrath raised during the debate.<\/p> <p> Deputy Michael Healy-Rae did fine promotion of the Killorglin area, Killarney and the entire region of Kerry.  He was followed by Deputies Michael Collins, Christopher O'Sullivan, Danny Healy-Rae, Mattie McGrath and Carol Nolan.  A plethora of fantastic promotion of Ireland was captured in the debate.  Well done to the Deputies.  The sentiment, as mentioned by Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, is that once visitors see what we have to offer, eat our food, meet the people, hear the music and see us dance, they will come back.  That is why marketing is important.  I am pleased to inform Deputy Munster that support of almost &euro;500,000 was awarded to Louth County Council for the Drogheda destination town plan to implement an access and orientation plan.  Regarding the Drogheda attraction of scale, the Ancient Destination Experience Development Plan identifies Drogheda as a key urban gateway to the ancient story of the Boyne Valley with the potential to be a tourism destination of scale.  The project addresses the need for a sustainable world class visitor attraction to act as a catalyst to increase visitor footfall.<\/p> <p> Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, as well as maybe Deputies &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Munster, talked about the Boyne Valley too and the reimagined Boyne Valley drive.  That is a catalyst project in the implementation of the Ancient Destination Experience Development Plan.  It involves reviewing and reimagining the Boyne Valley drive.  That project roadmap is completed and includes an action plan for delivery.  Its key output is the reimagined Boyne Valley drive.<\/p> <p> I told the Leas-Cheann Comhairle I would not get through all of the issues raised.  I have noted them and we will get back to all Deputies about the numerous issues.  Numerous Deputies mentioned the VAT rate.  I am conscious that the reduced VAT rate has been an important element of the business supports secured for the tourism and hospitality sector in the last two years.  The Government will continue to monitor tourism recovery and keep all supports, including the VAT rate, under review in that context.  I am acutely aware of the incredible pressure that these businesses face.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800039#MM00900","speaker":"1471","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666119600,"counter":389,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"National Tourism Development Authority (Amendment) Bill 2022: Referral to Select Committee","time":1666119600,"counter":390,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800040#NN00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1666119600,"counter":391,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Education and Skills pursuant to Standing Orders 95(3)(<i>a<\/i>) and 181(1). <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800040#NN00400","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666119600,"counter":392,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Estimates for Public Services 2022: Message from Select Committee","time":1666119600,"counter":393,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800040#NN00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1666119600,"counter":394,"content":"<p>The Select Committee on Environment and Climate Action has completed its consideration of the following Supplementary Estimate for Public Services for the service of the year ending on 31 December 2022: Vote 29 - Environment, Climate and Communications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800040#NN00700","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"\u00c1bhair Shaincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Matters","time":1666119600,"counter":395,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800040#NN00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1666119600,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 37 and the name of the Member in each case:<\/p><p>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v - to discuss the speedy implementation of the Galway Transport Strategy 2016.  <\/p><p>Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill - to discuss the funding for domestic violence services in budget 2023.<\/p><p>Deputy Bernard J.

This was evident in the stress suffered by individuals and families during the tracker mortgage scandal, caused by a toxic culture in our banks and financial services sector.  There has been intensive work at EU and national levels in recent years to make our financial system stronger and more stable.  The Central Bank Reform Act 2010 and Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 gave extensive regulatory powers to the Central Bank to protect customers and ensure we have a financial services sector that supports a modern economy.  This has borne fruit in making the sector more resilient and capable of withstanding future challenges.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill is a further step in enhancing existing regulatory powers.  However, the Central Bank (Individual Accountability Framework) Bill 2022 will also play a key role in driving the positive cultural change in financial services organisations that we need to see for the benefit of consumers, employees and wider society.  The legislation that the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, is bringing before the House is designed to ensure that this cultural change happens, is real and that it endures.<\/p>  <p>  This legislation will make individuals in financial services firms more responsive and responsible by enhancing individual accountability in decision-making at all levels, particularly at senior levels in financial institutions.  The Central Bank (Individual Accountability Framework) Bill 2022 introduces the individual accountability framework, comprising the senior executive accountability regime, SEAR, conduct standards for firms and for individuals performing controlled functions and the duty of responsibility.  By ensuring that there is clarity about who is responsible for what, the senior executive accountability regime will ensure that, in the event that there is wrongdoing in a firm regulated by the Central Bank, the resulting investigation can be focused and effective.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill serves as a clear declaration of the standards of behaviour expected of those working in the financial services industry, providing conduct standards for regulated financial services providers, RFSPs, and individuals performing related functions and providing for the sanctioning of individuals who breach these responsibilities.  The conduct standards are, in and of themselves, unremarkable.  They outline the expectations of financial sector executives to act with honesty and integrity, due skill, care and diligence, to co-operate with the regulator, to treat customers fairly and to comply with standards of market conduct.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill's provisions also serve as an additional enforcement tool for the Central Bank of Ireland.  While the enforcement and penalty decisions of the bank will continue to be guided by considerations of fairness and proportionality, the Bill will introduce enhancements to the Central Bank's existing supervisory and enforcement frameworks.  There will be changes to the administrative sanctions procedure under Part IIIC of the Central Bank Act 1942 and to the fitness and probity regime under Part 3 of the Central Bank Reform Act 2010.  The fitness and probity regime will be extended to cover various categories of financial holding companies.  To facilitate holding individuals accountable for their actions, the Bill will break the existing participation link which requires wrongdoing by a firm to be demonstrated before enforcement action can be taken against an individual person in the management of that particular firm.<\/p> <p>In addition to the elements of the individual accountability framework, the Bill also provides an opportunity to review the Central Bank's processes in light of the Supreme Court's decision in the case of Zalewski <i>v<\/i>. Adjudication Officers and others.  The changes included in the Bill will ensure these processes conform to the standards of fairness required by the Constitution in the administration of justice and provide for enhanced oversight by the High Court.  Given that the Central Bank's enforcement powers will be extended to a wider cohort, including more junior members of staff, due regard has to be given to the constitutional rights of all concerned in preparing the Bill for publication.  The complexity of certain elements of the Bill is necessary to achieve this important objective and to include appropriate safeguards.<br\/><br\/>Much of the detail of the individual accountability framework, including the initial scope of the SEAR, will be included in the Central Bank regulations.  Ahead of making these regulations, the Central Bank intends to conduct a comprehensive consultation exercise.  I strongly urge all industry participants to engage constructively with this consultation process.  Before the main provisions of the Bill are outlined, I will take this opportunity to flag the Minister's intention to propose a number of minor amendments on Committee Stage.<br\/><br\/>Under the relevant European treaty provisions, the European Central Bank, ECB, must be consulted on proposed legislative changes affecting national central banks.  The ECB published a positive opinion on the Bill on 13 September in which it stated that it &quot;strongly welcomes the measures envisaged by the draft law regarding the individual responsibilities of senior persons, including management board members and key function holders.&quot;  The ECB observed that in its opinion, &quot;cultural failings within the banking sector were considered to be a significant contributory factor in Ireland's financial crisis&quot; and &quot;weaknesses in risk culture are often considered a root cause of the global financial crisis.&quot;  In addition to strongly welcoming the Bill, the ECB made a number of suggestions on how it believes the Bill might be improved.  Where a change to the text of the Bill is necessary, the Minister intends to address this on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800040#NN01100","speaker":"1590","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666120200,"counter":400,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Domestic Electricity and Gas Disconnections: Motion [Private Members]","time":1666120200,"counter":401,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800041#OO00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1666120200,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:  \tnotes: <blockquote> \t&mdash; that the latest round of energy price hikes announced by energy providers is putting severe financial pressure on people;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that households are facing extraordinary costs to light and heat their homes this winter, and will need equivalent support from the Government and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) during this time;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that, in the first half of 2022, there were 712 domestic electricity and 309 domestic gas disconnections due to non-payment of account;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that there are 260,000 residential electricity pre-pay customers and 118,000 residential pre-pay gas customers;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the lack of research and monitoring into so called &quot;self-disconnections&quot;, and into the number of people who are disconnected from pre-pay meters;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that Sinn F&eacute;in's Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (Prohibition of Winter Disconnections) Bill 2021 sought to extend the moratorium on disconnections to run over the entire Fuel Allowance season, to give financially struggling households assurance that they will not be left in the cold and dark during the winter months;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that the Government delayed the second reading of the Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (Prohibition of Winter Disconnections) Bill 2021 by 12 months; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the CRU confirmation, at the meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Environment and Climate Action, that they lack the legislative remit to regulate standing charges on utility bills; <\/blockquote>acknowledges  <blockquote> \t&mdash;  that households need financial and regulatory support during this energy price crisis, not the threat of disconnections hanging over them;<br \/><br \/>condemns <br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government's failure to put in place a protection from disconnections for those who use pre-pay meters; and <\/blockquote>calls for: <blockquote> \t&mdash; a moratorium on disconnections to be immediately put in place for all households until the end of the Fuel Allowance season;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the friendly credit on pre-pay meters to be extended for the duration of the ban on disconnections to give pre-pay meter households the same protection from disconnections as other households;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; legislation to be introduced to give the CRU<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>powers to regulate standing charges on energy bills;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government to reduce and cap the price of electricity bills at summer 2021 rates; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; a windfall solidarity tax to be introduced on the excess profits of energy companies. <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>  <p>This motion seeks to do a number of important things.  It seeks to extend the moratorium on electricity and gas disconnections to all customers from now until the end of the fuel allowance season, which is late March or early April.  A ban on disconnections is currently in place but it is far too limited.  It applies to self-identified and registered medically vulnerable bill-pay customers.  In other words, it applies to a subset, self-identified, of a subset, registered, of a subset, medically vulnerable, of a subset, bill-pay.  It was introduced on 1 October and runs until the end of the March.  It is far too limited in its scope.  For other bill-pay customers the ban on disconnection kicks in from 1 December and runs to the end of February.  That is an extremely limited three-month ban at a time when 581,000 people are living below the poverty line according to European Anti-Poverty Network, EAPN, Ireland.  This is also a time when up to 43% of people - which is a record, but a conservative estimate - are at risk of or living in energy poverty, according to the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI.  It is also a time when the Government&rsquo;s budget is failing to keep pace with the cost of living, according to the Vincentian research centre.  It is also a time when energy suppliers are disconnecting approximately 170 domestic gas and electricity customers every month.<\/p><p>In the case of pay-as-you-go customers, there is no ban on disconnections despite the Taoiseach&rsquo;s public comments, which gave rise to headlines such as &quot;Taoiseach confirms pay-as-you-go utility customers will not be disconnected if unable to top up&quot;, &quot;Taoiseach: no disconnections of pay-as-you-go energy users this winter&quot; and &quot;Pay-as-you-go energy customers will not be disconnected this winter &ndash; Taoiseach&quot;.  In the days and weeks that followed those statements, it became quite clear that the Taoiseach had no intention of delivering on that commitment.  Instead, people were told that there would be a &euro;10 extra emergency credit.  It has now increased to &euro;20.  Is that enough?  People were told to contact the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, or the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  In other words, they were told to make contact with charities.  That is not the answer.  People were told to go to the community welfare officer.  This shows just how out of touch this Government and its Ministers are.  In the first nine months of this year, the number of exceptional needs claims increased by 66,000, or 37%.  Claims are processed in weeks or months, not hours or even days.  That is most certainly not the answer.<\/p><p>We were told that the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, was meeting with all the energy suppliers and with the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU.  There was some indication that we would have movement.  Instead the Minister came away from those meetings and with a straight face went on national radio to tell us that pay-as-you-go is actually good for people.  <\/p> <p>Nothing was said about the rip-off tariffs that they are on, the rip-off standing charges being applied or the number of medically vulnerable people who are on pay-as-you-go meters and should be on bill pay and most certainly nothing was said about the need to extend the exact same protections and supports to pay-as-you-go customers as we have for bill-pay customers.  As we set out in our motion, it can and should be done through the extension of the so-called friendly credit and it should happen immediately.  The risk of disconnection from gas and electricity should be lifted from families.  It is a matter of the values that we, as a country, hold in this Republic.<\/p> <p> Our motion also calls for legislation to be introduced to give the CRU powers to regulate standing charges on energy bills.  We further call on the Government to reduce and cap the price of electricity bills at summer 2021 rates and to introduce a windfall and solidarity tax on the excess profits of energy companies.<\/p> <p> This is a time of extreme crises &ndash; an energy crisis and a cost-of-living crisis.  The State needs to stretch itself.  This Government took the recommendations at face value from the CRU and did nothing with them.  They should have been stress tested and challenged.  That organisation does not hold up well in the current climate.  They should have been challenged and extended.  Sinn F&eacute;in has a suite of proposals that the Minister needs to take and implement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800041#OO00500","speaker":"1507","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666120800,"counter":404,"content":"<p>Workers and families are facing a cost-of-living crisis.

They are facing the stress of how they can keep on top of mounting bills, how they can heat their homes and how they can keep the lights on as we approach winter.  The Government has refused the opportunity to provide certainty to households with a cut and a cap on electricity bills over the winter months, which is a mistake that exposes families to high bills and further price hikes.<\/p>  <p>  At the same time, we know that households now face a threat of disconnections, with many already effectively self-disconnecting.  The Government&rsquo;s plan to introduce a disconnection ban from December to February falls short, with many requiring protection and support right here, right now.  The households that are using pre-pay meters are particularly vulnerable without greater security of direct debit contracts with their energy suppliers.  Once the &euro;20 emergency credit runs out, they are disconnected by default.  Many of them are already self-disconnecting.  They are rationing their use of energy with or without a choice.  They are turning down or off heating, despite the cold that is outside and inside, avoiding the use of essential appliances and skipping warm meals or showers, all to the detriment of their physical and mental health.  That is what is happening in the real world.<\/p>  <p>  In recent weeks and months, we have spoken and heard much about our national energy security, but we are also facing a crisis in household energy security - the ability of families to keep warm and have the basic essentials.  We need to deliver certainty to those families who use pre-pay meters.  This affects 378,000 households across the State, and many of them are in my own county of Donegal.  It is simply not good enough for the Government to wash its hands of this with no plan to protect those families and individuals from disconnection.  Earlier today we heard the Taoiseach say that allowing these individuals to build up debt is not the answer.  So what is the Government&rsquo;s answer?  Is it for the Government to turn off the gas and lights and leave them in the dark?  That is what it has done.

As the Minister knows, I represent one of those constituencies that has a larger than average percentage of households on low or very modest incomes.  I represent large urban areas where people are in poorly paid, precarious and part-time employment.  Many of those people do not get to choose the type of energy supply that they have because they live predominantly in the private rental sector.  That means they do not get to choose or control whether they pay with pre-pay meters or with a bill.<\/p> <p>These people are more likely to be at risk of poverty, including energy poverty, and least able to absorb the significant costs of which the Minister will be well aware, whether that is the cost of energy, food, fuel or rent.  I often wonder whether Government Ministers, many of whom do not have direct experience of the reality with which families such as those of whom I am speaking deal day to day, are fully cognisant of the exclusions that are included when they sit down to make laws and devise schemes.  That is why this is such an important motion.  The idea that the Government has designed a scheme that, in effect, ignores the needs of almost 400,000 households - some of the households that are most vulnerable to poverty, including energy poverty - is remarkable.  It is no surprise that Travellers are completely excluded from the measures the Government has taken today.  Due to the informal arrangements on many Traveller-specific accommodation sites, Travellers who most need this protection will not be able to avail of the discounts and protections on the bands.<\/p> <p> I urge the Minister to put party politics to one side and listen carefully to what many Members have to say but, more important, to think about the people who are not being protected by the measures he has introduced.  I urge him to go back to the drawing board, not only by supporting the motion but by revising the measures he has brought in, to ensure, in particular, that the families who need it most get the protection.  This week alone, I have dealt with two single parents, both of whom are in precarious part-time employment, desperately trying to do right by their children, and have experienced the threat of disconnection.

I think he was genuine in saying that, as if it would be news to people who live on low or fixed incomes.  Many of those people have already exhausted a large number of the options available to them, however, and they do not have weeks to wait for a community welfare officer to respond to them.  It is cruel and unfair to tell people who are afraid that they will be cold this week - not just in December but this week - that they will not be cut off, but then to be found wanting when the mechanism for ensuring that is requested.

There is a genuine need to protect people from this energy crisis, and those who are on prepay meters are among the most vulnerable in the State.

To his shame, the signature of the Minister was on that letter.  He then had the audacity to come before the House on several occasions to state that the Government could not take action at domestic level because it had to happen at EU level even though he had been part of the problem in terms of securing EU support for decoupling and price caps and windfall taxes on energy companies.<\/p><p>I commend Deputy O'Rourke on tabling the motion.

I appreciate their concern, which is all of our concern.  There is no monopoly in the House or within any party when it comes to care for our people.  We all share that.  The unprecedented rise in prices and what that may do to leave people in a position where they cannot pay their electricity bills and potentially face disconnection is an issue for all of us.  Clearly, the current situation we are witnessing in respect of significant increases in energy bills and the cost of living is a matter of serious concern.  The Government is keenly aware of the ongoing pressures this is placing on families and businesses and that is why a &euro;2.4 billion package of supports was implemented earlier this year and a package of once-off measures worth &euro;2.5 billion was included in the most recent budget.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to outline further global market developments that have affected these high Irish energy prices, which are the source of the problem.  I will outline what the Government is doing in providing significant supports for householders' energy costs, both through energy-efficiency and welfare supports, and then I will set out the functions of the regulator, the CRU, in respect of these matters, including its critical responsibilities for consumer protection.<\/p>  <p>  The increased cost of energy is an issue that is affecting not just Ireland but all EU member states.  Increased international gas prices as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine have had a serious knock-on effect on the market.  Domestic retail electricity prices and gas prices are now more than 80% higher than they were a year ago.  It is a matter of serious concern to the Government and to every Member that rising electricity and gas prices caused by these international conditions are putting increased pressure on consumers, particularly those in a more vulnerable economic position and at risk of energy poverty.  That is why I have been meeting with electricity and gas suppliers in recent weeks to convey a clear message in respect of the critical importance of doing everything we can to support financially vulnerable consumers through this time.  In response to rising electricity and gas prices in the European Union, the Commission has put in place a number of measures available to member states to mitigate the impact of those high prices on households and business.  The Council of energy ministers agreed a Council regulation on an emergency intervention to address these high prices at our meeting on 30 September.  The new EU emergency market intervention regulation consists of three main measures.<\/p> <p> The first is exceptional electricity demand reduction.  A mandatory 5% cut in electricity consumption during peak hours is being required.  This will require member states to identify the 10% of hours with the highest expected price and to take appropriate action to reduce demand during those hours.  The overall target is a 10% cut in total electricity demand until 31 March 2023 and the real benefit is that it lowers prices for all consumers.<\/p> <p> Second, a temporary revenue cap on inframarginal electricity producers has been agreed.  Power generation technologies with lower generation costs than natural gas, including renewables, nuclear and lignite, will have their revenues capped.  The surplus revenues will be collected by member states and used again to help reduce energy consumers&rsquo; bills.  There will also be a temporary solidarity contribution on excess profits generated from activities in the fossil fuel sector.  These two measures, we believe, can raise up to &euro;2 billion, depending on what the price of energy is, which again we can use to help protect our consumers.  That is what we are doing.<\/p> <p> Member states also agreed to set a mandatory temporary solidarity contribution on the profits of business activities in this crude oil and petroleum natural gas sector.  We will use those proceeds, as I said, to help consumers and intensive work is now underway to implement these measures.<\/p> <p> The best long-term approach for Ireland is also to insulate consumers from volatility on international wholesale energy markets by investing in energy efficiency and renewable energy, expanding the interconnection with the European neighbourhood markets and to deepen the Internal Market in energy.<\/p> <p> On the overall cost of living, it is vital to stress that a co-ordinated whole-of-government approach is being followed and is essential in tackling the issue.  The forthcoming energy poverty action plan will set out a range of measures to be implemented this winter, as well as key longer-term measures to ensure that those least able to afford increased energy costs are supported and protected.  This work is being undertaken by a steering group consisting of relevant Government Departments and agencies.  Their work also includes interaction with the NGO sector which has real expertise in this area.<\/p> <p> In response to rising energy prices, the Government has already taken action throughout this year.  As I said earlier, it introduced measures worth &euro;2.4 billion to assist householders with their energy costs, and a further &euro;2.5 billion in the recent budget.  The budget package includes a new electricity cost emergency benefit scheme which this House passed in the past week and is now being signed into law by the President.<\/p> <p> The scheme will credit &euro;550.47, exclusive of VAT, to each domestic electricity account in three payments of &euro;183.49 in each of the following billing periods: early November, January to February 2023 and March to April 2023.  The estimated cost, which was approved by the Oireachtas committee today in our Supplementary Estimate, is &euro;1.211 billion.  The scheme will apply to domestic electricity accounts using their unique meter point reference number, MPRN, to allow the payment to be credited to individual bills automatically, without the need for application or approval, including pay-as-you-go meters.  The payments will therefore help both Bill Pay and pay-as-you-go customers with their electricity costs.<\/p> <p> The measures introduced in budget 2023 also include a &euro;400 lump sum to fuel allowance recipients, in addition to the payment of &euro;33 per week for 28 weeks, which is a total of &euro;924 each year.<\/p> <p> There is a &euro;200 lump sum payment for pensioners and people with disability who receive the living alone allowance.  There is also a &euro;500 cost-of-living lump sum payment to all families receiving the working family payment.<\/p> <p> There is then the double payment of child benefit to support all families with children, together with a &euro;500 cost-of-living payment for people receiving the carers&rsquo; support grant which will be paid in November.<\/p> <p> A further &euro;500 lump sum cost-of-living disability support grant is to be paid to all people receiving a long-term disability payment.<\/p> <p> There is also a &euro;500 rent tax credit to those tenants who are in their own accommodation.<\/p> <p> These measures are in addition to Government supports such as the household benefits package, which consists of a set of allowances which help with the costs of running a household.  These include allowances towards covering electricity or gas costs where recipients are paid &euro;35 per month.<\/p> <p> Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a special heating supplement may be paid to assist people in certain circumstances.  Exceptional needs payments can be made to help meet an essential once-off cost where an applicant is unable to meet it from his or her own resources.<\/p> <p> Throughout this year the Government has taken action in response to these crises.  The electricity cost emergency benefit payment, which saw 99% of domestic electricity accounts being credited with the payments I mentioned earlier, came at a cost already of &euro;377.  This was part of a &euro;505 million package of measures put in place to address the increasing costs of living, including increases in fuel allowance.  There is a further reduction in VAT on electricity and gas bills from 13.5% to 9% and a &euro;320 million measure was introduced to reduce excise duties temporarily on petrol.<\/p> <p> As part of its statutory role, the CRU has consumer protection functions which include, for example, developing codes of practice and setting out consumer rights which are set out in the suppliers' handbook.  This includes ensuring compliance with the obligation on suppliers set out in the handbook.<\/p> <p> As part of Responses 6 and 7 under the National Energy Security Framework, the CRU has strengthened consumer protection measures, including an extension of moratoriums on disconnections which will be extended for all domestic customers from 1 December 2022 until 28 February 2023, and for vulnerable customers from 1 October 2022 to 31 March 2023.  There will be extended debt repayment periods.  From 1 November, debt repayment periods will be extended to allow a minimum of 24 months for customers to repay debt and customers can pay debt more quickly, if that is what they prefer.<\/p> <p> There will be a reduced debt burden on pay-as-you-go top-ups.  New measures will mean that the debt repayment levels will reduce to 10% from the previous 25% on pay-as-you-go customer top-up payments.  On a &euro;20 top-up, for example, only &euro;2 will go towards debt repayment if it exists, rather than the &euro;5 previously.<\/p> <p> Better value for those in financial hardship meters will also be introduced.  All customers with a financial hardship meter will be placed on the lowest cost tariff.  This includes a tariff which might otherwise be available, for example, for a new customer or on a retention offer.  The customer in financial hardship must be placed on whichever tariff is the cheapest tariff available from 1 December.<\/p> <p> There will also be the promotion of a vulnerable customer register and additional plans for suppliers.  I regret that I do not have time to list the full range of measures but this Government is completely committed to help our most stressed consumers through this energy crisis.  We will do that through these and other measures to be introduced in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800043#QQ00400","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666122000,"counter":413,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  The Minister began his contribution by saying that nobody in this House had a monopoly on caring.  Surely, if this Government cared, the one most basic thing it would do is to ensure that a ban on disconnections is introduced in the State as a very basic measure to show that this Government cares as people face into an unprecedented winter in many cases.  I find it quite incredible that in the midst of one of the greatest energy crisis that many of us will have seen and lived through, that it is up to the Opposition to bring forward a motion to seek action from the Government for basic protections for households.  I say basic because we are talking about households having electricity and heating.<\/p>  <p>  The asks in our motion are the difference between being able to turn on the lights or to be in the dark, or being able to turn on the heating or being cold in one&rsquo;s own home.  Earlier this month, which has been referred to earlier, the Taoiseach committed that the Government will not allow people on pay-as-you-go energy meters to be disconnected over the winter.  This was a big and welcome commitment but there has been no action from Government to date to make that happen.  These are just words.<\/p>  <p>  The planned ban on disconnection from 1 December is too late.  We have already seen over 1,000 domestic disconnections in the first half of this year alone and that is before we even come to the winter period and to the worst that is to come in the energy crisis.  The message from the Government, despite all of that, is to wait.  I have to make this point, and I have made it many times, that the solution is not additional needs payments through the Department of Social Protection.  That is an assistance, is one assistance for people, and one may get it or may not.  In the past month, I received a reply from the Department to tell me that 95% of additional needs payments applications were being finalised within five to eight weeks.  Can you imagine having to wait two months for a payment from the Department of Social Protection if one has a utility bill?  Only now is recruitment being looked at.<\/p> <p>Community welfare officers are being centralised and people cannot walk in as they could before.  I raised the need to put the application form online in July and that is still being examined by the Department.

Surely we can all agree on that in the House.  The Minister believes that the proposals he is putting forward are sufficient.  The argument we are putting forward from this side of the House is that they are not and that he is not doing enough.  Many workers and their families are left wondering how they are going to afford the bills that keep coming into their homes.  Other Deputies will speak about their constituencies.  If the Minister wants to come to my area, I can bring him to shopping centres where there are elderly people tonight, sitting in the shopping centres because they cannot afford to put the heating on in their own home.  That is happening now, not in December or February, when we will be talking about disconnections.  The weather in Ireland does not get warmer at the end of February.  We are arguing that this should at least be extended until March.  I ask the Minister to look at this and to show some heart to those families.<\/p>  <p>  The other big issue is that we are talking about people being disconnected.  We need to look at ways of stopping that.  There are simple measures and, for example, the Minister could extend this for another month, which would have a huge impact on many families.  Households need assurances and, again, that was the difference between ourselves and the Government in regard to the budget.  We are arguing that energy assurances need to be given to people but the Government argues that this route is better.  People will get some increases, such as social welfare increases and so on, but is it going to be enough?  I would argue it is not enough for ordinary families.  It is probably not the whole population, but a sizeable number of people are vulnerable and they are going to be more vulnerable as these prices increase.  I again ask the Minister to think on his position when the vote comes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800045#SS00200","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1666122600,"counter":416,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Rourke for tabling the motion.  The main focus is on prepay customers.  I do not know if the Government, including the Minister, understands the situation those prepay customers are in.  First, I believe the prepay situation is a total scam.  Most people are made to go into it if they have fallen into arrears and they are told this is a better way of managing their budget and their money, but it is not.<\/p>  <p>  I want to focus on children because we are going to have children not just going hungry, but cold, going to school the following day having had inadequate sleep, with inadequate supports in trying to get homework done and with inadequate food.  On occasion, we talk in the D&aacute;il about child poverty and every Member seems to get up and say it is something he or she wants to eradicate, yet we have systems that continuously fail children.  That goes to the heart of this issue, in that we are continuously failing children who are some of the most vulnerable in our society and who do not necessarily have a voice for themselves.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that the issue of prepay customers is dealt with.  It is totally unfair to exclude people just because they are on a prepay metering system.  I do not understand how anybody thinks that is a good system and people should not be encouraged into it.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the exceptional needs payment.  I am sick of hearing about this from the Government and even in advertisements.  I cannot think of one person coming to my office who has applied for this payment and received it in the past few months.  If they are on any sort of income, even a low income, they seem to be disqualified from it.  That is apart from the fact there are huge waiting lists and it takes approximately five to nine weeks, as Deputy Kerrane said, which is totally inadequate for an emergency payment.  The idea of it being an emergency is that people cannot wait for it.  However, they are not even qualifying for it.  That is not the solution.  It particularly annoys me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800045#SS00300","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1666122600,"counter":417,"content":"<p>I am disappointed that the Minister, Deputy Ryan, has left because there is an issue I want to raise with him.  I have raised it with the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, and my colleagues have referred to it on a number of occasions.  That is the issue of the community welfare officer and the exceptional needs payment, which simply is not working.  We cannot put on a radio or television programme or D&aacute;il debate without hearing Government Ministers, Deputies or Senators telling people that if they are stuck with a bill, they should go to the community welfare officer for an exceptional needs payment.  There is a ten-week wait for the community welfare officer in my local area.  The staff there are working very hard but there is a ten-week wait for it.  Across the State, according to the reply to a parliamentary question I received from the Minister, in the first four months of this year 1,001 people got payments towards their household bills, which included heating bills.  It is simply not working and is simply not an option for most people.<\/p>  <p>  I commend Deputy O'Rourke on tabling the motion and on all the work he has done on this issue in recent months, particularly since he was appointed our spokesperson.  I commend those who are helping people in huge stress.  The Government does not realise the stress and fear that many people are under.  My local community centre stays open later and dinners do not finish until 5 p.m.  People sit in the room because the heating is on and they do not want to go home because they do not want to heat up their own home as they are afraid of the bill.  We have not hit the peak of winter yet so people are very concerned.<\/p>  <p>  In the past 18 months, a litany of price hikes has been announced by energy companies.  The hikes included in the latest tranche have put immense pressure on households up and down the country.  Families are having to make unenviable choices when it comes to how to spend the money.  There is no doubt we are in a cost-of-living crisis but there is a need for the Government to intervene to protect our citizens.  I urge the Government to take the steps outlined during the debate to protect households from electricity and gas disconnections this winter.  There is a serious worry among people, especially those who live in flat complexes, those renting privately and those on pay-as-you-go meters.  There is no clarity as to what is going to happen, whether they are going to be disconnected and the choices they will have to make.  What do people do if they are disconnected and cannot cook their food?

The principle is irrefutable: no one should be left unable to heat their home or run their fridge or other appliances because they cannot afford to pay.  If there is consensus on that matter as we enter into this bleak winter ahead, then the Government has the task of examining every mechanism available to it to fulfil its responsibility to struggling households and families.  The Government has to intervene in the market when the market is failing to ensure that people will have the security this winter that they need.  The motion contains a variety of measures that may help.  Many are policies that have been proposed by Labour and by many of us in opposition.  The principle remains, however, that no one should go cold or hungry this winter because they are unable to pay.  Yet, we know that at present the cost-of-living crisis and a real fear about rising energy bills are forcing many people to take impossible decisions between heating and eating, and putting so many individuals and households in fear.<\/p>  <p>  In June this year, ESRI data revealed that energy inflation had increased the number of households in energy poverty to 29%, the highest recorded rate, with a concern that this will increase further over the winter months.  Within that study, there was certainly an acknowledgement that some of the measures that have been put in place, such as household electricity credits, can help to keep people out of energy poverty, but these measures are insufficient on their own and more targeted measures are also needed.  As we have seen from the hike in standing charges, certain measures are needed to ensure that the credits are not absorbed by further price increases, which is the real concern.<\/p>  <p>  We often talk about the energy crisis and the cost-of-living crisis as short-term, immediate problems that have come upon us this year, exacerbated by Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine.  Certainly, the brutal war that Russia is waging in Ukraine has exacerbated things.<\/p><p><i>8 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>However, the effects of the crises are long lasting and their roots have existed for a long time, particularly the Government's failure to deliver a sufficient supply of housing.  We welcome the winter eviction ban that was announced today.  Indeed, the Minister of State welcomed it in advance of its announcement by the Government.<\/p> <p> Research published this week by the ESRI and Pobal showed a strong relationship between financial difficulties in childhood and adulthood.  This is about the long-lasting effects of energy poverty and poverty more generally.  According to the study, 39% of adults whose childhood circumstances were bad or very bad were materially deprived in 2019 compared with just 10% of those whose circumstances had been good or very good.  Childhood financial circumstances influence later outcomes, suggesting that longer lasting supports are needed to mitigate the negative effects on health of poverty throughout life.  School closures during the pandemic exacerbated pre-existing inequalities among children.  It is imperative that we address the long-term impacts created by the cost-of-living crisis and the energy crisis.  Stemming the effects of fuel poverty must be a serious imperative for the Government.  Keeping families out of darkness is itself a targeted measure.<\/p> <p> I will address a number of the specific measures in the motion and elsewhere.  I welcome the motion's provision on the introduction of a windfall tax.  We in Labour have pushed for this for some time.  I welcome the recent intervention by the Minister of State's Green Party colleague, Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe, in the European Parliament when he called for the long-overdue introduction of such a measure at EU level.  However, I question the Government's strategy of appearing to wait and see what happens in Europe.  We could do more domestically.  Labour led the way much earlier this year when calling for a windfall tax on the profits of energy companies to be introduced in this country.  We could have taken action then and a measure could have been adopted that would have provided real help.  Last week, I restated my frustration at the Government's insistence that it could not do anything nationally and was awaiting developments at EU level.  In response to a question I tabled during Thursday's Leaders' Questions, it was welcome to hear the T&aacute;naiste's apparent commitment to introducing a windfall tax.  He certainly made reference to the Government's intention to introduce such a tax but could not give me any indication of the timeline of its introduction.  That prevarication has also been applied to standing charges.  It is difficult to comprehend why energy companies' profits and policies regarding standing charges are apparently untouchable by the Government.  We would push for more concerted action on both by the Government domestically instead of waiting on EU developments.<\/p> <p> I will make a similar point concerning another matter that we have raised with the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste a number of times, that being, the need to examine taking the Corrib gas field into State ownership as one way of bringing about reduced energy costs for households.  The Taoiseach indicated to me that he did not believe it was in the Government's gift to do so.  As I pointed out to him, though, existing statutory powers under the Fuels (Control of Supplies) Acts, 1971 and 1982, countenance this measure being taken.  Fianna F&aacute;il previously used these powers in government.  There is no limit; the restriction is not a legal one.  This is within the Government's power and it is time for radical action.  The Corrib gas field is an indigenous supplier of energy, providing for approximately 25% of Ireland's gas needs.  There is no reason the cost of Corrib gas increased, given that it is being produced here.  Emergency times call for emergency measures.  We need to take more radical and creative measures concerning what is an indigenous source of gas.  The owner of Corrib, Vermilion Energy, saw revenues increase last year by 267%.  It will undoubtedly make exceptional profits this year.  The Government should and must consider nationalising Corrib on a temporary basis to help to give households greater certainty on heating bills for the winter ahead.<\/p> <p> We have sought the Government's introduction of a cap on energy prices.  We acknowledge that designing and costing such a measure is complex and that there are a number of different ways to go about introducing it.  In our alternative budget, Labour allocated &euro;2.1 billion to support such a measure because a cap would ensure that all sectors of society benefited from lower energy prices.  We have seen other member states taking national action while awaiting an EU-wide initiative, which would itself be welcome.  Spain and Portugal produced a model whereby they limited the price of gas and electricity production, reducing consumer bills by between 15% and 20%.  This so-called Iberian model was the subject of some debate at an emergency meeting of energy ministers from EU member states last month, but it was also the subject of debate in Berlin last weekend where I had the honour of representing Labour at the Party of European Socialists' annual congress in Berlin.  I was glad to engage there with the Prime Minister of Spain, Dr. Pedro S&aacute;nchez, and the Prime Minister of Portugal, Mr. Ant&oacute;nio Costa, both socialist prime ministers who have led the way on adopting what they call an Iberian model of an energy price cap.  This model, which was brought forward by our sister social democratic parties in Spain and Portugal, has shown the sort of proactive measures that left-wing governments can take, and have taken, to protect their citizens from the fallout of Putin's brutal war on Ukraine.  At the very least, the Government should pursue some part of this measure at domestic level.  For example, domestic electricity credits could feature clawback mechanisms to enable them to be more targeted, such as the withdrawal of income tax credits from those earning more than &euro;100,000.  This is something that my colleague, Deputy Nash, has proposed.  A levy equivalent to the electricity credit and modelled on the non-principal private residence charge could also be applied to holiday homes and vacant housing to avoid those with multiple properties benefiting disproportionately.<\/p> <p> We need to see more data on self-imposed cut-offs for households that use prepay meters.  We are all conscious that these households and families are among the most vulnerable in the face of the cost-of-living crisis.<\/p> <p> In the brief time I have left, I wish to mention specific issues relating to those in rental accommodation.  Last week, Labour attempted to amend the Government's electricity credit Bill to provide better supports for tenants in rented accommodation who paid their landlords directly for their electricity instead of paying their electricity providers.  It was acknowledged by the Government that this was an issue, albeit for a relatively small number of renters.  We sought to ensure that renters would be assured of having the benefit of the credit passed on by their landlords.  Currently, if the landlord pays the bill, it will be up to him or her whether to pass on the benefit, as was the case with the previous electricity credit.  I ask that the Government review once again how best to ensure that renters receive the full sum of the credit owed to them.<\/p> <p> I wish to discuss district heating.  The issue of energy security is significant for those in apartments and complexes that are heated through a shared or district heating system.  These individuals are being hit with extortionate price increases because the supplier is the purchaser of the fuel and is charging a commercial tariff.  Tenants and homeowners in such complexes have no choice of supplier and I am hearing that many of them are seeing price rises of up to 600%, which is not sustainable.  These people and households need targeted supports.  In particular, those with district heating systems need a gas price cap now.  I reiterate my call on the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications &ndash; I am asking the Minister of State to raise it with him &ndash; to raise this matter at EU level, where there are ongoing discussions about a Europe-wide cap.<\/p> <p> I am glad to have had the opportunity to propose constructive measures to tackle the energy crisis and I look forward to the Minister of State's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800045#SS00600","speaker":"1698","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666123200,"counter":421,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Rourke for tabling this important and timely motion.  The Government's refusal to extend the moratorium on disconnections to households with prepay meters typifies its cavalier approach to this unprecedented crisis.  When this issue arose a number of weeks ago, the Government appeared taken aback.  The Taoiseach had done an interview at the weekend in which he gave a solemn commitment that no one would be disconnected this winter.  There was no equivocation, no caveat.  There was no room for confusion.  The Taoiseach was clear, and I will quote him.  He stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn an energy crisis of this kind we cannot have disconnections.  We are very clear about that.  We don't want people disconnected, particularly vulnerable people and people who will find it difficult in terms of meeting their bills. <\/blockquote>  <p>Those were his words.  That was the commitment, and many vulnerable people took great comfort from it.  After all, people have an expectation that the Taoiseach will live up to his public promises, particularly on a matter as important as this.<\/p><p>That commitment was given on Sunday, 2 October, but it did not even last a day.  Since then, the Taoiseach and the rest of the Government have been furiously backtracking.  They cite a moratorium on disconnections for bill pay customers, which we all welcome, but shrug their shoulders when it comes to pay-as-you-go customers.  In fact, the very notion of a moratorium on disconnections for those with prepay meters came as something of a shock when the issue was raised.  When Ministers spoke about a moratorium on disconnections, they forgot a significant group.  The 260,000 households with pay-as-you-go meters did not even seem to have occurred to the Government.  They did not feature in its plans at all.<\/p> <p>I believe a commitment was given in good faith that nobody would be disconnected this winter.  The Government then realised, however, that it had completely forgotten about pay-as-you-go customers and then decided quickly that it was too awkward to extend this promise to them.  We have been told it is too hard and too complicated to sort this matter out.  It is not, however.  That simply cannot be.  The Opposition has made many suggestions regarding how this could be done.  The reality is that if this was a priority for the Government, it simply would be done.  The truth is that if protecting people from the worst excesses of the energy crisis was a priority for the Government, an extension to the moratorium to these 260,000 households would have been planned and completed long ago.<\/p> <p> We all know these customers are among the most vulnerable.  These are people who, in the main, do not have the resources to pay large bills every two months.  For this, they pay a premium.  Prepay energy costs are generally more expensive than other forms of energy bills.  We should know this, and if we do not, this is because being poor in this country is extortionately expensive.  When people do not have money, their choices are restricted.  It is necessary for them to make decisions that seem attractive in the short term, but these choices tend to be more expensive in the long run.  These add to the high cost of being poor and this leads to a cycle of poverty that is exceptionally difficult to break.  One in six people is now experiencing this.  Those with prepaid meters who have been trying to manage their already meagre budgets are extremely vulnerable to energy poverty.  Week after week, they scrimp and save to try to keep their readers topped up.  The huge increases in the cost of electricity, however, mean they often simply cannot keep up with the costs.  When their credits run out, their energy runs out.  If they press a bill, they get an extra &euro;5, but if they do not have &euro;10 on top of that, their energy runs out.  They are then left in the cold and dark, unable to cook a meal or have a shower.  Let us imagine a family in this position.  Children will be cold and hungry because the heat cannot go on and a hot meal cannot be cooked.  Imagine how hard it is to be a parent in this situation, wishing there was an extra &euro;10 just to keep the lights on for at least another day.<\/p> <p> The Government had a chance to make a real difference in the lives of people who have been struggling.  It could have given them a commitment, one which has already been extended to every other energy customer, that they would not be cut off this winter.  Not only has the Government refused to do this, but it also announced that thoughtlessly-made commitment and then casually broke it the same day.  Tinkering around the edges with this issue does not amount to a moratorium.  It will not relieve people of the anxiety and stress they are feeling in wondering how they are going to keep the lights on.<\/p> <p> Energy is not the only cost that is going up.  In the newspapers today, we read that the costs of food will increase by more than &euro;800 this year.  We all know about the crippling costs of rent, with rising mortgage interest rates also increasing the burden of mortgage repayments.  Energy, like housing, is a human right.  We need it to survive.  In a wealthy country like ours, there is no reason for anybody, whether on a prepaid meter or not, to face a dark winter.  It is immoral and obscene that this is happening.  It is, therefore, something that can and simply must be resolved.<\/p> <p> Why is it that the Government seems only incapable of targeting its resources at those who need them most?  Prior to the budget, 90% of the cost-of-living measures introduced were not targeted.  This is a truly incredible statistic when all the expert advice from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, the Central Bank, the ESRI and others has been that supports must be targeted.  In the budget, the Government performed slightly better in that 50% of those measures were targeted.  Those supports were welcome, but they do not go far enough.  Given the scale of the crisis, one-off payments simply will not last.  The failure to adequately raise core social welfare rates will mean that many people will be worse off next year than they have been this year.  This is the reality.<\/p> <p> How can the Minister stand over a situation in which every Deputy, including highly paid Ministers like him, will receive &euro;600 in electricity credits in the months to come?  Is he really going to tell me that people on salaries of more than &euro;100,000 need this support when one in six people is living in poverty?  This is especially egregious when, under the Minister's watch, it is inevitable that people on prepay meters will be cut off.  This can be called \"self-disconnection\" if the Minister wishes, but that would be a complete distortion.  \"Self-disconnection\" is a cruel and unjust term.  It is not an autonomous decision that people will make willingly.  It will be forced on them because of high costs and poverty.  These people do not have a choice.  The Minister and his Government do have a choice.  They could make a change this week and announce a genuine moratorium on disconnections which would apply to every household.  As matters stand, it is perverse that those excluded from this moratorium are among the most vulnerable and most at risk from energy poverty.  It is not right, and every one of us here and every member of the Government knows it.<\/p> <p> I could raise many other issues but I am focusing on this issue and imploring the Minister to change his approach.  We simply must protect the most vulnerable.  This must be the overriding concern of every Deputy in this House.  Otherwise, what is our function?  We know the State has the power to act in a decisive manner when it really wants to and when it feels the gravity of the situation demands it.  There are so many circumstances, for example, the Covid-19 pandemic, that we simply cannot unsee.  This is another such circumstance and we are running out of time to act.  A moratorium on disconnections that excludes 260,000 households with pay-as-you-go electricity meters is simply not a blanket moratorium on disconnections.  These people must not be abandoned this winter.  The moratorium must be extended in a meaningful way to these households.  The most vulnerable in our society cannot be allowed to bear the brunt of this energy crisis.  I implore the Minister to change tack.  Some 260,000 people cannot be left at risk of their lights going out this winter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800046#TT00200","speaker":"1560","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666123800,"counter":423,"content":"<p>We move to the People Before Profit-Solidarity group.

Effectively, he said \"No\".  That question and answer opened this controversy and 19 days later the Government has failed to put the issue to bed.  The Taoiseach said at first that people should engage with the Department of Social Protection.  Ministers then started saying that people should engage with their energy providers.  One energy provider, Electric Ireland, came before an Oireachtas joint committee and informed its members that it had a hardship fund of &euro;3 million.  The entity was roundly criticised, and rightly so, for having such a relatively small sum in that fund.  How much money do the private energy companies have in their hardship funds?<\/p>  <p>  On Wednesday, 12 October, I submitted a parliamentary question to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who has responsibility for energy.  I asked him to provide me with information as to the amounts in the hardship funds of each of the gas and electricity utility companies.  The Minister replied that: \"I am aware that electricity and gas suppliers have set up hardship funds which provide exceptional financial support to those in need\".  In his reply, however, he did not answer the question as to how much money is in each of these funds.  Is it &euro;3 million or is it &euro;5?  We are none the wiser.  There was not a word from the Minister on this issue.  Why?<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is engaged, he tells us, in a round of consultations with the energy providers.  Has he even bothered to ask them this question?  Do all these companies have hardship funds?  The PrepayPower website, for example, makes no reference whatsoever to one.  I am, therefore, asking the Minister whether this company has a hardship fund.  When he met its representatives, did he even ask if it had one?  We should be told.  I want to know and members of the public want to know.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has created quite a contradiction for itself today by now supporting a winter evictions ban but not supporting an across-the-board winter disconnections ban.

What have we got so far from the Government?  We have got a lot of spin, yielding some false headlines and false hope for people on prepay meters.  These include headlines stating that the Taoiseach had reassured prepay customers they would not be disconnected this winter.  When it comes to action to protect the 340,000 households on electricity prepay meters and the tens of thousands of others on gas prepay meters we have got nothing.  The Government says it will not oppose the motion, so the D&aacute;il will say these people should be protected from disconnections.  I am sorry to say, though, that this will not protect people from disconnections.  The Government has refused to take the simple actions it needs to take to stop the disconnections of prepay customers this winter.  Those actions are to extend emergency credit and remove the exit fees to transfer from the prepay power companies to other companies.  As matters stand, people will be disconnected this winter and that will be on the Government.<\/p>  <p>  The awful phrase of self-disconnections is being used.  This is the idea that people are somehow choosing to disconnect by running out of money.  As a result of the cost-of-living and housing crises, they are not able to put any more money in their meters to pay for electricity or heat so the heat is going out and the lights are going off.  It is not a choice in any sense.  I even had a case a couple of weeks ago of a woman who was not only self-disconnected but the company, PrepayPower, attempted to physically completely disconnect her gas supply.  She was informed she had been disconnected because she had not topped up her account in 180 days.  Even though there was credit on the account, the company attempted to disconnect Mary Byrne from Tallaght because she had not topped up or activated the account for 180 days.<\/p>  <p>  There will be more horror stories like this if the Government refuses to act.  Why does it refuse to act?  Is it the case that it just did not think about this?  I do not think so.  It is because it is utterly out of touch with the 340,000 households in question and utterly in touch with the demands and needs of the corporations.  These are predatory companies that prey on people and make huge money out of charging them extra because they are on prepay meters.  They effectively hold people hostage by charging massive exit fees.  The Government is simply doing what those companies want.  If it did what was necessary and got rid of the exit fees and the extended emergency credit, everyone would leave these companies and the Government simply does not want to do that.<\/p>  <p>  Who are these companies?  Three millionaires control the Irish prepay energy market.  Ulric Kenny and Andrew Collins are on the Irish rich list and own PrepayPower, while Pinergy is owned by multibillionaire Peter Coates, who has wealth of over &pound;8 billion.  These are the people who will determine if over 300,000 households will have electricity and gas to light and heat their homes this winter.  These companies operate with complicated fee and charging structures that lack transparency and are designed to trap people, for fear of triggering up to several hundred euro in exit fees if they try to leave.  This is the reality of the marketplace.  The Government accepts that the profits of these three people come before the heat and lighting needs of 500,000 people.  The predatory nature and impoverishing effects of capitalism are laid bare in the energy market that Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael worked so long and hard to deregulate and privatise in order that the rich get richer and the poor get cold.<\/p>  <p>  These prepay predators should be shut down and households should be moved to bill pay accounts as part of a nationalised and not-for-profit electricity system that puts the needs of the many before the profits of the few.  We need price controls, namely, maximum unit prices that should apply to prepay electricity, just as they apply to bill pay accounts.  This would stop the extortionate charges.  If there are price controls in place and these rich individuals are left in control of our energy market, their ongoing profiteering will have to be subsidised.  You cannot control what you do not own.  For this reason, we have to nationalise the energy industry.  We have to take it out of the hands of those who are running it in the interest of profit and instead run it for public need on a not-for-profit basis.  The climate crisis is too important and the cost-of-living crisis too severe for us to leave this in the hands of the market any longer.  We have to nationalise the energy system and use it to electrify everything in our economy that can be electrified, while simultaneously moving as rapidly and justly as possible to 100% renewable energy.  That will only be done on the basis of public ownership and democratic control that determines that this is a priority, even if nobody can make a profit from it.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the motion but I also call on Sinn F&eacute;in to join us in calling for nationalisation.  I call on Sinn F&eacute;in to state that if it leads the next Government, it will nationalise the energy system because it is what needs to be done.  That will add to the pressure on the Government to do what needs to happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800048#VV00100","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1666124400,"counter":428,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that the electricity credit announced in the budget will go some way towards helping families struggling to keep up with rocketing energy prices.  However, without a price cap the average energy bill has continued to rise, with some families stating it is like paying a second mortgage or double rent.  This is highly unsustainable.  Shortly after the budget announcement, electricity and gas suppliers announced additional price hikes, putting severe financial pressure on people.<\/p><p>In the first half of 2022, there were 712 domestic electricity and 309 domestic gas disconnections due to non-payment of accounts.  While the CRU has announced enhanced consumer protection measures for this winter, including an extension to moratoriums on disconnections from 1 December until 28 February, some of my constituents in Louth and east Meath have come to my clinic this week worried sick and asking if this can be implemented sooner as they cannot afford the significant increase in bills, on top of the inflated price of food.  While I acknowledge that, for vulnerable customers, the moratorium has been extended from 1 October to 31 March, I ask the Government to implement a one-rule-for-all approach to these extensions.  Everybody needs protection from disconnection as a matter of urgency.<\/p><p>With regard to people on pay-as-you-go energy meters, it seems the only offer being made is a reduction from 25% to 10% in the debt repayment suppliers can deduct from a pay-as-you-go top-up payment.  There is still a question over how the emergency payments are going to be paid to pay-as-you-go customers, given that the metering system cannot provide the data to identify these people.  There are approximately 346,000 households with prepaid electricity meters but because it is not possible to see when a pay-as-you-go customer's meter is running out, getting payments to these people quickly is a challenge.  While I acknowledge that there is a &euro;3 million hardship fund administered by MABS and St. Vincent De Paul to help households to top up their energy meters, this protective measure is insufficient.  Apart from the word of the Taoiseach that nobody will be disconnected, what guarantee do these customers have that they will not be disconnected this winter?<\/p><p>Another issue the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, raised last week is self-disconnections.  The PrepayPower website still states: &quot;If you do not keep your PPP PAYG Meter topped up with credit, it will self-disconnect and your electricity supply will cut off.&quot;  What will be done about these self-disconnections?  On vulnerable customers, the PrepayPower website states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe CRU has put in place a rule whereby [registered] Vulnerable Customers cannot be disconnected for non-payment of [arrears] during winter months.  [This applies to both gas and electricity.] It is important that all of our customers ... categorised as Vulnerable ... understand that this rule cannot apply to them whilst on our [pay-as-you-go] supply <\/blockquote>  <p>While the promotion of a vulnerable customer register is welcome, what burden is being placed on suppliers to actively promote the vulnerable customer register and the protections it offers from 1 November?  Will the CRU oversee this as well as the electricity credit scheme and, most important, does this apply to pay-as-you-go customers?  The Taoiseach affirmed that no vulnerable person would be disconnected this winter but there is evidently a mismatch between his definition of vulnerable and that of the CRU, which characterises vulnerable customers as having certain specific medical conditions.  I ask for clarity on that today.  Is it a medical vulnerability, vulnerability to poverty or both?<\/p><p>It must be remembered that behind every meter, whether pay-as-you-go or bill pay, are people.<\/p> <p>People are in a difficult place and we are crucifying people who are on pay-as-you-go plans.  We need to make sure that we look after them and that they have a proper Christmas.  I acknowledge that the Government and the CRU are planning on implementing the financial hardship meter.  This is a measure for those in financial hardship where households have opted for a pay-as-you-go meter to help to cut costs.  At present, suppliers are not required to place customers with a financial hardship meter on any discounted tariff.  From 1 December, all customers with a financial hardship meter are to be placed on the cheapest tariff available from their supplier.  Again, this measure is supportive but it needs to be implemented sooner than 1 December. <\/p> <p> As part of steps to protect households this winter, the CRU has also extended debt repayment periods up to 24 months.  However, given that the cost of living has only ramped up in the past 12 months, and with the war still ongoing, our low and middle income earners are being hit the hardest.  They cannot afford to buy food, never mind pay back debt.  This debt and the worry of paying it back were preventable.  The Government failed to decouple the link between gas prices and electricity prices and again refused to implement a price cap on electricity which would have prevented the rise in electricity bills.  This is just not good enough.<\/p> <p> Let us not forget that the electricity businesses are profiting from these vulnerable customers.  Electricity credits are ultimately a subsidy to energy companies.  They set the price and the Government subsidises households and businesses to pay that price.  There is no mention of a windfall tax for the energy companies.  There is no mention of price controls.  Instead, the energy companies can pocket these subsidies in the form of increased prices and profiteering, with no long-term guarantee.<\/p> <p> I have spoken to many business people in Dundalk over recent months and I have been flabbergasted at the cost increases they are facing.  Not all businesses will be able to sustain these increases in costs and they will eventually have to be passed onto the end users.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800048#VV00200","speaker":"1600","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666125000,"counter":430,"content":"<p>This energy crisis is devastating families and communities throughout the country at present.  We are months into the crisis and what we have seen from the Government so far is inertia and glacial steps.  The Government's response has been incredibly slow.  At the beginning of this month we saw energy prices increase again.  Electric Ireland increased prices for the third time this year and the fourth time in 12 months.  It increased bills by 26.7% and residential gas prices by 37.5%.  These are incredibly difficult increases.  Families are suffering as a direct result of the actions the Minister is taking.  What is happening is unprecedented.  Right now the country is in a situation where 40% of the population is in fuel poverty.  This is incredible.  A total of 70% of the population is likely to be in fuel poverty in the near future.  It is unprecedented that in a First World country in a western democracy, 70% of the population would be facing fuel poverty.  This is as a result of the direct actions the Government has taken.  It is responsible in large part for the damage being done to people in this country.<\/p>  <p>  Every day I listen to horrific heartbreaking stories of families in this crisis.  Families have to choose between heating or eating.  Families are not able to pay for the fuel that goes into their cars so they can get to work.  People are not able to cover the cost of keeping open the businesses in which they have invested their blood, sweat and tears.  We look at the devastating crisis these families and businesses are in and we contrast it with the level of the response of the Government.  It is incredible.<\/p>  <p>  I am a very strong believer that there is incompetency at the heart of this Administration.  I would not just level it at the Government.  I also include senior elements of the public service.  We have some of the slowest delivery of decisions and administration in the western world.  This country is like an oil tanker as it is so slow to change direction.  The Minister was smiling.  We delivered seven offshore wind turbines in 20 years.  This is an incredibly low figure for any country that greenwashes itself on a regular basis with photographs, glossy brochures and launches of green projects.  We were the last country in Europe to introduce a feed-in tariff for the microgeneration of electricity.  In the North of Ireland roofs were festooned with solar panels ten years ago.  Some families still have not achieved a feed-in tariff..  If shutting stations such as Lanesborough and Shannonbridge in the teeth of this type of crisis does not shout incompetency, what does?  We are the only country in Europe without a gas reserve.  This is as a direct result of a decision made by the Government.<\/p>  <p>  Originally I felt that perhaps these were contributing factors to the Government's inability to deal with the crisis we are in, but I have to say I am coming to the view that it is not by accident that prices are being kept high.  It is by design of the Government in large part that prices are being left high.  This is because high electricity prices achieve two policy objectives for the Government.  First, given that we have a grid working at the edge of blackouts, high prices prevent demand and this protects the grid from the excessive demand that could lead to blackouts.  Second, high prices reduce the level of energy consumed and this lowers emissions, which is another policy objective.  I accept that the Government has provided electricity credits but it has done sweet damn all on reducing the price of fuel and electricity.  The Government can do this.  It is in its gift but it is refusing to do so.  This is a damning aspect of the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800049#WW00200","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1666125000,"counter":431,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for tabling the motion.

They would rather people die of the cold at home.  It is very important to lay down a marker that people will have energy security and that their lights or heat will not be turned off.

We find ourselves in astonishing situations.  We are in a crisis and &euro;200 this year will not scratch the surface for the ordinary mother and father, the same people who are being bled dry at the filling station day in, day out, due to greedy Government taxes on diesel and petrol.  The price of diesel is &euro;2.05 per litre in filling stations because the Government gave no help to hard-pressed motorists in the last budget.  Of course, why would it?  If it gave some relief, it would have helped those mainly in rural Ireland as they do the most travel.

I support this motion for an immediate moratorium on disconnections of households.  It is heartbreaking to hear constituent after constituent tell me that they are unable to afford their electricity and gas bills.  It is even more heartbreaking when I hear about energy companies making record profits in a year when there were 712 domestic electricity and 309 domestic gas disconnections due to non-payments, which is absolutely despicable.  What kind of country are we living in that would allow this to happen and what kind of Government allows this to happen on its watch?<\/p>  <p>  A recent Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes survey showed that more than 1 million people in Ireland say they are struggling to make ends meet.  Four out of five people say they have less money in their pockets compared to this time last year.  Something needs to be done.  The budget did not go far enough in providing what people need to get by.<\/p>  <p>  Young people are leaving Donegal and Ireland in their droves in order to afford to live.  We can hardly blame them when we hear stories of students living in tents and cars and sleeping on couches due to the lack of affordable accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  Scope, the disability and equality charity, said today that lives are at risk because disabled people fear they will be unable to afford to heat their homes this winter.  A recent poll of 1,000 disabled adults found that 63% were worried about being able to pay their heating bills.  Some 60% of respondents said they feel the Government is ignoring them, which says it all.  People have no faith in the Government and no hope that things will get better.  The Government has completely crushed people's spirits.  It has failed every section of society in not addressing this cost-of-living crisis, which will sadly cost lives unless we do something about it.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with the motion, which proposes to introduce a windfall tax on excess profits of energy companies, but we must ensure this tax is significant.  There is no point in introducing a tokenistic windfall tax, just as this Government has done for fear of deterring energy companies' investments.  We cannot be afraid to do what is right for fear of scaring off investors.<\/p>  <p>  As I have said before, now is the time to renationalise the energy industry.  The Government should use the windfall tax as a way to do this, using money gained from the tax to invest in nationalisation.  We need to take the industry back into public ownership to remove the profit motive and have the ability to implement price freezes for citizens as well.  We should not have to rely on private companies to treat our citizens fairly.<\/p>  <p>  The EU solidarity contribution on extraordinary profits made by fossil fuel energy producers is welcome.<\/p> <p>However, it does not go far enough.  I do not agree with the flexibility member states are given on what rate of levy to apply.  Companies making record profits should be taxed at a high rate and flexibility should not be given on this.  I also do not agree with the fact that the levy only applies to profits that are more than 20% higher than in previous tax years.<\/p> <p> It is my firm belief that nobody should be making additional profits during an energy crisis that is severely affecting our citizens.  The windfall tax should apply to all profits made above the 2019 profit figure at the very least.  No energy company should be profiting at the expense of others, especially not at the expense of the most vulnerable in Irish society.  Energy companies are making eye-watering profits and are the cause of the energy crisis.  For the Government to try to put the blame solely on the war in Ukraine is completely disingenuous.  It has an impact, but energy costs were rising significantly before the war.<\/p> <p> Again, I support the motion and the measures it calls for, such as a moratorium on disconnections, the windfall tax and the reduction in the cap on the price of electricity at summer 2021 rates.  However, as helpful as these measures will be, they do not go far enough to address the systemic change needed in our energy industry.  We need to renationalise our energy, give control back to the people and invest any money gained into a greener future.  One thing is certain: fossil fuels will not be part of this plan in the future.  Is this not an opportunity to move away from these expensive and damaging fuels which big companies profit from, and do things for and on behalf of the people?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800050#XX01200","speaker":"1547","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666126200,"counter":446,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing forward this motion, which contains a number of very sensible and doable proposals.  I want to address some of the remarks from the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who has left us.  He quite rightly informed us of the global and European situation which is worsening day to day as Russia not only sends drones to murder people in their homes, but also deliberately and systematically attacks energy installations in Ukraine.  He also told us of the many supports put in place in the budget.  They are real and substantial for many families.  His list sounded impressive, but it is important to say that many families will not qualify for the majority of targeted supports.  The extra payment for those on fuel allowance, for example, is very welcome, but the vast majority of family carers will not be able to avail of that because carer's allowance is not a qualifying payment for fuel allowance, despite the fact that people caring for older persons have the heat on all the time.  <\/p>  <p>  For some families, the safety net will hold for now, but there is a cohort of families on low to middle incomes who are in real trouble and will not be able to pay their bills.  They include, for example, the civil servants who have retired on class D pensions.  Many tens of thousands of people, mainly women, have pensions marginally above the State pension, but will not be able to avail of any of these targeted measures.  They will only be able to avail of the universal measures, which will not be enough.  The electricity bills landing on people's mats right now are frightening, but for some they are truly terrifying.  I refer to those who have always paid their bills and want to continue to pay them, but know they will not be able to pay them in full.  Those people cannot be disconnected.  Many of the people on pay-as-you-go often have no choice as this is the system in the rental properties they live in.  The Taoiseach told us clearly that nobody would be disconnected this winter and spring.  I want to know whether the Taoiseach and Government can deliver on that promise, which I believe was made in good faith.<\/p>  <p>  I do not often give specific examples to make a general argument, but something I heard in recent times stopped me in my tracks.  An older man with a lower income had a budget in place, with help from MABS, to try to help him to manage the huge increases in costs over the coming months.  He was advised to use the &euro;400 extra in the fuel allowance to buy a few hundred litres of oil.  Despite the best efforts of his adviser, he resisted and said he would instead spend it to put a headstone on the grave of one of his children.  I know this is not everybody's story, but it illustrates that those on low incomes have no flexibility and some of them will find themselves without light and heat this winter.  People have to know that their heat and light will not be turned off.  I ask the Minister of State to confirm the words of the Taoiseach, namely that there will be a moratorium on disconnections.<\/p>  <p>  The Government cannot use the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and MABS as a mudguard.  They are already overstretched and trying to assist people in financial distress.  Community welfare officers are overrun.  Speaking of exceptional needs payments, apart from the fact that such payments are complicated and difficult to get, the Government seems to forget completely that community welfare officers are totally overstretched.  They are dealing with many more new requests.  More people need help, but there are no new officers in place.  In fact, some are leaving the service, and those on sick and other leave are not being replaced.  There is pressure in the system, yet Ministers are telling some of our most vulnerable people to add to that pressure.  That is not fair because it is not working.<\/p>  <p>  Further action is needed.  We want a windfall and solidarity tax to be put in place immediately.  We do not have to wait for the EU.  Legislation must be introduced to give the CRU powers to regulate standing charges on energy bills.  What is happening is a rip-off.  A moratorium on gas and electricity disconnections must be introduced immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800051#YY00200","speaker":"1605"},{"type":"speech","time":1666126200,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for their engagement on this crucially important issue.  The passion behind the contributions is a reminder of how important it is that we have an affordable supply of energy for the economic as well as social well-being of our people.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, made it clear that the scale of the measures introduced by the Government in 2023 totalled &euro;2.5 billion, which includes the &euro;1.2 billion electricity cost benefit scheme, which we legislated for last week, but action does not stop there.  There is a great deal of additional work under way in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and across various State bodies.  A significant element of this work is driven by the active response of the European Commission to impacts on the energy sector arising from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  On 18 May, the Commission published the REPowerEU plan.  It focuses on diversification of energy imports, energy savings and accelerating clean energy deployment.  As we have outlined, this has created the framework within which we are now working to introduce not only a windfall tax, but also a solidarity payment to ensure an equitable contribution by all players to the unprecedented situation we all find ourselves in.  One can distinguish between the windfall tax and the solidarity payment on the basis that one is a tax on those who have fossil fuel deposits and make money from them and the other is a tax on those who are benefiting unfairly from the high price of gas, although they are generating electricity from something which does not have the same costs attached, such as wind power.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to galvanise the efforts of all citizens to reduce the amount of energy we use.  A great deal of work is already happening on this, with the Reduce Your Use campaign.  This includes mandatory requirements on the public sector to lead by example and reduce its energy use.  Of course, not everybody can reduce their energy use and we must support those people who are not using enough energy because they are afraid they will not be able to pay for it.  A number of Deputies brought forward stories of that happening among their constituents.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is going to bring forward an energy poverty action plan in the coming weeks, which will build on the important work done under the previous strategy to combat energy poverty.  Critically, it will capture the whole-of-government effort needed to support people in or at risk of energy poverty.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister and I are very much aware of the situation regarding Traveller families and their access to the benefits of this scheme.  I want to reiterate that the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is working on this issue and arrangements will be put in place as soon as possible as the Government has approved funding for this action.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is also fully aware of the pressures on businesses, and that is why the temporary business energy support scheme is being introduced to protect businesses and families.  The legislation to establish this scheme will be brought forward as part of the finance Bill.  It is estimated that the scheme will cost &euro;1.2 billion.  It will be administered by the Revenue Commissioners and operate on a self-assessment basis.<\/p><p><i>9 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>Businesses that are eligible will receive 40% of the increase that they have seen in their electricity and gas costs up to a monthly cap of &euro;10,000.<\/p> <p> Behind all of that, however, there is always more work to be done on improving communications on the benefits to which people are entitled and the supports that are available to them.  The Department of the Minister is working closely across Government and with NGOs to make this an integral part of the Reduce Your Use campaign.<\/p> <p> While all this urgent work on measures that will have a real impact in the shorter term is essential, we must not lose sight of the bigger picture.  I cannot overstress that the best way to protect ourselves from the impact of international fossil fuel prices is to reduce dependence on fossil fuels.  As we transition away from fossil fuels and progressively decarbonise, we have to ensure that the way we decarbonise captures this unique opportunity to improve life for all of use in the long term.<\/p> <p> Making our homes energy efficient and no longer reliant on fossil fuels will not just mean that they are warmer, healthier and cheaper to run, it also means that we are taking concrete action on social deprivation that is sustainable and enduring.  A total of &euro;244 million has been allocated for Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, residential and community retrofit schemes and the solar photovoltaic, PV, scheme in 2022.  Some &euro;118 million of this amount has been allocated to energy-poverty schemes.<\/p> <p> More than 4,500 homes will benefit from the free upgrades targeted at those in energy poverty this year and, on top of that, &euro;85 million funding has been provided by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage for the local authority energy efficiency retrofit programme for this year and another &euro;87 million for next year.  This means that of the total Government retrofit budget allocation of &euro;329 million, approximately 60%, or &euro;203 million, has been allocated to dedicated energy-poverty schemes and local authority retrofits this year.<\/p> <p> Budget 2023 has provided &euro;337 million for SEAI residential and community energy upgrade schemes, including the solar PV scheme for medically vulnerable electricity customers.  Some &euro;291 million of this allocation comes from carbon tax revenue.  This is the highest-ever allocation for these schemes.  This will facilitate the delivery of energy upgrades to 37,000 homes, including 6,000 free upgrades to those in energy poverty.  A further &euro;87 million has been allocated for the local authority retrofit programme for next year.  The overall allocation of  &euro;8 billion for residential retrofit to 2030 demonstrates the Government's commitment to the vision.<\/p> <p> I wish to say something about vulnerable customers and those on pay-as-you-go meters.  No vulnerable customer should stay on a pay-as-you-go meter.  People can register as vulnerable with their supplier and there is no charge to move from a pay-as-you-go meter to bill pay for electricity.  The CRU has also removed the &euro;200 charge that was in place for moving from a gas pay-as-you-go meter to bill pay and that is also free.<\/p> <p> The Minister discussed the full range of supports that suppliers have in place for their customers including hardship funds.  These funds are put in place by suppliers at their own initiative in addition to their regulatory obligations.  In speaking to them, I understand that there was a low take-up of hardship funds.  Payments are made to customers on a discretionary basis by the networks.  I understand that MABS is involved in administration of a number of these funds.  I thank the Deputies for their contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800051#YY00300","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666126800,"counter":449,"content":"<p>I thank my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, for bringing this motion before the House.  We have known for a long time of the struggles that some households are facing when it comes to energy costs.  That situation is now worse than ever given the cost-of-living crisis and the particular crisis that families and households face as electricity and gas prices continue to rise.<\/p>  <p>  Since the pandemic, families have had to worry about illness, temporary loss of jobs, financial worries and putting food on the table.  They now face a new pandemic in energy with costs spiralling out of control, so much so that they choose between sitting in darkness, having a meal on the table or heating the house.  Government should also take into account the stress our school children will go through if their homes are disconnected as the winter months come in and they may have two to three hours of homework.<\/p>  <p>  We in Sinn F&eacute;in are calling for a ban on disconnections to start immediately and run to the end of March for all customers and not just those who are medically vulnerable.  Households need support during this difficult time, not the threat of being left in the cold, with darkness hanging over them.  Such a ban on disconnections gives a household time to come to an arrangement with their supplier.  Our motion would also give certainty to the many people who use prepay electricity meters.  Once their &euro;20 emergency credit runs out, prepay customers are disconnected.  The Government still has no plan to protect these households.<\/p>  <p>  Our motion would ensure that prepay meter customers got the same protection from electricity and gas disconnections.  This is about fairness and giving certainty to people.  The Government needs to ensure that all households are protected from disconnections.  I would have called on all Deputies to support this motion but the Government took the easy way out by not opposing the motion, which does not necessarily mean it is supporting it.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in will stand up for ordinary workers and families to ensure no family will be in the dark or the cold this winter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800052#ZZ00200","speaker":"1506"},{"type":"speech","time":1666126800,"counter":450,"content":"<p>I commend my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, on introducing this motion.  We have had 712 domestic electricity and 309 domestic gas disconnections in the first half of this year.  Something needs to be done immediately.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's rejection of the Sinn F&eacute;in proposal to reduce and cap electricity prices at pre-crisis levels was a big mistake.  It leaves hard-pressed households exposed to additional hikes and to the prospect of disconnection.  As families face a long winter, they worry that they will not be able to keep the lights on.<\/p>  <p>  The Government also delayed by 12 months the Second Reading of the Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (Prohibition of Winter Disconnections) Bill 2021, which was introduced by Sinn F&eacute;in.  The Bill sought to extend the moratorium on disconnections to run over the entire fuel allowance season.  The Government should rethink these proposals and not simply reject them because Sinn F&eacute;in has proposed them.  What is important is that people are protected now.<\/p>  <p>  Households throughout my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan and all other constituencies are facing enormous energy bills this winter.  They have been hit by price hike after price hike over the past 18 months and are anxious about whether they can keep on top of these escalating bills.  It is vital that people are protected now, that they are given certainty that their bills will be affordable and that they will have an assurance that they will not face disconnection from electricity and gas this winter.<\/p>  <p>  Introducing measures in December will be too late for many.  This needs to happen now and continue until the end of March.  The protection must also be extended to the 378,000 customers across the State who use pay-as-you-go meters.  Currently, when their emergency credit runs out, prepay customers are disconnected by default but the Government still has no real plan to protect these households.  That is not good enough.  We need to ensure that prepay meter customers get the same protection from electricity and gas connections or, at the very least, friendly credit on prepay meters needs to be extended.<\/p>  <p>  This is an unparalleled crisis.  The Government needs to ensure that all households are protected from disconnection.

Is it that people are not aware of them?  Many people who find themselves in the situation of being unable to pay their bills are those who have never, ever, found themselves in such a situation before.  I ask that something be done to communicate to people that there is a hardship fund under MABS and that people need to use it.  We need to see if there are blockages along the way.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State also said that no customer should stay on a pay-as-you-go meter.  Is the message he is sending out one that people can easily transfer from a pay-as-you-go meter to bill pay?  People will welcome that, but we need to make sure that there are no blockages.

This was particularly so with the clear call for the extension of the disconnection ban to all customers from now until the end of March.  There was no commitment from Government to do that.  There was no commitment to provide a solution for pay-as-you-go customers.  The solution there would be to ensure they have the exact same protections as billpay customers have.  The Government did not provide a solution for them.  I think I am right in saying, and it would be important to clarify this, that the facility to transfer onto a billpay contract is limited only to vulnerable customers.  As I said before, that is a subset of a subset of a subset of a subset.  That provision should be made available to all customers.<\/p>  <p>  Not opposing this motion while not supporting it either amounts to a shameful abandonment of those people, who are in deep need of support from this Government.  It is not a big ask to extend the fundamental principle that in the middle of a crisis, we in this Republic will not disconnect people from heat and light this winter.  It should not be a challenge.  However, this is a reflection of a failure of Government to support people in need.<\/p>  <p>  The argument was made that pay-as-you-go is good for some people as it helps them manage their bills.  It is offensive.  It completely misses the point.  We know people are, for want of a better term, self-disconnecting.  We know people are facing real financial hardship but they are not being supported.  This Government is pretending they do not exist.  That is in effect what it is doing and it is the sum total of the Minister and Minister of State's contributions to this debate.  At the root of all this is an argument of moral hazard, namely, that there is a cohort of people we cannot extend the same protection to because they could not manage their affairs.  That is insulting, offensive and is implied by the fact the Government will not extend the same protections to that cohort of people as it has to everybody else.  I wanted to put that on record.  People can see through it.<\/p>  <p>  There is an opportunity to address it, which we have spelled out.  The Government should extend the friendly credit.  It should show those people it will support them over this winter.  The Government does not even count the people who are so-called self-disconnecting.  They are being completely disregarded and explained away on the basis it is good for them to manage their own accounts.  They need to be supported.

Let us look at the various scenarios in which students might be renting.  A student might rent privately, register with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, and pay their rent.  They are covered just as any renter in the general population would be.  There are students who avail of the rent-a-room scheme and the Minister for Finance has been clear they are covered.  Students who live in on-campus accommodation often have a licence agreement rather than a tenancy agreement.  They will be covered.  The final category is a student who is renting privately but whose parents are paying the rent.  The Finance Bill will now ensure, quite rightly, that parent can avail of the rent relief.

Again, it is not possible for me on the floor of the D&aacute;il to imagine all the various scenarios of individual PhD students.

Some PhD students get no stipends.  Some get miserable stipends of a few grand.  Even those who get &euro;18,000 have to work all the hours that God sends.  They find it difficult to study or they have to have a second job, which makes it almost impossible for them to complete their studies.  A lecturer who used to lecture me in UCD said they are worried about UCD's ability to recruit and retain postgraduate students.  That is serious when we have chronic skills shortages in a number of areas across our society and public services.

We are increasing those stipends by a further &euro;500 in this budget.  We are putting that &euro;500 into the baseline.  We need to do much more for PhD students.  We have increased the number of postgraduate students who will be able to access the &euro;1,000 additional contribution towards their fees this year.

It is not on a once-off basis.  It has permanently reduced college fees for any household earning less than &euro;100,000.  It has done double that this year in recognition of the cost-of-living crisis.  The Deputy said it does not even compensate.  All of the increases or reductions that we have provided are ahead of inflation or the increased prices that students are facing.  When one looks at the budget in the round, there are further additional supports.  For example, there has been a 50% reduction in public transport fees for students and young people.  These are real, tangible measures.  We have more to do.  I regularly, intensively engage with students on this issue and I listen to and hear them.

While these amounts have been allocated to the various beneficiaries, the final actual expenditure for 2022 is not known as yet because we have not reached year end.  The final allocation for the NTF in 2023 will be set out in the Revised Estimates.  Any increase in NTF expenditure, all other things being equal and without a corresponding reduction on the Vote, requires an increase in my Department and overall Government expenditure ceilings.  NTF expenditure increases general Government expenditure and can only be accommodated within the fiscal strategy agreed by Government.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2023 has allocated &euro;682.5 million for the NTF, as the Deputy correctly said.  The net difference between the 2022 and 2023 allocations is &euro;82.5 million.  This is due to the removal of the temporary funding provided in 2022 for Covid, the Brexit adjustment reserve and the national recovery and resilience plan, which amounted to &euro;131.4 million in 2021, with the provision of &euro;48.5 million in the 2023 allocation for Covid and Brexit measures, as well as an increase of &euro;400,000 in the NTF baseline for access to apprenticeship initiatives.  I know I have presented many figures, but it is important to put them on the record.<\/p>  <p>  When finalising the Revised Estimates for 2023, further expenditure may be identified and categorised under the NTF.  The final amount is a matter for Revenue in the coming weeks.  The cumulative surplus for the NTF at end 2021 was &euro;1.102 billion.  The projected annual surplus for 2022 as set out in the Revised Estimates for 2022 was &euro;88.7 million but it is likely to be higher when all receipts and expenditure fall due.<\/p> <p>The forecast for the annual surplus in 2023 will be reviewed in finalising the Revised Estimates taking account of all allocated expenditure and income projections.  The forecast annual surplus for 2023 was calculated on a preliminary basis as part of budget 2023 as &euro;338.4 million.

On top of that, the Minister said there is more than &euro;1 billion sitting in reserve from unspent funds from the past few years.  That means that by the end of 2023 there will be &euro;1.5 billion sitting in this reserve, accumulating no interest.  This money was collected through the levy with the commitment that it would be invested in education and training and at the same time the Minister has failed to deliver any meaningful progress on addressing the funding gap in the third level education budget.

We have a situation where third level education is crying out for greater levels of funding.  At the same time, we have an ever-increasing reserve of money in the NTF.

The challenge for the Government, and I respectfully suggest it is also a challenge for the Opposition to show how it is done, is that any expenditure from the NTF is categorised as the equivalent of general Government expenditure.

I would like to see a particular application of the NTF to support skills priorities and to develop the quality of our workforce.  In regard to the latter issue I envisage an expanded mandate for Skillnet Ireland, which is the way to proceed, in leading workforce development as the Government agency with extensive partnerships with industry and employees.

I look forward to visiting on Monday and engaging further with the Deputy there.<\/p>  <p>  The multi-campus South East Technological University, SETU, will be transformative for the south-east region.  Addressing the economic and social needs of the south east is at the centre of its mandate building on the previous achievements which I want to herald of the Waterford Institute of Technology and the Institute of Technology, Carlow.  SETU provides a high quality multi-campus environment with a strong focus on science and technology programmes aligned with skills needs in the region and nationally.  It also engages in industry-oriented research and plays a pivotal role in facilitating access to, and progression through, higher education.  In this context I am confident that SETU, our country&rsquo;s newest university, will play a key role in retaining and developing talent in the south-east region.  I am strongly committed to supporting the university on its campus development plans.  I am strongly committed to expanding the footprint of the university in Waterford.  An engineering, computing and general teaching building in Waterford and a science and health building in Carlow are being advanced through the higher education public private partnership programme.  I expect news on that very shortly.  Also, next year, construction is scheduled to commence on significant energy retrofit projects in Waterford and Carlow.  Engagement is ongoing with the university in regard to the expansion of the Waterford campus footprint.  Steps are also being taken in regard to the Wexford campus.  The Deputy can be assured that these developments remain key priorities for me and for my Department.<\/p>  <p>  The specific level of investment as in all higher education institutions, and this is not specific to the south east, is always informed by the scope and pace of capital projects and will be decided in the context of my Department&rsquo;s overall allocation under the national development plan.  We issue capital calls and we invite universities to apply, and the same will be the case with the SETU.  We have, however, separate and distinct from what I just said, made specific provision in regard to securing an expanded site in Waterford and for that there is not a need to compete with other projects in and across higher education institutions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800055#CCC00900","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1666128600,"counter":485,"content":"<p>It is now 11 years since Fine Gael promised Waterford a national university.

We are making significant progress in realising the ambition of the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025.  A key objective is to make apprenticeships more attractive to employers and learners and to ensure continued engagement.  The progress to date includes: the establishment of the National Apprenticeship Office, the appointment of its first director and the initiation of its work plan; the removal of legislative barriers to the development of apprenticeship programmes in professions, enabled by the approval of the Oireachtas of the Higher Education Authority Bill 2022; the establishment of the National Apprenticeship Alliance, representing a broad range of partners involved in apprenticeship; the imminent establishment of the equity of access subcommittee, to help make apprenticeship more reflective of the national population; securing resources for access measures, including a bursary programme for underrepresented groups; the introduction of the apprenticeship employer grant of &euro;2,000 and a gender bursary grant of &euro;2,666; a significant increase in the number of new apprenticeship registrations in 2021 - a near 40% increase on the 2019 figures; the allocation of &euro;17.2 million of additional capital investment for SOLAS and the Higher Education Authority, HEA, building on the &euro;20 million apprenticeship capital fund investment in 2021; and the inclusion of apprenticeship options on the CAO website from November 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Due to these measures and other supports aimed at simplifying the process for employers, there are currently almost 8,500 employers and 25,000 apprentices.  We are confident that these numbers will increase as apprenticeships can help companies to compete in the modern marketplace and make their organisations more competitive.  In addition to building the company's skills base, providing quality training helps with staff loyalty and retention, thus adding more to the benefits of apprenticeships.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800056#DDD01200","speaker":"1493"},{"type":"speech","time":1666129200,"counter":500,"content":"<p>The figure of a 40% increase in apprenticeship registrations in 2021 sounds impressive.

There is a certain amount of risk from an employer&rsquo;s point of view in the apprentice moving on after they have taken them on and trained them for four years.  That is an issue that will have to be addressed by a combination of employers paying apprentices properly and then paying them properly when they qualify.  However, there has to be the ability to show an employer that it works and has a value for them as well.  That is the big problem.

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform carried out a review of the cost of apprenticeships in 2019.  It highlighted the need to standardise the cost data collection.  Basically, inconsistent and decentralised reporting in areas such as costs and tracking of apprentices means that the information to support the assessment of spend on apprenticeship was unavailable, retention rates are not recorded centrally and the impact of programmes in terms delivering employer and apprentice requirements had not yet been assessed at a central level.  That is now changing, obviously, with the National Apprenticeship Office.<\/p>  <p>  Apprentice recruitment is heavily linked to economic activity, with immediate impacts on recruitment and retention rates where there is a decline in activity.  Under the action plan, by the end of 2022, the National Apprenticeship Office will establish a performance framework to assess efficiency and effectiveness of apprenticeships to include monitoring of: employer and apprentice mix in terms of employer size; apprentice gender, ethnicity, age, disability and socioeconomic background; apprentice retention rates; and an annual survey of apprentice employers in educational institutions and consortia.

We have had a number of meetings with Empowering People In Care, EPIC.  Marissa Ryan, its CEO, is doing great work and Rory Brown, a member of its youth council, recently spoke at the launch of the new national access plan.  Before I get into my formal answer, I make the point that we have agreed to include exactly the type of students to whom the Deputy is referring as a priority cohort group in the new national access plan.  For the first time, they are identified as a priority group.  That is important because what we put in the plan as a priority group gets measured.  Ultimately, targets get set and data get generated.  It also enables the group to begin to access funding for people leaving aftercare trying to access higher education in terms of the various schemes we have in place.<\/p>  <p>  It is evident from the consultations we have had that those leaving the care system represent an important group whose life experiences and situations merit additional support in accessing and participating in further and higher education.  With that in mind, the new national access plan, which I launched in late August, for the first time identifies people with experience of the care system as one of the priority groups for action under the plan.  The plan sets a high level of ambition for the higher education system in supporting access, participation and success among groups identified as priority groups.  It aims to support inclusion and diversity in the student body.   Delivery of the plan is supported by the programme for access to higher education, PATH, which provides a range of supports, including financial supports, to priority groups.  The supports include access to bursaries and scholarship schemes and support for people from target groups in accessing initial teacher education.  There are other strands to the PATH programme and, in the interest of time, I will send the Deputy a note on those aspects.  <\/p>  <p>  In working to address the issues of people with experience of the care system, I acknowledge, as they have asked me to do, that there is a lot more work that needs to be done to develop better data on care leavers and their path through higher education.  The first priority will be to establish new baseline data for these learners and then, from that, develop specific targets in terms of increased participation.  We will be working to develop better data in this area to help us understand what targeted interventions look like.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800057#EEE00200","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1666129800,"counter":511,"content":"<p>I welcome that this group will be considered a priority group and that there will be proposed analysis of their pathway through third level, etc.  Subject to assessment, care leavers are entitled to aftercare from the age of 18, when their foster or residential placements end, until the age of 21.  Aftercare supports can be extended to the age of 23 if the young person goes to further or higher education.  The Minister will agree that is discriminatory and unfair.  All young people, regardless of the path they take in life, be it an apprenticeship or going straight into the world of work, should be granted supports for an equal length of time on leaving care.  Aftercare should be placed on a statutory footing for all young people leaving care and there should not be a barrier for those who are not in further education from the age of 21.  I am not sure what role the Minister's Department can play in that aspect in terms of the drafting of rules but if it is in his power to reform that system, I ask him to so do.

The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, the Department of Health, the Department of Social Welfare and the likes play a role in the oversight and implementation of the plan, as do stakeholders and people with lived experiences in terms of the priority groups.  I am happy to send the Deputy a note on the matter.<\/p>  <p>  When my officials and I met with EPIC on a number of occasions to discuss several of these issues relating to the emerging challenges that students who have experience of the care system encounter, we discussed 12 items, including the need for wrap-around supports, data collection, career guidance into higher education, specific focus on retention, streamlining of the SUSI supports, the need for more flexibility, therapeutic supports in some cases, role models to spread positivity around the system and the issue of trust being key in the context of the relationship with access officers.

According to EUROSTAT figures, 80% of people aged between 16 and 29 in this country are still living at home with their parents.  In every town and village in the country, young adults are living with their parents due to the crisis-of-living crisis and other spiralling pressures such as rents.  The age of 18 is very young for a person to leave home.  Many of those who do so often feel anxious and return to the family home at weekends or, at least, can phone their parents to look for financial or other assistance.  Obviously, most young people return to their family homes at Christmas, for example.  For an 18-year-old in foster care, the State placement ends on the person's 18th birthday and aftercare supports can end for many of those people as well.

As she is aware, as part of the budget 2023 we have secured a significant cost-of-living package for third level students, including a once-off &euro;1,000 state financial support towards the undergraduate student contribution fee for higher education students eligible for the free fees scheme.  This measure will reduce the student contribution payable by students from &euro;3,000 to &euro;2,000 in the current academic year.  The measure applies to all students eligible for free fees, including mature students.  This additional level of support towards the student contribution will benefit approximately 94,000 or 95,000 additional students.<\/p>  <p>  The student contribution is paid in respect of programmes covered by my Department&rsquo;s free fees scheme.  At present, part-time or blended courses are not eligible for inclusion in this scheme and students attending such courses pay a tuition fee.  In short, this is not an issue relating to mature students as compared with non-mature students, if that is the right phrase.  The issue here is the linkage with the &euro;3,000 fee.  The decision we took in the budget was to reduce the &euro;3,000 fee on a once-off basis by &euro;1,000, to &euro;2,000.  Regardless of whether one is a mature student, if one is paying or required to pay the &euro;3,000 fee, that is reduced to &euro;2,000.<\/p>  <p>  I concede the point that there are a number of other students who pay different fees or are involved in different ways of doing college, including part-time learning, blended learning and the likes, in respect of which they are not eligible for the &euro;3,000 fee and, therefore, do not benefit from the &euro;1,000 reduction.  However, in an effort to be helpful to the Deputy's constituent, I point out that we have increased the allocation in the student assistance fund for the current academic year.  The fund provides financial support to students experiencing financial difficulties while attending college and can provide assistance towards rent, childcare costs, transport costs and books and class materials.  The fund is open to full- or part-time registered students on courses of not less than one year's duration leading to an undergraduate or postgraduate qualification.  Application  to the fund can be made through the access office in a student&rsquo;s third level institution.

Do we want to do more?  Yes.  Do we need to do more in respect of part-time students?  We absolutely do for the reasons the Deputy has said.

However, as autonomous bodies, the internal disbursement of this funding is a matter for the individual institution.  As is clear from the actions already taken in the cost-of-living measures outlined in the budget, my Department is monitoring the issue of stipends and the views expressed by students and other stakeholders.  With that in mind, as an immediate and tangible relief against the challenges of the rising cost of living, I am introducing a once-off payment in 2022 of &euro;500 for PhD students who receive an Irish Research Council, IRC, or Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, award, and a &euro;500 increase to the stipend baseline in 2023 for PhD students who receive either of those awards.  PhD student recipients may also, in certain circumstances, qualify for support from SUSI.<\/p>  <p>  I confirm that my Department will soon begin a review of PhD student support, and we plan to have a report commissioned and finished by early 2023.  I intend to announce further details in the coming days, once finalised, and I would welcome the Deputy&rsquo;s views in this regard.  In my first budget as Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, I increased the IRC stipend from &euro;16,000 per annum to &euro;18,500, matching that of SFI.  In the context of the Government's cost of living package, I was happy to secure a further &euro;500 increase for the SFI and IRC PhD stipends.  However, a more fundamental look at stipends and other associated issues that I hear about from students is merited at this stage.<\/p>  <p>  My Department does not collate information on the level of stipends awarded by funding agencies.  However, I can confirm that the stipends provided by the SFI and the IRC are set at &euro;18,500.  I understand there is variation in stipends awarded by other bodies, whether sourced from public funds, own resources or private funds.  The issue of a recommended minimum stipend is one that could usefully be considered by the review I am initiating currently.  There could be merit in that.  At the moment, stipends are funded either through the two agencies, the IRC and the SFI, but also by individual institutions.  Some can come from private funding, some from public funding and some from a mix of both.  There is not this issue of a recommended minimum stipend in Ireland and I think that is something we could usefully advance in the context of the review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800059#GGG00600","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1666131000,"counter":540,"content":"<p>The problem is in terms of announcing different things and saying there are different amounts of money available in the budget.

That is an 82% increase in rents and wages have gone nowhere near keeping up with that, never mind the SUSI grants or PhD stipends.  In that context, it is easy to see how students would be so discontented.  The budget stated that 4,000 PhD researchers would benefit from the &euro;500 increase.  However, in an answer the Minister gave me on 23 June, he said there were fewer than 3,000 PhDs funded through the SFI and the IRC.  That would mean that less than half of all the PhD researchers would benefit from the payment.  We also need a wider discussion, as the Minister said, around how we expect PhD researchers to live on the stipends of &euro;19,000, which is far less than the minimum wage.  I welcome the review but I want to know its scope and when it will be completed.

I think there are legitimate issues around how a PhD researcher or PhD student is classified within the university.  I am not suggesting that there is a one-size-fits-all model, or saying the Deputy is suggesting that.  Some countries that are viewed as doing very well in this area classify the PhD students as employees while others who also do very well and support PhD students well do not classify them as such.

Will the Minister outline what this differentiation is?  Is he working to ensure it persists?  In other words, is he working to ensure we will not have the technological universities morphing into a traditional type of university?  The technological universities are separate and have a different type of energy.  Will the Minister comment on, for example, the National Maritime College of Ireland, NMCI, which is close to my constituency?  I refer to the great potential there to develop the skill sets required in the offshore wind energy sector etc.  This college is part of the MTU.  As the Minister also said in his earlier response, this college is also different in its own way and deserves focus and support because, as Deputy Matthews said earlier, we need to develop the skill sets required in the offshore wind energy sector.  This is an exciting development but without institutions like the NMCI retaining their current focus and getting the support to do so, then we could slip in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800061#JJJ00200","speaker":"1515"},{"type":"speech","time":1666132200,"counter":561,"content":"<p>I agree with that and I look forward to visiting the National Maritime College of Ireland later this year with Deputy Stanton and exploring how we can work together to offer support.

This is important; they are equal and there is parity of esteem.  They are universities and it is possible to get any one of the whole spectrum of university qualifications right up to a PhD.  These institutions do, however, have a distinctive mission.  This is not just my view, a mission that was legally sanctioned by inclusion in the Technological Universities Act 2018.  It is important that people remain true to this objective, and I believe they will.

To be honest about this issue, and it is important to be so, the Government's decision in the budget we announced links the &euro;1,000 reduction to the &euro;3,000 fee.  The way I explain this in my own mind, therefore, is that if people are eligible to pay the &euro;3,000 fee, they are then eligible to get the &euro;1,000 reduction.  This will benefit in or around 94,000 or 95,000 students between now and Christmas.

I do not necessarily mean our relationship with the institutions but with the students within them.  Many students who may attend a private college may still need financial assistance.  This idea that people who attend private institutions are not in need of financial assistance is a misplaced understanding of the whole variety of reasons people might go to a private college.  <\/p>  <p>  I met the Higher Education Colleges Association, HECA, relatively recently.  I met its chief executive and the presidents of the private colleges.  As the Higher Education Bill 2022 passed through the Oireachtas, we discussed how this does provide an opportunity for what we call designated status.  As part of institutions, be they public or private, seeking designation, we can have a conversation in the context of those institutions deciding to be a designated institution and that not meaning the loss of private status.  We will recognise such a college as a designated institution.  What conversation does this open for us in respect of student grants and financial assistance for students in need?  I would like to have this conversation because I am aware, and I come across these cases, as I am sure the Deputy does in his constituency work as well, where some students are in private institutions but do require financial assistance and at present are blocked from accessing schemes.  I think this designation process, therefore, is the route to go.

This could be in terms of the cost-of-living crisis or in respect of other issues that can arise from time to time, in the context of the fund for students with disabilities, SUSI student grants and the like.  I have clearly told the sector, and its representatives will confirm, that I believe the way forward is to have the conversation about being a designated institution.  If we are to have any sort of relationship involving taxpayers' money, then it will be in the context where the new Higher Education Authority legislation now provides opportunities in this regard.  The budget announcement delivered in this House last month by the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, and the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, provides a whole variety of ways of trying to help people.  The reduction in student fees is just one of them.  It is right and proper and somewhat understandable, though I am sure frustrating for some, that only institutions that are publicly funded, where a fee is set in this House, can be provided with a reduction in fees.

It is important that when you have an announcement in the budget, you examine how you will translate that into implementation.  As part of the budget, I was delighted to receive a significant cost-of-living package for third level students.  Some &euro;143 million will be spent between now and the end of the year to reduce the cost of education for students and their families.  That is in addition to the public transport fare reductions for students and the rent relief.<\/p>  <p>  Part of that project, as the Deputy said, is including a once-off &euro;1,000 State financial support towards the undergraduate student contribution fee.  This will assist students with the costs of attending higher education and will help alleviate some of the financial pressures which they and their families are facing.  The measure will reduce the student contribution payable by free fees for eligible students from &euro;3,000 to &euro;2,000 in this academic year.  We expect this measure to benefit 94,000 additional students.  It is anticipated that students who are paying their student contribution fee in two instalments will have the amount reduced from their next instalment by their institution during semester 2.  This means that if a student is paying the &euro;3,000 in two instalments, &euro;1,500 now and &euro;1,500 in the second half of the year, the latter amount will automatically be reduced to &euro;500.  That will affect the bulk of students because most of them pay in instalments.  However, some students will have paid the full &euro;3,000 upfront.  Students who have paid the full contribution fee already will receive a refund from their institutions before the end of the year.<\/p>  <p>  Institutions will communicate with directly on how the refund process for students who paid their full student contributions during semester 1 will operate.  Students should expect to hear from their institutions this week and next and that will largely be to seek the bank details of where they would like the refund to be paid into.  Those refunds will automatically process in the weeks ahead.  If a student does not respond with bank details or if a small number need to be paid in 2023 we are ready and intending to pay them between now and the end of the year and as quickly as possible.

This is a question I have been looking to put for quite a while.  It is something the Government needs to take seriously.  This is a space in which we need to be proactive and engage with all stakeholders, including developers, the ESB and other electrical and energy providers.<\/p>  <p>  The long and short definition, as I understand it from a layman's point of view, is that private wire is essentially where private industry, particularly large energy users like pharmaceutical companies, data centres and so on are essentially taken off-grid and they try to provide as much of their own energy through wind or solar power as possible, perhaps with the help of a nearby farmer or whatever the case may be.  This allows these companies to provide for the vast majority of their energy needs.  The difficulty is that the ESB has full power over consent in this area.<\/p> <p>As I understand it, private wire is covered under section 37 of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999.  Essentially in many cases it allows for the ESB to be very slow at engaging with these big developments.  The ESB does not want to see these large energy users becoming self-sustainable because it is not in the long-term interests of the ESB.  It does not want to see large profitable consumers of energy and customers going off grid.  In the long term it is taking a view that it will damage its profit margins.  I am extremely worried about this area.  I submitted a parliamentary question to the Department which is dated 21 September.  In the reply the Minister said this is a commitment under the Climate Action Plan 2021.  The plan includes a commitment to review this policy.  The aim was that the review would be undertaken by the first quarter of this year.  Unfortunately we are now in the fourth quarter.  It is six to nine months down the line and we are still waiting for the review.<\/p> <p> This is an urgent matter.  People are facing ever-growing bills.  We look across the water at what is going on in the UK and the extortionate amounts people are paying for energy.  Thankfully the Government has stepped in in the short term here and provide &euro;200 energy credits over a period of time.  This is very welcome.  In the long run we know from the forecast of the energy regulator, and from anybody in the field, that we are facing a decade when we will struggle to keep up with demand.  This is something on which we need to act now.  By the Department's own admission it is something we should have acted on in the first quarter of this year.  I am very concerned because this is not the only issue on which we are behind schedule.  There are also the wind and solar energy guidelines that seem to have been going on forever.  It is almost depressing when we get responses that state we are behind schedule and we will catch up.  I hope the Minister will have a positive response that will outline exactly what he and the Department will do on this urgent issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800062#KKK01700","speaker":"1521","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666133400,"counter":592,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important topic.

The current legislative framework does not for the most part allow for privately-owned power lines.  The ESB is the sole distribution asset owner and ESB Networks is the sole distribution system operator in the State.  On a practical level this means the ESB owns the electricity distribution while ESB Networks, a subsidiary of the ESB, builds and maintains all distribution level network infrastructure.<\/p><p>The Deputy may be interested to know this position has its roots in the early years of the State when the ESB was established by the Electricity (Supply) Act 1927.  On its establishment it was placed in charge of operating, managing and maintaining what we now know as the Ardnacrusha power plant along with distributing electricity nationwide.  The ESB chose, as allowed for under the Act, to take on the direct responsibility of distributing electricity to consumers and set about creating our electricity network.  The results of this decision, once fully enacted and after the ESB had acquired all existing electricity undertakings operating in the State, was the creation of a standardised national network in the control of the ESB.<\/p><p>The current electricity market environment is very different, with a liberalised and interconnected market in operation.  However, as the Irish energy sector evolves further and moves towards renewables and a zero-carbon economy we must review the environment in which electricity suppliers operate.  The Electricity Regulation Act 1999 provides in limited circumstances for the construction by private entities of electricity lines and infrastructure.  However the Act also provides that the ESB can gain ownership of such constructions, either through agreement or at the direction of the Commission for Regulation of Utilities.  Notwithstanding the current position in respect of direct lines and private wires, it is important to emphasise the scale and ambition of what we are looking to do in delivering to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels and make Ireland a world leader in delivering renewable energy as part of our drive towards a low-carbon system.<\/p><p>The Government is very aware of calls from stakeholders for amendments to be made to the legislation and regulations on direct lines and private wire networks.  Officials from the Department have met and continue to engage with interested parties and stakeholders in the area.  These stakeholders have indicated that amendments to the <i>status quo<\/i>could allow for the deployment of more renewables across the electricity sector while reducing overall grid demand.  They outlined three key areas where they wish to see direct lines and-or private networks providing electricity.  These include business enterprise parks, large energy users and renewable energy communities.  It has been outlined to officials that allowing for private networks for business parks and large energy users would have sectoral benefits for Ireland.  These include increasing the attractiveness of our country as a base for foreign direct investment.  It would also provide an environment for renewable generation.  It is noteworthy that stakeholders have highlighted that there is a desire among many large corporations, in particular technology companies, to have renewable sources of generation directly linked or owned by the company.<\/p><p>Ireland has ambitious climate targets as I set out earlier.  I believe the development of private wires can and will have a significant role in helping to meet them.  Action No. 115 of the climate action plan commits the Department to reviewing the policy options on allowing private networks and direct lines.  Government policy is that the ESB is the sole distribution asset owner and ESB Networks is the sole distribution system operator.  In the interests of clarity it is warranted to point out there is a clear distinction between a private network and a direct line.  The consultation will seek views and report on both matters.  A direct line is regarded by the Department as a privately owned power line that connects one generator with one energy user.  A private network on the other hand is a privately owned and operated electricity distribution network connecting end users with generators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800063#LLL00200","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1666133400,"counter":593,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  To be fair that is a very substantive response and I appreciate it.  I do have several issues.  I have listened to many people from Government parties and the Opposition speaking about offshore wind energy.  The harsh reality is we are being told it will take an average of seven years to do it here but when we look at our European counterparts, such as Slovakia, it can take as little as 18 months.  It is laughable.  It is actually quite worrying to read in the Minister's response that the ESB is the sole provider and sole distributor.  Let us call it for what it is: it is a monopoly.<\/p>  <p>  I am glad the Minister is having a public consultation.  How long will it last for?  When is it due to conclude?  When does the Minister hope to implement any recommendation there may be?  The targets we have and the implementation of the climate action plan are also quite welcome and we are all supportive of them.  This area will be very important and central to the plan.<\/p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that in the Minister's opening remarks he said this is governed by the Electricity (Supply) Act 1927.  That is nearly a century ago.  Given the energy crisis we are in it is a perfect example of why we need to get on with the consultation and get on with implementing any amendment the Minister may have.  Already over in the UK, Centrica, which is the parent company of Bord Gais, has made a strategic decision to no longer supply large energy users such as those we are speaking about.

It has been stalled by concerns about possible unintended consequences.  My view is that we are in changing market circumstances.  Power is very tight and we are now at the very edge of any country's development of renewables.  If we are to have a balancing capability, where it is not just for power generation but also for potential storage solutions, then private wires could provide us with support integrated into the grid.<\/p><p><i>11 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>The environment is changing and it may allow us the opportunity to start developing self-generation in this way, be it through private direct wires or networks where we move away from the historic position and start looking at the sort of potential that is available.  We have to be careful and make sure it does not undermine other investments or the ESB network, which is a vital piece of infrastructure for us.  There is real potential to bring new power generation into a country where that will be critical in the next ten years as well as new balancing capabilities.<\/p> <p> EirGrid is saying that it wants to work with large energy users in terms of flexible demand response and their generation helping the system when times are difficult.  In that sort of changing and evolving market, it seems to be that the balance will move towards allowing private wires and self-generation, which large industrial users have been seeking for some time but we have not been able to deliver.<\/p> <p> I will wait the conclusion of the consultation before finalising the arrangements, but that has to happen within months, not any longer than that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800063#LLL00400","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services","time":1666134000,"counter":596,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800064#MMM00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":597,"content":"<p>Last Thursday, I was contacted by constituents, parents and service users about St. Michael's House, 18 Cromwellsfort Road, Dublin 12.  A man who has Apert syndrome and has relied on the service for approximately 20 years was advised on Wednesday that he would have to arrange his own transport to get to the service.  Heretofore, buses used to transport service users from 8 a.m. to 10 a. m. and 2.30 p.m. to 5 p.m.  Staff at St. Michael's House, which is a section 38 facility funded by the HSE, are also distraught by this situation.<\/p>  <p>  I contacted St. Michael's House and the transport manager.  I was advised that due to the Covid situation, a number of drivers in their late 50s and 60s have not come back to work because of health reasons and replacing them has become an issue.  There is also the issue of not being able to recruit escorts.  I spoke to the manager of the transport section, who was very helpful, about recruitment and retention and he advised that driver numbers are down by nearly one third.  He would usually be able to get relief drivers but they are not available either.  The whole situation has dried up.<\/p>  <p>  There is a short-term and long-term crisis.  In the short term, they need to be able to get the service user to the centre over the next period of time.  Service users have not been able to use the service since last Thursday.  The transport manager suggested that taxis should be provided to services users in the short term but the funding is not available.  Special funding would need to be provided for that in the interim or a system of sharing buses from other services would need to be worked out.<\/p>  <p>  In the long term, drivers need to be trained to the level of D1 - minibus drivers - and it needs to be done quickly.  It is taking the Road Safety Authority at least eight weeks to perform tests.  Garda vetting will also have to be done and then the training.  Therefore, it will not happen today or tomorrow.  This will be a long-term resolution.  Carers need a Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, level 5 qualification to escort the service users.  I have been advised that the past two and a half months were worse than the two and a half years of the Covid pandemic.  The transport manager had 43 buses running before Covid and has only 29 running now.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, funding will be required in the short term to provide an interim service to the centre's service users and a long-term plan is needed to get transport for these services back on the road again.  The Minister has to sit down with the transport manager and representatives from St. Michael's House.  I know it is affecting other units, although the unit up the road, St. Michael's House at 107 Cromwellsfort Road, has no problems, I presume because they held on to their drivers since the Covid pandemic.  These service users and parents cannot be left in a lacuna, not accessing services.  This is not on and it has to be resolved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800064#MMM00300","speaker":"1569"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":598,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Collins for raising this issue and I want to set out a few relevant points.  The Department of Health and the HSE provide specialist disability services, including day services and rehabilitative training, to people with disabilities who require such services.  The provision or management of transport services does not fall within the remit of the Department of Health nor is it a service for which the HSE has responsibility or provides funding.  Therefore, day service funding and supports do not include the provision of transport services.<\/p>  <p>  Having said that, some transport supports are provided by the HSE or by funded agencies on a discretionary basis, and a variety of transport solutions are pursued in different community healthcare organisation, CHO, areas.  These include travel training to enable public transport to be used upon commencement of a day programme where applicable; local transport such as Local Link, private bus transport providers and taxis, funded via a combination of service provider, HSE funding, service user contribution, and-or combined funding; and some service providers providing transport where capacity exists.<\/p>  <p>  I should point out that, in general, day service users are in receipt of disability allowance and are automatically entitled to a free travel pass.  There are improvements in access to a range of transport supports available to persons with disabilities in the State, for example, the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners; the free travel scheme operated by the Department of Social Protection; and CL&Aacute;R funding, approved by the Minister for Rural and Community Development to voluntary organisations providing transport for people with significant mobility issues.  Under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021, the Department of Transport has responsibility for the continued development of accessible public transport.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy raised some pertinent issues such as the fact that driver numbers are down by one third, the training of drivers could take up to eight weeks, the issues of Garda vetting as well as funding for the provision of taxis.

He cannot physically get onto public transport.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome this response.  It should be done in the next week or two to address the short-term and long-term issues.

As Deputies know, following the decision of the Government on 30 November 2021 in respect of the enhanced defective concrete blocks grant scheme, the Government approved the Remediation of Dwellings Damaged By the Use of Defective Concrete Blocks Bill 2022 on 21 June.  The Bill passed both Houses of the Oireachtas and was subsequently signed into law by the President on 23 July 2022.  The Act includes significant improvements to the current scheme and several enhancements.<\/p>  <p>  The maximum grant cap for grant assistance under the scheme has been increased from &euro;247,500 to &euro;420,000.  The current 90% maximum grant was increased to a 100% grant for all remediation options 1 to 5, subject to the overall cap in grant rates.  Exempt development status has been provided for on a like-for-like basis.  There is the provision of a Government guarantee on remediation works, other than the full demolition and rebuild through eligibility for a second grant, if required, for a period of 40 years.  Alternative accommodation, storage costs and immediate repair works to a maximum value of &euro;25,000 within the overall grant cap have been included.  <\/p>  <p>  The Housing Agency will play a key role under the scheme by taking on the financial cost of testing and assessing homes and determining, on behalf of local authorities, the appropriate remediation option and grant rate for each dwelling.  The scheme has been extended to Clare, Limerick and other counties, as required.  A new independent appeals process has been introduced.  As an interim measure, significant improvements were made to the existing grant scheme in February 2022 by way of SI 85 of 2022, which includes a provision for the inclusion as an allowable cost of essential remediation immediate repair works up to a value of &euro;5,555 and relates to the structural stability of any part of the home affected by defective concrete blocks.  This funding for immediate repairs is available now and will also be available under the enhanced grant scheme upon its commencement.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding alternative temporary accommodation, it should be noted that the enhanced grand scheme includes provision for &euro;15,000 to be made available to affected homeowners to assist in temporary accommodation.  Donegal County Council sought approval from the Department for two facilitator posts in Donegal to support homeowners through the defective concrete blocks, DCB, process.  The role of facilitators will include guiding homeowners through the DCB application process and facilitating the homeowner to access all other relevant support services, including options for alternative accommodation or storage.  I want to confirm that a letter of approval supporting the post of facilitators to assist homeowners through an enhanced DCB grant scheme has been issued and work on drafting the necessary regulations has commenced with the intention of having the enhanced scheme ready for application early in the new year.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputy Mac Lochlainn referred to modular housing.  I will bring that proposal to the Minister in the Department.  On Sharon Moss's house in Letterkenny, it is hugely worrying and disappointing.

The former Deputy Tommy Broughan, the late Senator Feargal Quinn and I and, most recently, Senator Tim Lombard have raised this issue in these Houses.  Numerous reports have been carried out here and abroad on this.  The fact of the matter is that approximately 12 days from now, winter will have arrived.  The clocks will go back one hour and we will have dark evenings.  One week from now, sunset will be at 6:20 p.m. and two weeks from now, it will be dark just after 5 p.m.<\/p>  <p>  Many arguments have been put forward over the years with regard to road safety and the benefit to tourism of having brighter evenings; this would also benefit shopping, retail, farming and recreation and, even in the United States, it was found that when an adjustment was made, crime levels fell because criminals like darkness - they do not like light.<\/p>  <p>  In July, the EU Ministers reached a political agreement on a voluntary reduction of natural gas demand by 15% this winter.  The world changed on 24 February 2022 and the big imperative now is energy.  Arguments have been made and people such as Professor Aoife Foley have said that if we maintain summertime, households could save between &euro;250 and &euro;400 per year.  We would also reach the situation of reducing the gas and electricity we use and have longer evenings for all kinds of reasons.  The world changed on 24 February when Russia invaded Ukraine.  We must do all we can in Ireland and in Europe to reduce energy consumption and the amount of electricity we use.  One argument is that it be done by not moving the clocks.  Another is that the moving of the clocks be deferred.<\/p>  <p>  I note that in Ireland, for instance, we moved the clocks forward on 27 March.  In the United States, it was done two weeks earlier on 13 March.  On the other side of the year, in Ireland, we move the clocks back on 30 October and in the United States they wait until 6 November.  The United States has gained three weeks of summertime.  We could do more than that.  We could move the clocks in the spring in early February and, again, a bit later at this time of the year if it would be palatable to have summertime all year round.<\/p>  <p>  It would save quite a lot of money for people and there would be many other benefits as well.  Private Members' Bills have been discussed in these Houses and in committees over the years.  Europe has said we can do it.  I know there are issues with Northern Ireland and the UK but perhaps it is time now, in light of what is happening in Ukraine, to have a serious discussion about this to see whether we can save energy and bring all of the other benefits that have been discussed, looked at and agreed over many years to this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800066#OOO00500","speaker":"1515"},{"type":"speech","time":1666135200,"counter":613,"content":"<p>I convey the apologies of my colleague, the Minster for Justice, Deputy McEntee, who regrets she cannot be here for this matter due to another commitment.  On behalf of the Minister, I thank Deputy Stanton for raising this important matter here today and for giving me the opportunity to provide clarity on some issues.  The question of deterring or delaying daylight saving time to wintertime is a complex one and one to which the Department of Justice has given careful consideration for some time.  Deputy Stanton has always given this careful consideration as well.<\/p>  <p>   Ireland is currently party to an EU-wide arrangement on this issue.  In 2019, MEPs voted in favour of forgoing seasonal clock changes.  There is, as a result of this vote, an ongoing proposal under discussion within the EU working party on transport for an EU directive to discontinue seasonal clock changes.<\/p>  <p>  The European Commission's proposal would have particular implications for the island of Ireland, especially in the context of the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.  The Department of Justice sought to understand the potential impact of the Commission's proposal before reaching a conclusive decision.  It is important to be mindful of the long-term consequences that such a change would amount to in people's daily lives.  With that, a wide-ranging public survey, stakeholder engagement and a public-opinion poll were conducted in the context of developing Ireland's position on this proposal. <\/p>  <p>  The results of the Department of Justice's detailed consultations demonstrated that abolishing seasonal clock changes could negatively affect the lives of many.  It was discovered that the overwhelming majority of respondents would not be in favour of any change that would result in two time zones on the island of Ireland, which would inevitably lead to increased difficulties for business and the general public.  It is vital that undue barriers to trade are not erected by changes in policy and this was communicated clearly by the public during the consultation process.<\/p>  <p>  More generally, in the context of the EU proposal, Ireland's position along with that of a number of other member states has reflected concern that the proposal could reduce synchronicity and result in a patchwork of time zones across the EU, thereby causing unnecessary confusion in the Single Market.<\/p> <p>Ireland has supported a call for a full impact assessment of this proposal to be carried out prior to any final decisions being made at EU level.  We will await the conclusions of such an assessment and further decisions made by the EU Commission before reaching a resolution.<\/p> <p> The Deputy makes some very pertinent arguments.  The argument would be much stronger if the United Kingdom had not voted for Brexit, but these are problems we face on the island of Ireland.  On a positive point, I live in the west of Ireland where we normally have a little more rain than on the east coast but, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would understand, we have ten minutes extra in the evening.  Sometimes it is a joy to behold and people living on the east and south coasts miss out on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800066#OOO00600","speaker":"1608","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666135800,"counter":615,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for letting us know he lives on the bright side of Ireland.  Long may he continue to enjoy that.  I agree with him that the main stumbling block is having two time zones on the island of Ireland.  A number of years ago there was a Private Member's Bill in the House of Commons proposing to maintain summertime all year round.  It ran out of time but there was much support for it.  If time had not run out on it, we might not be discussing this today.  It was very close.  I believe the Prime Minister of the time was in favour of it as well but it ran into the sand and has not been resurrected since.  Other things have taken over.<\/p>  <p>  As I said earlier, the world has changed since last February.  Energy security and energy costings are very important.  I noticed today the UK is fearful of having blackouts and having gas curtailed.  That could impact on us as well.  We must do everything we can to avoid that.  I remember that in the 1970s the clocks did not change because of a similar energy crisis.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle probably recalls it too as she is likely of the same vintage as me.  I remember being in a classroom when the sun was coming up at dawn because we were conserving energy.  It worked then and could work now.  This certainly deserves debate.  I agree with the Minister of State that all of Europe, the UK and Ireland should jump together on this one.  We do not want a patchwork of time zones.<\/p>  <p>  I ask that the Minister for Justice go back to Europe and consult colleagues.  We live in a different time with respect to energy security, energy supply and energy cost.  I mentioned all the other benefits that come from this as well.  Now is the time to start talking about it.  It too late to change it ahead of the upcoming adjustment at the end of this month, but perhaps in the spring we might be talking and making different points, and people might decide to change earlier rather than moving it forward.  I cannot understand why we are so far away from the equinox in springtime either.  It should be changed in early February and let us have the summer early.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800067#PPP00200","speaker":"1515"},{"type":"speech","time":1666135800,"counter":616,"content":"<p>I again thank the Deputy for raising the matter.  I will bring his concerns and views back to the Minister.  As I outlined, it is important any decision made with regard to seasonal clock changes take account of the wider impact these changes would make.  The Department of Justice's engagement with the public has shown the people are keenly aware of these impacts.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has introduced a number of targeted measures in budget 2023 to increase energy efficiency, such as increasing the funding to the better energy, warmer homes scheme.  This will allow homeowners on low incomes to upgrade the energy efficiency of their homes.  The small firms investment in energy efficiency scheme will provide a grant to companies to encourage capital investment in projects to reduce carbon emissions.  The &euro;600 energy credit for household and the temporary business energy support scheme will also assist in reducing the impact of the increased cost of energy.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Justice will continue to engage at EU level on the issue of seasonal clock changes and ensure Ireland's interests are taken into account throughout the decision-making process.  The Deputy is right to say we need to conserve energy.  His proposal sounds very reasonable to me.  If all the countries in Europe, the UK and the island of Ireland were to jump together, we would have a good chance.  The war in Ukraine has brought huge challenges.  I will not say huge opportunities but there are areas where we can try to conserve energy.  It is vital.  I am watching the EirGrid dashboard every day.  As a politician, one hopes the wind blows as much as possible and that it remains relatively mild, but there are challenging times ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101800067#PPP00300","speaker":"1608"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666135800,"counter":617,"content":"<p>Cuireadh an D&aacute;il ar athl&oacute; ar 11.35 p.m. go dt&iacute; 9.12 a.m., D&eacute; C&eacute;adaoin, an 19 Deireadh F&oacute;mhair 2022.<br \/><br \/>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 11.35 p.m. until 9.12 a.m. on Wednesday, 19 October 2022.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
