As you may be aware, the current public pay agreement, Building Momentum 2021-2022, includes the process of Sectoral Bargaining, to address outstanding claims such as this one. The MLSA were granted their own bargaining unit to progress this claim. The size of the Sectoral Bargaining fund available to the MLSA, and to all other cohorts of staff bound by this Agreement, equates to 1% of their basic pay. The MLSA and Health management have been engaged in talks over the last number of months with the aim of finding a way to advance their claim for pay parity through the Sectoral Bargaining process.<\/p>  <p>The Public Service Agreement Group (PSAG), comprised of union and civil service representatives with an independent chair, met on May 11th to consider this matter.

The &ldquo;Elective Hospitals Oversight Group&rdquo;, under the joint governance of the Department of Health and HSE has been guiding the development of the elective hospital proposals, following the process outlined in the updated Public Spending Code, setting out the value for money requirements for the evaluation, planning, and management of large public investment projects.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of additional protected capacity for elective care is further confirmed by the Government Decision, in December 2021 and subject to the necessary approvals and requirements under the Public Spending Code being met, on a new National Elective Ambulatory Care Strategy. This new strategy aims to change the way in which day case, scheduled procedures, surgeries, scans and outpatient services can be better arranged to ensure greater capacity in the future and help to address waiting lists. The development of additional capacity will be provided through dedicated, standalone Elective Hospitals in Cork, Galway and Dublin. The Government decision is very clear on this.  No other locations are under active consideration. It is important to note that the locations chosen will allow for new facilities of a size and scale to implement a national elective care programme that will tackle waiting lists on a national basis. This means that the new facilities will be designed to maximise their capacity and in doing so will operate to cover as a wide catchment area as possible, extending beyond existing and future health areas including the mid-west.<\/p>  <p>  The elective care scope of service will be developed in two phases commencing with day cases, diagnostics, and outpatients and then by in-patient treatment. On this basis, the Elective Care Centres (ECCs) will be designed to provide sufficient capacity to facilitate future phases, including some elective in patient capacity, thereby providing a sustainable and strategic response to cater for the highly dynamic landscape of healthcare policy and practice.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to a specific proposal for an elective only hospital in the mid-west region, a submission was made to the HSE National Capital and Property Steering Committee in 2018 for the St John&rsquo;s 120 bed proposal, and the proposal was considered by the Committee at that time and has been on the agenda since. However, substantial queries on the submission were raised by the Committee. As the proposal does not align with the recently approved Government Policy for National Elective Ambulatory Care Strategy, it is not in the approved project pipeline and has not been included in HSE Capital Plan. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600067#WRC02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Strategies","counter":166,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600067#WRC02800"},{"type":"question","counter":167,"qnumday":68,"qnumall":"[25567\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600067#WRC02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the role of genomic medicine in Ireland; and his plans for a national genomics strategy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":168,"content":"<p>Genomics has transformed our understanding of disease and our ability to deliver care in a way that is more specific and personal to each individual patient.

During this stabilisation period, it is essential that patients do not seek supplies of medicines over and above their normal requirements as doing so will disrupt existing stock levels and hamper the supply of medicines for others. Following my meeting with key stakeholders involved in the supply of HRT products to the Irish market it was agreed to establish a multi-stakeholder group to closely monitor the supply of HRT until the issue is fully resolved.<\/p>  <p>  The HPRA publishes a medicinal product shortages list on its website, with the reason for the shortage, the expected dates for the return of supply and in some cases, such as HRT shortages, the HSE&rsquo;s clinical guidance on the management of patient treatment in response to medicine shortages. The information is made available to assist healthcare professionals in managing medicine shortages when they do arise and reduce their impact on patients. The information relating to shortages on the HPRA website is dynamic and changes depending on the current information the HPRA has to hand, including removal from the list when a shortage has been resolved.<\/p>  <p>  The HPRA will continue to liaise with suppliers of HRT medicines over the coming weeks with a view to securing updates and commitments regarding the restoration of normal supplies for patients as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600068#WRD02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Facilities","counter":229,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600068#WRD02900"},{"type":"question","counter":230,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[27032\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600068#WRD03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of capital projects associated with Mayo University Hospital specifically the emergency department expansion; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1601","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":231,"content":"<p>As the Health Service Executive is responsible for the delivery of public healthcare infrastructure projects, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly in relation to this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600068#WRD03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":232,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600068#WRD03200"},{"type":"question","counter":233,"qnumday":91,"qnumall":"[26033\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600068#WRD03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the consideration that he and his Department have given to the requests by an organisation (details supplied) for a new contract to replace the existing 23-year-old contract for public eye-care and for the expansion of services accessed in the community.","asker":"1495","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":234,"content":"<p>I value the important role community optometrists play in our Health Service in the delivery of holistic patient care.

In addition to forms of contract, the CWMF also contains template documents for the prequalification and tender stages of the procurement process as well as extensive guidance material in relation to the management of public works and services contracts.<\/p><p>The CWMF is designed to support the Public Spending Code and is used to support the development of capital infrastructure proposals such as that for the new National Maternity Hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600068#WRD05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":259,"content":"<p>Question No. 100 answered with Question No 16.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Care Services","counter":260,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600068#WRD06000"},{"type":"question","counter":261,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[26628\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600068#WRD06100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to increase the provision of homecare package providers in CHO9; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1568","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":262,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600068#WRD06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Maternity Hospital","counter":263,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600068#WRD06300"},{"type":"question","counter":264,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[21484\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600068#WRD06400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the estimated updated final cost for the National Maternity Hospital and National Children&rsquo;s hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1579","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":265,"content":"<p>On 17 May last, the Government approved the legal framework that will underpin the relocation of the National Maternity Hospital (NMH) to the St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital (SVUH) campus at Elm Park. Separate to the legal framework, and as required under the Public Spending Code, the final business case for the capital project is progressing. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that all capital development proposals must progress through a number of approval stages, in line with the Public Spending Code, before a firm timeline or funding requirement can be established.<\/p>  <p>  A Final business case has been submitted to the Department by the NMH Project Board and is now subject to technical review by the Department of Health, including the External Assurance Process for major capital projects recently introduced by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p>  <p>  Pending favourable review under the Spending Code, a Memorandum for Government will then be brought forward to progress the programme for the NMH. If approval in principle is granted, the project can move to preparation of tender documents in line with EU law and deployment of a tendering strategy.<\/p>  <p>  The final decision to proceed with the construction of the NMH and therefore to estimate the cost for the new NMH cannot be made until the tender process has been completed and the costings reviewed to ensure that the proposal continues to deliver value for money and remains affordable.<\/p>  <p>  The new Children&rsquo;s Hospital (NCH) project comprises the main hospital on a shared campus at St James&rsquo;s, the Outpatient and Urgent Care Centre at Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown, and the Outpatient and Emergency Care Centre at Tallaght University Hospital.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018, Government approved a capital budget of &euro;1.433bn for the NCH project. This included the capital costs for the main hospital at St James's Hospital campus, the two satellite centres, equipment for the three sites, and the construction of the carpark and retail spaces. The capital budget has not been depleted.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of items not included in this investment figure as there was no price certainly for them and nor can there be, for some, for the duration of the project.

The Taskforce was convened in September 2019, to improve health outcomes and health experiences for women and girls.<\/p><p>Awareness of menopause and its symptoms has been emphasised through the nationwide &ldquo;Radical Listening&rdquo; exercise carried out by the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce. This exercise enabled women across the country to share their views and experiences of the health sector and health services. This was a large-scale consultation process intended to maximise the participation of women across all life stages from 18 years upwards, including minority and disadvantaged women.<\/p><p>278 women participated in open interviews and workshops, where menopause was a recurring theme. Through this process, the taboo around discussing menopause, and a lack of trusted information, were consistently raised as key issues for women experiencing menopause. I published a report on the findings of the &lsquo;Radical listening&rsquo; exercise in September 2021.<\/p><p>The first-of-its-kind ICGP post of Clinical Lead for Women&rsquo;s Health in General Practice has been established. In March 2022, Dr. Ciara McCarthy took up post as the Women's Health Clinical Lead. Her role will enable the development of a comprehensive life-course approach to women&rsquo;s health in general practice, where the vast majority of advice and services for women at all stages in their health journey is available. Dr McCarthy&rsquo;s appointment comes soon after the successful roll-out of the comprehensive new Certificate course in Community Gynaecology for GPs, which provides GPs with up-to-date training in a range of gynaecological presentations in general practice, with evidence-based learning on best practice, from contraception, sexual health, fertility, HRT and the menopause.<\/p><p>Additionally, the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce engaged in discussions on menopause through the &lsquo;Women&rsquo;s Health Weekly&rsquo; presentation series in which key stakeholders presented to Taskforce members on important topics in women&rsquo;s health. In November 2019, the topic of &lsquo;Perimenopause and Menopause&rsquo; was presented, the video of this presentation is available on gov.ie and YouTube.\u00a0<\/p><p>The HSE has developed a dedicated landing page - hse.ie\/menopause - to improve user experience and accessibility to relevant information. <\/p><p>While the majority of women who seek support for their\u00a0menopause\u00a0can be effectively supported within primary care by their GP, approximately 25% of symptomatic women will require specialist medical expertise in\u00a0menopause.\u00a0Specifically, this cohort of women will fall within four broad categories:<ol type=\"1\"><li>Treatment does not improve their menopausal symptoms;<li>They have on-going troublesome side effects e.g. bleeding;<li>They have contra-indications to HRT; and<li>There is uncertainty about the most suitable treatment option for their menopausal symptoms e.g. complex medical history.<\/ol>The intention is that these more complex cases can be dealt with in a number of specialist\u00a0menopause\u00a0clinics being developed around the country.<\/p><p>In September 2021, I announced my commitment to establish dedicated specialist\u00a0menopause\u00a0clinics across Ireland. The Women&rsquo;s Health Action Plan 2022-23 committed to developing 4 specialist menopause clinics nationally in 2022. In April, I announced further investment to support 2 additional specialist Menopause Clinics, bringing a total of 6 such clinics nationwide for women who require complex, specialist care. These clinics will form a core part of a new approach to\u00a0menopause\u00a0care for women in Ireland and will be supported by enhanced community and primary care supports as well as the publication of targeted and trusted sources of information for women experiencing\u00a0menopause.<\/p><p>Specialist\u00a0menopause\u00a0clinics will be provided in Dublin, Limerick, Galway and Cork working to complement the\u00a0menopause\u00a0support available to women in their community.<\/p><p>The first specialist\u00a0menopause\u00a0clinic in the National Maternity Hospital opened in December 2021. The clinic is\u00a0multidisciplinary,\u00a0supported by GPs with a certified special interest in the area of\u00a0menopause\u00a0and by\u00a0clinical nurse\/midwife specialists. In addition to seeing women who meet the clinical criteria for referral to the service, the clinical team also provides advice and guidance to GPs in the community to support the effective management of menopausal symptoms for women closer to home within primary care.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>Additional activity underway and planned in the area of\u00a0menopause\u00a0includes:<\/p> <blockquote> \t-  \u200eGP training is a key aspect of women receiving the best care through\u00a0menopause. The Irish College of GPs are active members of the Women's Health Taskforce and continue to be engaged on how women's health can be better considered within the primary care setting. Relevant activity includes the collaboration between ICGP and the British\u00a0Menopause\u00a0Society to develop training in\u00a0menopause\u00a0management, which is currently in place; an ICGP Women&rsquo;s Health Webinar on\u00a0menopause\u00a0and endometriosis which was held in June 2021 and had 1567 attendees; and a GP Education course which was established in September 2021 in the area of Community Gynaecology\u00a0which includes\u00a0menopause\u00a0as a topic.

Irish organic beef is also exported to Germany, Britain, Netherlands and the Nordics, however, it is difficult to get an indication of export market share at this time. <\/p>  <p>  Organic beef production in Ireland has been estimated at 3,150 tonnes in 2021 which accounts for less than one per cent of overall beef production (619,800 tonnes CSO).<\/p>  <p>  Bord Bia, under the aegis of\u00a0the Department, continues to invest in identifying and supporting export market opportunities for Irish organic companies (including those seeking to export beef) through their network of overseas offices and trade events. <\/p>  <p>  Central to this is the planned return to the BioFach trade fair in July 2022. This is the leading trade fair for organic produce in Europe. Bord Bias organic client companies will be able to build new business and generate new leads.

Amendments to the mackerel\u00a0policy\u00a0in 2010 and 2017 were introduced following a\u00a0full review and public consultation. It should be noted that the 2017 policy is subject to legal challenge in the Courts.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Consultation on the management of quotas within\u00a0National Policy is carried out each month at the Quota Management Advisory Committee (QMAC) meeting involving fishing industry representatives from the catching and processing sectors, the Department and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA). The QMAC\u00a0examines in detail the operation of each fishery, available quota and uptake patterns for the different metiers of fishing vessels. Detailed discussions are held taking account of the situation of the fleet and the market. Any issues relating to the management of the Mackerel quota allocation to the relevant fisheries as set down in National Policy,\u00a0 are discussed by the QMAC and recommendations are brought to my attention to inform my\u00a0decision. <\/p>  <p>  As recommended by the QMAC, National Policy for Quota Balancing has been put in place to support the landing obligation for both demersal and pelagic stocks including Mackerel.

It is worth noting that within the EU, most quota systems have been privatised for their main commercial stocks.\u00a0In Ireland, allocations are not owned by the vessel and when an allocation is not fished it is returned to the State for redistribution to the fleet.  This\u00a0 policy helps to support an Irish-owned and operated fleet with operations based in Ireland.  If the fleet were not Irish owned, there would likely be a rapid concentration of ownership in a small number of international companies which are not likely to operate from Ireland and may not have any\u00a0commercial links with Ireland.

In that context it is important to recognise that Ireland is part of the EU single market and participates in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which is the key mechanism for ensuring food security throughout Europe.<\/p>  <p>  Specifically in the context of the Ukrainian crisis, significant implications are being seen across all sectors, including the agri-food sector.<\/p>  <p>  As well as the immediate humanitarian crisis, which must take priority, we need to take the necessary steps to ensure that food security is maintained. The European Commission announced in March, via the communication, \"Safeguarding food security and reinforcing the resilience of food systems\", a range of actions to enhance global food security and support farmers and consumers across the EU in light of rising food prices and input costs.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Commission communication sets out actions in three areas. First, it presents immediate actions to safeguard food security in Ukraine and around the world. Second, it addresses the challenge of food stability in the EU's food system, with a range of measures to support our farmers and maintain affordability for our citizens. Third, it confirms the EU agenda to make our food system sustainable and resilient in the years to come.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  At farm level, the crisis is impacting very significantly on the price of animal feed, fertiliser and fuel. Within my Department, I have established a Rapid Response Team, chaired by the Secretary General, to actively monitor the impacts on agri-food supply chains and to contribute to the whole of Government response to this crisis.<\/p>  <p>  I also established the National Fodder and Food Security Committee headed by Teagasc and tasked it to prepare an industry response to the emerging crisis in feed, fodder, fertiliser and other inputs, and to develop contingency plans and advice to assist farmers in managing their farm enterprises.<\/p>  <p>  There has been a reduction in fertiliser use on farms to date this year in response to Soils, Nutrients and Fertiliser campaign. I tasked Teagasc with developing this roadmap to reduce our dependency on chemical fertiliser, which was launched earlier this year. It is a credible roadmap that will be good for the environment, as well as addressing some of the concerns around fertiliser prices.<\/p>  <p>  In March, I announced a targeted intervention package for the tillage sector worth over &euro;12 million with the aim of supporting the growing of additional tillage and protein crops and the establishment of multispecies swards. This package is aimed at producing more native crops and crops with a low demand for chemical fertiliser, while also reducing our dependency on imports.<\/p>  <p>  The tillage incentive scheme will incentivise farmers to grow additional crops such as barley, oats and wheat this year. The scheme is targeted at increasing the overall tillage area and making a real impact on increasing our supply.<\/p>  <p>  The multispecies sward scheme, including support for red clover, is aimed at reducing nitrogen fertiliser use while maintaining forage yields. Multispecies swards have been proven to reduce our dependency on chemical fertiliser while maintaining forage output.<\/p>  <p>  These targeted measures will help Irish farmers diversify at a time of escalating costs and build resilience against the expected impact of the situation in Ukraine.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this month, I brought a Memo for Information to Government on measures aimed to assist cattle and sheep farmers to produce fodder (silage and\/or hay) during 2022 to prevent a Fodder crisis during the coming winter. My Department is continuing to engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the detail of the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, on the future of Ireland's agri-food sector generally, you will be aware that the new Food Vision 2030 strategy was launched last August. Food Vision is a landmark for the Irish agri-food sector and is honest and upfront about the challenges ahead. Crucially, it proposes solutions and charts a pathway to sustainability in all its dimensions. Food Vision aims for Ireland to be a world leader in Sustainable Food Systems, which would deliver food security and nutrition for all in such a way that the economic, environmental and social basis to generate food and nutrition for future generations are not compromised. This will deliver significant benefits for the Irish agri-food sector itself, for Irish society and the environment.<\/p>  <p>  I am taking a very proactive approach to the crisis in Ukraine.

The ETD prescribes minimum tax rates for fuel with which all Member States must comply. ETD provisions on mineral oils are transposed into national law in Finance Act 1999 (as amended). Finance Act 1999 provides for the application of excise duty, in the form of Mineral Oil Tax (MOT), to specified mineral oils, such as petrol, diesel and Marked Gas Oil (MGO) that are used as motor or heating fuels. Gas oil that qualifies for a reduced rate of MOT is marked green and is usually referred to as MGO, green diesel or agricultural diesel. <\/p>  <p>  MOT is comprised of a non-carbon component and a carbon component. The carbon component is commonly referred to as carbon tax and the non-carbon component is often referred to as &ldquo;excise&rdquo;, &ldquo;fuel excise&rdquo; or &ldquo;fuel duty&rdquo;. The current rate of MOT on MGO is &euro;111.14 per 1000 litres.\u00a0 This compares very favourably to the current rate applied to auto diesel which is &euro;405.38 per 1000 litres.<\/p>  <p>  In March this year, the Minister for Finance reduced the rate on MGO by 2 cents per litre inclusive of VAT from 10 March. The Minister for Finance has also provided for an additional 3 cent (VAT inclusive) reduction in MOT for MGO with effect from 1 May until Budget night in October. This brings the total reduction to 5 cent, reducing the non-carbon component, or excise, to nil. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that those who incur expenses in relation to farm diesel in the course of farming or the trade of agricultural contracting may claim an income tax or corporation tax deduction for these expenses, including any carbon tax charged in respect of the diesel.<\/p>  <p>  I would also note that Section 664A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides further relief on expenditure incurred by farmers in respect of an increase in the carbon tax on farm diesel. It is an additional tax measure for farmers introduced in Budget 2012 which compensates increases in the carbon tax from the 2012 base rate of &euro;15 per tonne of CO2 emission. <\/p>  <p>  This measure means that a farmer may take an income tax or corporation tax deduction for farm diesel (including any carbon tax charged in respect of the diesel) and then a further deduction for farm diesel which is equal to the difference between the carbon tax charged and the carbon tax that would have been charged had it been calculated at the rate of &euro;41.30 per 1,000 litres of farm diesel (the 2012 baseline). <\/p>  <p>  My colleagues across Government and I continue monitor the situation closely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600072#WRH00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Industry","counter":449,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600072#WRH00500"},{"type":"question","counter":450,"qnumday":175,"qnumall":"[26715\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600072#WRH00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his plans if appropriate support will be provided to Irish pig farmers who are struggling to maintain their operations as costs rise exponentially; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1598","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":451,"content":"<p>The continued development of the pigmeat sector is a priority for the Government, given the pivotal role the industry plays in the national economic context.

The advice includes applying sufficient fertiliser on grassland and crops, on the basis of a fodder budget for winter 2022 so as ensure that sufficient fodder is conserved. In addition, Teagasc commenced a nationwide advertisement campaign giving advice to farmers along with extensive engagement with farmer clients. <\/p><p>On the 22nd March 2022, I also announced a Targeted Intervention Package framed around three pillars to support Irish farming families arising both from events in Ukraine and wider global price volatility.

I expect to announce further details on the proposed scheme shortly.  <\/p><p>The financial supports previously announced, and those currently under discussion, will assist farmers in providing sufficient fodder for winter 2022.

loans to persons who are over 50 years of age at the time the loan is approved;<\/p>  <p>  - loans to persons who, at the time the loan is made, have otherwise arranged life assurance, providing for payment of a sum, in the event of death, that will at least cover the outstanding balance on the mortgage.<\/p>  <p>  However, it should also be noted that, as a contractual matter, mortgage lenders could\u00a0still require that a life insurance policy is put in place in such circumstances as a condition\u00a0for the mortgage.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the operation of the life assurance market, the Central Bank expects\u00a0the insurance industry to engage with its customers in an open, fair and transparent manner.\u00a0 However, it is important to note that, subject to compliance with all relevant legal and regulatory requirements governing the provision of life assurance, that\u00a0insurance underwriting decisions and the medical and other evidence required to assist such decision making are a commercial and business matter for the life assurance provider having regard to\u00a0their own risk analysis. <\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, if an applicant for a mortgage and\/or\u00a0life assurance\u00a0is not satisfied with the way\u00a0a regulated firm is dealing with them, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  If an applicant for a mortgage\/life assurance\u00a0is not satisfied with the response from the regulated entity to that complaint, the\u00a0person may then submit the matter\u00a0to the statutory and independent Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600075#WRL00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":602,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600075#WRL00900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Civil Service","counter":601,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600075#WRL00800"},{"type":"question","counter":602,"qnumday":227,"qnumall":"[27021\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600075#WRL00900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will report on the civil service blended working policy framework; if his Department, in collaboration with civil service employers, trade unions and staff associations have finalised and developed their tailored policies on blended working that are appropriate to their business needs and employees; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1609","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":603,"content":"<p>The Blended Working Policy Framework for Civil Service Organisations was published on Thursday 31st March 2022.

The current status of progress on tailored, individual policies is for individual Departments to comment on, although in general, the Civil Service as a whole has kept pace on the development of their policies. Within my own Department, a draft local policy has undergone engagement with local staff representatives and is expected to be submitted to the local Management Board for further review at their next meeting.

such as disability, unemployment or caring.\u00a0 This ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need and that resources are targeted to those who need them most.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Means are any income belonging to the carer and their spouse, civil partner, or cohabitant and includes earnings, property, (except their own home) or an asset that could bring in money or provide them with an income, for example occupational pensions, or pensions or benefits from another country.\u00a0 Where an applicant has a second property (other than their own home), the capital value of the property, less any outstanding mortgage, will be assessed as part of the means test.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The current income disregard and means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is the most generous within the social welfare system.\u00a0 The amount of weekly earnings disregarded is &euro;332.50 for a single person and &euro;665 for a couple.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Since my appointment as Minister for Social Protection, supporting carers has been a key priority for me.

supporting them in that role.\u00a0 Accordingly, the current State Pension (Contributory) system includes a range of measures including PRSI credits, Homemaking Disregards and HomeCaring Periods to recognise caring periods outside of paid employment in the calculation of a State Pension payment.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  HomeCaring Periods may be awarded for each week not already covered by a paid or credited social insurance contribution (regardless of when they occurred) to a maximum of 20 years. \u00a0Only one person can benefit from a HomeCaring Period for supporting a child or adult at one time.\u00a0 HomeCaring Periods can only be used under the Interim Total Contributions Approach (also known as the Aggregated Contribution Method) of pension calculation. \u00a0HomeCaring Periods relate to full-time care for:<\/p>  <p>  - a child or children under\u00a0the age of 12 years of age;<\/p>  <p>  - a child or children over\u00a0the age of 12 who needed an increased level of care;

the carer is in receipt of Child Benefit.\u00a0 If the foster carer is not in receipt of Child Benefit, s\/he can still qualify for HomeCaring Periods provided the caring periods are confirmed by Tusla.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Since April 2019, all new State Pension (Contributory) applications are assessed under all possible payment rate calculation methods, including the Yearly Average and the Interim Total Contributions Approach, with the most beneficial rate paid to the pensioner.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo; includes a commitment to examine options for a pension solution for carers, the majority of whom are women, particularly those of incapacitated children, in recognition of the enormous value of the work carried out by them.\u00a0 The Pensions Commission was established in November 2020 to examine the sustainability of the State Pension system and the Social Insurance Fund.\u00a0 The Commission&rsquo;s terms of reference included consideration of how people who have provided long-term care for incapacitated dependants can be accommodated within the State Pension system.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report was published on 7th October 2021.\u00a0\u00a0It established that the current State Pension system is not sustainable into the future and that changes are needed.\u00a0\u00a0The report set out a wide-range of recommendations, including enhanced pension provision\u00a0for long-term carers.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In the interests both of older people and future generations of older people, the Government is considering the comprehensive and far reaching recommendations in the Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report very carefully and holistically.\u00a0\u00a0My

National Childcare Scheme (or the Affordable Childcare Scheme):<\/p><p>- Currently, universal subsidies are available to all families with children under 3 years old. They are also available to families with children over 3 years who have not yet qualified for the free preschool programme (ECCE). This subsidy is not means tested and provides 50c per hour towards the cost of a registered childcare place for a maximum of 45 hours per week.<\/p><p>- Income Assessed Subsidies are available to families with children aged between 24 weeks and 15 years. This subsidy is means tested and will be calculated based on your individual circumstances. The rate will vary depending on family income, child&rsquo;s age and educational stage, and the number of children in the family. The maximum available income assessed  subsidy dependent on the aforementioned conditions is &euro;5.10 per hour or a maximum weekly subsidy of &euro;229.50.<\/p><p>Budget 2022 announced a number of changes to the NCS which will be rolled out this year. The first change removes the practice of deducting hours spent in pre-school or school from the entitlement to NCS subsidised hours, benefiting an estimated 5,000 children from low income families. This came into effect on 2 May 2022. The second change will extend the NCS universal subsidy to all children under 15 from September 2022, benefiting up to 40,000 children. Full year estimates of these changes have been factored into the costs below but the impact of these changes will not be fully known until Q4 2022.<\/p><p>The estimated costs based on the scenarios presented are derived from current levels of usage and expenditure adjusted for the Budget 22 changes. These individual estimates are based on no behavioural change and should be interpreted with caution. It should be noted that changes to subsidies may result in changes to patterns and levels of usage by families. These changes are likely to be more pronounced at higher rates of increase.<\/p><p>Based on the above, the following are the estimated costs and estimated children affected , assuming that the minimum targeted subsidy is increased so as never to be below the universal subsidy:<\/p><p>- 50 cent - &euro;60 million &ndash; 37,200 children<\/p><p>- &euro;1 - &euro;102 million &ndash; 43,500 children<\/p><p>- &euro;1.50 - &euro;164 million &ndash; 50,600 children<\/p><p>- &euro;2 - &euro;212 million (equates to &euro;100 per week at 40 hours per week*)&ndash; 58,300 children<\/p><p>- &euro;2.50 - &euro;261 million &ndash; 66,700 children<\/p><p>- &euro;3 - &euro;314 million &ndash; 76,200 children<\/p><p>- &euro;3.50 - &euro;402 million &ndash; 101,700 children<\/p><p>- &euro;4 - &euro;466 million &ndash; 116,500 children<\/p><p>- &euro;4.50 - &euro;526 million &ndash; 119,300 children  <\/p><p>- &euro;5 - &euro;586 million &ndash; 119,900 children<\/p><p>*It is assumed that the &euro;20 per week referenced by the Deputy is for an individual using 40 hours universal at .50 per hour.

However, the Government decision to commence Direct Provision dates back to 1999. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform had responsibility at that time for the international protection process in Ireland and in 2001 set up an internal agency called the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) to administer the Direct Provision system.<\/p>  <p>  The system of Direct Provision of accommodation and related services came about as a result of an increasing number of international protection applicants arriving into the State in 1999. Prior to this, asylum seekers were treated as homeless under the structures then in place. These proved unsuited to the situation facing Ireland in 1999 and subsequent years, when the number of applicants for international protection arriving in Ireland increased significantly. A total of 7,724 applications were received in 1999 and a further 10,938 in the following year. Of these, most presented themselves in Dublin. The homeless service of the then Eastern Health Board could not cope and there was a serious prospect of widespread homelessness among applicants.<\/p>  <p>  In response, the then Minister for Justice, John O'Donoghue T.D., chaired a cross-departmental group to examine the issue. From this, the Directorate for Asylum Support Services (DASS), under the aegis of the then Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, was established in November 1999 to co-ordinate the scheme of dispersal and Direct Provision for asylum seekers. DASS was subsequently replaced by the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) on 2 April, 2001.\u00a0 It had as a core principle that applicants would be located in centres across Ireland rather than concentrated in Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  The Direct Provision system did not relate only to the Department of Justice.\u00a0 It was set up as a whole of Government approach to provide services to arriving International Protection applicants. The Government made a decision that protection applicants could access services, such as health and education, through the existing mainstream services.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is not aware of any academic research that was carried out at the time of commencement.\u00a0 Rather, a number of working groups were established to make recommendations on the improvement of the system in subsequent years, notably the 2015 McMahon Working Group and report, and most recently the report of the Catherine Day Advisory Group, which informed the White Paper to End Direct Provision and to Establish a New International Protection Support Service. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Government is committed to ending the current system of Direct Provision and to replace it with a new International Protection policy, centred on a not-for-profit approach. Last year, I published &lsquo;A White Paper to End Direct Provision and to Establish a New International Protection Support Service&rsquo;, which sets out how a replacement to the Direct Provision system will be structured and the steps to achieving it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600078#WRO01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Childhood Care and Education","counter":784,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600078#WRO01700"},{"type":"question","counter":785,"qnumday":294,"qnumall":"[27054\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600078#WRO01800","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the number of early childhood care and education-only childcare providers, that is, providers that do not offer a service outside of ECCE provision; the amount of annual funding they received; the number of childcare providers in receipt of state funding in same; the amount of annual funding received; the number of providers in receipt of funding that do not provide ECCE; and the amount of annual funding received in 2020 and 2021, respectively.","asker":"1449","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":786,"content":"<p>The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme is a universal two-year pre-school programme available to all children within the eligible age range.

The remainder came from State funding. This percentage was found to vary significantly across services. Many services rely entirely on State funding while others services rely exclusively on parental fees. In a sustainable service, it is expected that the income to services (from both parental\u00a0fees\u00a0and State funding) exceeds the costs of delivering\u00a0services.<\/p><p>The income and costs data captured as part of the Review have underpinned the substantial Covid-19 supports secured including the exemption for employers in the ELC and SAC sector to the rule in the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) of having to demonstrate the reduction in turnover that was required of other employers.<\/p><p>Data for this Review was collected prior to the Covid-19 pandemic so the analysis of the breakdown of services' income between State funding and parental fees does not take account of the special financial supports that were made available to the sector from March 2020. <\/p><p>However, data available through the Annual Early\u00a0Years\u00a0Sector Profile survey shows that fees have remained largely static since the onset of Covid-19.\u00a0 At the same time, numbers of children attending services have reduced.\u00a0 This may rebound as parental working patterns change. \u00a0<\/p><p>My Department is committed to the importance of collecting high quality income and cost data.\u00a0In 2021, a new supplementary income and costs survey was circulated to all providers alongside the Annual Early Years Sector Profile survey, administered by Pobal on behalf of the Department. In 2022, the income and cost survey has been incorporated in to the Sector Profile and I am pleased that 83% of services have already completed this. This up to date sectoral data will provide a strong basis to inform future policy development and investment decisions.<\/p><p>With regard to State spending in 2020 and\u00a02021,\u00a0it is important to note that these were distorted years, due to Covid-19 effects.\u00a0 Expenditure data in relation to the sector from my Department is as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th><\/th>       <th>2020 <\/th>       <th>2021 <\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Original \/ Revised Allocation<\/td>       <td>&euro;590.9* <\/td>       <td>&euro;637,9<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Expenditure <\/td>       <td>&euro;       507.9m<\/td>       <td>&euro;         593.5m**<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Notes <\/td>       <td>*2020 was a revised figure<\/td>       <td>** It is important to note that 2021 Expenditure figures are provisional and yet   to be finalised<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>As we are only partially through 2022, I cannot provide State spending, but can advise that the allocation in Budget 2022 was &euro;716.7 million. \u00a0<\/p><p>This expenditure\u00a0data does not include, for example, expenditure on\u00a0the EWSS, which has been available to ELC and SAC employers in the sector between August 2020 and April 2022. The EWSS at enhanced\u00a0rates (from October 2020-January 2022) equated to &euro;34 million per month for the ELC and SAC sector, covering on average 80% of payroll costs and 50% of total operating costs for providers.\u00a0 Standard EWSS (from August 2020-October 2020 and for February 2022) equated to &euro;22 million per month , covering on average 50% of payroll costs and 38% of total operating costs for providers, and a flat\u00a0rate of &euro;100 from March-April\u00a0 2022, amounting to &euro;11 million per month, covering on average, 25% staff costs or 11% total operating costs.This expenditure\u00a0data also excludes the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) that was operated by Revenue in 2020.<\/p><p>Given the significant distortion that occurred in the sector throughout 2020 and 2021, in terms of both income from fees with reduced attendance of children, and public income, with various exceptional funding arrangements in place, it is not possible to make robust estimates about the split in services&rsquo; income from public and private sources during this time. \u00a0<\/p><p>Core Funding, with\u00a0a total full year cost equivalent to &euro;221 million,\u00a0will be of\u00a0particular interest\u00a0with regard to the relationship between\u00a0State investment and parental fees. Core Funding is the new funding stream to start a partnership between the State and providers to\u00a0support delivery of ELC and SAC for the public good, for quality and affordability for children, parents and families.\u00a0<\/p><p>Core Funding will introduce a fee freeze for the September 2022-August 2023 programme year.

Specifically, on average, staffing costs were found to account for approximately 70% of the total cost of delivering ELC across all services.

The rates of participation in early learning and childcare are also lower than European averages. As investment in subsidisation grows in the coming years as committed to in First 5 and the Programme for Government, demand from parents will also increase.<\/p>  <p>  In the coming years, NDP capital funding allocated to early learning and childcare will be used to increase the stock of early learning and childcare infrastructure, in order to address capacity challenges including the undersupply for certain types of provision and in specific areas of the country.<\/p>  <p>  (3) First 5 Initiatives: First 5 (Government Strategy for babies, young children and their families 2019 -2028) was launched in 2018 and was re-committed to in the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future.

This will enable significant capital investment in early learning and childcare during the lifetime of the NDP over three pillars as follows:<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0(1) Modernisation: Much of the existing early learning and childcare infrastructure that was previously delivered by large scale capital programmes is now in need of upgrading and modernisation in order to be fully compliant with new regulations and more recent guidelines, as well as to maximise energy efficiency.

The rates of participation in early learning and childcare are also lower than European averages. As investment in subsidisation grows in the coming years as committed to in First 5 and the Programme for Government, demand from parents will also increase.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0In the coming years, NDP capital funding allocated to early learning and childcare will be used to increase the stock of early learning and childcare infrastructure, in order to address capacity challenges including the undersupply for certain types of provision and in specific areas of the country.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0(3) First 5 Initiatives: First 5 (Government Strategy for babies, young children and their families 2019 -2028) was launched in 2018 and was re-committed to in the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future.

An award letter was sent on that day 28th April 2020 advising she had been awarded Postgraduate Tuition Fees to a maximum of &euro;6,270 and the special adjacent rate of maintenance grant.<\/p>  <p>  The application was reviewed as part of a Post-Award Review on 15th October 2020 and a further award letter confirming she had been awarded Postgraduate Tuition Fees to a maximum of &euro;6,270 and the special adjacent rate of maintenance grant was sent on 19th October 2020. <\/p>  <p>  An internal review request was received regarding this application on 19th October 2020 regarding the adjacency rate awarded.<\/p>  <p>  The assessment team in SUSI investigated this placement and based on information from the college&rsquo;s website the placement is for two days a in SUSI week on placement and the rest of the week is on campus. Therefore, as the placement is not for a period of at least one semester off-campus the adjacency rate cannot change as more time is spent on campus than off campus. The applicant was advised of this by telephone on 26 October 2021. The Internal Review Team issued the following determination. &ldquo;As the placement\/course is split throughout the week as stated on the college website, the placement is not full time and therefore will not affect adjacency.&rdquo; The student further contacted SUSI on 30th August 2021 to query why she had not been awarded the non-adjacent rate of maintenance. Her application was reviewed and a letter to advise her that there had been no change to the original decision to award her the adjacent rate of grant was sent to her on 2nd September 2021. SUSI received a Notice of Appeal regarding adjacency for the 2020\/2021 academic year on 17th December 2021 and a letter was sent to the applicant on 22nd December 2021 advising that the appeal could not be accepted as it was received outside the maximum 60-day timeframe.<\/p>  <p>  The applicant contacted the Support Desk in SUSI to enquire when the original decision was made and how the 60 days were calculated. The student was advised date of the decision to award her the adjacent rate of grant was 19 October 2020 and the 60 days started then. This would mean the 60-day window to appeal closed on 18 December 2020. As the appeal was received 12 months after this date it could not be considered by the Appeals Officer. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by an appeals officer in SUSI and remains of the view that the scheme has not been interpreted correctly in his\/her case, an appeal may be submitted to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board within the required timeframe (i.e. not later than 30 days after the notification of the determination of the appeals officer to the applicant). My officials have also been informed that the student in question submitted an appeal to the Student Grant Appeals Board in January 2022 however, this could not be heard as an appeal by the Board as the student never submitted an appeal to the SUSI Appeals Officer as per the process outlined above. I would encourage the Deputy to make contact directly with SUSI if she has any additional questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600079#WRP01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Apprenticeship Programmes","counter":853,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600079#WRP01100"},{"type":"question","counter":854,"qnumday":318,"qnumall":"[27151\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600079#WRP01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the availability of a motor mechanical apprenticeship for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":855,"content":"<p>Under the Further Education and Training Act (2013), SOLAS has statutory responsibility for planning, funding, and co-ordinating Further Education and Training (FET) in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  To become an apprentice your constituent will need to be hired by a SOLAS approved employer.

These changes and others make general practice in Ireland a more attractive career choice.<\/p>  <p>  The number of GPs entering training has been increased steadily over the past number of years, rising from 120 in 2009 to 233 in 2021. Responsibility for training has transferred last year from the HSE to the Irish College of General Practitioners and an intake of 258 trainees is planned for this year, with further increases expected for future years.<\/p>  <p>  The measures undertaken will see an increase in the number of GPs working in the State, improving access to GP services for patients throughout the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600080#WRQ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":919,"content":"<p>Question No. 340 answered with Question No. 16.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Infectious Diseases","counter":920,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600080#WRQ00500"},{"type":"question","counter":921,"qnumday":341,"qnumall":"[26278\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600080#WRQ00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress that has been made by the HSE and its medical team to identify the strain of meningitis which has recently resulted in a number of admissions to hospital;

It takes a life course approach, acknowledging the importance of developing a healthy attitude to sexuality in young people and of building on that foundation for positive sexual health and wellbeing into adulthood and older age. The Strategy has been extended to the end of 2022, in order to account for the various impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on previous timelines. <\/p><p>Current priority deliverables under the Strategy are HIV prevention, including the continued expansion of a Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) programme, which commenced in late 2019, and the HIV Fast Track Cities programme, involving Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway. Other key areas of work include expanding access to contraception, free of charge; expanding sexually transmitted infection (STI) services, progressing a population survey on sexual health and improving sexual health education, training and resources, including in schools, higher and further education.<\/p><p>A review of the Strategy began in 2021, having been postponed as a result of the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Focus group meetings were held with key stakeholders, including clinical and public health staff, the HSE Sexual Health and Crisis Pregnancy Programme (SHCPP) team, those working in STI clinics, the education sector, the Department of Health and Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce, the research and academic sector and organisations representing the LGBTI+ community.<\/p><p>The detailed feedback from these meetings has been collated and will inform the future direction of the next iteration of the strategy. An external review of the Strategy has been approved and is currently being commissioned through standard procurement processes. It is envisaged that the procurement process will conclude by July, with the Review to take 3-4 months once commenced. When complete, the Report will be published on the Healthy Ireland website. Results will, in turn, inform future policy direction and the Women's Health Taskforce will continue to provide input as the policy is implemented. <\/p><p>Following the completion of the Review, and taking into account its recommendations, drafting of a renewed National Sexual Health Strategy will commence. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600080#WRQ04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1608"},{"type":"question","counter":968,"qnumday":358,"qnumall":"[27049\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600080#WRQ04600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the implementation of the Hepatitis C strategy; if a screening programme for persons born between 1965 and 1985 is being considered; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":969,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600080#WRQ04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products","counter":970,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600080#WRQ04800"},{"type":"question","counter":971,"qnumday":359,"qnumall":"[27050\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600080#WRQ04900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the drug reimbursement process will be streamlined to ensure that potentially life-saving drugs can be accessed sooner by patients in need of them; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":972,"content":"<p>The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicines under the community drugs schemes, in accordance with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013. The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In line with the 2013 Health Act and the national framework agreed with industry, a company must submit an application to the HSE to have a new medicine added to the reimbursement list.<\/p>  <p>  Reimbursement is for licenced indications which have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency or the Health Products Regulatory Authority.<\/p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (the NCPE).\u00a0 \u00a0They use a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.<\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the IPHA agreement, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving an application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse the medicine.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an ongoing basis it must ensure that the best price is achieved. This can lead to protracted commercial engagements.<\/p>  <p>  When there is a proposed decision by the HSE not to support reimbursement of a medicine, there is an extension in this timeline.\u00a0 This is due to the requirement of the HSE to issue a &ldquo;notice of proposal&rdquo;, and to allow 28 days for manufacturers to make representations to the HSE to reconsider their decision. The HSE must then consider those representations and make a formal decision.<\/p>  <p>  The current process for assessing applications works very well where new medicines have strong evidence of clinical effectiveness, are priced in a cost-effective manner.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The principal factors in determining the speed of reimbursement are the price at which a manufacturer applies for the reimbursement of a product, the availability of Exchequer funding, and the outcome of the HSE&rsquo;s rigorous assessment process as to its clinical and cost-effectiveness.

Substantial key achievements last year and this year to date include approval of the Government&rsquo;s National Elective Ambulatory Strategy and progressing plans for new elective hospitals in Cork, Galway and Dublin; publication of the Business Case for Regional Health Areas to support the alignment of community and hospital services based on defined population need; and mainstreaming innovation through the Sl&aacute;intecare Integration Fund.<\/p><p>New governance structures have been put in place, including the new Sl&aacute;intecare Programme Board, co-chaired by the Secretary-General of the Department of Health and the Chief Executive Officer of the HSE, to ensure that implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare is fully embedded and owned across the Department of Health and the HSE.<\/p><p>Work is being finalized on a detailed 2022 Action Plan in order continue to deliver on our Sl&aacute;intecare commitments this year and this will be published in the near future. Key areas of focus this year will include addressing waiting lists, further developments in shifting care to the Community, further investment in innovation, enhanced capacity and access to care, implementing digital and eHealth solutions in line with Government&rsquo;s recently published national digital framework &ldquo;Harnessing Digital&rdquo;, introducing the Sl&aacute;intecare Consultant Contract, progressing the National Elective Ambulatory Strategy through the provision of new elective capacity in Cork, Dublin and Galway, and the realignment of acute and community services via Regional Health Areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600081#WRR02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":1014,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600081#WRR03000"},{"type":"question","counter":1015,"qnumday":373,"qnumall":"[27121\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600081#WRR03100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the extent to which the concerns of parents of children with mental health problems are regularly monitored with a view to ensuring the availability of adequate residential places; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1016,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600081#WRR03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff","counter":1017,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600081#WRR03300"},{"type":"question","counter":1018,"qnumday":374,"qnumall":"[27122\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600081#WRR03400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the issues that he and his Department have identified as being the most crucial in ensuring the availability and retention of staff at various levels; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1019,"content":"<p>Under Action 25 of the Civil Service Renewal Planthe Civil Service as a whole committed to carrying out a series of employee engagement surveys, the first of which was undertaken in September 2015.

This designation is for medicines developed for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of rare diseases that are life-threatening or very serious. The European Commission decides whether to grant an orphan designation for the medicine based on the COMP's opinion. The application process for this designation takes a maximum of 90 days from validation.<\/p>  <p>  In the EU, medicines for rare diseases must be authorised by the European Commission under the &lsquo;centralised procedure&rsquo;. It is therefore not open to Irish authorities to grant a marketing authorisation for orphan medicines outside of this framework. Evaluating a marketing-authorisation application under the centralised procedure can take up to 210 days, not counting clock stops when applicants have to provide additional information. It is possible for an orphan medicine sponsor to submit an application through an accelerated assessment procedure. This procedure reduces the timeframe for the EMA to review the marketing-authorisation application to 150 days, not including any clock stops.

There are many reasons for such shortages including shortages of raw materials, manufacturing difficulties, logistical\/transport issues or product recalls due to potential quality defects.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Medicines shortages can therefore originate at any point in the supply chain and can involve and impact on many different stakeholders. Accordingly, medicines shortages require a multi-faceted, multi-stakeholder response to ensure patient safety, continuity of care and protection of public health. Ireland has a multi-stakeholder medicines shortages framework in place, coordinated by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), to prevent, wherever possible, and manage medicine shortages when they occur.<\/p>  <p>  The HPRA is aware of the current challenges regarding the intermittent supply of some hormone replacement therapies (HRT). The HPRA has had regular and ongoing engagement with suppliers in this regard. The companies that place the products on the market have indicated that the current supply difficulties are due to a significantly increased demand for these medicines in Ireland in recent years. To illustrate, the supply of one range of HRT patches has increased by between 77% and 117%, for the three most-used strengths, compared to 2020. In addition, based on demand in recent months, the company expects a similar increase in the demand for all strengths during 2022. This would mean that the usage of this patch in Ireland would be approximately 4.5-7.5 times higher in 2022 (depending on the strength) compared to 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Based on information provided by companies involved in the recent HRT shortages, we now appear to have entered a stabilisation period in supply. During this stabilisation, it is essential that patients do not seek supplies of medicines over and above their normal requirements as doing so will disrupt existing stock levels and hamper the supply of medicines for others. Following a meeting with key stakeholders involved in the supply of HRT products to the Irish market it was agreed to establish a multistakeholder group to closely monitor the supply of HRT until the issue is fully resolved. <\/p>  <p>  The HPRA publishes a medicinal product shortages list on its website, with the reason for the shortage, the expected dates for the return of supply and in some cases, such as HRT shortages, the HSE&rsquo;s clinical guidance on the management of patient treatment in response to medicine shortages. The information is made available to assist healthcare professionals in managing medicine shortages when they do arise and reduce their impact on patients. The information relating to shortages on the HPRA website is dynamic and changes depending on the current information the HPRA has to hand, including removal from the list when a shortage has been resolved.<\/p>  <p>  The HPRA will continue to liaise with suppliers of HRT medicines over the coming weeks with a view to securing updates and commitments regarding the restoration of normal supplies for patients as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600082#WRS01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Reviews","counter":1062,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600082#WRS01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1063,"qnumday":390,"qnumall":"[27179\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600082#WRS01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will implement a review of Ireland's maternity hospitals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1495","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1064,"content":"<p>A comprehensive review of maternity services was carried out by the Health Information and Quality Authority, an independent authority established to drive high-quality and safe care in Ireland. In 2018 and 2019, HIQA undertook a monitoring programme of all 19 maternity units\/hospitals, against the National Standards for Safer Better Maternity Services. Assessment of services undertaken during the monitoring programme focused on four specific themes within the national standards:<\/p>  <p>  -  leadership, governance and management;<\/p>  <p>  -  workforce;<\/p>  <p>  -  effective care and support; and<\/p>  <p>  -  safe care and support.<\/p>  <p>  In 2020, HIQA published an individual report into services at each unit\/hospital, along with an overview report into maternity services nationally. That report is largely positive and the finding of high levels of compliance against most of the Standards assessed during the monitoring programme, is particularly welcome. Importantly however, the report identifies a number of areas where work is required to meet the standards. The HSE has done significant work to address the findings of the report to date, including revising its Implementation Plan for the National Maternity Strategy, in the roll out of the Strategy&rsquo;s model of care and in improved governance of maternity services.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition, funding for the development of maternity services has increased significantly, with a total of almost &euro;16 million allocated specifically for the implementation of the Strategy under Budgets 2021 and 2022. This funding is further improving access to specialist services, including obstetric, endocrinology, perinatal pathology, neonatology, and perineal services, as well as further developing community-based midwifery services. It is also supporting the recruitment of additional WTEs into maternity services across the country, including Consultants, Midwifery\/Nursing posts, Allied Health workers, Healthcare Assistants and Administrative staff.

This work informs the actions required to meet the need for adequately trained doctors in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Department of Health officials engage on an ongoing basis with colleagues in the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and other relevant stakeholders to ensure that we train enough graduates with the skills necessary to support the delivery of health and social care services and to develop a strategic approach to workforce planning for the health sector. <\/p>  <p>  Ongoing discussions between both Departments are in relation to increasing domestic supply of health and Social Care graduates in the short term, through the immediate provision of additional places, and the longer-term planning being undertaken around future skills needs in context of future demand for health and social care services. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600082#WRS05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":1105,"qnumday":404,"qnumall":"[27214\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600082#WRS05700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if   highly skilled and highly in-demand healthcare professionals across the HSE services and in particular in the child disability network team services are being sought  under the current critical shortage  are being sought under critical skills employment permits; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1622","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1106,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600082#WRS05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":1108,"qnumday":405,"qnumall":"[27215\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600082#WRS06000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the recommendations that have been made to his Department by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1622","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1109,"content":"<p>The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) advises the Irish Government, including SOLAS, on skills needs and labour market issues that impact on enterprise and employment growth.\u00a0<\/p><p>My Department has not received any recent\u00a0 recommendations made, by this Group, in relation to the skill needs of the health sector, and is not aware of any plans to do so in their future work programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600082#WRS06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":1112,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600083#WRT00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Gorse Burning","counter":1111,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600083#WRT00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1112,"qnumday":406,"qnumall":"[27194\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600083#WRT00300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the actions that he is taking to address illegal gorse fires; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":1113,"content":"<p>The burning of vegetation is controlled by the Wildlife Acts. It is an offence under Section 40 of the Wildlife Act, 1976 (amended by Section 46 of the Wildlife Act, 2000) to burn, from 1st March to 31st August in any year, any vegetation growing on any land not then cultivated. Individuals who are found to burn vegetation within that prohibited period are liable to prosecution by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS).\u00a0 My Department\u00a0has no role in regard to prosecutions.<\/p>  <p>  Wildfire activity for 2022 is significantly reduced in comparison to recent years and current burned area is estimated at just over 2500ha. In recent years average burned area is approximately 3800ha. The recent reduction is considered to be a result of reduced levels of agricultural burning observed during this season, coupled with meteorological factors influencing fire risk. The majority of land affected during 2022 to date is not farmland or used for agricultural purposes.<\/p>  <p>  Wildfire is an easily preventable threat to our beautiful hills and bogs and the habitats and livelihoods they sustain. Everyone must play their part in protecting our landscapes and supporting our emergency services and ensuring they are not needlessly diverted by illegal fires.<\/p>  <p>  There is a inherent natural risk of fire in our uplands and on bogs at this time of year, due to the condition of vegetation in these area. Upland grasses, heather and gorse are highly flammable in spring when the\u00a0weather is dry.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In the right conditions, any ignition, for any reason, can give rise to wildfires. Both landowners and the wider public, whether they are at work or enjoying the countryside, should be mindful of the significant risks of fire at this time of year and be aware of the damage to land and habitats caused by illegal burning and other accidental and unintentional ignitions.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  My Department conducts a number of activities annually to monitor and reduce wildfire incidence and outcomes.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has issued reminders to all landowners in relation to illegal burning of agricultural lands, and any land found to have been burned illegally can be deemed ineligible across a number of area-based schemes.\u00a0 My Department also monitors fire activity and risk throughout the main risk period between March and September, using a variety of means at our disposal, including satellite detection and ground inspections.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has also undertaken a number of awareness measures aimed at reducing the level of illegal ignitions, particularly on farmland, and in ensuring that affected sectors are fully prepared for fire outbreaks where these occur. This includes the provision of Fire Danger Rating Notices to relevant sectors and Departments to ensure that the correct level of preparedness is maintained throughout the fire season. My Department also encourages the safe use of fire by land managers during the open burning season, and provides guidance for doing so.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that wildfire ignitions occur from a variety of sources, not just agriculture, and many recent fires have occurred on lands with no associated agricultural activity, including lands used for turf cutting, and public lands with open access used by the public for recreation. Fires associated with illegal dumping on bogland are a particular problem. In 2020, some of the largest and most problematic fires occurred as a result of recreational land user activities.<\/p>  <p>  The farming community has a central role to play in the control of fire in our landscapes through the management of land, and the reduction and maintenance of fire prone vegetation (such purple moor grass, heather, and gorse\/whin) as potential fuels in high fire risk areas. <\/p>  <p>  To this end, my Department supports a number of locally-led schemes under the EIP-AGRI measure that in turn support the implementation of fire management activities on the ground including vegetation management activities. Projects of this type are now in place in many of the main fire risk locations in Ireland, including the Blackstairs Mountains, Wicklow Mountains, McGillicuddy Reeks, Inishowen Peninsula, Connemara, and within the Hen Harrier Project.<\/p>  <p>  The Hen Harrier project is a\u00a0results-based project, supported by my Department, covering key habitats across a number of different counties. The project \u00a0has recently developed and implemented a number of specific fire management measures including upland grazing management and support, the development of ponds in high risk areas that can provide water for aerial fire fighting operations, and the safe use of fire as a land management tool by landowners. The project also liaises directly with relevant local fire services in areas where it operates. <\/p>  <p>  All of the upland projects involve fire management education and awareness building activities directly with landowners through project agricultural advisors and direct inputs from local fire and rescue services and experts from my Department and Teagasc.<\/p>  <p>  My Department activated its Fire Danger Rating System back in March of this year for the fire season ahead and to date four such Fire Danger Notices notices have been issued, ahead of risk weather phases.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I advise\u00a0Forest owners and managers to\u00a0check and update their fire plans and other relevant contingencies such as insurance, firebreaks, access and water points, and private helicopter contracts etc., so as to be prepared well in advance of high fire risk phases. Rural dwellers should also assess wildfire risks to their homes and properties and prepare accordingly. Guidance for this is available from the Office of Emergency Planning &ldquo;Be Summer Ready&rdquo; awareness campaign\u00a0www.gov.ie\/summerready.<\/p>  <p>  There has been a very significant increase in the use of outdoor amenities and recreation sites by the public since the onset of COVID-19. This is a very welcome development, however forest visitors are reminded not to light fires or use barbeques, to behave responsibly, observe relevant local bye-laws, observe correct physical distancing practice and to park considerately so as not to impede access of emergency vehicles to incidents.<\/p>  <p>  There is a very firm link in recent years between serious wildfire ignitions and illegal dumping and burning of domestic waste in many areas, and malicious burning at forest amenity sites and turf bogs open to the public. <\/p>  <p>  My Department asks all countryside users to be vigilant, to report any suspicious activity to An Garda Siochana, and to report any uncontrolled or unattended fires immediately to the Fire and Emergency Services via 112\/999 service. We all have our part to play in protecting our countryside from uncontrolled fires.<\/p>  <p>  Fire warnings can be accessed at:\u00a0www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/642e6-forestry\/\u00a0and\u00a0www.teagasc.ie\/crops\/forestry\/forest-fire-risk\/.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600083#WRT00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Programme for Government","counter":1114,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600083#WRT00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1115,"qnumday":407,"qnumall":"[27162\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052600083#WRT00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the status of Programme for Government commitments to complete a land use review ahead of the drafting of a land use strategy and a national soil strategy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":1116,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government: 'Our Shared Future' committed to a land use review to ensure that optimal land use options inform all relevant government decisions.\u00a0 This land use evidence review is also noted in  the Climate Action Plan published in (Nov 2021).\u00a0 <\/p><p>The review balances environmental social and economic conditions and will involve a process of evaluation of the ecological characteristics of the land, consideration of emissions to air and water, carbon sequestration and climate adaption challenges.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The review is being overseen by a Steering Committee co-chaired by my Department and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC).\u00a0 The steering committee is made up of representatives from my Department, Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications\u00a0Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage) as well as independent nominees.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The Land use review is being carried out in two distinct phases:<\/p><p>Phase One is an evidential review which is being led by\u00a0 the EPA and is being guided by a cross-governmental technical steering group.\u00a0 Phase one aims to provide an evidence base to determine an appropriate land use indicator set for Ireland, as well as determining the environmental, ecological, and economic characteristics of land types across Ireland. <\/p><p>The EPA is working with Government Departments and public sector colleagues to assess the available evidence in the following areas:<\/p><p>-  The impact of current land use on the environment and society<\/p><p>-  The indicators we can use to measure land use impacts on environment and society<\/p><p>-  The environmental and societal trends that will impact on land use<\/p><p>-  Ireland&rsquo;s land use stakeholders<\/p><p>-  The commitments and targets in existing policy that impact on land use decisions<\/p><p>-  Land use practices that have proven beneficial to environment and society<\/p><p>In summary, Phase one of the national Land Use Evidence Review will gather the data and evidence to report on the environmental, ecological, and socio-economic characteristics and considerations for land use and land-based activities across Ireland, including how they interact with each other, with a view to informing the Policy Development ambitions for Phase two of the Evidence Review.

At farm level, the crisis is already impacting very significantly on the price of fertiliser, animal feed and fuel.<\/p>  <p>  Within my Department, I have established a Rapid Response Team to actively monitor the impacts on agri-food supply chains and to contribute to the whole of Government response. <\/p>  <p>  I also established the National Fodder and Food Security Committee headed by Teagasc and tasked it to prepare an industry response and to develop contingency plans &amp;amp; advice to assist farmers in managing their farm enterprises. <\/p>  <p>  I have announced a number of measures over the past three months to assist the agriculture sector and am currently considering what additional measures will be necessary.<\/p>  <p>  Fuel has seen a very significant price rises in recent months. While primary responsibility for the taxation of fuel is with the Minister for Finance, I continue to work closely with him to ensure that the tax code reflects the Government&rsquo;s priorities for the agri-food sector. Ireland&rsquo;s taxation of fuel is governed by European Union law as set out in the Energy Tax Directive and the Finance Act 1999 provides for the application of excise duty, in the form of Mineral Oil Tax. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, gas oil that qualifies for a reduced rate of Mineral Oil Tax is marked green and is usually referred to as Marked Gas Oil (MGO), green diesel or agricultural diesel. <\/p>  <p>  Mineral Oil Tax is comprised of a non-carbon component and a carbon component. The carbon component is commonly referred to as carbon tax and the non-carbon component is often referred to as &ldquo;excise&rdquo;. In March this year the Minister for Finance reduced the excise rate on agricultural diesel by 2 cents per litre and then again by an additional 3 cent from 1st May. This total reduction of 5 cent reduces the non-carbon component, or excise, to nil. <\/p>  <p>  The current rate of Mineral Oil Tax on agricultural diesel is &euro;111.14 per 1000 litres. This compares very favourably to the current rate applied to auto diesel which is &euro;405.38 per 1000 litres.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that those who incur expenses in relation to farm diesel in the course of farming or the trade of agricultural contracting may claim an income tax or corporation tax deduction for these expenses, including any carbon tax charged in respect of the diesel.<\/p>  <p>  I also note that Section 664A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides further relief on expenditure incurred by farmers in respect of an increase in the carbon tax on farm diesel. As well as an income tax or corporation tax deduction for farm diesel, a further deduction for farm diesel which is equal to the difference between the carbon tax charged and the carbon tax that would have been charged had it been calculated at the rate of &euro;41.30 per 1,000 litres of farm diesel (the 2012 baseline), is allowed.<\/p>  <p>  I continue to engage with all our stakeholders and continue to work across Government, and with our European partners, to respond to this crisis, using all of the tools at our disposal. I am taking a very proactive approach to the crisis in Ukraine.
