These factors are generally accepted to include global supply chain issues relating to rebounding global demand post COVID-19; and the impact of the invasion of Ukraine on international commodity supplies especially grain\/oilseeds and energy supplies.  These issues are significant and are having impacts right across the economy. <\/p><p>Notwithstanding the issues around supplies and their costs, businesses must behave competitively. The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), which is independent in the exercise of its functions, has powers to:<\/p><p>-  Enforce competition and consumer protection rules that ensure businesses set prices independently and communicate them appropriately to consumers;<\/p><p>-  Ensure that mergers do not result in a significant lessening of competition, which carries a risk of higher pricing;<\/p><p>-  Help to educate and inform consumers so they are able to shop around, and in doing so add to the competitive pressure on businesses when they set their prices; and<\/p><p>-  Conduct a market study if it suspects that there is a market failure or dysfunction that results in pricing that is causing consumer harm.<\/p><p>Excessive pricing may be illegal if a business is in a dominant position, where it faces little competition, and its customers have little bargaining power. When a business is dominant, it is not allowed to abuse its position. Businesses and their pricing decisions are constrained by the need to compete rather than by any legal obligation.<\/p><p>When the CCPC receives complaints about pricing it assesses them to see if they indicate a possible breach of competition or consumer protection law. It can also take action on its own initiative when it suspects there may have been a breach.  <\/p><p>I understand that the Deputy has previously raised the issue of profit margins made by energy providers.  The regulation of energy networks in this country falls under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Environment, Climate, Communications and Transport and, in turn, the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities. However, this is a complex issue and several energy providers across Europe have requested liquidity supports from their governments. The Deputy will also be aware of moves afoot at the EU level to examine some of the underlying structures of energy markets and pricing. <\/p><p>In a market economy like ours, businesses are free to set prices in line with market conditions, provided they are not in a dominant position in the market, and provided they do this without colluding with competitors. There are some exceptions, for example suppliers of energy, telecommunications, postal services, and financial services having an obligation to apply to, or inform, a regulator about pricing changes.  This means that prices can rise, whether that be as a result of increased input costs or an imbalance in supply and demand.While in these situations companies can make profits, this is not necessarily the same as &lsquo;profiteering&rsquo;, which normally refers to emergency situations where a product is in such short supply that any seller with stock is able to set a price independently of any competitive constraint. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500086#WRB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1505"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Redundancy Payments","counter":39,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500086#WRB00800"},{"type":"question","counter":40,"qnumday":23,"qnumall":"[43741\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500086#WRB00900","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if he will clarify the progress made to date on enacting the recommendations of the Plan of Action &ndash; Collective Redundancies in order to protect workers in cases of mass redundancies, tactical insolvencies and other such instances; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1467","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":41,"content":"<p>Work is continuing on implementing the Plan for Action on Collective Redundancies published in June 2021, with some company law changes already made and a number of both employment rights and further company law changes being worked on by my Department.<\/p>  <p>  The Plan sets out several commitments to safeguard further the rights of workers in these circumstances including:<\/p>  <p>1.   amendments to company law and employment law,<\/p>  <p>2.  establishing a new Employment Law Review Group, and<\/p>  <p>3.  the provision of an accessible guidance document.<\/p>  <p>  The Guidance Document was published in December 2021.

The provisions only apply in relation to sales of products to consumers. The 2007 Act repealed the Prices Act 1958 and the Prices (Amendment) Act 1972 which had similar provisions. It should be noted that the 1958 Act was brought in as Ireland emerged from rationing and was likely to have been employed to stem hoarding and the inflationary impact arising from sudden demands, as supply restrictions were relaxed.<\/p>  <p>  In general, maximum ceilings are not set for prices in Ireland. Such an approach aims to promote competition amongst retailers and service providers. Some sectors are regulated and, depending on the sector, the regulator can influence. <\/p>  <p>  Price controls are crude instruments in terms of their aims, and their use may lead to distortions in the market. The setting of too low a price would affect availability and supply, making a bad situation worse. While prices for a controlled product will have stabilised, the pricing could cause a shortfall in availability, withdrawal of supply, reduction in quality, and have a more lasting damage on the supply chain network as retailers and suppliers withdraw from the market for commercial reasons.  On the other hand, the setting of too high a price would make the measure ineffective.<\/p>  <p>  To ensure that any imposition of price controls are at just the right point would require a level of foresight on international trends and input price fluctuations as well as a system which would allow prices to be continually reset. Furthermore, the system would require the capability to set prices across products deemed particularly important around which, no doubt, there would be considerable debate as well as a capacity to monitor and enforce pricing. <\/p>  <p>  There could also be risks to our international reputation were Ireland to unilaterally introduce price controls on goods that are internationally traded. Ireland is an open economy. Many of the products we purchase are imported, or significant components of those products are imported. It is very difficult to see how price controls could be successfully implemented when suppliers and manufacturers are relying on imported goods and inputs, the price of which, is not amenable to control.  <\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy, Government is acutely conscious of the cost-of-living challenge for people and the rise of input costs for business at the moment. Our responses must help, and not make the situation worse. The fundamental problems lie with matters outside of our domestic control. So we must help our people and businesses through the challenging period and I am confident that Government will shortly introduce a significant range of further measures to alleviate the pressures felt by people and businesses in this regard.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500086#WRB01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1602"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Prices","counter":49,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500086#WRB01800"},{"type":"question","counter":50,"qnumday":26,"qnumall":"[45101\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500086#WRB01900","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the supports that are available to businesses to undertake energy audits to assist them in driving down their energy costs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1617","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":51,"content":"<p>It&rsquo;s clear that this is a really challenging time for enterprise.

In Ireland we are well positioned to move to renewable energy sources, thereby mitigating the cost and increasing our security of supply. I and officials in my Department have been engaging across Government on efforts to facilitate businesses reduce their energy costs through the use of renewable energy.

This increased demand was also driven by the extension of categories of employment permits following the Review of the Occupational Lists in October 2021.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and I recognised the impact delays in the processing times for employment permits has had for businesses and their workers.  Therefore, an internal plan of action was undertaken which has increased resources and implemented more efficient methods of processing applications in the permits system.  The processing team has trebled in size and daily output has more than trebled compared to 2021 levels.<\/p>  <p>  Since the implementation of this plan, the Employment Permits Unit has made positive progress by reducing the number of applications awaiting processing from c. 11,000 in January 2022 to approximately 2,500 today, despite further strong growth in demand during 2022.  <\/p>  <p>  Processing times for Critical Skills applications from Trusted Partners have fallen from 21 weeks to 3 weeks with Standard applications reduced to 4 weeks.

The system is, by design, vacancy led and managed through the operation of the critical skills and ineligible occupation lists. These lists are usually subject to twice yearly evidence-based review, taking account of labour market research, a public consultation and contextual issues such as Brexit and Covid 19.<\/p>  <p>  Doctors, including non-consultant hospital doctors (NCHDs), are on the critical skills list and are eligible for the Critical Skills Employment Permit.  The Critical Skills Employment Permit is Ireland's premium employment permit and is targeted at highly skilled people in eligible occupations deemed to be critically important to growing Ireland&rsquo;s economy, are highly demanded and highly skilled, and in significant shortage of supply in our labour market.  This permit provides for immediate family reunification, broad access to the labour market for dependants, spouses and partners as well as fast tracking to long term residency after two years. The criteria attached to this permit type includes the requirement for the non-EEA national to have secured a job offer of two years.<\/p>  <p>  In Q4 of 2021 my Department and the Department of Health announced changes to the employment permit system for Non-Consultant Hospital Doctors (NCHDs) in public hospitals or public health facilities.  Going forward these NCHDs will receive a two-year multi-site employment permit, irrespective of the length of the initial employment contract.  Subsequent employment contracts with a different public hospital or public health facility will be accommodated under this initial two-year multi-site General Employment Permit without the requirement to submit a new Employment Permit application.  Doctors who obtain a new multi-site employment permit will be granted a new Stamp 1H from the Department of Justice.  At the end of the 2-year period the NCHD will then be able to apply for Stamp 4 immigration permission.  This will remove hundreds of doctors from both the Employment Permits and Immigration Service Delivery systems and reduce the administrative burden for the public hospitals or public health facilities as well as for the doctors concerned.  This new change will also allow the spouse of doctors on Stamp 1Hs, to obtain a Stamp 1G which allows immediate access to the labour market. This will make Ireland a much more attractive location for internationally mobile doctors and will increase the supply of labour without creating additional housing demand.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, in March this year, I along with the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Health announced further changes to allow non-EEA doctors currently in the State for 21 months or more, holding a General Employment Permit, to apply for a Stamp 4 immigration permission.  A Stamp 4 permission allows the holder the right to work without the requirement to hold a valid employment permit.  This scheme is currently open until 31st October 2022 and full details, along with the appropriate application form are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  When this scheme was open earlier in the year, more than 800 doctors were successful in obtaining a Stamp 4 permission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500088#WRD03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1505"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Industrial Relations","counter":187,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500088#WRD03800"},{"type":"question","counter":188,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[44787\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500088#WRD03900","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if he will report on the recent acceptance of proposals for Employment Regulation Orders for the early years services sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":189,"content":"<p>I was very pleased to accept proposals for the Employment Regulation Orders submitted for the Early Years&rsquo; Services Sector.  <\/p><p>The proposals are a result of lengthy and detailed negotiations before a Joint Labour Committee consisting of representatives from both the employee and employer side, and their commitment to improved workplace relations is to be acknowledged. <\/p><p>This recognition of the crucial work that our childcare providers and their employees do, a majority of whom are women, is of importance to our whole society . <\/p><p>These Orders will commence today, 15 September 2022, and apply to a number of grades within the sector and will provide improved pay and conditions for the large majority of people working in the sector, as follows: <\/p><p>- &euro;13.00 for Early Years Educators\/ School-Age Childcare practitioners;<\/p><p>- &euro;14.00 for Early Years Lead Educators \/ School-Age Childcare co-ordinators;<\/p><p>- &euro;15.50 Graduate Early Years Lead Educators \/ School-Age Childcare co-ordinators<\/p><p>- &euro;15.70 for Deputy Managers;<\/p><p>- &euro;16.50 for Managers; and<\/p><p>- &euro;17.25 for Graduate Managers.<\/p><p>The Orders are being supported by the Government&rsquo;s &euro;221m Core Funding Scheme, which was announced as part of Budget 2022.

The Plan not only aimed to recover employment lost during the pandemic but to promote new employment opportunities through increased labour market activation and by accelerating the provision of training, reskilling and upskilling opportunities. <\/p><p>According to the latest available national figures, from the Central Statistics Office&rsquo;s Labour Force Survey, employment levels reached 2.55 million in Q2 2022. We now have more people employed in our country than ever before, while the quarterly unemployment rate stands at 4.4% - levels not seen since 2005. These results are a testament to the hard work and resilience of the Irish people and enterprise. The rate of growth since the beginning of 2021 has been remarkable. Since Q1 2021, the number of people in employment has grown by 324,000 (14.5%). <\/p><p>It has been especially welcome to see a strong recovery in the Accommodation and Food Service sector, with employment in this sector increasing by 68% since the start of 2021. The impact of the pandemic was not equal across sectors, and those in the Hospitality sector were significantly affected. Our strong policy interventions during the pandemic &ndash; rapidly rolling out the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme and Pandemic Unemployment Payment &ndash; appear to have minimised any long-term labour market scarring in the sector.<\/p><p>Much of the recent increase in employment has been driven by record levels of female labour market participation. There is currently a record-high 1.19 million women in employment &ndash; an increase of 164,400 since the start of 2021. As well as continued funding increases for early learning and childcare, interventions through <i>Making Remote Work<\/i>, our national Remote Work Strategy and <i>Pathways to Work 2021-2025, <\/i>have assisted in addressing obstacles to labour market inclusion for women. <\/p><p>As we approach full employment, one challenge for businesses will be recruiting talent with the right skills - this is particularly important in the context of the dual green and digital transitions. As set out in the <i>Economic Recovery Plan<\/i>, the Government continues to roll-out thousands of additional re-skilling and upskilling opportunities to steer employees and employers through employment transitions, while my Department also operates an employment permit system which is highly responsive to areas of identified skills needs and labour shortages across the economy.<\/p><p>I recognise that these employment figures do not tell the lived experience for some, and many people are struggling and worried about the future. My Department have been making huge improvements to workers&rsquo; rights this year, including introducing statutory sick pay, the right to request remote working and, starting next year, moving to a living wage, all of which will enhance employment security, flexibility and make sure work pays. These rights, coupled with new cost-of-living measures due to be announced in Budget 2023, will help with what will be a difficult winter ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500092#WRH03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Small and Medium Enterprises","counter":391,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500092#WRH04000"},{"type":"question","counter":392,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[45379\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500092#WRH04100","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the extent to which a full evaluation has been done of the needs of small and medium enterprises with a view to offering the maximum support possible in order to combat the problem of rising costs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":393,"content":"<p>The Government is very aware of the economic challenge of escalating prices, in particular energy prices, and has put in place measures to assist businesses, including small and medium enterprises.

Many small and medium businesses around the country are seeing their margins squeezed by the rising costs of doing business, and in particular the significant increases in energy costs. The Wholesale Price Index for energy products rose by almost 78 per cent in the year to July 2022, and this spike is becoming apparent in the costs of energy intensive businesses. This is not unique to Ireland and is an issue facing all major economies around the world. <\/p>  <p>  Analysis from my Department suggests that 120,000 people are directly employed in gas-intensive manufacturing sectors, with a further 275,000 employed in oil-intensive sectors. That is where gas or oil is used to meet 40 per cent, or more, of that sector&rsquo;s energy requirement. Exposure to electricity price increases is more broad-based across all economic sectors. As wholesale gas prices drive changes in electricity costs to a significant degree, there is a wider range of sectors with an indirect exposure to changes in gas prices.  <\/p>  <p>  While it is useful to consider the numbers employed and the energy intensity of the economic sectors to gain a broad understanding of sectoral exposure to energy, it would be incorrect to imply that all jobs in energy intense sectors are at risk.

The CCPC do not tell businesses what prices to charge. Generally, traders in Ireland are free to set and change their prices for goods and services. Lower prices play a key role in attracting consumers, and traders compete to keep their prices low enough to attract consumers.<\/p>  <p>  When the CCPC receive complaints on pricing, they assess them to see if they indicate a possible breach of one of the areas of competition or consumer protection law that the CCPC is tasked with enforcing. They take action on their own initiative when they suspect there may have been a breach. However, they cannot investigate behaviour which a consumer regards as unfair unless the behaviour may breach the law.<\/p>  <p>  In a market economy like ours, businesses are free to set prices in line with market conditions, provided they are not in a dominant position in the market, and provided they do this without colluding with competitors. Excessive pricing may be illegal if a business is in a dominant position, where it faces little competition, and its customers have little bargaining power. When a business is dominant, it is not allowed to abuse its position. Businesses and their pricing decisions are constrained by the need to compete rather than by any legal obligation.<\/p>  <p>  It is illegal for competing businesses to form a cartel - that is, an agreement to fix prices - or to agree a common pricing policy or to carve up a market in order that they do not have to compete. It is also illegal for businesses to share information about their future pricing intentions. Wholesalers may not dictate the retail prices charged for their products by independent retailers. As long as businesses do not collude, however, they are free to set their own prices and may observe their competitors' prices and adjust their own prices accordingly.<\/p>  <p>  When the CCPC receives complaints about pricing it assesses them to see if they indicate a possible breach of competition or consumer protection law. The CCPC can take enforcement action if an investigation uncovers sufficient evidence of a breach. The nature of enforcement action depends on the type of the breach and the nature of the evidence but can include referral to the Director of Public Prosecutions for a criminal prosecution. <\/p>  <p>  Certain sectors due to their nature and their systemic importance (for example, energy) are regulated by specific sectoral regulators who can influence the pricing decisions of providers in that regulated sector.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to my Department's remit, we have been to the fore in updating and expanding our laws on consumer rights and competition. <\/p>  <p>  The Competition (Amendment) Act 2022 gives our competition authorities the necessary powers to crack down on rogue operators that are found to be breaching competition law. Cartels, where they exist, will be broken up and companies abusing a dominant position can be suitably punished with heavy fines of up to 10% of global turnover. These new powers will act as a big disincentive for those taking part in anti-competitive practices, which drive up costs, freeze out start-ups and smaller businesses and lead to bad quality products and poor services. <\/p>  <p>  The Consumer Rights Bill 2022, which will enter the Seanad shortly, is the largest reform of consumer rights legislation in 40 years. The new law consolidates and modernises consumer law and gives consumers new protections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500092#WRH04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1602"},{"type":"question","counter":401,"qnumday":157,"qnumall":"[45382\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500092#WRH05000","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the degree to which enterprise and trade in general is challenged by numerous price increases by various suppliers of goods and services; if such issues can in any way be alleviated to ensure the safeguarding of small and medium enterprises; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":402,"content":"<p>The top competitiveness challenge facing enterprise today is the high inflation environment and rising input prices.

The plans include a strong focus on promoting remote working opportunities and investing in infrastructures across the nine regions.<\/p><p>- While National Broadband Plan has been impacted negatively by COVID-19, the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications is continuing to engage with National Broadband Ireland to address the delays that have arisen. As a result of actions taken by NBI, the project has been building momentum and month on month increases in Premises Passed are being recorded. This is expected to continue this year and beyond.<\/p><p>- The Civil Service Blended Working Policy Framework was published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on March 31st, 2022, which will help deliver the Programme for Government commitment to move to 20% remote\/home working across the sector.<\/p><p>- Ongoing remote work promotion and guidance including advice for employers and employees on best practice, health and safety, equality and skills by a range of agencies including the Health and Safety Authority, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Western Development Commission, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, Skillnet Ireland and local Education and Training Boards.<\/p><p>- My Department is continuing to develop and promote its Guidance for Working Remotely webpage. This webpage acts as a central access point for employers and employees and brings together the existing State guidance, legislation and advice on remote work into one place. The webpage is a live resource and is updated regularly. The webpage includes an Employer Checklist to provide employers with a quick way to successfully navigate the adoption of remote working arrangements.<\/p><p>-  On May 18th, an Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) research paper was published which found that remote working is likely to have a positive impact on the Irish economy and society. The paper, &ldquo;An Evaluation of the Impacts of Remote Working&rdquo; examines the impact of remote working on several key policy areas, finding positive effects on productivity, the environment, regional development, private finances, and labour market participation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500093#WRJ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","counter":424,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500093#WRJ01500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Pensions","counter":423,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500093#WRJ01400"},{"type":"question","counter":424,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[45240\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500093#WRJ01500","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if he has considered proposals that have been put to him to increase the pensions of those who worked for An Post; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":425,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[45391\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500093#WRJ01600","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the reason that a 2% increase for members of the An Post Superannuation Scheme has not been implemented; the timeline that An Post is working towards for implementation of this rate, which was effective from 1 January 2022; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":426,"qnumday":175,"qnumall":"[45395\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500093#WRJ01700","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"when he will sign-off on the agreed pay rise for An Post pensioners; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1570","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":427,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 167, 174 and 175 together.  <\/p><p>I received\u00a0a recommendation from my officials on 1 September and granted my consent on 2 September to the payment of an increase of 2% to An Post pensioners with effect from 1 January 2022.

Until the Finance Act 2019 Ireland&rsquo;s vehicle benefit-in-kind regime was unusual in that there was no overall CO<sub>2<\/sub>rationale in the regime, despite a CO<sub>2<\/sub>based vehicle BIK regime being legislated for as far back as 2008 (but never having been commenced). Section 6 of the Finance Act 2019 legislated for a fundamental overhaul of the regime which brought in discount and surcharge rates based on a car&rsquo;s emissions profile, and is due to commence from 1\/1\/2023. <\/p><p>There have been arguments surrounding the mileage bands in the BIK structure as they can be perceived as incentivising higher mileage to avail of lower rates, leading to higher levels of emissions. The rationale behind the mileage bands is that the greater the business mileage, the more the car is a benefit to the company rather than its employee (on average); and the more the car depreciates in value, the less of a benefit it is to the employee (in years 2 and 3) as the asset from which the benefit is derived is depreciating faster. Mileage bands also ensure that cars more integral to the conduct of business receive preferential tax treatment.<\/p><p>The new system takes account of  these environmental concerns by reducing the mileage bands from five to four, thus weakening any perverse incentives of increasing mileage to reduce tax liability while still seeking to apply the tax in proportion to the quantum of benefit derived from the car.  The new structure with CO<sub>2<\/sub>-based discounts and surcharges provides a broad structure to incentivise employers to make greener choices when providing employees with company cars; the system will mean that low-emission vehicles and any EVs that are liable for a BIK charge will benefit from a preferential rate ranging from 9 - 22.5%, depending on mileage. Conversely, high emissions vehicles will be subject to higher rates of BIK. This will bring the taxation system around company cars into step with other CO<sub>2<\/sub>-based motor taxes as well as the long-established CO<sub>2<\/sub>-based vehicle BIK regimes in other member states.<\/p><p>In addition, Ireland currently has a BIK relief for electric vehicles which is due to continue until end 2025.

While this matter was raised by the Commission of Investigation in its First Interim report, as set out below, I am confident the Commission resolved the concerns to its satisfaction in the interim as this matter is not raised in the Commission&rsquo;s Final Report.<\/p><p>This First Interim Report (Section 15) identified a concern of the Commission in November 2015 that the definition of &ldquo;capital loss&rdquo; adopted by the Special Liquidators may not respond fully to the objectives of the Commission, and noted that the Commission intended to arrive at a concluded view as to the meaning of capital loss. <\/p><p>I understand that the definition of capital loss for the purposes of the Terms of Reference is primarily relevant to identifying which transactions fall to be investigated by the Commission, whether the initially identified 38 transactions, or a greater number which might result from a wider definition of capital loss. It remains to be determined whether other transactions will ultimately be investigated by the Commission of Investigation. <\/p><p>I understand from the Commission&rsquo;s First Interim Report that the definition of capital loss adopted by the Special Liquidators and provided to the Commission did not include loans in respect of which the underlying security had been sold and the remaining balance had been deemed irrecoverable, unless that balance was written off in the books of the Bank in the Relevant Period, being 21 January 2009 (the date of the nationalisation of IBRC) and 7 February 2013.  In its Second Interim Report (Section 2.17 et seq), the Commission confirmed that it had further engaged with the Special Liquidators and also obtained expert advice on the meaning of capital loss as understood in the banking industry.  The Commission noted that it would welcome clarification of the intended meaning of the term &ldquo;capital loss&rdquo;.  <\/p><p>I am advised that this issue was not raised in the Commission&rsquo;s next ten interim reports, nor in its Final Report, which is some 1376 pages long, plus appendices of a further 165 pages.

I have no reason to believe that the Special Liquidators in any way withheld information from the Commission.

There were 10,347 people in receipt of Rent Supplement on 10 September 2022. <\/p>  <p>  Local Authorities are responsible for the provision of rental assistance to those with a long-term housing need primarily through the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2019 specify requirements in relation to a range of matters, such as structural repair, sanitary facilities, heating, ventilation, natural light, fire safety and the safety of gas, oil and electrical installations.

In addition, the household must be deemed eligible for social housing support. The concept of the scheme is that a household with an unsustainable mortgage goes from being a homeowner to being a social housing tenant.<\/p><p>To the end of June 2022, 1,905 households with unsustainable private mortgages have completed the MTR process and 635 cases are being actively progressed. A total of 5,602 individuals are benefitting from the scheme, which comprises of 2,892 adults and 2,373 children. The Housing Agency publishes, on a quarterly basis, detailed statistical information on the operation of the MTR scheme which also shows a breakdown of the number of active, completed, ineligible and terminated cases by lender. This information is available on the Housing Agency's website at the following link: www.housingagency.ie\/housing-information\/mortgage-rent-statistics<\/p><p>In 2020, 363 Mortgage to Rent cases were completed and in 2021, 678 cases were completed. Between January and June 2022, 223 cases were completed. The Mortgage to Rent scheme is a demand led scheme and is driven by lenders following active engagement by borrowers. Therefore, case completions are dependent on the level of borrower engagement that can be achieved by lenders, with the support of advisory services such as MABS and Abhaile, as well as the Department and Housing Agency's awareness raising initiatives. It is not envisaged that the number of completed cases for 2022 will exceed the number completed in 2021. <\/p><p>Both the Programme for Government and Housing for All commits to strengthening the Mortgage to Rent scheme and ensuring that it is helping those who need it. Building on the significant amendments already made to the scheme in 2017, the 2021 Review, which was published on the 24 January 2022, examined the impact of these changes and what further changes would benefit those in need of the scheme. While the scheme is performing well, it was assessed that some further enhancements were needed to enable more households in need of State support with their long-term housing needs to avail of this scheme.<\/p><p>One key priority action was to broaden the eligibility criteria of the scheme. This was implemented under the scheme on 14 February 2022. These include changes to the following aspects of the scheme, which will enable more borrowers to apply:<\/p><p><i>Positive Equity:<\/i>Three new limits varying from &euro;25,000 to &euro;35,000 apply depending on the location of the property. <\/p><p><i>Property Acquisition Limits:<\/i>Increases of up to 14% on the previous limits have been implemented across two threshold areas. These limits take account of current market conditions and the recent research by the Central Bank.<\/p><p><i>Flexibility on over accommodation: <\/i>The scheme now allows flexibility on the over accommodation rule where a member of the household is aged 65 or over, or has a disability.<\/p><p>Approximately 8% of eligible cases submitted to The Housing Agency between 14\/02\/2022 and 30\/06\/2022 were deemed eligible as a result of the broadened eligibility criteria for property acquisition limits and over accommodation. My Department does not have sight of an individual borrower&rsquo;s positive equity and so cannot statistically track the impact of this change.<\/p><p>My Department wrote to all the lenders involved in the MTR scheme and notified them of the changes to the eligibility criteria in advance of the effective date of 14th February 2022. In that letter, the Department requested that they take account of these changes when assessing borrowers for MTR.<\/p><p>Another action area within the 2021 Review is 'Communication and awareness raising'. There is continued engagement with Abhaile, the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) and Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) to disseminate information on the MTR scheme.

However, they may be able to apply to their local authority for a new HAP payment for another property sooner if their circumstances change. For example, if they receive a job offer in another area, or if their family changes in size and the property is no longer suitable.  <\/p>  <p>  The flexibility of HAP as a social housing support is one of the scheme's key characteristics and was one of the primary benefits envisaged at the outset of the scheme. With this in mind, Departmental circulars relating to inter-authority movement issued in 2017 and 2019, with the aim of facilitating movement of HAP households from one local authority area to another in cases where a HAP tenant wishes to access rented accommodation with HAP support in another local authority area.  Inter authority movement is, however, subject to certain conditions, such as the relevant Social Housing Income Eligibility Bands and confirmation that the applicant's income is below the threshold in the new local authority.<\/p>  <p>  In order to maintain equity between all tenants in receipt of social housing support, inter-authority movement for HAP will be facilitated without reference to Social Housing Eligibility Income Bands in areas that offer shared areas of choice in their allocation schemes, as no change to existing treatment is involved in such areas. For example, in Dublin, the four local authority areas currently offer shared areas of choice in their allocation schemes.  <\/p>  <p>  HAP tenants who avail of inter-authority movement, can only be offered access to the housing transfer list of the originating local authority.  The practical operation of transfer lists is a matter for each local authority to manage, on the basis of their own scheme of letting priorities. The making of such schemes is a reserved function of the local authority and as such is a matter for the elected members.<\/p>  <p>  The day-to-day operation of the HAP scheme is a matter for individual local authorities. However, given that such flexibility facilitates better utilisation of all private rental stock for social housing purposes and supports the maximum activation potential of HAP households by removing geographical barriers to employment, all local authorities have been requested to give appropriate consideration to these requests. It is the responsibility of the local authority to make a decision in each individual case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500095#WRL01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":549,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500095#WRL01800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Birth Registration","counter":548,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500095#WRL01700"},{"type":"question","counter":549,"qnumday":215,"qnumall":"[45214\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500095#WRL01800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the status of a foreign birth registration application (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1625","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":550,"qnumday":217,"qnumall":"[45258\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500095#WRL01900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will expedite the foreign birth registration case of a person (details supplied); the current average timeline for processing foreign birth applications; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1627","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":551,"qnumday":218,"qnumall":"[45285\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500095#WRL02000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if a foreign birth registration (details supplied) will be reviewed and expedited;; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1626","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":552,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 215, 217 and 218 together.<\/p><p>My Department is responsible for processing Foreign Birth Registration (FBR) applications for people who are born abroad and claim Irish Citizenship through a grandparent born in Ireland or through a parent who has claimed citizenship also through FBR, Naturalisation or Post Nuptial Citizenship. <\/p><p>Demand for this service increased significantly as a result of the Brexit vote in the UK.

To support schools in this work the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) is currently providing training to schools to ensure that the promotion of wellbeing will be at the core of the ethos of every school. Schools will be navigated through an introduction to the Wellbeing Framework and how to use the School Self Evaluation (SSE) process in guiding wellbeing promotion in their schools.

The document is called  Look, Listen &amp;amp; Link. <\/p>  <p>  - NEPS has also delivered a series of wellbeing webinars via the Education Support Centres of Ireland, to further support schools. <\/p>  <p>  The programmes and initiatives set out above are in addition to the educational psychological support that NEPS provide to all primary and post-primary schools. This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to individual pupil casework where there is need. NEPS works closely with the HSE and its agencies to ensure those who may require the provision of therapy or counselling are referred on to the appropriate clinical services for intervention and support.<\/p>  <p>  At post primary level, counselling is a key part of the role of the Guidance Counsellor, offered on an individual or group basis as part of a developmental learning process, at moments of personal crisis but also at key transition points.

The procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour amongst its pupils and in dealing with any negative impact within school of bullying behaviour that occurs elsewhere. They include specific requirements in relation to the use of prevention and education strategies and the consistent investigation, follow up and recording of bullying behaviour.<\/p><p>A new Digital Strategy for schools, the Digital Strategy for Schools to 2027, was published in April. The Strategy will advance the embedding of digital technologies across teaching, learning and assessment, building on the work under previous strategies. Online safety and the safe and ethical use of digital technologies is a key component of the new Strategy. The Strategy will continue to work towards ensuring that learners have the opportunity to develop their digital skills so that they can navigate the digital world in a confident and competent manner and that their voices are heard and taken into account in further developments in this area.  <\/p><p>Support and resources in the area of online safety and digital citizenship are provided by Webwise. Webwise promotes the autonomous, effective and safer use of the internet by young people through a sustained information and awareness strategy targeting school leaders, teachers, parents\/guardians and learners themselves with consistent and relevant messages.  Webwise and PDST Technology in Education are currently developing a new online cyberbullying course which seeks to inform teachers and school leaders about cyberbullying and outlines a school&rsquo;s role in relation to creating an anti-cyberbullying culture and promoting student wellbeing including online wellbeing. This course aims to provide both primary and post-primary teachers with the knowledge, resources and confidence needed to teach about cyberbullying and deal with cyberbullying incidents as they arise.<\/p><p>There are also extensive training and curricular supports, including through the Social Personal Health Education (SPHE) curriculum and the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST), to assist schools in the development of policies and practices on the safe use of the internet and on the prevention of bullying including cyber-bullying.<\/p><p>Throughout the implementation of the Strategy, Webwise will continue to develop and disseminate relevant resources and run campaigns addressing key topical issues as they arise.<\/p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, I established a Steering Committee to review the 2013 Action Plan on Bullying in February of this year. This Steering Committee is chaired externally by Dr. Noel Purdy of Stranmillis University College in Antrim. This review involves significant consultation and collaboration across my Department, with other Government Departments and Bodies including the Ombudsman for Children, and also involves consultation with a broad range of education stakeholders, including parents and students, school management bodies and teacher and school staff unions. <\/p><p>The review is taking account of the significant developments and relevant research since the action plan was published in 2013. It is specifically considering cyber bullying, identity based bullying and sexual harassment, among other areas. <\/p><p>The review is also giving detailed consideration to the recommendations contained in the Oireachtas Joint Committee Report on School Bullying and the Impact on Mental Health which was published in August 2021. <\/p><p>The Steering Committee consists of senior officials from the Department of Education, including the Inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological Service, representatives of the National Parents&rsquo; Council Primary, National Parents&rsquo; Council Post-Primary, Irish Second Level Students&rsquo; Union (ISSU), the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, the National Anti-bullying Research Centre in DCU and other external experts and representatives of advocacy organisations which include BelongTo, Webwise, Parentline National Traveller Women&rsquo;s Forum, Women&rsquo;s Aid and the Independent Living Movement Ireland and two anti-racism advocates. The Steering Committee has held nine meetings to date.<\/p><p>A number of consultation strands have been conducted over the past few months including focus groups with children and young people, focus groups with school staff and members of the school community and a public consultation process. This extensive consultation process will ensure that my Department captures as many voices as possible to inform the development of an inclusive and comprehensive Action Plan on Bullying. <\/p><p>A Working Group has been established to review and update the <i>Anti-bullying procedures for Primary and Post Primary Schools<\/i>in parallel with this work. The working group is comprised of representatives from each of the relevant management bodies and teacher and school staff unions, along with representatives from the National Parents&rsquo; Council Primary, National Parents&rsquo; Council Post-Primary, Irish Second Level Students&rsquo; Union (ISSU) and the National Anti-bullying Research Centre in DCU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500095#WRL05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":591,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500096#WRM00200"},{"type":"question","counter":592,"qnumday":230,"qnumall":"[45212\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500096#WRM00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of a funding application by a school (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":593,"content":"<p>I can confirm to the Deputy, that my Department is in receipt of an application, under the Additional School Accommodation (ASA) scheme, from the school in question. <\/p><p>The application is currently under assessment by my officials and the school authority will be contacted directly with a decision upon completion of the assessment process. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500096#WRM00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport","counter":594,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500096#WRM00500"},{"type":"question","counter":595,"qnumday":231,"qnumall":"[45222\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500096#WRM00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if school transport will be provided as a matter of urgency for named persons (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1605","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":596,"content":"<p>The School Transport Scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department.

I am conscious that buying textbooks is a significant cost for parents, and for this reason my Department provides a book grant to all recognised primary and post primary schools within the Free Education Scheme in order to provide assistance for books, including Book Rental Schemes. Under this scheme, my Department provided funding of &euro;18.2 million in 2022 to all of these schools. Schools participating in my Department&rsquo;s DEIS Programme receive an enhanced rate of book grant.<\/p>  <p>  School book rental schemes have an important role to play in reducing the cost of school books for parents and guardians. In order to support the establishment of book rental schemes my Department provided &euro;15.7 million seed capital in 2014, 2015 and 2016 to all primary schools.   From the information available to my Department currently, approximately 96% of all primary schools and 69% of all post-primary schools operate a book rental scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Schools are expected to adopt a cost-conscious approach to the selection of books for use in their classes. Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at post-primary level, determined by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), the decisions on which textbooks, programmes and resources, if any,  to use in primary and post-primary schools are taken at school level. <\/p>  <p>  Members of the Irish Educational Publishers&rsquo; Association (IEPA) subscribe to a Code of Practice which includes an agreement that publishers will not revise any texts within at least four years - unless there is a change in the curriculum, the state examination or methods of assessment, or if there is a recognised teacher-led demand to do so. <\/p>  <p>  It is a matter for the Board of Management of each individual school to decide on its own policy in relation to the use of book grant funding in the school. The current arrangement relies on the local knowledge of the school in order to ensure a fair allocation of funds to those students most in need.<\/p>  <p>  The Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill is currently before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. When enacted, it will improve how schools engage with students and their parents by requiring each school to consult with students and their parents on individual school plans, policies and activities, including school costs.

In July, Dublin City Council voted to transfer the site to the Office of Public Works, marking another step towards the development of this important national site of conscience. It is anticipated that initial conservation and structural works will commence on site before year end.<\/p><p>With regard to local memorialisation initiatives, my Department continues to offer funding to survivor-centred advocacy groups who wish to organise local commemorative events. My colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage,  established a working group to develop central guidance to assist local authorities in providing services and facilitating local memorialisation in line with the wishes of survivors. A consultative process with survivor advocacy groups and representatives, led by independent facilitators, was conducted to inform the group's work. <\/p><p>In addition to an annual progress report, which will be laid before the Houses towards the end of the year, my Department continues to prepare quarterly progress updates. On 31 May, the second of these updates was issued directly to every person who has provided their contact information to my Department's dedicated mailing list. The third update is due to be published at the end of this month and will also be published on my Department's website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500097#WRN03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ukraine War","counter":688,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500097#WRN03800"},{"type":"question","counter":689,"qnumday":262,"qnumall":"[45269\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500097#WRN03900","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the number of home pledges that were received for Ukrainian refugees by county; the current number of pledges (details supplied); the number of refugees who have been housed through a refugee process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1627","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":690,"content":"<p>Since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine on 24 February, and the invoking of the temporary protection Directive by the European Union shortly afterwards, My Department has worked intensively as part of the cross-governmental response to the Ukraine crisis.<\/p><p>The operational challenges brought about by responding to the conflict are significant.

In addition, the impact on the individual applicant&rsquo;s quality of life, the length of time the individual has been waiting, and the available budget are factors that form part of the decision-making process. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE advise that standard stock wheelchairs are readily available while bespoke and powered wheelchairs can take time to be manufactured and delivered by the supplier, making the determination of a meaningful standard &lsquo;waiting time&rsquo; extremely difficult and not practical.

The problem became particularly acute over the last couple of years as a significant number of contracted dentists chose to opt out of the DTSS. <\/p><p>I secured an additional &euro;10 million in Budget 2022 to provide for expanded dental health care for medical card holders including the reintroduction of Scale and Polish. To address the concerns of contractors about the viability of the Scheme, I am using an estimated &euro;16 million of an underspend in this year&rsquo;s estimate allocation (&euro;56 million) to award fee increases across a number of items including fillings and restorations. The combination of these two measures represents an estimated total additional investment of &euro;26 million in the Scheme this year over and above what was spent on the Scheme in 2021, &euro;40 million.<\/p><p>Following consultation with the Irish Dental Association, these new measures came into effect on 1st May. I would hope that this substantial additional investment in the Scheme will encourage more and more dentists to provide care to medical card patients. The numbers of patients being seen and the numbers of treatments being provided under the DTSS have started to increase in recent months.

It was very tough to draw a line on this matter.

In the 2022 Revised Estimates, my Department was allocated &euro;378 million. This funding ensures that we are in a position to further assist communities in Kildare and throughout the country seeking funding and other supports for important local activities and projects. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government places a strong emphasis on balanced regional development through a range of measures. My Department supports this commitment through targeted investment that supports rural regeneration, facilitates new working opportunities and fosters regional enterprise growth. We will continue to invest in, and support, communities in Kildare and across the country - through our wide range of schemes such as the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, LEADER Programme, Town and Village Renewal Scheme, Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme, Local Improvement Scheme, CL&Aacute;R Programme, Islands Capital Programme, Community Enhancement Programme, Connected Hubs initiative, Libraries Investment Capital funding, PEACE IV Programme and the PEACE PLUS Programme. <\/p>  <p>  My Department also provides strategic interventions, funding programmes and supports which target and address issues of social and or economic deprivation in rural and urban communities throughout the country. <\/p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;2 million was secured to design and implement a new Empowering Communities Programme (ECP) in 2022 aimed at specifically targeting area-based deprivation through a community development approach. This initiative, in part, stems from a Programme for Government commitment to expand the Dublin North East Inner City model and will be informed by other initiatives such as the Community Development Pilot Programme, the Place-Based Leadership initiative and the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme which operates across the country. <\/p>  <p>  &euro;40,000 in Dormant Accounts funding has also been made available to 4 Local Community Development Committees to act as exemplars in reaching out to those furthest from participation and the decision making processes. It is anticipated that the learnings gathered will inform enhanced engagement with marginalised groups by local decision making bodies, to ensure better outcomes for all members of our communities. In addition to the pilot programme, information and resources are being provided to all local authorities to support their engagement with marginalised communities. National events will showcase good practice in relation to engagement strategies, with inputs from experts and national advocacy and representative organisations. <\/p>  <p>  Information on all of the funding and supports available through my Department are available online on the Gov.ie website.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is also responsible for a number of important policies, including the National Policy on Social Enterprise, and Sustainable, Inclusive and Empowered Communities which is a 5 Year Strategy to Support the Community and Voluntary Sector 2019-2024.<\/p>  <p>  Our Rural Future which I launched in 2021, is a whole-of-Government rural development policy which contains more than 150 commitments for the social and economic development of rural Ireland. The policy will assist rural Ireland to recover from the impacts of COVID-19, enable long-term development of rural areas, and create more resilient rural economies and communities for the future. Extensive consultation underpins the policy, and in shaping the 2022 Work Programme my Department consulted widely, including hosting a series of three Rural Ideas Fora and the first ever Rural Youth Assembly.<\/p>  <p>  All my Department&rsquo;s policies are underpinned by extensive consultation with a wide range of stakeholders including rural and urban stakeholder groups, community groups, young people, Government Departments and State Agencies. This engagement process provides important insights into issues impacting on rural and urban communities and in identifying areas for response which are relevant to the work of my Department. <\/p>  <p>  Ongoing dialogue is maintained with rural and urban stakeholders in order to identify and respond to shortcomings and issues impacting on individuals and communities. I will also continue to collaborate with my Government colleagues and will monitor the issues which impact our urban and rural communities in order to respond to emerging needs.<\/p>  <p>  I am confident that the funding supports and policies provided by my Department will continue to deliver, tangible benefits for both urban and rural communities, supporting economic development, and enabling the local and community development sectors to continue to provide valuable much needed services and supports to all communities throughout the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500101#WRR00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flexible Work Practices","counter":900,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500101#WRR00900"},{"type":"question","counter":901,"qnumday":332,"qnumall":"[45368\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500101#WRR01000","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the extent to which she continues to encourage the build-up of state-of-the-art technology hubs at convenient locations throughout the country to enable many enterprises have the benefits of an office setting without the necessity of travelling to more distant locations; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":902,"content":"<p>Our Rural Future, Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Policy, was published in March 2021. The policy recognises the opportunity for rural rejuvenation that remote working presents and commits to establishing a comprehensive and integrated national network of 400 remote working hubs by 2025. <\/p><p>Last year I launched the National Hub Network together with its online booking platform, connectedhubs.ie. It is a single network that provides users with information on the location of, and facilities available at, remote working hubs throughout Ireland. The network includes a diverse range of hubs, services and facilities thus facilitating companies of different sizes. <\/p><p>There are currently 281 remote and co-working facilities across the country on-boarded to the connectedhubs.ie platform. This number is growing all the time meaning we are well on track to meet our target of 400 remote working hubs nationwide by 2025. The attached table provides a breakdown of connectedhubs.ie facilities by county. <\/p><p>On 8 June, I announced the 81 projects that were successful in securing funding from the 2022 Connected Hubs Call, allocating &euro;5 million to add additional capacity to existing remote working hubs and Broadband Connection Points throughout the country. This follows the award of almost &euro;9 million in funding allocated via the 2021 Connected Hubs Call.  <\/p><p>To date my department has invested over &euro;100M to support the establishment, improvement and sustainability of hubs. For example, the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund (RRDF) and the Town and Village Renewal Scheme both support the establishment of digital hubs. The dataset drawn from the National Hubs Network will contribute to future decisions pertaining to the location and model of remote working hubs that will be funded by my Department through such schemes. <\/p><p>To date my focus has been on establishing the network and on achieving this initial critical mass. Following strong progress on the establishment phase of the project, my focus has now shifted to the next stage of development. <\/p><p>I have always been clear that balanced regional development, sustainable and thriving communities, and indeed the wider national economy will all benefit from workers and employers embracing the remote working revolution. <\/p><p>I am pleased to say that the connectedhubs.ie team have for some time been developing a corporate service to engage with and support corporate clients interested in using our nationwide network to accommodate their employees, but also to gain access to the vast pool of talent that Ireland has to offer, whether those talented people live in our cities, towns, villages or rural parishes. I believe that this work represents significant opportunities for employers of all sizes to leverage the National Hub Network directly. <\/p><p>I am committed to ensuring that the National Hub Network will continue to make a central contribution to the achievement of the Government's vision for rural Ireland, as set out in Our Rural Future. <\/p><p>TABLE 1 &ndash; Connectedhubs.ie - Remote Working Hubs by County (as of the 12th of September 2022) <table>    <tr>       <th>-<\/th>       <th>Live on the connectedhubs.ie platform<\/th>       <th>Mapped to be invited to join the connectedhubs.ie platform <\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow<\/td>       <td>5<\/td>       <td>8<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan<\/td>       <td>7<\/td>       <td>7<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare<\/td>       <td>9<\/td>       <td>14<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork<\/td>       <td>27<\/td>       <td>19<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal<\/td>       <td>15<\/td>       <td>18<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin<\/td>       <td>47<\/td>       <td>33<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway<\/td>       <td>21<\/td>       <td>32<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry<\/td>       <td>19<\/td>       <td>9<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare<\/td>       <td>8<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>       <td>7<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>       <td>7<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim<\/td>       <td>8<\/td>       <td>18<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick<\/td>       <td>13<\/td>       <td>12<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth<\/td>       <td>8<\/td>       <td>10<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo<\/td>       <td>22<\/td>       <td>17<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>       <td>20<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>       <td>10<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly<\/td>       <td>5<\/td>       <td>12<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon<\/td>       <td>7<\/td>       <td>15<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>       <td>9<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary<\/td>       <td>10<\/td>       <td>20<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford<\/td>       <td>8<\/td>       <td>10<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>       <td>9<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford<\/td>       <td>7<\/td>       <td>9<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow<\/td>       <td>8<\/td>       <td>2<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><b>Total<\/b><\/td>       <td><b>281<\/b><\/td>       <td><b>339<\/b><\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500101#WRR01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":903,"content":"<p>Question No. 333 answered with Question No. 331.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":904,"content":"<p>Question No. 334 answered with Question No. 331.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Schemes","counter":905,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500101#WRR01400"},{"type":"question","counter":906,"qnumday":335,"qnumall":"[45372\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500101#WRR01500","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the extent to which she expects the Leader programme to be made available throughout the country over the next twelve months; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":907,"qnumday":336,"qnumall":"[45373\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500101#WRR01600","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the extent to which she expects the Leader programme to be made available in County Kildare over the next twelve months; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":908,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 335 and 336 together.<\/p><p>The LEADER Programme is one of the key interventions of Our Rural Future, the Government&rsquo;s Policy for rural development.<\/p><p>I was delighted to welcome the recent announcement that the European Commission has confirmed their approval of Ireland&rsquo;s CAP Strategic Plan for 2023-2027, which includes the LEADER programme. This approval is a key step in the delivery of the next LEADER programme for the period 2023-2027<\/p><p>A number of further steps will now be completed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in advance of bringing the CAP Plan to Government for final approval in the coming weeks. <\/p><p>As part of the new Common Agricultural Policy Strategic Plan, the Government has committed significant funding of &euro;180m to LEADER for 2023-2027.  This allocation was agreed by Government in October 2021.The allocation of this funding across LEADER areas will be announced in tandem with the forthcoming two stage selection process for the new LEADER programme.<\/p><p>Transitional funding of &euro;70m was also provided for the LEADER Programme 2021 and 2022 to ensure that there was no gap in funding prior to the commencement of the 2023-2027 programme.<\/p><p>My Department&rsquo;s focus now is to finalise the design of the new LEADER programme in conjunction with key stakeholders.  I hope to be in a position to launch the selection process in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>For the duration of the selection process, stakeholders will be engaged in preparatory work relating to strategy design and a separate funding stream is available to support this work.<\/p><p>While this process is ongoing, existing LEADER Groups will also still be engaged in delivering projects on the ground and in closing out the current programme.<\/p><p>All available project funding has not yet been allocated to projects or drawn down by LEADER groups under the transitional programme. Approximately 80% of project funding has been committed by LEADER groups and I am aware that they continue to develop projects &lsquo;in the pipeline&rsquo; in order to fully utilise the available budget.  <\/p><p>Currently, nationally, over 5,400 projects have been approved for funding in excess of &euro;228 million. The total amount allocated to the Kildare LAG under both the 2014-2020 and Transitional programme was over &euro;6.8 million.  This funding is allocated at the start of the relevant programming period rather than on an annual basis in keeping with the flexibility afforded to LAGs in managing delivery. <\/p><p>I am confident that the implementation of the new LEADER programme will help to sustain the crucial contribution that LEADER has made to the realisation of our ambitions for rural Ireland as set out in <i>Our Rural Future.<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500101#WRR01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":909,"content":"<p>Question No. 336 answered with Question No. 335.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":910,"content":"<p>Question No. 337 answered with Question No. 331.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":911,"content":"<p>Question No. 338 answered with Question No. 331.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":913,"qnumday":339,"qnumall":"[45376\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091500101#WRR02200","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the extent to which she hopes to continue to support recreational walk schemes throughout the country and in County Kildare over the next twelve months; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":914,"content":"<p>The Walks Scheme, which is funded by my Department, contracts landholders to undertake maintenance work on National Waymarked Ways and other priority trails that traverse their lands.

In addition, my Department&rsquo;s Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme (ORIS) provides funding for the development and enhancement of amenities such as walking trails. <\/p><p>Last September, I announced the approval in principle of 31 new trails to join the Walks Scheme.

These trails are being formally brought onto the Scheme by Local Development Companies who deliver the Walks Scheme locally and who are developing work plans for each of the individual landholders involved.<\/p><p>The new trails added to the Scheme were selected following a call for expressions of interest to join the scheme.
