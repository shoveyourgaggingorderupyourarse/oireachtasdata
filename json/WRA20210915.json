The Sub-Group on Insurance Reform, under the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery &amp;amp; Investment, which the T&aacute;naiste chairs was established to oversee and drive forward insurance reform. \u00a0The Action Plan for Insurance Reform is one of the most important programmes of reform that this Government will undertake. Implementation of the Plan is on track with the first six-monthly Implementation Report published in July 2021, showing that work is progressing well to implement the Action Plan, with 34 of the 66 actions completed.<\/p><p>Actions for my own Department under the Action Plan are set out as follows:<\/p><p>- Enhancing the role of thePersonal Injuries Assessment Board <\/p><p>As Minister of State for Trade Promotion, Digital and Company Regulation, I have met regularly with PIAB and a range of representative bodies to assess the role of PIAB and develop proposals to enhance and reform the agency. I have undertaken a public consultation seeking views on the matter from all interested parties. The Department has considered the 240 responses received and, informed by the public consultation, Heads of a Bill have been developed in consultation with PIAB, which I am considering.<\/p><p>As set out in the Plan the new Personal Injuries Guidelines came into effect on the 24th April. These Guidelines apply to all cases assessed by PIAB from that date. Preliminary PIAB data indicates that since the implementation of the Guidelines, the average PIAB award has decreased by approximately 50%. Furthermore, about 80% of PIAB awards are now &euro;15,000 or less, compared to 30% in 2020. The new Guidelines clearly represent a shift in the manner in which general damages are awarded in our country and in the level of those damages and should exert downward pressure on insurance premiums. \u00a0<\/p><p>In addition, the Minister for Justice and I, published the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Compensation) Bill 2021 in April 2021. This Bill will bring Garda compensation claims within the PIAB process.

This Bill represents a step change in competition enforcement for Ireland and will give the CCPC more effective enforcement powers to punish anti-competitive conduct.

The work of the Office includes engaging with sectoral stakeholders to understand gaps in the insurance market, with a view to expanding the risk appetite of existing insurers. It is also involved in exploring opportunities for new entrants in order to increase the availability of insurance. This Office provides a more coordinated Government policy approach to increase competition in the insurance sector.<\/p><p>The full implementation of the Action Plan for Insurance Reform will help to ensure that we have an insurance system which is both affordable and reliable and underpins a vibrant economy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500071#WRB04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1596"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":56,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500071#WRB04700"},{"type":"question","counter":57,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[43803\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500071#WRB04800","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the steps he is taking to ensure that Covid-19 vaccine trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights waiver is addressed through the WTO TRIPS Agreement.","asker":"1525","askee":"1474"},{"type":"question","counter":58,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[43757\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500071#WRB04900","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if Ireland will call on the European Union to support a temporary TRIPS waiver on Covid-19 vaccines, medicines and diagnostics at the upcoming WTO meeting;

To deliver on insurance reform Government established a Cabinet Committee Subgroup on insurance reform which is chaired by the T&aacute;naiste and of which I am a member. The subgroup published the Action Plan for Insurance Reform in December 2020 which sets out actions across Government that will be taken to reform the insurance market. This is one of the most important programmes of reform that this Government will undertake. Implementation of the Plan is on track with the first six-monthly Implementation Report published in July 2021, showing that work is progressing well to implement the Action Plan, with 34 of the 66 actions completed.<\/p>  <p>  Among the actions completed are the introduction of the Personal Injuries Guidelines which came into effect on the 24th April. These Guidelines apply to all cases assessed by PIAB from that date. Preliminary PIAB data indicates that since the implementation of the Guidelines, the average PIAB award has decreased by approximately 50%. Furthermore, about 80% of PIAB awards are now &euro;15,000 or less, compared to 30% in 2020. The new Guidelines clearly represent a significant shift in the manner in which general damages are awarded in our country and in the level of those damages and should exert downward pressure on insurance costs.<\/p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Perjury and Related Offences) Act 2021 was signed into law in June 2021 and commenced on 28 July 2021.  The legislation provides a clear definition of perjury and should enable the offence and related offences to be more easily prosecuted in the courts. The establishment of the Insurance Fraud Coordination Office under the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau is also a welcome development. Both will act as effective deterrents to assist in tackling fraudulent claims.<\/p>  <p>  An Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market has been established within the Department of Finance, chaired by Minister of State Fleming and supported by my Department. The work of the Office includes engaging with sectoral stakeholders to understand gaps in the insurance market, with a view to expanding the risk appetite of existing insurers. It is also involved in exploring opportunities for new entrants in order to increase the availability of insurance. This Office provides a coordinated Government policy approach to increasing competition in the insurance sector.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister of State for Trade Promotion, Digital and Company Regulation, I have met regularly with PIAB and a range of representative bodies to assess the role of PIAB and develop proposals to enhance and reform the agency. Heads of a Bill have been developed in consultation with PIAB, which I am considering. I am also progressing legislation to strengthen competition law in Ireland. The legislation will break new ground in this area, giving competition authorities, such as the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), enhanced powers including administrative sanctions and other tools in dealing with anti-competitive practices.<\/p>  <p>  The scope of the National Claims Information Database has been widened to cover Employer Liability and Public Liability with a first report published by the Central Bank in July.<\/p>  <p>  While progress on these actions is welcome, Government is committed to doing more to reduce insurance costs. The Minister for Justice is considering legislative proposals to reform the law in the area of occupier&rsquo;s liability. Under the Action Plan, the Department of Justice is working on several actions in the area of fraud. We will also enhance the National Claims Information Database. Ministers and I have met regularly with stakeholders to understand the issues they face and to inform our policy making process. This engagement will continue as we deliver meaningful reform of the insurance sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500072#WRC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1596"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Policy","counter":81,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500072#WRC01400"},{"type":"question","counter":82,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[43796\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500072#WRC01500","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the status of the development of the regional enterprise plan to 2024 for the west of Ireland; when the plan will be completed and published; the analysis his Department carried out in the preparation of the plan into the potential of community-focused, indigenous industries in providing sustainable employment opportunities in the future particularly in view of job losses due to Covid-19; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":83,"content":"<p>Regional enterprise development and sustainable local job creation is a key policy priority of mine and this Government. <\/p><p>My Department is currently overseeing the development of nine new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2024.<\/p><p>These are &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo; plans, developed by regional stakeholders working together to identify growth opportunities, recognise vulnerabilities, and to address ecosystem gaps, so as to enable job creation in businesses, including indigenous businesses, across the regions, through collaborative regional actions.<\/p><p>The new West Regional Enterprise Plan to 2024 which covers Galway, Mayo and Roscommon will build on the core activities of the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs and the wider range of State Bodies involved in supporting enterprise development in the region, with a focus on creating sustainable employment opportunities. <\/p><p>I have the pleasure of driving the delivery of the new Plan in the West and I have engaged directly with the West Regional Steering Committee made up of regional stakeholders and chaired by Evelyn O&rsquo;Toole, Founder CEO of Complete Laboratory Solutions (CLS), throughout 2021. <\/p><p>The regional stakeholders in the West region are currently working to finalise focused Strategic Objectives for their region, and actions to deliver on these objectives and intend to sign off on the new West Plan in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>Once this has been done it is my Department's intention to publish all these new Plans including for the West region, in quarter 4 this year.<\/p><p>Finally, my Department through Enterprise Ireland has made available &euro;0.5 million in Feasibility Funding with grants of up to &euro;50,000 on a 50% match fund basis through the Regional Enterprise Transition Scheme which can be leveraged to develop nascent initiatives emerging from the Regional Enterprise Plans.

Ensuring we have the best business environment for all businesses to grow and proposer requires a whole of Government approach so we can underpin the longer-term resilience of our enterprise sector to deal with future shocks. That is why engagement and coordination with other Departments and agencies is so important to delivering on our indigenous enterprise development priorities, including through Cabinet Committees, Senior Officials Groups and other enterprise stakeholder groups and fora which I and my officials actively lead and are involved with.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A central focus for my Department and the Indigenous Enterprise Division over the last two years in particular is assisting businesses across all sectors to prepare for Brexit and to respond to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. This included the development of business continuity checklists, toolkits, grants and awareness campaigns, online grant schemes, schemes for recruiting staff to deal with customs, a range of loan and finance schemes including the &euro;800m Future Growth Loan Scheme and the &euro;2bn Credit Guarantee Scheme developed with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, the design and delivery of the &euro;650m Restart Grant Scheme and top-ups in 2020 and the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC) this year. The Division also has liaison responsibility for Enterprise Ireland, the 31 Local Enterprise Offices and the Design and Crafts Council of Ireland and each of these agencies have implemented a range of new grant and advisory schemes to help indigenous businesses on behalf of the Department., which have helped thousands of indigenous businesses through the COVID-19 crisis.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A key priority in the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future was the establishment of the SME Growth Taskforce, which I Chaired in the latter half of 2020 and was a follow-up on the recommendations in the 2019 OECD on SME and Entrepreneurship Policy commissioned by my Department. The Taskforce membership included entrepreneurs, business leaders, unions and other stakeholders to fulfil the commitment made in the Programme for Government to draw up a long-term strategic blueprint for SMEs and entrepreneurs beyond COVID-19. The research and work of the Taskforce included engagement with a range of government departments and agencies on the key development issues for indigenous enterprise.\u00a0The resulting report 'SME and Entrepreneurship Growth Plan&rsquo;, sets out a wide range of recommendations with long-term strategic relevance for SMEs and entrepreneurs. The recommendations include measures to help SMEs and entrepreneurs to start up, scale up and access foreign markets, as well as recommendations aimed at helping SMEs to become more productive and ready for the transition to a digital, green economy.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Following the publication of the Report, a Ministerial-led 'SME &amp;amp; Entrepreneurship Implementation Group' was formed to take forward these proposals in conjunction with appropriate Government Departments, Agencies and other stakeholders. To-date the Implementation Group, which is led by my colleagues Minister English and Minister Troy and the Indigenous Enterprise Division have met on five occasions and have held sessions to discuss progress on thematic areas such as insurance costs, access to finance, entrepreneurship and internationalisation, digitalisation, clustering and networking. The\u00a0 Taskforce is meeting in plenary tomorrow to review progress on the recommendations and to consider any additional measures needed to help our indigenous sector as the economy reopens.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the commitment to establish the SME and Entrepreneurship TaskForce, the Division also led on the commitment in the Programme for Government to establish a SME State Bodies Group, to consider access to finance issues for indigenous enterprise. I chair this Group, together with my Ministerial colleagues the Minister for Finance, Paschal Donohoe, T.D. and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Michael McGrath, T.D. The Group was a particularly helpful forum for assessing the financing needs of SMEs as the COVID-19 crisis unfolded and as the Indigenous Enterprise Division worked on the design of the COVID Credit Guarantee Scheme. To date over &euro;500m has been drawn down by over 7,000 indigenous businesses. Similarly, the Division worked with Department of Finance and the Department of Agriculture on the development of the new &euro;330m Brexit Impact Loan Scheme, the enabling legislation for which was passed by the Oireachtas earlier this year.\u00a0 In addition, for the agri-food sector, my officials in the Indigenous Enterprise Division have worked closely also with DAFM colleagues on the design and implementation of the &euro;75m Agri-Food Competitiveness and Market Diversification Fund I launched earlier this year to help impacted businesses in the sector respond to the twin challenges of COVID and Brexit.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  More generally, we are working to increase the range businesses eligible for assistance and the 31 Local Enterprise Offices have already started on this road with the Productivity Fund and Business Continuity Vouchers, which targeted an expanded cohort of enterprises that is firms with up to 50 employees which would customarily not have qualified for funding. Enterprise Ireland is also working with a broader base of non-exporting SMEs, with the Retail On-line scheme and the COVID-19 Sustaining Enterprise Fund and the Sustaining Enterprise and Accelerated Recovery Fund. We are also providing more and cheaper loan finance through MicroFinance Ireland, SBCI and the &euro;2bn Credit Guarantee Scheme. We have also launched a number of new climate change advisory and grants schemes this year and I am pleased that the LEOs' Green for Micro scheme is progressing well.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In response to the on-going issues arising from COVID-19, my Department continued to virtually engage with indigenous enterprise through the 31 Local Enterprise Offices (LEO). Many of the ongoing schemes and initiatives were moved to online platforms to allow for continued engagement with client companies.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Look for Local campaign launched earlier this summer by the LEOs, is funded by my Department and supported by Enterprise Ireland (EI) and the Local Authorities.\u00a0 The Look for Local campaign was an opportunity for the LEOs to show support for all those small businesses as they reopened and encouraged Irish consumers to do the same.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My colleague Damien English T.D., Minister of State for Business, Employment and Retail chairs the Retail Forum. The Retail Forum was established by my Department in June 2014\u00a0and provides a platform for structured engagement between retail representative bodies, retailers and the public sector on key concerns for the retail sector.\u00a0The agenda is driven by Forum Members with key issues discussed at Forum level and also progressed through Working Groups.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the Retail Forum, Minister of State English has engaged directly with the retail, grocery and distribution sector during the pandemic and Brexit. The Forum will meet later this week to consider the progress on a major review of the future of the retail sector and also progress on the Online Retail Scheme, for which over &euro;19m has been awarded to retail businesses to date.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  in relation to the indigenous personal services sectors, Minister English, along with colleagues from the Indigenous Enterprise, SMEs and Entrepreneurship Division have formally held a number of meetings with representatives from the Hair and Beauty sector to discuss issues arising from COVID as well as other concerns and needs the sector has to become more resilient, sustainable and competitive in attracting and retaining employees and this engagement will continue.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is also in regular contact with these representatives to keep them informed on subjects such as education and training, while responding to any queries they may have, e.g. VAT rates, statutory sick pay, etc. As a result, my Department have engaged with colleagues from the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science; the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection on a range of topics pertinent to that Sector.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Regional enterprise development and sustainable local job creation is a key policy priority of mine and this Government. My Department is overseeing the development of nine new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2024, including for each region. These are bottom-up plans, developed by regional stakeholders including the Local Authorities, the enterprise agencies, local enterprise offices, regional skills forum and education and training institutes in each region.<\/p>  <p>  The Plans aim to identify growth opportunities, recognise vulnerabilities, and in response, strengthen the regional enterprise ecosystem to enable job creation in the regions and are additional to the ongoing work of the various bodies such as the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, and others focusing on collaborative initiatives aimed at job creation in the regions.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Each Plan is overseen and monitored by a Regional Steering Committee made up of regional stakeholders and chaired by a senior level private sector businessperson. My Departmental colleagues, Minister Robert Troy and Minister Damien English are driving the delivery of the new Plans and chair a national oversight group which enables sharing of best practice and collaboration opportunities across the regions.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the tourism and hospitality sectors, which are significant indigenous employers, I established and chair the Hospitality Forum with my colleague the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Catherine Martin T.D., who has lead policy responsibility and Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland are agencies of her Department.\u00a0 My Department and the Indigenous Enterprise Division continue to work closely with colleagues across government departments and agencies on measures and funding schemes to assist the hospitality, live events and exhibition sectors and most recently were central to the recent reopening of indoor hospitality in July.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  While the last year has been challenging for indigenous enterprise, we have a strong and resilient base of businesses that we are committed to ensuring can sustain and grow their employment and sales into the future. I was pleased last week to lead the first in-person trade mission of indigenous enterprise since last March 2020 to the UK, France and Germany, to promote Irish innovation and secure additional contracts. I and my Department will continue to work with government departments and sectoral agencies as appropriate to ensure that we have the most conducive and competitive environment and to strengthen the close working with sectoral policy departments and sectoral agencies.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500072#WRC03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":107,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500072#WRC04000"},{"type":"question","counter":108,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[43731\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500072#WRC04100","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if, in advance of a phased return to office-based working from 22 September 2021, he and his Department will publicly state that the preferred option of Government is for employers and managers to agree for a blended working model with workers and their trade unions which takes into account the health and safety of workers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1467","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":109,"content":"<p>On 31 August 2021, the Government published <i>Reframing the Challenge: Continuing our Recovery and Reconnecting,<\/i>setting out the proposed process for the further gradual of society and the economy. <\/p><p>From the 20<sup><\/sup>September onwards, attendance at the workplace for specific business requirements may commence on a phased and staggered basis.

Our Economic Recovery Plan outlines ongoing support for people and businesses to make a full return to work and sets out medium term policies to promote sustainable and balanced growth, as well as signalling the gradual phasing out of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment.  The overarching ambition in our Economic Recovery Plan is to have 2.5 million people in work by 2024, exceeding pre-pandemic levels.<\/p>  <p>  The past year has been a difficult year for most businesses, including those in the retail sector. As the largest private sector employer, the retail sector plays a critical role in contributing to the Irish economy and in providing for the needs of society.  It is vital that our retail sector continues to develop capability and remains competitive. <\/p>  <p>  The number of PUP recipients in the Wholesale and Retail Sector has been falling since outlets reopened.  The sector has seen PUP claimants fall to 22,434 currently, down from the sector&rsquo;s 2021 peak of 76,606 in February.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to the pandemic the sector was facing challenges with upward cost pressures and the increasing impact of technology. COVID-19 has accelerated structural changes, particularly the shift to digital and online with ripple effects in local economies. My Department has provided specific funding through the COVID-19 Online Retail Scheme and the Trading Online Vouchers Scheme to assist the retail sector to make this transition. <\/p>  <p>  I want the sector to continue to develop and to become one of our most innovative and resilient sectors, so that people can be confident about building a long-term career in retail.   My Department will continue to engage with the sector through the Retail Forum, currently chaired by my colleague Damien English, TD, Minister of State for Business and Employment.  The forum provides a platform for structured engagement between retail representative bodies, retailers, and the public sector, on key issues for the sector.<\/p>  <p>  Our Economic Recovery Plan also commits to further strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s Skills Framework to ensure people are supported to secure and remain in sustainable and quality employment. This will be achieved through a combination of upskilling and reskilling with substantially accelerated training and skills opportunities and increased activation capacity through Pathways to Work 2021-2025. The Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025, which targets 10,000 apprenticeship registrations per annum by 2025, is another important mechanism to address skills shortages. Retail Ireland&rsquo;s Skillnet Apprenticeship in Retail Supervision and the National Hairdressing Apprenticeship are good examples of programmes providing job-ready qualified professionals. My colleagues, Simon Harris, TD, Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, and Niall Collins, TD, Minister of State for Skills and Further Education, recently announced a further extension of the Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme until the end of December 2021 which provides financial support for employers who register apprentices to a national apprenticeship. <\/p>  <p>  We want people to feel safe and be safe as we work through the progressive reopening of our economy and the return to the workplace.  My Department, with the Health and Safety Authority, the Department of Health and the HSE developed a Work Safely Protocol which provides a framework for all businesses to operate safely in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.  As businesses continue to re-open in accordance with the Government&rsquo;s latest roadmap, they must do so in accordance with the public health advice and with the COVID-19 mitigation measures set out in the Protocol. The ultimate aim is to keep employers and employees in all sectors safe while also helping businesses to re-open and, more importantly, to remain open and productive. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500072#WRC06700","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Data","counter":135,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500072#WRC06800"},{"type":"question","counter":136,"qnumday":100,"qnumall":"[43533\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500072#WRC06900","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the detail of the overall trends in import and export trade, trade between Ireland and both Great Britain and Northern Ireland, distinguishing overall volumes of exports and those supported by Enterprise Ireland; and the policy challenges which they raise.","asker":"1549","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":137,"content":"<p>The performance of the import and export sectors has been significantly impacted over the last three years by both Brexit and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

In order to increase the agility and responsiveness of the system, to modernise it and to ensure that it is capable of adapting to rapid changes in the needs of the labour market, the Review recommended that new legislation be initiated.

Published on January 15th, 2021, the Strategy aims to ensure that remote work is a permanent feature of the Irish workplace, in order to maximise its economic, social and environmental benefits.<\/p><p>The Strategy contains 15 actions to progress remote work into the future, organised into three pillars and underpinning conditions: These pillars are:<\/p><p>1.  Create a Conducive Environment <\/p><p>2.  Develop and Leverage a Remote Work Infrastructure<\/p><p>3.  Build a Remote Work Policy and Guidance Framework<\/p><p>Each action has been attributed to lead actors for delivery and each action is scheduled to be delivered by Q1, 3, or 4 of this year. Lead actors report progress on the actions to the Interdepartmental Group (IDG) on Remote Work. This IDG has met three times to date this year, most recently on September 7th. At these meetings it has been established that good progress has been made in achieving most actions by their deadlines. The IDG will meet again in November to further drive the implementation of the strategy. <\/p><p>The strategy reflects the Government&rsquo;s wider commitment to create more flexible and family-friendly working arrangements which will benefit both employees and employers. In April, the Workplace Relations Commission published the Code of Practice on the Right to Disconnect which will help employees to strike a better work-life balance and to switch off from work outside of normal working hours. The code is flexible and gives employees more options to work outside of traditional hours. It also reflects the fact that many Irish employees are part of a global network, requiring contact with colleagues around the world at different times.<\/p><p>On May 31st, the Department of Rural and Community Development launched Ireland&rsquo;s National Hub Network, ConnectedHubs.ie. This was followed on July 22nd with the announcement of &euro;8.8 million in funding for 117 projects across Ireland as part of the Connected Hubs Call. This investment will contribute to the ongoing development of the National Hub Network, which already includes 134 hubs and will grow on a phased basis to over 400 hubs throughout the country.<\/p><p>On June 28th, my Department launched the &lsquo;Making Remote Work&rsquo; campaign across broadcast, print and social media to promote the Guidance for Working Remotely webpage. This webpage acts as a central access point for employers and employees and brings together the existing State guidance, legislation and advice on remote work into one place. The webpage includes an Employer Checklist to provide employers with a quick way to successfully navigate the adoption of remote working arrangements. The &lsquo;Making Remote Work&rsquo; campaign is continuing, and the Government is encouraging workers and employers to discuss the kinds of remote working arrangements that may be suitable for their organisations.<\/p><p>As part of creating an environment conducive to remote work, my Department will soon legislate for the right for employees to request remote work. The report of the submissions received during the public consultation on the proposed measure was published on August 20th, and a working group has been established to draft the General Scheme of the Bill which will be presented to Government as soon as possible. <\/p><p>Taken together, I am confident that all these actions will help promote remote work and facilitate hybrid working in a way that benefits both workers and employers.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500073#WRD04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Data Centres","counter":187,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500073#WRD05000"},{"type":"question","counter":188,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[43753\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500073#WRD05100","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if he will consider a review of  Government policy on the development of data centres in Ireland until a cost-benefit analysis has been carried out in relation to energy security, energy prices and their potential to impact on Ireland&rsquo;s ability to meet climate targets; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1627","askee":"1474"},{"type":"question","counter":189,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[43754\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500073#WRD05200","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if there are plans to update the Government statement on the Role of Data Centres in Ireland&rsquo;s Enterprise Strategy report taking into account increased growth in the sector since the policy was devised in 2017, new climate action legislation that has been enacted since and other relevant Government policies that have been drafted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1627","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":190,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 and 127 together.<\/p>  <p>As the Deputy has alluded to, there have been significant policy and market developments with implications for the data centre sector in Ireland since the publication of the 'Government Statement on the Role of Data Centres in Ireland's Enterprise Strategy' in summer 2018. Data centres are already a significant feature of Ireland&rsquo;s technology sector and our electricity demand (representing 11% of demand in 2020); they are also a core infrastructure enabler of a technology-rich, innovative economy, which makes Ireland a location of choice for a broad range of sectors and value-added activities. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is currently preparing a new Climate Action Plan that will address, amongst many objectives, our ambition to further decarbonise our electricity system. We will seek to further decarbonise our electricity grid while we simultaneously pursue the electrification of sectors such as transport and heating and, crucially, preserve our security of supply and the reliability of our grid. Arising from the Climate Action Plan, I expect that the &lsquo;Government Statement on the Role of Data Centres in Enterprise Strategy&rsquo; will need to be revised to reflect new policy and regulatory developments, ongoing challenges and potential opportunities facing the sector. <\/p>  <p>  This would be part of a suite of actions to ensure that Ireland is planning appropriately for new energy demand in the context of our electrification and decarbonisation ambitions, facilitating growth in digitalisation and our technology sector, while ensuring that we are cultivating energy markets and infrastructure that deliver smart and competitively priced services to all electricity customers. Promoting a higher level of Corporate Power Purchase Agreements in the Irish market, assessing opportunities for large energy users to provide flexible levels of demand at peak times, and facilitating businesses to better monitor and manage the carbon intensity of their electricity hour by hour and across different locations on the grid, could all potentially contribute to this objective.  <\/p>  <p>  In revising the Government Statement, my Department would work closely with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and stakeholders such as Eirgrid, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities and IDA Ireland, to set out the additional measures required to ensure that the existing demand for data centre development can be harnessed to drive the decarbonisation of our electricity system and deliver regional economic opportunities. I expect that appropriate grid connection policy and electricity market design, alongside research, development and innovation in the sector, can facilitate increasingly efficient, flexible and future-proofed infrastructure for Ireland&rsquo;s digital, knowledge-based economy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500073#WRD05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Policy","counter":191,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500073#WRD05400"},{"type":"question","counter":192,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[43848\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500073#WRD05500","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if he will report on the South-West Regional Enterprise Plan.","asker":"1455","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":193,"content":"<p>Regional enterprise development and sustainable local job creation is a key policy priority of mine and this Government. <\/p><p>My Department is currently overseeing the development of nine new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2024.<\/p><p>These are &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo; plans, developed by regional stakeholders which will identify growth opportunities, recognise vulnerabilities, and enable job creation across the regions including in the South-West region through collaborative regional actions.<\/p><p>The new South-West Plan to 2024 which covers Cork and Kerry will build on the core activities of the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs and the wider range of State Bodies involved in supporting enterprise development in the region. <\/p><p>I have the pleasure of driving the delivery of the new Plan in the South-West and I have engaged directly with the South-West Regional Steering Committee made up of regional stakeholders and chaired by Patricia Quane, retired Vice President and General Manager, Astellas Ireland throughout 2021. <\/p><p>The regional stakeholders in the South-West region are currently working to finalise focused Strategic Objectives for their region, and actions to deliver on these objectives and intend to sign off on the new South-West Plan in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>Once this has been done it is my Department's intention to publish all these new Plans including for the South-West region, in quarter 4 this year.<\/p><p>Finally, my Department through Enterprise Ireland has made available &euro;0.5 million in Feasibility Funding with grants of up to &euro;50,000 on a 50% match fund basis through the Regional Enterprise Transition Scheme which can be leveraged to develop nascent initiatives emerging from the Regional Enterprise Plans.

At the same time, we must remember that commercial landlords have their own financial obligations that still need to be paid. Where a landlord has debt in place, their flexibility will likely be driven by what their bank\/lender will accept. One person&rsquo;s rent might be another person&rsquo;s income or pension.<\/p>  <p>  Over the last eighteen months, the Government has urged commercial landlords and tenants to talk to one another and come to some arrangement, as it is in everybody&rsquo;s interest that terms are amicably agreed. As such, last October, I published the Code of Conduct between landlords and tenants for commercial rents. The aim of this Code is to facilitate discussions between landlords and tenants impacted by COVID-19. It sets out a structured approach for engagement between both commercial landlords and tenants, based on their mutual interest in continuing to work together.<\/p>  <p>  The Code states that landlords should be willing to do what they can to help their tenants to continue to operate rather than facing the risk of a vacant premises and inability to obtain new tenants. Equally, tenants should pay what they can and speak with their landlord when difficulties arise. In addition, as set out in the Code, care should be taken to ensure that any repayment of the deferred rent does not compromise the ability of the affected tenant to recover from the crisis.<\/p>  <p>  As the relationship between landlord and tenant is a legal matter, the Code advises that parties may wish to seek legal advice when deciding new arrangements. If one party feels that another is reneging on new arrangements or new contractual commitments, they may also wish to seek legal advice in that instance.<\/p>  <p>  However, the Code should not be seen in isolation. The Government has put in place a comprehensive package to help businesses through the crisis including the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC), the forthcoming Business Resumption Support Scheme (BRSS), low-cost loans, the deferral and warehousing of tax liabilities and the waiver of commercial rates.

This is one of the most important programmes of reform that this Government will undertake.

Furthermore, about 80% of PIAB awards are now &euro;15,000 or less, compared to 30% in 2020.

Feedback received from enterprise across the board has been universally positive.  In fact, Ireland was one of the few countries that has managed to keep their employment permit system fully operational throughout the crisis. <\/p>  <p>  From the outset of the crisis, in order to assist the HSE and all other medical providers in the State to respond to, and to assist with, the public health response to the threat of Covid-19, all medical employment permits are expedited with immediate effect.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department has seen a significant increase in applications for employment permits this year.  To the end of August, some 14,624 applications were received, representing a 35% increase over the same period in 2020 (10,772) and a 19% increase on 2019 (12,276).  Some 9,526 employment permits were issued over this period.  <\/p>  <p>  Processing times have been impacted by this increase in demand but also because of the HSE cyber-attack.  As a result, employment permit applications associated with the July Doctors rotation (which occurs twice yearly in January and July) had to be submitted either manually or through other nonstandard methods.

The Commission commissioned research by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), which examined international practices in relation to the national minimum wage and subminimum rates.

Our Economic Recovery Plan, published in June, commits to ongoing support for people and businesses to make a full return to work.  Assisting businesses and people in those sectors where the impacts of the pandemic have been most severe is prioritised in the plan in a targeted way. Our Economic Recovery Plan also sets out medium term policies to underpin a sustainable and balanced recovery and a commitment to invest in infrastructure and reforms to enhance our capability and long-term capacity for growth. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to creating the right environment for a jobs-led recovery and to getting people back to work as quickly as possible. While numbers in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment continue to reduce, significant numbers of people remain in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment in Accommodation and Food Service Activities (27,545), Wholesale and Retail Trade (22,434) and Administrative and support service activities (16,504), and construction (11,725) sectors.<\/p>  <p>  Our Economic Recovery Plan set an ambitious target to exceed pre-crisis employment levels by having 2.5 million people in work by 2024 and in more productive and resilient jobs. The Plan commits to further strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s Skills Framework to ensure people are supported to secure and remain in sustainable and quality employment. As the PUP is phased out, helping people back to work and reducing the risk of labour market scarring and entrenched long-term unemployment is a priority for Government. This will be achieved through a combination of upskilling and reskilling with substantially accelerated training and skills opportunities and increased activation capacity through Pathways to Work 2021-2025. <\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025, which targets 10,000 apprenticeship registrations per annum by 2025, is an important mechanism to address skills shortages in particular sectors. Retail Ireland&rsquo;s Skillnet Apprenticeship in Retail Supervision and the National Hairdressing Apprenticeship are good examples of programmes providing job-ready qualified professionals in those sectors. My colleagues, Simon Harris, TD, Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, and Niall Collins, TD, Minister of State for Skills and Further Education, recently announced a further extension of the Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme until the end of December 2021 which provides financial support for employers who register apprentices to a national apprenticeship. <\/p>  <p>  The pandemic has accelerated previously existing trends and shifts which have potential to significantly reshape business models and sectors.  Many of these changes are likely to be permanent with potential to fundamentally alter Ireland&rsquo;s economic outlook. Not all previous jobs will return, while capacity constraints may emerge very quickly in certain areas. The twin decarbonisation and digitalisation transition and associated behavioural changes will profoundly alter the economy. <\/p>  <p>  Embracing these transitions will also open up substantial new opportunities for businesses and support significant job creation. Identifying and developing the skills required in growing sectors of the economy is critical to Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness.  The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) advises the Government on projected skills requirements across the Irish economy and makes recommendations on how existing education and training systems and delivery mechanisms, as well as other sources of skills supply, can be improved. <\/p>  <p>  Innovation, collaboration and knowledge are the cornerstone of a sustainable growth model and underpin the agility needed to respond to an evolving sectoral landscape.  The Government is committed to creating the right environment for a jobs-led recovery by helping business become more resilient and agile, by increasing Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness, and through a focus on expanding sectors. The education, training and research sectors will be supported to respond to the challenge. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500076#WRG05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"question","counter":355,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[44169\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500076#WRG05400","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the degree to which he has received communications from employers throughout the country who are experiencing difficulty in recruiting staff as Covid-19 restrictions are eased; if his attention has been drawn to the need for the expeditious processing of work permit applications or the use of other methods in order to address the situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":356,"content":"<p>The employment permits system is designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately skilled non-EEA nationals to fill skills and\/or labour shortages, in circumstances where there are no suitably qualified Irish\/EEA nationals available to undertake the work and that the shortage is a genuine one. <\/p>  <p>  The system is managed through the operation of the critical skills and the ineligible occupations lists which are subject to twice yearly evidence-based review.

Our Economic Recovery Plan commits to ongoing support for businesses and people to provide certainty and confidence for employers to continue to operate and re-employ staff members, with enhanced support for the worst affected sectors, as well as signalling the gradual phasing out of the PUP.\u00a0 The Plan also sets out medium term policies to underpin a sustainable and balanced recovery and a commitment to invest in infrastructure and reforms to enhance our capability and long-term capacity for growth.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Although the numbers in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment continues to reduce, there are still a significant amount of people who remain in receipt of this payment,with the highest numbers in the Accommodation and Food Service Activities (27,545), Wholesale and Retail Trade (22,434), Administrative and support service activities (16,504), and construction (11,725) sectors.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Extension of the Employee Wage Subsidy Scheme, which subsidises a portion of labour costs, until 31 December 2021 gives businesses the opportunity to trade profitably even when operating under ongoing constraints.\u00a0Extension of the Covid Restriction Support Scheme to the end of the year, the Business Resumption Scheme, broadening of the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID grant and continued deferral of tax liabilities further demonstrate the Government&rsquo;s efforts to help businesses to continue trading and restore employment.<\/p>  <p>  Our Economic Recovery Plan set an ambitious target to exceed pre-crisis employment levels by having 2.5 million people in work by 2024 and in more productive and resilient jobs. The Plan commits to further strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s Skills Framework to ensure people are supported to secure and remain in sustainable and quality employment and ensure employers can access the skills they need. As the PUP is phased out, helping people back to work and reducing the risk of labour market scarring and entrenched long-term unemployment is a priority for Government. This will be achieved through a combination of upskilling and reskilling with substantially accelerated training and skills opportunities and increased activation capacity through Pathways to Work 2021-2025. <\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025, which targets 10,000 apprenticeship registrations per annum by 2025, is an important mechanism to address skills shortages in particular sectors. Retail Ireland&rsquo;s Skillnet Apprenticeship in Retail Supervision and the National Hairdressing Apprenticeship are good examples of programmes providing job-ready qualified professionals in those sectors. My colleagues, Simon Harris, TD, Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, and Niall Collins, TD, Minister of State for Skills and Further Education, recently announced a further extension of the Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme until the end of December 2021 which provides financial support for employers who register apprentices to a national apprenticeship. <\/p>  <p>  The pandemic has accelerated previously existing trends and shifts which have potential to significantly reshape business models and sectors.\u00a0 Many of these changes are likely to be permanent with potential to fundamentally alter Ireland&rsquo;s economic outlook. Not all previous jobs will return, while capacity constraints may emerge very quickly in certain areas. The twin decarbonisation and digitalisation transition and associated behavioural changes will profoundly alter the economy. <\/p>  <p>  Embracing these transitions will also open up substantial new opportunities for businesses and support significant job creation.\u00a0Identifying and developing the skills required in growing sectors of the economy is critical to Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness.\u00a0 The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) advises the Government on projected skills requirements across the Irish economy and makes recommendations on how existing education and training systems and delivery mechanisms, as well as other sources of skills supply, can be improved.

Many trends and shifts that have been emerging for some time have been accelerated. Trends such as the growing digital economy; decarbonising the economy; labour market composition changes; and global developments such as Brexit, geo-political change, trade protectionism, international taxation among others. Some of the most noticeable changes include the shift to online retail and to electronic payments, and to greater levels of remote working. Each of these trends on their own has the potential to reshape businesses and lifestyles in significant ways creating new challenges and also opportunities. <\/p>  <p>  The Economic Recovery Plan, which was published in June, sets out the Government&rsquo;s approach to recovery in the aftermath of the pandemic and to ensure that we are prepared to realise the opportunities that these evolving trends will present. The most immediate challenge in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic is the scale of the unemployment challenge. This will require a determined and relentless focus on helping people back to work, accelerating the provision of training, reskilling and upskilling to assist people to transition to new jobs in growing sectors of the economy. The Economic Recovery Plan sets out our overall ambition of exceeding pre-crisis employment levels by reaching 2.5 million people in work by the end of 2024. Crucially these jobs will be more productive, innovative, resilient and in new areas of opportunity, aligned with the Government&rsquo;s green and digital ambitions.<\/p>  <p>  Central to the employment challenge is getting people back to work as quickly as possible. This will be achieved intense activation and skills development including by increasing the caseload of the Public Employment Service by 100,000 per annum; providing a new Work Placement Experience Programme, to reach 10,000 participants by the end of 2022; accelerating the rollout of 50,000 education and training places; and providing for a SOLAS Recovery Skills Response Programme to provide a range of additional education and training interventions including the SOLAS Green Skills Action programme.<\/p>  <p>  The pandemic may also have exacerbated Ireland&rsquo;s two-tiered economy, increasing the gap between domestic and export orientated firms.\u00a0 Our Economic Recovery Plan outlines a two-pronged recovery approach; a focus on domestic SMEs, whilst leveraging and reinforcing the enormous strength and resilience of the Foreign Direct Investment sector in Ireland and its indispensable contribution to communities across the country.<\/p>  <p>  The Plan outlines measures to improve SME productivity, exporting activity, internationalisation and diversification, digitalisation, and business dynamism, as well as greening enterprise, in order to boost the resilience, of Irish SMEs to current and future shocks and disruptions. The SME and Entrepreneurship Growth Plan, published earlier this year, gives Government a clear set of recommendations, directly from the business community, on how to build the best business and regulatory environment possible for SMEs and entrepreneurs to come back stronger from COVID and become more resilient over the longer-term. The implementation of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategic framework will further reinforce these efforts and strengthen Irish enterprise to respond to market shocks. Through the delivery of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy, and complementary trade initiatives, Ireland will enhance its value proposition for FDI and aim to win 800 total investments to aid job creation of 50,000 across the country.<\/p>  <p>  The new Housing for All strategy, which will target of 33,000 homes every year, will not only drive considerable direct and indirect employment opportunities but will also address supply constraints in terms of housing which continues to be a challenge.\u00a0 Our ambitious retrofitting goals, supported by a Loan guarantee for Low-Cost Residential Retrofit Loan Scheme, will further drive employment in the construction sector.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The ambitious programmes outlined in the Plan will be underpinned by substantial capital investment under the revised National Development Plan, as well as &euro;915 million expected in a first tranche of funding under the European Recovery and Resilience Facility.

Impacts include challenges with mobilisation of key contractors with restrictions on operations, supply chain and logistic delays (both nationally and internationally), as well as the recruitment of key personnel as NBI and its contractors scale, up including challenges associated with on-boarding and training people. Inevitably, like many other organisations, NBI and contractor staff are at risk of contracting Covid 19 or may have to restrict their movements as a result of being a close contact posing further challenges. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract to address the impacts of the Covid 19 pandemic on the project.<\/p><p>\u200bFurther details are available on specific areas within Tipperary through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie.

Ireland also continues to exempt essential transport workers travelling in the course of their international duties from testing and quarantine requirements when entering Ireland in the interests of keeping supply chains open.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to supports for businesses in general, the\u00a0Government's Economic Recovery Plan has extended the period during which a range of business supports will be available to enterprises and workers in all sectors of the economy.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500079#WRK05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Airport Policy","counter":543,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500079#WRK05900"},{"type":"question","counter":544,"qnumday":242,"qnumall":"[43666\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500079#WRK06000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"when the appointment of a chair of Shannon Group plc will be made; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1518","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":545,"content":"<p>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the process to appoint a new Chair which is administered by the Public Appointment Service (PAS) has now reached its final stages.<\/p><p>Minister\u00a0of State Naughton and I met with the candidates shortlisted via the PAS process last week and I expect to make an announcement in relation to the appointment of a new Chairperson shortly. <\/p><p>In line with normal arrangements for the appointment of Chairs to State Boards, the Chair designate will be required to appear before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications before being formally appointed as Chair of Shannon Group.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500079#WRK06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bus Services","counter":546,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500079#WRK06200"},{"type":"question","counter":547,"qnumday":243,"qnumall":"[43678\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500079#WRK06300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the detail of the fines for service failures over the past two years for Dublin Bus and Go Ahead; and the reasons and formulae for deciding these fines.","asker":"1486","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":548,"qnumday":244,"qnumall":"[43679\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500079#WRK06400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the details of the fines issued to Dublin Bus by the NTA over the past period, specifically those that relate to the operations of the new PA hybrid bus; if his attention has been drawn to concerns (details supplied) that such fines are being issued erroneously by the NTA for failure to deliver services which have in fact operated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1486","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":549,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 243 and 244 together.<\/p><p>As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.

This prepares them for delivering complex change with diverse stakeholders, which is a key skill for senior managers in my Department.<\/p><p>Table A <table>    <tr>       <th>Year\u00a0<\/th>       <th>Expenditure incurred<\/th>       <th>Purpose of expenditure<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2015<\/td>       <td>&euro;2,500<\/td>       <td>Meridian programme for 1 officer<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2016<\/td>       <td>&euro;2,500<\/td>       <td>Meridian programme for 1 officer<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2017<\/td>       <td>&euro;5,000<\/td>       <td>Meridian programme for\u00a02 officers<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500080#WRL04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs","counter":593,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500080#WRL04500"},{"type":"question","counter":594,"qnumday":259,"qnumall":"[43254\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500080#WRL04600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if there are plans to extend tax relief to counselling and psychotherapy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1583","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":595,"qnumday":265,"qnumall":"[43348\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500080#WRL04700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated full year cost to the Exchequer of extending tax relief to counselling and psychotherapy services as a qualifying health expense; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":596,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 259 and 265 together.<\/p><p>Section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for tax relief in respect of qualifying health expenses and defines &quot;health expenses&quot; as &quot;expenses in respect of the provision of health care including the services of a practitioner&quot;. <\/p><p>A practitioner is defined in the section as &quot;any person who is:<\/p><p>a. registered in the register established under section 43 of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, <\/p><p>b. registered in the register established under section 26 of the Dentists Act, 1985, or, <\/p><p>c. in relation to health care provided outside the State, entitled under the laws of the country in which the care is provided to practice medicine or dentistry there&quot;.<\/p><p>I am advised that comprehensive guidance material on health expenses can be found on Revenue&rsquo;s website in Tax and Duty Manual Part 15-01-21.  <\/p><p>Tax relief on the costs of counselling and psychotherapy services is currently available and may be claimed where the counsellor or therapist is a qualified practitioner as defined above.  <\/p><p>This is similar to the position that applies to other medical expenses and I am satisfied that the legislation provides sufficient flexibility for expenses that should qualify for tax relief.

While historically Ireland has been a relatively cash-intensive economy, significant progress has been made and a rapid increase in the take-up of electronic payments is evident. <\/p>  <p>  The Covid-19 pandemic has potentially acted as a catalyst for the move towards digital payments and the move away from cash. According to the Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s credit and banking statistics for July 2021, the volume of card transactions, excluding ATM usage, increased by 15 percent compared to July 2020. While ATM withdrawals remain subdued compared to pre-pandemic levels, down 30 per cent on its 2019 monthly average. The latest figures from the Banking &amp;amp; Payments Federation of Ireland show that on a quarterly basis, the volume of contactless payments increased by 62 per cent year on year to 199 million in the second quarter of 2021, with the value rising by 68 per cent to almost &euro;3.2 billion.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding a significant increase in the take-up of electronic payments, cash remains a vital part of the Irish payment system. A study, commissioned by my Department in 2018, concluded that a fully cashless society would not be an appropriate objective. The Report is available at the following link: www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/f8bfbe-indecon-report-on-benchmarking-of-irelands-payments-industry\/<\/p>  <p>  In September 2020, as part of the EU Digital Finance Package, the European Commission published the Retail Payments Strategy. One of the key aims of the strategy is to maintain access to and acceptance of cash across EU Member States. The strategy recognises the importance of ensuring that there is continued access to cash and that the increased use of digital payment methods does not lead to financial exclusion.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission aims to further develop the European payments market so Europe can fully reap the benefits of innovation and opportunities that come with digitalisation. Consumer protection is a key part of this work, in order to create safe payment solutions where risks are monitored and mitigated effectively.\u00a0One element of this is the introduction of strong security requirements for the initiation and processing of electronic payments, which apply to all payment service providers. Payment service providers are now obliged to apply strong customer authentication (SCA) when a payer initiates an electronic payment transaction. SCA requires the customer to go through two-factor authentication made up of elements from two of three separate categories: knowledge, possession, and inherence. This approach is intended to reduce the risk of fraud for all types of electronic payments (especially online payments) and to protect the confidentiality of the user&rsquo;s financial data.<\/p>  <p>  I have no role in the day to day operations of any bank operating within the State including banks in which the State has a shareholding. Decisions in relation to commercial matters such as the\u00a0application of interest rate charges\u00a0are the sole\u00a0responsibility of the board and management of the banks, which must be run on an independent and commercial basis.<\/p>  <p>  Key lending and deposit rates are set by the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB)having regard to its monetary policy objectives. The application of negative deposit rates by the ECB has resulted in European banks incurring a consequent cost on deposit accounts held with the ECB. Banks across Europe have looked to pass some of the costs associated with negative rates to deposit holders with larger balances, the Irish banks are no different in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  My Department\u00a0will continue to monitor develops in this area to ensure that consumers have access to a broad range of reliable and innovative services that meet their needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500081#WRM02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":636,"content":"<p>Question No. 273 answered with Question No. 272.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":637,"content":"<p>Question No. 274 answered with Question No. 272.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":638,"content":"<p>Question No. 275 answered with Question No. 272.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":640,"qnumday":276,"qnumall":"[43437\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500081#WRM02900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund; the details of investments made to date in 2021, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1562","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":641,"content":"<p>The NTMA have informed me that ISIF publishes bi-annual reporting which contains an update on the status of the operation of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, including economic impact reporting.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The latest report available on the ISIF website sets out an ISIF performance update up to the end of June 2021 and incorporates an economic impact report for 2020.<\/p><p>The high level messages from the latest report are be summarised in the following bullets as:\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>- Strong ISIF Portfolio investment return of +5.2% during the first half of 2021 with over &euro;450M in investment gains and over &euro;2.2bn since inception in December 2014.<\/p><p>- ISIF made 10 investments during the first half of 2021 bringing total ISIF commitments to &euro;5.2bn across 151 investments (further detail is on page 7 of the latest ISIF\u00a0report).<\/p><p>ISIF's H1 2021 update which was published on the ISIF website on 7 September 2021 is accessible\u00a0by\u00a0following the below URL link: <\/p><p>isif.ie\/uploads\/publications\/070921H120201-Performance-and-FY2020-update-published.pdf<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500081#WRM03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Research and Development","counter":642,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500081#WRM03100"},{"type":"question","counter":643,"qnumday":277,"qnumall":"[43442\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500081#WRM03200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the countries in the European Economic Area that provide a tax credit system for research and development; the countries in the European Economic Area that apply a tax credit system for research and development that applies to research and development activity in circumstances in which the activity is carried out in another jurisdiction of the EEA; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":644,"content":"<p>Governments in many countries provide support for research and development (R&amp;amp;D) with the aim of promoting R&amp;amp;D investment in their respective economies.

The guidelines are to support contracting authorities, including the Office of Government Procurement (OGP), the four key sectors (Health, Education, Local Government and Defence), individual Departments, Offices, commercial and non-commercial State bodies, and private entities which are subsidised 50% or more by a public body, when awarding contracts for goods and services.<\/p>  <p>  For all works and works-related services (above and below the relevant threshold) contracting authorities should consult the Capital Works Management Framework (CWMF) available here\u00a0www.gov.ie\/en\/service\/1d443-capital-works-management-framework\/#\u00a0. The\u00a0CWMF is an integrated set of contractual provisions, guidance material and technical procedures which covers all aspects of the delivery process of a public works project from inception to final project delivery and review.\u00a0 The CWMF is for the use by contracting authorities involved in the expenditure of public funds on construction projects and related consultancy services.

The National Development Plan provided a capital allocation of at least &euro;100m for the Fund over the period to 2027. <\/p><p>There are two streams of funding within the LSSIF. Stream One provides assistance for the development of detailed plans and cost effective analysis for proposed projects to bring them to tender stage.  Stream Two provides assistance for the construction or delivery of a project.<\/p><p>It was open to all local authorities and National Governing Bodies (NGBs) to apply for funding. All applications were assessed in accordance with the published Evaluation Procedures and Guidelines and the published scoring system both of which are available at the following link:-<\/p><p>www.gov.ie\/en\/service\/4113b3-large-scale-sport-infrastructure-fund-lssif\/. <\/p><p>Amongst the key factors in assessing applications was the likelihood of a project increasing participation (including for those with a disability), the priority afforded to the project by the relevant local authority and\/or NGB, the level of socio economic disadvantage in the area and whether the proposed project would be shared by a number of different potential users.<\/p><p>The first allocations under the LSSIF were announced in January 2020 and, thus far, approximately &euro;86.4m has been awarded to 33 different proposals. These initial allocations included funding for 8 swimming pool projects under Stream 2 of the LSSIF: <\/p><p>1.  Laois: Portarlington Leisure Centre Swimming Pool<\/p><p>2.  Sligo: Waterpoint Aqua Park <\/p><p>3.  Kilkenny: The Watershed Development, <\/p><p>4.  Limerick: Askeaton Pool and Leisure <\/p><p>5.  Wicklow: Wicklow Swimming Pool and Leisure Centre<\/p><p>6.  Louth: Dundalk Leisure Centre<\/p><p>7.  Galway: Galway Regional Aquatic &amp;amp; Fitness Centre<\/p><p>8.  Dublin: Samuel Beckett Civic Campus Phase 2<\/p><p>All of these projects are now at various stages of the due diligence process in keeping with the public spending code.<\/p><p>Previously, Government support for new swimming pools or the refurbishment of existing pools was provided through the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme (LASPP). 52 pools have been completed under the LASPP and three swimming pool projects (Lucan, Buncrana and Edenderry) remain in the programme.  A list of the completed projects is attached.<\/p><p>In relation to future swimming pool needs, my Department is currently undertaking a review of progress on all existing LSSIF grants. As part of this review, my Department is also considering the timing of any new call for proposals and it is expected that the review will be completed in the coming months. In addition, the National Sports Policy commits to the development of a National Swimming Strategy. This will involve close collaboration with relevant Government Departments, Local Authorities, sporting bodies and other stakeholders. As part of this, there will be a review of swimming pool provision to identify where gaps exist and how these can be met. Furthermore, a Sports Action Plan, covering the period to end 2023 will be published shortly. It is envisaged that the development of a national swimming strategy will be significantly progressed as a priority action in that plan, with the aim of completing the strategy in early 2022.  <table>

As you will be aware from your own time with this portfolio; in December 2017, NPWS announced the expansion of Ballycroy National Park to include the area known as Wild Nephin. This expansion increased the total size of the Park to over 15,000 hectares of the Nephin Beg Mountain range, which included a private acquisition of 1,200 acres at Altnabrockey. This expansion of the National Park was the result of a long-standing collaborative project between Coillte and the NPWS, and\u00a0consequently some 65% of state owned lands in the Park are now outside of the Ballycroy catchment area. <\/p>  <p>  Of the National Park's 15,000 hectares, circa 33% is in the parish of Ballycroy, 26% in the parish of Kiltane (Bangor Erris, Ballymunnelly, Bellacorick areas) and approximately 20% is in the parish of Burrishoole (Newport, Mulranny, Srahmore), and 20% in the parish of Crossmoline (Derra, Tubrid and Keenagh).\u00a0 Included in the above is the 4,200 hectares leased from Coillte and the acquisition at Altnabrocky, all of which is not within the parish of Ballycroy.<\/p>  <p>  The new name is intended to assist the integration of the original park and the newly acquired land fully into the Nephin Beg mountain range in the North Mayo landscape, to integrate with all the communities in the townlands which make up the park and to provide a clearer indication of the location to tourists, reducing confusion, especially in terms of the Nephin Wilderness area. <\/p>  <p>  In this context, it should be noted that the official state-of-the-art visitors centre for the National Park remains in Ballycroy village, and\u00a0my Department is currently developing proposals in conjunction with \u00a0Mayo County Council and Failte Ireland to upgrade and invest in this area, including examining the potential for a Planetarium and Observatory to complement the National Park&rsquo;s designation as a gold-tier Dark Sky park. The location of the Visitor facility in Ballycroy village and the associated walks and educational facilities,\u00a0which attract\u00a0 visitors to Ballycroy, will remain on all road signage in the region as we continue to grow the visitor numbers annually into both the parish of Ballycroy and the wider north Mayo region with the support of Mayo County Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500084#WRP02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1512"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Heritage Sites","counter":818,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500084#WRP02200"},{"type":"question","counter":819,"qnumday":339,"qnumall":"[44052\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500084#WRP02300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if the independent expert advisory group established by him to evaluate applications for inclusion on Ireland&rsquo;s UNESCO World Heritage Sites Tentative has completed its evaluation and made recommendations as to which properties should be considered for inclusion on a new list by early September 2021 as anticipated; if he will publish the evaluations and recommendations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1518","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":820,"content":"<p>The Expert Advisory Group (EAG) that I appointed earlier this year to assess the six applications to Ireland&rsquo;s new Tentative List of World Heritage Properties is currently finalising its report and recommendations, and I anticipate receiving these in the coming weeks. <\/p>  <p>  Once I receive these recommendations, they will then be considered further by my Department and myself before any final decision is made as to what properties\u00a0will be\u00a0progressed for inclusion on the new Tentative List.

This intensive effort across departments and agencies included the development of two Brexit Omnibus Acts; three Brexit Action Plans; substantial investment in the State&rsquo;s infrastructure and IT systems (including provision for 1,500 additional staff to support new checks and controls); and the provision of financial, upskilling and advisory supports for impacted sectors and businesses. Throughout the Brexit process, our readiness work was always underpinned by a strong communications and outreach programme.<\/p>  <p>  The UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the Customs Union and Single Market produced inevitable and unwelcome consequences for Ireland. Even with the Withdrawal Agreement and Trade and Cooperation Agreement in place, the seamless trade with the UK when we were both members of the Single Market cannot be replicated as was. The Government continues to do whatever it can to ease the burden on businesses trading with our nearest neighbour, including new requirements concerning customs and SPS checks and controls. While some businesses have experienced specific issues, more than 87% of the trucks landing in our ports from the UK are now being &ldquo;green routed&rdquo; to leave our ports directly, having correctly completed the required customs formalities prior to arriving.<\/p>  <p>  Government Departments, including my own, continue to engage with all relevant stakeholders, whether business representative groups, retailers and individual businesses or shipping companies, hauliers and logistics companies, to manage the issues arising from the new trading relationship with the UK. A range of financial, upskilling and advisory supports for impacted sectors and businesses remain available and we will continue to monitor developments and engage with all key stakeholders. Information on these supports is set out at gov.ie\/brexit.<\/p>  <p>  With new UK checks scheduled to begin on 1 October, the Government&rsquo;s Brexit response communications are now primarily focused on exporters, particularly those moving food and other agri-products.\u00a0 In addition to a nationwide advertising campaign across all platforms - print, radio and digital advertising - a number of webinars for exporters are taking place allowing Government Departments and Agencies to disseminate the relevant technical information to exporters.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the Ireland\/Northern Ireland Protocol, we note the UK statement of 6 September regarding the Protocol grace periods. We and our EU partners continue to engage with stakeholders across the island of Ireland, including in relation to the Protocol. The Protocol is designed to protect the Good Friday Agreement and avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, to protect vital all-island supply chains, and to ensure the integrity of the Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it.

Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they wish to for advice.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  NEPS understands dyslexia in the context the severity and persistence of an individual&rsquo;s needs over time and their response to intervention.\u00a0 This approach aligns with the new Special Educational model in schools which focuses on the identification of need and the matching of specific interventions to that need.\u00a0 Specific interventions are therefore tailored, by the school, to the individual&rsquo;s observed needs by the school, rather than being generic to a specific difficulty or disability. <\/p>  <p>  The Department also provides for special schools and special class placements where more intensive and supportive interventions are provided.\u00a0 Special classes attached to mainstream primary schools also support the needs of pupils with dyslexia.\u00a0 Such classes have a reduced pupil\/teacher ratio of 9:1 and an increased level of capitation grant.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Funding is available to schools\u00a0under the assistive technology scheme for the purchase of specialised equipment such as computers and\/or software to assist children with special educational needs, including children with dyslexia. <\/p>  <p>  Schools apply to the NCSE, through their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) for such support.\u00a0 SENOs make recommendations to the Department where assistive technology is required, in accordance with the criteria set out in the Department's Circular 0010\/2013.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Further resources provided for pupils with dyslexia include reasonable accommodations in State Examinations such as the provision of a reader, use of a tape recorder or scribe, or a spelling and grammar waiver; further details are available on the State Examinations Commission website at www.examinations.ie\/schools\/circulars\/reasonable-accommodations\/.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Department encourages parents and school authorities to engage locally regarding pupils' education.\u00a0 Should a parent be dissatisfied with the manner in which supports have been provided to support their child's education they should raise this matter directly with their school Principal or the Board of Management of the school.\u00a0 Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's present or future educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500087#WRS06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"question","counter":1036,"qnumday":415,"qnumall":"[43379\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500087#WRS06300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the plans there are to increase schools specifically for those with dyslexia in Dublin.","asker":"1485","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1037,"content":"<p>There are no plans to expand Reading Schools at this time. <\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is currently undertaking Policy Advice on Education Provision in Special Classes and Special Schools to examine whether placement in specialist settings brings about improved educational outcomes and experiences, relative to their ability, for students with special educational needs. <\/p>  <p>  This Policy Advice is to be completed shortly\u00a0and\u00a0will then be considered by my Department.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that\u00a0in May 2021, I\u00a0requested\u00a0my Department\u00a0to arrange for a review of the policy on reading classes and schools.\u00a0 When received, this report will also be considered in the context of planning future provision.<\/p>  <p>  It is a priority of my Department that every child\u00a0receives an education.\u00a0 A continuum of education provision is in place\u00a0covering the full range of need\u00a0spanning placement in mainstream classes with supports through to more specialist placements either in a special class or a special schools depending on the level of complexity of need.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My Department spends in excess of &euro;2m annual in supporting this continuum.<\/p>  <p>  Available supports\u00a0include provision to meet\u00a0care needs and provide additional teaching support where this is required\u00a0required.\u00a0 In addition, there are specialist educational supports provided by the National Educational Psychological Services and the National Council for Special Education to help schools provide an appropriate education for pupils with special educational needs including reading difficulties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500087#WRS06400","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Funding","counter":1039,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500088#WRT00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1040,"qnumday":416,"qnumall":"[43384\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500088#WRT00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the amount her Department spent on a school (details supplied) in each of the past four years and to date in 2021, in tabular form.","asker":"1489","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1041,"content":"<p>My Department is collating this information and I will respond to the Deputy shortly with the\u00a0details requested in her Parliamentary Question.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500088#WRT00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects","counter":1042,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500088#WRT00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1043,"qnumday":417,"qnumall":"[43439\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500088#WRT00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of the new school building project at a school (details supplied);

Following consultation on the draft framework, the NCCA plans to publish the draft curriculum for mathematics (junior infants to sixth class) for consultation. The findings from this consultation together with the consultation on the draft framework will help to clarify the relationship and connections between the draft Primary Mathematics Curriculum (PMC) and the full redeveloped primary curriculum.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the PMC from junior infants to second class a systematic review of the literature was conducted, concentrating on teaching and learning for children aged three to eight years. This comprised an international audit of mathematics curriculum policy (Burke, 2014); Research Report 17 (Dunphy et al., 2014) which focused on definitions, theories, development and progression in primary mathematics; and Research Report 18 (Dooley et al., 2014) which looked at pedagogy and learning more specifically. Drawing on this research base, a background paper and brief for development of the draft PMC (NCCA, 2016) was produced.\u00a0 As part of this phase of the research and development of the draft PMC, the draft curriculum specification for junior infants to second class was published on the NCCA website in November 2017 for consultation. This consultation took place between October 2017 and March 2018. The report from this consultation (NCCA, 2018) added significantly to the research base.<\/p>  <p>  Following a decision that the draft PMC should be a single specification from junior infants to sixth class, the second phase of research reports served to complement the existing research base by focusing on the senior classes of primary school. A research addendum to Research Reports 17 and 18 was compiled (Dooley, 2019) which looked at broad teaching and learning considerations for children in the upper years of primary school. This was further supplemented with five short research papers which examined core mathematical concepts, skills and processes with which children engage across the five mathematical domains (Delaney, 2020; Leavy, 2020; Nic Mhuir&iacute;, 2020a, 2020b; Twohill, 2020).\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  At post primary level, the new Junior Cycle Mathematics higher and ordinary level specifications were introduced for first years in September 2018, and were due to be examined for the first time in the Junior Cycle examinations\u00a0 2021. However, due to the exceptional circumstances brought on due to the COVID-19 pandemic these examinations were cancelled. Each of the new Junior Cycle subject specifications will be subject to an early enactment review by the NCCA. In relation to Senior Cycle it is anticipated that consideration of the NCCA&rsquo;s Senior Cycle Review Advisory Report will give rise to further research in relation to\u00a0curriculum and assessment.<\/p>  <p>  The development of any new curricula is funded through the budget provided by the Department to the NCCA annually as part of the Estimates process.<\/p>  <p>  The Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST)\u00a0 and Junior Cycle for Teachers (JCT) as Department of Education funded support services have responsibility for delivering professional development supports to teachers and school leaders in all areas of curriculum and policy for schools. Both services provide Maths CPD to schools and teachers which takes cognisance of Department of Education policy, NCCA curriculum guidance and highly effective national and international practice related to pedagogy in Mathematics Education. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500088#WRT05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Land Issues","counter":1096,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500088#WRT05900"},{"type":"question","counter":1097,"qnumday":435,"qnumall":"[43929\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500088#WRT06000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will intervene, if necessary, using compulsory purchase powers in relation to the situation at a school (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1098,"content":"<p>My Department understands that the lands in question are the subject of a legally binding contract.<\/p>  <p>  My Department further understands that an application under the Strategic Housing Development (SHD) process for the development of the site referred to by the Deputy has commenced.

The means assessment reflects the fact that there is an expectation that people with reasonable amounts of income or capital are in a position to use these resources to support themselves so that social welfare expenditure can be directed towards those who need it most.  <\/p>  <p>  A person may be entitled to Disability Allowance where they have an injury, disease or disability that has continued, or may be expected to continue, for at least one year.<\/p>  <p>  The Blind Pension is a means-tested payment paid to blind and visually impaired people.  It is unique in the social protection system as it is a payment provided to people with a specific physical impairment.  As such, it contains different eligibility and means assessment criteria to Disability Allowance.  Unlike Disability Allowance, recipients of Blind Pension may also qualify for a range of other primary schemes such as Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit, Illness Benefit, and One-Parent Family Payment. <\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I signed Regulations which introduced a new income disregard for Disability Allowance recipients who have been granted bursaries, stipends or scholarships towards completing a PhD.  It is subject to an annual limit of &euro;20,000 per annum (i.e. if a recipient gets more than one bursary, the combination cannot exceed &euro;20,000) and is available for a maximum of four years. <\/p>  <p>  My Department encourages other social welfare recipients to avail of education and training through the Back to Education scheme, as well as by referrals to Education and Training Board courses through the Department's Intreo service.  In addition, income received from the SUSI grant is disregarded in the means test for most social welfare schemes.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, there are a number of scholarships, such as those awarded by certain charitable organisations, which are not assessed as part of the means test for social welfare payments.  These include payments under the 1916 Bursary Fund and under Higher Educational Scholarships for Adult Learners from Uversity to a maximum of &euro;7,000 per annum.  Uversity is a registered charity that has been awarding Higher Education Scholarships to adult learners since 2018.<\/p>  <p>  For both Disability Allowance and the Blind Pension, capital is assessed as part of the means test.  Capital assessed includes all monies held in financial institutions or otherwise, the market value of shares as well as houses and premises owned by a claimant which may or may not be put to commercial use. Property personally used (a claimant&rsquo;s home) is not included in the means assessment. <\/p>  <p>  The Department uses an assessment formula, which is set out in legislation, to calculate a person's weekly means from capital.  For Blind Pension, and most other social assistance schemes, the formula is as follows; the first &euro;20,000 is fully disregarded; the next &euro;10,000 assessed at &euro;1 per thousand, the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;2 per thousand, with the remainder assessed at &euro;4 per thousand. <\/p>  <p>  The capital assessment formula applying to Disability Allowance is unique in the social welfare system, in that the first &euro;50,000 is fully disregarded; the next &euro;10,000 assessed at &euro;1 per thousand, the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;2 per thousand, with the remainder assessed at &euro;4 per thousand. <\/p>  <p>  Any changes to the means test for Disability Allowance or the Blind Pension would need to be considered in an overall budgetary and policy context. <\/p>  <p>  The issue of taxation of social welfare payments is a matter for the Minister for Finance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500090#WRV06400","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Code","counter":1227,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500091#WRW00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1228,"qnumday":479,"qnumall":"[43695\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500091#WRW00300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if matters raised in correspondence (details supplied) will be examined.","asker":"1698","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1229,"content":"<p>This matter concerns proposals to give recognition to loss in pregnancy where the criteria for registration of a birth or stillbirth are not met.

It is important to note that entitlement to these supports is generally not contingent on the nature of the illness or disability but on the extent to which a particular illness or disability impairs or restricts a person&rsquo;s capacity to work.  My Department spent a total of &euro;4.7 billion on illness, disability and caring payments in 2020.<\/p><p>Illness Benefit is the primary income support payment for people who are unable to attend work due to illness of any type.  Additional payments may also be made in respect of a qualified adult and qualifying children.  It is payable for up to two years, based on the person&rsquo;s continued eligibility.<\/p><p>Invalidity Pension is a pension paid to people who are &ldquo;permanently incapable of work&rdquo; because of illness or disability.

When an individual commences employment, they can avail of an income disregard of &euro;140 per week.  In addition, a 50% taper on earnings between &euro;140 and &euro;350 is also applied (disregarded), for the purpose of the means test. <\/p><p>My Department also provides a range of income supports for people who are unemployed.  The two main income supports for people who are unable to find full time employment are Jobseeker's Benefit and Jobseeker's Allowance.  Both schemes require that a person must be available for and genuinely seeking work as well as satisfying the other qualifying conditions.  A person must be unemployed for 4 in 7 consecutive days to be eligible for a Jobseeker payment which means that a person can work part time and still be eligible for a payment as long as they satisfy the scheme conditions. <\/p><p>Jobseeker's Benefit is a social insurance contribution based income support for people who have sufficient contributions paid. It is paid for up to 9 months (or 234 days) for people with 260 or more PRSI contributions paid or up to 6 months (or 156 days) for people with fewer than 260 PRSI contributions paid. <\/p><p>Jobseeker's Allowance is a means-tested payment made to people who are unemployed and seeking full-time work, who do not qualify for Jobseeker's Benefit.  There is an earnings disregard of &euro;20 per day subject to a maximum of &euro;60 per week (3 days).  The balance is then assessed at 60%. <\/p><p>A person who is in receipt of Jobseeker's Allowance for at least 390 days may be eligible to apply for the Part Time Job Incentive Scheme which allows a person to take up part time employment of up to 24 hours per week and receive a payment of &euro;128.60, with an increase for a qualified adult.  Participants on the scheme are expected to continue to seek full time employment and there is no limit on the employment income that they can earn under the scheme. <\/p><p>My Department also provides a number of income supports for low income families who are working, including those working part-time.

They comprise of a standard seven phase programme of alternating on-the-job and off-the-job phases.  The off-the-job training for these programmes is delivered in Training Centres, Institutes of Technology and Technological Universities. Given the practical nature of off-the-job training for craft apprentices, the shutdown of on-site learning activity in 2020 and 2021 had a significant impact on the ability of craft apprentices to progress through their course. <\/p><p>In addition to the general activity surrounding a return to on-site learning across the further and higher education sector a number of specific actions were put in place to support craft apprentices to progress in their training in a timely manner:- <\/p><p>- Craft apprentices were prioritised for a return to on-site learning on 8 March 2021.  <\/p><p>- Delivery of off-the-job phases continued over the summer, subject to public health advice and with restricted numbers. This approach assisted institutions and providers in preparing and organising the safe return of larger numbers in the autumn.<\/p><p>- &euro;20m in capital funding has been provided to increase training capacity in the system with SOLAS and HEA allocating this to ETBs and HEIs. This will facilitate an additional 4,000 craft apprenticeship places, assisting significantly with the immediate backlog issues but also more broadly increase training capacity in the apprenticeship system as the sector caters for higher demand.  <\/p><p>- An additional &euro;12 million was allocated for 2021 to support additional classes and teaching capacity to ameliorate COVID-19 measures at higher education level (Phases 4 and 6).  <\/p><p>- A  three-step plan to tackle the backlog in craft apprenticeship off-the-job training over the coming period by SOLAS and further and higher education providers is well developed. Step 1 of the plan includes an increase in the number of training workshops available across further and higher education from September 2021 onwards. Steps 2 and 3 involve tailored emergency approaches to accelerate the throughput of apprentices at Phases 2 and 6 for a designated period of time. <\/p><p>- Phase 2 apprentice commence off-the-job training throughout the year. SOLAS are engaging with the ETBs to maximise and expand provision to clear the waiting lists for phase 2 training. <\/p><p>- Phase 4 and 6 intakes are currently scheduled three time per year &ndash; September, January and April.  Additional capacity coming on stream at phase 4 and 6 from September has resulted with in the region of 2,500 phase 4 and 6 apprentices scheduled to commence off-the-job training in September, up from 2,100 per intake immediately pre-COVID.  <\/p><p>- In the event that Phase 4 and 6 are prevented from returning at full capacity, a number of alternatives remain available to ensure that craft apprentices are not precluded from qualifying in a timely manner, including the potential for competency assessments to allow apprenticesto qualify.

As in any statutory scheme, a core principle of the scheme is that there is consistency of approach and an equitable treatment for applicants as part of the means assessment process. All applications are assessed nationally with reference to the terms and conditions of the relevant student grant scheme. The terms and conditions of funding are applied impartially to all applicants. <\/p><p>The Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Act 2020 establishes the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment as a social insurance benefit scheme separate from other social protection statutory schemes including the Supplementary Welfare Allowance and Jobseeker Allowance and Jobseeker Benefit schemes. <\/p><p>For student grant purposes the Covid-19 payment has been treated as reckonable income for the SUSI means assessment process since it was introduced in March 2020. This means that the Covid-19 payment is treated in a similar fashion to other Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection payments such as Jobseekers Benefit\/Allowance, thus ensuring a consistency of approach and an equitable treatment of students and their families in the SUSI means assessment process. <\/p><p>However, a very important feature of the scheme that I would point to is the change of circumstances provision. If a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to SUSI to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. The income of all parties to the application will be assessed or reassessed on current income and applicants may also be asked to provide evidence of same. <\/p><p>Such a change in circumstances would clearly include no longer being in receipt of a pandemic unemployment payment. Students will no longer receive the PUP from early September, in line with normal circumstances where students do not qualify for unemployment payments while at college.<\/p><p>An applicant can request a review by contacting the SUSI Support Desk at 0761 087 874 or emailing <i>support@susi.ie<\/i>. <\/p><p>Any student who believes his\/her student grant application has been assessed incorrectly may also avail of the opportunities to appeal to SUSI and subsequently to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board.<\/p><p>Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances.

This phase, taking place over the course of September and October, will see the majority of Covid-related restrictions gradually lifted and replaced by guidance, underpinned by a focus on public health advice, personal judgement and personal protective behaviours, to enable the wider reopening of Irish society.<\/p>  <p>  The plan represents a significant shift in the State&rsquo;s public health management of the pandemic and entails a change from protection at the population level, through regulations and restrictions, to protection at a personal level enabled by supportive measures implemented in relevant settings.<\/p>  <p>On 10 September 2021, my Department issued correspondence to English language education (ELE) stakeholders stating that this plan now provides a roadmap to reopening for all sectors of the economy including for the resumption of activity in the ELE sector initially from 20 September 2021 and incrementally expanding in line with the changes to restrictions following 22 October 2021. ELE providers have been advised that they should make necessary preparations for the safe resumption of activities in accordance with the provisions of this plan while ensuring compliance with public health guidelines alongside all relevant travel restrictions and advices as they evolve. This is noting, that the Government&rsquo;s roadmap does not currently address a plan for the lifting of current travel restrictions which will be kept under ongoing review.<\/p>  <p>  While, subject to the ongoing review of the public health situation, many regulations and restrictions will be lifted over this period, it remains incumbent on ELE providers to ensure that they maintain their duty of care for the health and wellbeing of their staff, their students and their wider communities as levels of activity increase in the coming weeks and months. It is key that efforts continue to be made to mitigate the spread of Covid-19 and that providers do not reopen nor expand their current levels of activity unless ready to do so in a safe manner. To this end, it is essential that all ELE providers: <\/p>  <p>  - Review and keep all sectoral reopening protocols, outbreak management procedures and the associated adaptation framework up to date and in line with evolving public health advice and the national Work Safely Protocols. This is to include relevant updates to arise from the signalled review of the Work Safely Protocols alongside the HSE&rsquo;s upcoming review of the public health response to Covid-19 which will address testing, contact tracing, outbreak management, surveillance and sequencing, <\/p>  <p>  - Continue to review on-site operations in line with the overall progression of disease control and mitigation measures through appropriate risk assessment and engagement, <\/p>  <p>  - Consult with staff and students on their wider reopening plans, <\/p>  <p>  - Ensure that all relevant protective measures, such as mask wearing and physical distancing, are in place and remain in alignment with evolving public health advice,   <\/p>  <p>  - Ensure that sufficient resources and capacity are in place to meet the needs of both existing and any prospective, new students, <\/p>  <p>  - Establish robust procedures for the safe arrival of new ELE students into the State, ensuring that relevant supports and information are in place to assist students to comply with travel restrictions and advices on arrival including where any restriction on movements or mandatory hotel quarantine is required,    <\/p>  <p>  - Promote and encourage vaccine uptake among existing, new and prospective students to the greatest extent possible,      <\/p>  <p>  - Ensure that all staff and students are aware of the locations of nearby facilities for PCR testing, are encouraged to get tested if displaying any symptoms of Covid-19, not to attend in person if displaying symptoms and to self-isolate in the event of a positive test, <\/p>  <p>  - Ensure that every effort is made to support and to comply with the needs of public health officials in the event of an onsite Covid outbreak. <\/p>  <p>  It is also important that the sector as a whole should continue to coordinate its efforts to collectively support its members to manage and ensure a safe and successful reopening.<\/p>  <p>  To facilitate the implementation of the Government&rsquo;s roadmap and the resumption of the recruitment of new International non-EU\/EEA ELE students, my Department will be engaging with the Department of Justice to review the conditions which have been applied to the student immigration system including the Interim List of Eligible Programmes (ILEP) over the period of the pandemic to date. Further guidance in relation to student immigration and ILEP requirements will be provided to the ELE sector once this engagement has been completed. <\/p>  <p>  In advance of the recruitment of new International non-EU\/EEA students, ELE providers will be required to notify ILEP of their reopening plans and to confirm that they have the capacity and capability to safely reopen, to safely bring students into the State in accordance with relevant travel restrictions and advices, to safely provide for their full cohort of students and to fully comply with any and all relevant public health guidelines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500092#WRX04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Further and Higher Education","counter":1336,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500092#WRX04700"},{"type":"question","counter":1337,"qnumday":515,"qnumall":"[43441\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500092#WRX04800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the breakdown of spending under the heading employee development provision including the workplace basic education fund, WBEF, of the national training fund expenditure, particularly the amount allocated for WBEF in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1338,"content":"<p>The Employee and Continuing Professional Development programme provision from the National Training Fund is aligned with Government policy to support workforce upskilling and commitment to roll out the ETB led Skills to Advance programme which is designed to target existing employees with limited formal qualifications.

These units include Burglary Response Units, Crime Task Force, District Detective Unit, Drugs Units and Street Crime Units.<\/p><p>The table below sets out the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to street crime units in the DMR.  <table>    <tr>       <th>DIVISION<\/th>       <th>SERGEANT<\/th>       <th>GARDA<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>DMR NORTH<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>5<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>DMR SOUTH<\/td>       <td>NIL<\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>DMR EAST<\/td>       <td>NIL<\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>DMR WEST<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>DMR SOUTH CENTRAL<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>10<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>DMR NORTH CENTRAL<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>       <td>24<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>TOTAL<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>       <td>43<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>The Deputy may also\u00a0be aware that Operation Spire and Operation Pier are concentrated\u00a0within Dublin City Centre through the DMR South Central and North Central Divisions.

The processing of personal data for marketing and profiling purposes takes place under the so-called &ldquo;legitimate interests&rdquo; ground in Article 6.1(f) of the GDPR, with the case law of the European Court of Justice underlining the importance of free movement of personal data and establishing that Member States are not permitted to impose additional conditions that would have the effect of amending the scope of any of the grounds now set out in Article 6.1 of the GDPR. <\/p>  <p>  The Office of the Attorney General has also advised my Department that section 30 of the 2018 Act appears to go beyond the margin of discretion afforded to Member States in giving further effect to the GDPR and would conflict with Article 6(1) (f), read alongside Recital (47). <\/p>  <p>  Put simply, it is not an option for a Member State to unilaterally prohibit a category of processing activities which might otherwise be lawful under Article 6.1(f). The commencement of section 30 could, therefore, give rise to a substantial risk of infringement proceedings against the State pursuant to Article 258 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  The European Commission has also confirmed that processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest and that Article 6(1) (f) of the GDPR does not make the processing of personal data of a child for the purposes of direct marketing unlawful. <\/p>  <p>  The Commission also indicated that subject to Article 22 (automated decision-making), processing of personal data of a child for the purposes of profiling is not generally prohibited, albeit the processing must take into account that children merit specific protection as clarified in recital (38). <\/p>  <p>  Moreover, the Commission has indicated that the term \"micro-targeting\", as referenced in Section 30 of the Act, is not mentioned in the GDPR, as such its scope remains uncertain and undefined.<\/p>  <p>  Apart from this apparent conflict with the GDPR, the Office of the Attorney General has advised that section 30 gives rise to difficulties under Article 38.1 of the Constitution and under Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Article 38.1 provides that no person shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law. In order for a domestic offence provision to comply with Article 38.1, it must be clear, precise and foreseeable in its application. It is not clear under section 30 what might constitute the processing of personal data of a child for the purposes of micro-targeting. It is also a requirement under Article 7 of the Convention that offence provisions must be sufficiently clear and precise so as to enable individuals to ascertain which conduct constitutes a criminal offence and to foresee the consequences of engaging in such conduct. <\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are keeping this specific issue under review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500094#WRZ04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Antisocial Behaviour","counter":1459,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500094#WRZ04600"},{"type":"question","counter":1460,"qnumday":557,"qnumall":"[43691\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500094#WRZ04700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if her attention has been brought to recent incidences of violent antisocial behaviour in the south inner city of Dublin; the steps her Department is taking to address escalating crime in the area; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1698","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1461,"content":"<p>At the outset, I would like to assure the Deputy that the Government takes concerns regarding anti-social behaviour very seriously.

Any cases\u00a0of assault or intimidation are completely unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  Preventing children getting involved in and diverting children away from criminality when they have already become involved is a\u00a0 key priority for the Department of Justice, and both the Programme for\u00a0Government and the Justice Plan 2021 contain a number of commitments with\u00a0 regard to tackling anti-social behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, I launched the Youth Justice Strategy 2021-2027 earlier this year.\u00a0 The immediate priority within the new Strategy\u00a0is to enhance engagement with children and young people who are most at risk of involvement in criminal activity, principally by strengthening the services available through the existing network of 105 Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs)\u00a0across the State.<\/p>  <p>  GYDPs engage with young people through a range of supports, including education, training and\u00a0 employment support, social enterprise initiatives, as well as personal\u00a0 development and supports such as mentoring and personal development activities. Experience in the operation of the Children Act highlights the\u00a0need to include children below the age of criminal responsibility (12 for\u00a0 most offences) in preventative measures, and to consider the extension of\u00a0 measures to divert young offenders away from the criminal justice system beyond the age of 18.<\/p>  <p>  In line with a commitment\u00a0 in the Programme for Government, I have also established an Expert Forum on Anti-Social Behaviour. This forum is considering the\u00a0 effectiveness of existing legislation and will seek to propose new ways forward, including new powers for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, if required,\u00a0and additional interventions to support parenting of offenders.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that\u00a0there has been an increase of 14% in the number of\u00a0 Garda&iacute; assigned to the Dublin South Central Division between\u00a02015 and\u00a0August 2021, although it should be noted that issues such as anti-social behaviour cannot be solved by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na alone.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, on 13 November 2020 Minister Helen McEntee\u00a0announced that\u00a0the\u00a0 Department will pilot Local Community Safety Partnerships in three areas,\u00a0including Dublin&rsquo;s north inner city.\u00a0Local Community Safety Partnerships\u00a0are the new structures\u00a0described in\u00a0the Department&rsquo;s Community Safety Policy which are designed to take a holistic approach to safety issues in partnership with the community.

Reforming and modernising our licensing law is an important part of how we do that. <\/p>  <p>  Today, I have received Government approval to draft the General Scheme of the Sale of Alcohol Bill 2021 to reform and modernise licensing laws in Ireland. We are delivering on the first stage of that commitment and setting a course for how we will do it.<\/p>  <p>  The outdated Licensing Acts, Registration of Clubs Acts, and the Public Dance Hall Act 1935, will all be repealed and replaced with updated and streamlined 21st century provisions relating to the sale, supply and consumption of alcohol in licensed premises and registered clubs.

A recommendation to establish a Firearms Assessment and Appeals Authority, which would determine, on the basis of an objective assessment of all the issues, with safety of the public being paramount, whether particular forms of firearms may be licensed in the State, whether there should be any limit on the number of such firearms and what safety conditions might properly be applied to their licensing,\u00a0is currently\u00a0under examination by my Department.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation regarding the regulation of firearm licensing continues to be reviewed on an ongoing basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500095#WRAA04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1618"},{"type":"question","counter":1518,"qnumday":576,"qnumall":"[44209\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500095#WRAA04200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will provide details of the current number of valid firearms licences including details on the types of firearms.","asker":"1525","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":1519,"qnumday":577,"qnumall":"[44210\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500095#WRAA04300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will provide details of the number of firearms licences issued and renewed in each of the years 2014 to 2020.","asker":"1525","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1520,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 576 and 577 together.<\/p><p>Unfortunately it was not possible to compile the figures in the format requested by the Deputy within the time-frame permitted.

The primary legislation underpinning the NHSS is the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act 2009. Participants in the NHSS contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone, and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.<\/p>  <p>  The Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Amendment) Act 2021, which was signed into law on 22 July, introduced further safeguards in the NHSS to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses. The principal amendment of this Act ensures that where the owners of farms and businesses go into long-term residential care, their contributions against those assets will be capped at 3 years, providing that a named family successor commits to running the asset for a period six years and certain other conditions are met. <\/p>  <p>  It also includes an amendment in relation to applying the 3-year cap to the proceeds of sale of a house while a resident is in long-term care. This addresses the first relevant commitment in the\u00a0Housing for All Strategy (action 19.7).\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Within the NHSS, the asset value of a resident's home, known in the Scheme as the \"principal residence\", is assessed for 3 years, with 7.5% of its value going towards the cost of care (3.75% in the case of a couple). After 3 years on the scheme, the value of this property is no longer assessed. In practice, this generally reduces the nursing home fees of those maintaining their home, from year four onwards. However, under previous rules, if it was sold, the resulting cash asset was assessable in full for the entire length of stay in care. This could act as a disincentive for those who might otherwise consider selling their homes. The 2021 Act now extends the 3-year cap to cover the proceeds of sale, so that a person will be able to sell their home without incurring additional fees from the fourth year onwards. The timeline set out in the legislation ensures that the Act will be operational by the end of October 2021. In the development of the legislative amendment it was projected that this change would bring up to between 330 and 580 homes to market each year, on average 2.25 years earlier than if sold when the resident left care.<\/p>  <p>  As well as introducing the change above, the Department of Health has also agreed to action 19.8 in the Housing for All Strategy to develop a mechanism in relation to the rental of vacant properties \"in a way that is targeted, equitable, evidence-based and provides appropriate safeguards for vulnerable older people\". It is important to note that complex policy questions remain in meeting these criteria and there are high risks associated with unintended consequences. There is no existing exemption of rental or similar income from assessment within the Scheme and due care needs to be taken to ensure that any changes are appropriate; to protect and meet the needs of residents while also making provision for those in need of housing. <\/p>  <p>  The NHSS is a complex &euro;1.4 billion Scheme that relies on &euro;350m of contributions from over 22,000 residents. It is important to ensure that the costs, benefits, and unintended consequences of any policy changes are fully understood and resolved before they are put in place. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health and Department for Housing, Local Government and Heritage continue to collaborate on this policy, including the identification of the number of houses that may be brought into use and the costs associated with the policy options available to address this action, with a view to introducing legislation as soon possible once this analysis and policy development is complete.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500097#WRCC02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Care Centres","counter":1627,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500097#WRCC02500"},{"type":"question","counter":1628,"qnumday":613,"qnumall":"[43346\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500097#WRCC02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when primary care services and a new primary care facility will be established in Tullow, County Carlow;

The pandemic has demonstrated not only the value of the eHealth initiatives that were specified within the contract, but also others, such as the transfer of prescriptions electronically between the GP practice and community pharmacy and the use of telehealth solutions (audio and video) to enable social distancing and reduce physical contact between patients and clinical staff, during times when the virus was most prevalent.<\/p>  <p>  During the vaccination rollout, the HSE was able to accelerate the Individual Health Identifier (IHI) programme as a result of GPs providing the necessary identifying information for each person vaccinated within GP practices. This in turn will facilitate the practice systems themselves being populated with IHI numbers.<\/p>  <p>  It was not possible to implement the full ePrescribing system during the pandemic.

I am assured by the HSE in the context of the closure of the Centre that the needs and preferences of each resident are of paramount importance.<\/p>  <p>  On 28 June, the HSE notified the Department of Health that the HSE&rsquo;s Cork Kerry Community Healthcare Organisation had taken the difficult decision to close the Owenacurra Centre in Midleton as the building is not fit for purpose.<\/p>  <p>  Owenacurra is a long-term residential centre with 19 residents but also accommodates a mental health day service.<\/p>  <p>  The Mental Health Commission (MHC), as regulator, had raised serious concerns about the centre, and the HSE shares those concerns. HSE Estates confirmed that the building is in very poor condition, with major defects and is not fit for purpose. It was originally planned to refurbish the building but as work progressed on those plans it became clear that no matter what refurbishment takes place, the building could not meet either building or Commission standards. The HSE&rsquo;s priority is the welfare of the 19 residents of the centre.<\/p>  <p>  The relocation process is progressing. I have been informed by the HSE that all of the residents have had their needs assessed so that they can be appropriately placed in accordance with their assessed needs and I understand meetings with the multi-disciplinary team (MDT) to discuss options and the residents&rsquo; wishes (with family, where consent is provided) are ongoing. It is planned to complete the programme of meetings this week .<\/p>  <p>  The MDT continues to have ongoing discussions with all residents and a key contact lead is available as a facilitator for residents, families and the team. Social work input has been increased, including support from a housing co-ordinator, and increased consultant input is also available.<\/p>  <p>  A member from the independent Irish Advocacy Network (IAN) is part of the project steering group in addition to a Mental Health Service User Family Member &amp;amp; Carer Engagement representative, to ensure the residents and families continue to have independent supports available throughout the process.<\/p>  <p>  The process of engagement with the staff is also being progressed. Arrangements will be informed by the terms of the Public Service Stability Agreements &lsquo;Building Momentum (2021-2022)&rsquo; and underpinned by the nationally agreed Redeployment Protocol. The future of the entire site will be considered at a later stage.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE are reviewing what healthcare services are required in the Cork\/Kerry area and if this site is suitable for the delivery of any of these services.<\/p>  <p>  A suspended mental health day service is also located within the building. Work is underway to identify an alternative location for this service, as close as possible to the current location.<\/p>  <p>  The Department and the HSE will continue to work with the MHC to ensure that quality and standards in our mental health facilities continue to be improved in line with best practice and recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500099#WREE04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"question","counter":1773,"qnumday":663,"qnumall":"[43557\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500099#WREE05100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the location in which the 19 residents and patients will be redeployed to in east County Cork after the closure of the Owenacurra mental health centre, Midleton, County Cork;

Home support services are key in facilitating older people to remain at home and, with our ageing population, will become increasingly important in the future.\u00a0 The Government is committed to establishing a new, statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-support services, which the Department of Health is currently developing.<\/p>  <p>  Work is on-going within the Department to determine the optimal approach to the development of the new scheme within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms and on 27 April 2021, Government gave approval to draft a General Scheme and Heads of a Bill to establish a licensing framework for home support providers. In parallel to this, work is ongoing in relation to the development of a reformed model of service delivery for home support. Within this context, funding was secured in 2021 for the HSE to progress the roll-out of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs in the community; the pilot of a reformed model of service-delivery for home-support; and the establishment of a National Office for Home Support Services.<\/p>  <p>  While the new home-support scheme is under development, the Government is prioritising improving access to home-support services. As part of Budget 2021, funding for an additional 5 million hours of home-support was provided. This increased investment will contribute to meeting the Programme for Government commitment to providing equitable access to home-support services.<\/p>  <p>  There will, of course, always be people whose needs are best met in a residential care setting and the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, commonly referred to as Fair Deal, is a system of financial support for people who require long-term residential care.<\/p>  <p>  The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented challenge across our health services and none more so than in our nursing homes. \u00a0The Deputy will be aware that the Nursing Homes Expert Panel was established, on foot of a NPHET recommendation, to examine the complex issues surrounding the management of COVID-19 among this particularly vulnerable cohort. The Expert Panel report, which was published in August 2020, has added further to our knowledge and learning. This report clearly outlines the key protective measures that we must ensure are in place across our nursing homes. These actions are based on learning from our own and the international experience of COVID-19. The report also recommends additional analysis and examination of the relevant public health and other data sets in order that further causal and protective factors for COVID-19 clusters are identified.<\/p>  <p>  Work to progress the recommendations of the Expert Panel report, particularly those recommendations requiring a priority focus in the response to COVID-19, is ongoing across health agencies and stakeholders. The recommendations of the report are varied and complex, are both short-, medium- and longer-term in nature, and require a mix of ongoing operational response to COVID-19 and a longer-term strategic reform. Those strategic reforms are, by their nature, complex and relate to whole of system issues.<\/p>  <p>  At a broader level, there has been significant and ongoing consideration of this impact since the start of the pandemic, with various examinations and development of reports with a focus on COVID-19, its impact on nursing homes and the pandemic learnings that can inform future policy, regulation and the model of care for older persons. The significant examination undertaken by the Expert Panel provides important learning and a framework for enhancing older persons services both in the short and long-term and this work is progressing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500101#WRGG01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":1857,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500101#WRGG01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1858,"qnumday":691,"qnumall":"[43693\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500101#WRGG01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the timeline for the resumption of indoor choir rehearsals.","asker":"1698","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1859,"content":"<p>As outlined in<i>COVID-19: Reframing the Challenge, Continuing Our Recovery and Reconnecting<\/i>, which was announced by Government on 31 August, from 20 September organised indoor group activities such as choirs, bands and music groups can take place with capacity limits of 100 people (with appropriate protective measures) where all patrons are immune (fully vaccinated or recovered from COVID-19 within previous 6 months).

This guidance came into effect on 19 July. The public health advice is to restore visiting to near normal in terms of frequency of visits in those settings with a high level of vaccination of residents as quickly as possible, while also recognising the need to remain cautious as we continue to deal with the evolving risks associated with COVID-19. <\/p><p>The guidance provides that: <\/p><p>- Providers should put in place the necessary measures to progress to more normalised visiting and visiting frequency as quickly as possible in line with public health guidance with no more than two visitors at any one time.<\/p><p>- Routine visiting will no longer need to be scheduled in advance.<\/p><p>- There is no requirement to have a list of nominated visitors.<\/p><p>- The duration of the visit should not be limited.<\/p><p>- Fewer restrictions will apply to residents going on outings or visits outside of the nursing home.<\/p><p>Nursing home providers are ultimately responsible for the safe care of their residents. In a broad sense, visits to nursing homes are governed by legislation under the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013; regulation 11 provides that the nursing home should facilitate visiting and not restrict visiting except in circumstances such as the resident requesting same, or potential risk posed from visiting &ndash; this aligns with the risk assessments referred to in the visiting guidance.  The regulations also require that the nursing home has suitable facilities in place and available for residents to receive visits. It is the legal responsibility of each provider to assess the risks and mitigation measures associated with their service and how best to manage visits having regards to the specific circumstances that arise in relation to their service. The HPSC has developed public health guidance, mentioned above, to assist and support providers in this regard.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the current positive epidemiological outlook and the continued reopening of society, risks continue to remain and emergent risks such as variants of concern present ongoing challenges and the need for vigilance.

Scientific and clinical evidence is evolving on the long-term effects of COVID-19. An increasing number of reports and studies are now being published on the topic; however, at present there is no agreement on the definition or the terminology.<\/p>  <p>  It is recognised that persistent and prolonged symptoms can occur after acute COVID-19 infection in a proportion of patients, including in some patients who did not develop symptoms severe enough to require hospitalisation. My Department, through the Health Research Board, continues to fund research into the clinical impacts of COVID-19.<\/p>  <p>  Patients with persistent symptoms following COVID-19 infection may be followed up by their GP or in hospital settings as clinically appropriate. People in the community who are concerned about persistent symptoms following Covid-19 should contact their GP in the first instance. Treatment is currently focused on management of specific symptoms.<\/p>  <p>  Specific guidance on the treatment of 'Long COVID' is presently under development both here and internationally.  You may wish to note that the HSE is currently recruiting for the position of an Implementation Lead to oversee the implementation of a national model of care.<\/p>  <p>  COVID-19 in children is usually asymptomatic or manifests as a mild illness of short duration. However, concerns have been raised regarding prolonged illness in some children, with no clear resolution of symptoms several weeks after onset, as is observed in some adults and this is an area of ongoing research. Studies to date have identified that that long illness duration after SARS-CoV-2 infection in school-aged children does occur but is uncommon and less commonly than is reported in adults. In most studies of children affected, symptoms are reported to have resolved or significantly decreased over time, providing reassurance about long-term outcomes. Additionally, studies suggest that the symptom burden in children with what has been termed long COVID-19 was not greater than that in children with long illnesses due to causes other than SARS-CoV-2 infection. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE is currently assessing need and the best way to care for those impacted by Long COVID to ensure the appropriate supports are in place. As part of this work on post-COVID care, the HSE is examining how it can model the possible numbers that will be affected, noting that this will take time as more evidence emerges.

The programme is based on the principles of safety, effectiveness and fairness, with the objective of reducing severe illness, hospitalisations and deaths from COVID-19 infection.<\/p>  <p>  The immunisation programme in Ireland is based on the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC). The Committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practices in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department.<\/p>  <p>  The NIAC review all data relating to COVID-19 vaccines on a rolling basis. Following the recommendation for use of vaccines against COVID-19 by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and authorisation for use by the European Commission, the NIAC develops guidance for their use in Ireland which is contained in the Immunisation Guidelines for Ireland. These guidelines are continuously updated and include guidance on all new vaccines as they are approved for use in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  You can read the guidelines at www.hse.ie\/eng\/health\/immunisation\/hcpinfo\/guidelines\/covid19.pdf.<\/p>  <p>  On the 28th of May, the EMA recommended an extension of the use of the Pfizer vaccine to include those aged 12 to 15 years. The EMA subsequently advised an extension of indication for the Moderna vaccine to include use in children aged 12-17 years. The NIAC reviewed these findings and has recommended that vaccination be extended to those aged 12 -15 years, those in this age group will be offered an mRNA vaccination to protect themselves from COVID-19. There are currently no vaccines authorised for use for those aged under 12 years old.<\/p>  <p>  Clinical trials to assess the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in children under 12 years of age are currently ongoing, with results expected later this year. Vaccine manufacturers Pfizer and Moderna are conducting trials in healthy children between the ages of 6 months and 11 years old using lower vaccine doses. Children have different reactions to medications and vaccinations, so conducting clinical trials specific to that population is important to fully understand the benefits and potential side effects of COVID-19 vaccines in this group. Once the data becomes available, it will be thoroughly reviewed by the EMA and the NIAC prior to the vaccines being administered to children under age 12.<\/p>  <p>  Non-pharmaceutical interventions including social distancing, hand hygiene, good respiratory etiquette and ventilation, as well as vaccinating as many adults and adolescents as possible will all help lower case rates amongst younger children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500103#WRJJ04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":2010,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500103#WRJJ04400"},{"type":"question","counter":2011,"qnumday":745,"qnumall":"[44058\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500103#WRJJ04500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if discussions are expected on the way waiting times in hospitals for outpatient appointments can be reduced; if other options will be examined to ease the crisis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1499","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2012,"content":"<p>It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted in the last eighteen months as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic and more recently as a result of the ransomware attack.

This is to be used to fund additional capacity to address the shortfall arising as a result of infection control measures taken in the context of COVID-19, as well as addressing backlogs in waiting lists.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working on a Multiannual Waiting List Plan to address waiting lists and bring them in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500103#WRJJ04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":2013,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500103#WRJJ04700"},{"type":"question","counter":2014,"qnumday":746,"qnumall":"[44069\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500103#WRJJ04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if supports will be put in place for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1605","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2015,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500103#WRJJ04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dental Services ","counter":2016,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500103#WRJJ05000"},{"type":"question","counter":2017,"qnumday":747,"qnumall":"[44076\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500103#WRJJ05100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on the fact that the current wait time for orthodontic treatment when assessed is 72 months; his views on the impact this delay would have on the formation of young person&rsquo;s oral cavity; the reasons for the delay; the efforts that are being made to address the delay; the average wait time in each of the past five years in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1618","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2018,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500103#WRJJ05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":2019,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500103#WRJJ05300"},{"type":"question","counter":2020,"qnumday":748,"qnumall":"[44090\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500103#WRJJ05400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the case of a person (details supplied) will be addressed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2021,"content":"<p>The immunisation programme in Ireland is based on the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC). The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.<\/p>  <p>  In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.<\/p>  <p>  In June 2017, on foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.<\/p>  <p>  The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.<\/p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.<\/p>  <p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020\/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration. This applies to everyone whether or not they have a medical card\/GP visit card, as it is outside of the HPV immunisation programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500103#WRJJ05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services","counter":2022,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500103#WRJJ05600"},{"type":"question","counter":2023,"qnumday":749,"qnumall":"[44142\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500103#WRJJ05700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a child (details supplied) will receive support hours and services.","asker":"1514","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2024,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500103#WRJJ05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":2025,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500103#WRJJ05900"},{"type":"question","counter":2026,"qnumday":750,"qnumall":"[44150\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500103#WRJJ06000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will address a matter regarding the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2027,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500103#WRJJ06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"}]
