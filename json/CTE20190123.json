I remind members to ensure that their mobile phones are switched off or placed in silent mode as they cause problems.  I am delighted that we are having an engagement on the priorities of the Romanian Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  Her Excellency, Mrs. Manuela Breazu, Ambassador of Romania to Ireland, is with us.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome her and thank her and her officials for being here and for giving of their time. I also welcome those in the Public Gallery.<\/p><p>I congratulate Romania on assuming the Presidency of the Council of the European Union at the beginning of this month.  This is Romania's first time to host the Presidency since it joined the EU in 2007.  It is an exciting time and we wish it every success with that.<\/p><p>Before we begin, I must remind everyone of the rules on privilege.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  <\/p><p>I ask the Ambassador to make her opening statement.  The committee is really looking forward to the discussing matters with her.  We know she is an excellent ambassador, very respectable and hard working, and we thank her for taking time out to be with us today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019012300002#A00400","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548252000,"counter":6,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for his opening remarks and for welcoming me.  I thank the Members of the Dail and Seanad for taking time and for the good attendance for my presentation of the first ever priorities of Romania as holder of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  I thank my colleagues from the embassy who are present.  Before starting my presentation I congratulate the D&aacute;il on celebrating its recent anniversary of 100 years since its first sitting and I thank the Members of the Parliament for inviting us ambassadors as representatives of our Speakers to attend that very important event.<\/p> <p>  I would like to begin by thanking the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs for regularly organising meetings with the incoming holders of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, as well as for its constant engagement with European missions in Dublin.  I am honoured to be here as part of this active dialogue on European affairs.  I am particularly honoured that, for the first time in its history, Romania holds the Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  It is a big honour for me to represent my country on this momentous occasion.<\/p><p>Our first EU Presidency will take place against the backdrop of large-scale developments that will determine the shape of the European Union, including the reflection on the future of Europe, the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, the transition towards a new legislative cycle as a result of the European elections in May 2019 and, implicitly, the end of the European Commission and European Parliament&rsquo;s terms of office.<\/p><p> Common efforts by member states and the EU institutions are needed in order to identify workable solutions to major challenges currently facing the European unification project.  Brexit takes the European Union into a new reality.  It must be orderly and managed while maintaining the unity of the EU 27 and securing strong and close future relations with the UK.  The EU will step into a new phase after Brexit.  The Presidency, together with member states and the EU institutions, should act to shape a strategic frame for its future.  In this context, the informal leaders summit in Sibiu on 9 May, two weeks before the European elections, will be a landmark of our Presidency.  It will be a crucial moment to raise awareness among citizens about the added value generated by the EU and to send a message of unity within the European Union.<\/p><p> Furthermore, the end of the current EU institutional cycle translates into a high number of pending issues that reflect key priorities for the future of our Union and its citizens.  We have set a high level of ambition in achieving tangible results while adopting a realistic approach.  For this reason, in the first half of its term the Romanian Presidency will focus its efforts on advancing the legislative process in order to finalise as many issues as possible.  Work will continue assiduously in the second half of our term on the equally important and complex non-legislative issues.<\/p><p> The European Union will need a solid and appropriate budgetary framework and resources in order to achieve the objectives of the following seven years.  The European budget is a reflection of how we see the European Union in the future.  That is why we must ensure that the results of the negotiations on the multi-annual budget are balanced and well calibrated to the daily reality as perceived by European citizens.  In this vein, another topic on our agenda is to move forward with negotiations on the multi-annual financial framework, which is a flagship issue for our Presidency.  We will make all possible efforts to prepare the ground for a timely agreement on the next multi-annual financial framework.<\/p><p> While holding the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, Romania will act as a genuine and honest broker in order to find solutions that enable progress on the European agenda.  We are convinced that cohesion is key in this regard, which is why we have chosen &ldquo;Cohesion as a common European value&rdquo; as our motto and the central theme of our Presidency.  It records the principle of unity of member states and outlines the importance of cohesion policy and its key role in attaining the objective of reducing economic, social and regional disparities among member states and their citizens.<\/p><p> Within this paradigm of cohesion, we have defined our Presidency priorities and assigned them to four pillars of action.  Pillar 1 regards a Europe of convergence.  Our Presidency aims to contribute to ensuring convergence and cohesion in Europe to enable sustainable and equitable development for all citizens and member states by enhancing competitiveness, closing development gaps, facilitating social progress, promoting connectivity and digitalisation, stimulating entrepreneurship and strengthening industrial policy.  Taking forward the negotiation process on the 2021-2027 multi-annual financial framework will be an overarching objective throughout our Presidency.<\/p><p> Pillar 2 relates to a safer Europe.  Our Presidency aims to consolidate a safer Europe through increased cohesion among EU member states in dealing with the new security challenges that threaten the safety of citizens and through supporting co-operation initiatives in this field.  Migration will continue to be the subject of intense debate in Europe and our action on the internal and external management aspects of migration must be comprehensive.<\/p><p> Pillar 3 deals with Europe as a stronger global actor.  During our mandate, we will aim to further consolidate the global role of the EU through promoting the enlargement policy, a more active role for Europe in Africa and south Asia, promoting multilateralism, European action in neighbouring countries, further implementing the global strategy, offering the necessary resources for the EU and implementing all its global commitments.  EU action in the eastern neighbourhood will benefit from a favourable context during the first semester of 2019, in which when we celebrate the tenth anniversary of the launch of the Eastern Partnership.  The enlargement policy as an instrument capable of extending stability and prosperity across Europe will represent another important topic which contributes to a safer and a more prosperous future for the European Union.<\/p><p> Pillar 4 regards a Europe of common values.  Our Presidency aims to stimulate the solidarity and cohesion of the EU by promoting policies to fight discrimination, encourage equal opportunities and equal treatment for men and women, and increase citizens' involvement in European debates.  All EU policies and action should be underpinned by European values and principles as provided by the European treaties.  The advancement of the European project should be progressed with a united, inclusive and open approach among all member states.  There must not be divisions throughout the Union.  This is a key message to reinforce citizens&rsquo; trust.<\/p><p> On the calendar of the Romanian Presidency there will be thousands of technical meetings and hundreds of other important meetings in Brussels, Luxembourg, Strasbourg and Bucharest.<\/p><p> The coming six months offer a great opportunity to bring Romania closer to the citizens of the other member states and to present a European country deeply anchored in the cultural and spiritual tradition of the European Continent.  We look forward to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019012300002#A00500","nonspeaker":"H.E.

This is the most historic period since the establishment of the European Union, formerly the European Economic Community, as a result of what is happening in the United Kingdom.  It will be a sad occasion if the United Kingdom leaves the European Union.  We should be honest that the EU will be a lesser organisation without it.

It is a busy time.  I have no doubt the ambassador is more than fully aware of the concerns of Ireland with regard to the Brexit situation.  It is evolving as we speak.  Romania's support for the Irish position is greatly appreciated.<\/p><p>There was an article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>on 1 January about the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, voicing fears that Romania's fiery domestic disputes and populist politics would be unwanted distractions at a time when the bloc aims to show strength and unity over Brexit.

I welcome Mrs. Breazu's views on the domestic political situation in Romania, the street protests and so forth.  I do not want to strike a discordant note.

I have no doubt she will do a good job.  Notwithstanding the fact, her country comes into the Presidency at a very trying time.  Her Excellency Mrs. Breazu was at our centenary celebrations over the past number of days.  It is amazing to ponder how things have changed over the past 100 years.  In some ways they have not changed at all.  Some of the same issues were as topical 100 years ago as they are today, which is sad and unfortunate.<\/p> <p>  I thank Romania and the other European member states for their support in the negotiations that have been taking place and which are still unfinished.  These are, as we all know, very important negotiations.  It is a very trying time for this country and for the European Union.  It is not just a test of Ireland's mettle or the UK's mettle; it is a test of the mettle of the European Union and what it stands for in the future.  Whatever comes out of this will have a long and lasting impact on the European Union, its composition, its attitude to the world and the world's attitude to it.  It is important we recognise that whatever is eventually decided must be with the agreement of all concerned.  There should be no coercion and nobody should be kicked into a position of having to do something.  That applies right across Europe.  We have discussed many times in our meetings that every member of the European community has a role to play.  That role changes from time to time but cohesion, which Her Excellency Mrs. Breazu mentioned in her speech, is hugely important because 100 years ago was a troubled time across Europe.  People were deciding which way they should go.  They went in different directions and, ultimately, it was a huge calamity.  It was known to many people at the time the route they were taking was the wrong one.  We have had 100 years to ponder.  We have learned much in the meantime.  We have had advances of technology and science.  We hope we can put it to good use in the time that lies ahead.  <\/p> <p>  We hope when the Brexit issue is finally resolved, it is resolved satisfactorily from the point of view of Ireland, which has to be that also of the European Union, and from the point of view of our overseas neighbours in the UK.  The presumption that we have to take what we get, which has emerged in some quarters in recent times, is not well placed.  It is a dangerous presumption, a dangerous way for Europe to go and a dangerous way for Europe to be propelled in the future.  My hope is the remaining time available in the Brexit negotiations will be put to very good use to mend any fences that have broken or fallen down.  Populism has been referred to already.  Many countries across the globe have an upsurge of populism at present.  It is not a great idea.  It has not worked in the past.  It led to mass destruction in the past.  A short time out for everybody to read a little bit of our most recent history should be sufficient to tell us all we should not take that route.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019012300002#C00400","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1548252000,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank members and the ambassador.

The Chairman has put difficult questions to me and I will try to respond to all of them.  First, I thank him for the comments he has made about my country and the relationship between Romania and Ireland.  I have worked hard in the five years I have been here to advance bilateral dialogue.  One of the most important aspects of bilateral relations is the strengthening of parliamentary relationships.  There have been many visits at a higher level between the Speakers of the Houses and various committees and delegations.  There has as a result been a much better understanding between Romania and Ireland in the past five years.<\/p> <p>  On Brexit, the Chairman mentioned how much Ireland had progressed in 100 years.  Romania also celebrated its centenary as a modern state last year.  Since I came here I have witnessed many important events, including 100 years since the Easter Rising and 100 years of the D&aacute;il.  It is also very important that this year we celebrate the fact that it is 30 years since the fall of communism.  We should not forget this.  My colleagues from the European Union will recognise because I share this with them that waking up in January and preparing to travel as the ambassador of a country that holds the Presidency of the Council of the European Union was very emotional for me.  Romania and Europe have changed a lot in the past 30 years.<\/p> <p>  In January 1989 I was getting ready to take up my role as an engineer in a big petrochemical complex on the Black Sea after my maternity leave, with no hope things would be better.  On the contrary, there was the very gloomy prospect that the dictator Nicolae Ceauescu would tighten his grip on Romania.  His ideas had led us to a highly controlled totalitarian regime.  In 2019 we are are not only in the European Union, we also hold the Presidency of the Council of the European Union and I am an ambassador for Romania which is a big honour and responsibility.  We should never forget how Europe has changed, mainly for us, the citizens of a country who lived for 45 years under a dictatorial regime.  That is why holdindg the Presidency has even more important connotations for us.  Ireland has been in the European Union for more than 40 years and held the Presidency six times.  Sometimes for Ireland it is a case of \"Been there, done that\" and continuing, but for us, we are holding the Presidency for the first time in our history.  It has to be good and prove that Romania has changed irreversibly.  I do not think we need to prove this because we have already been a member of the European Union for 12 years.  <\/p> <p>  A question was asked about Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker's declaration on 2 January.  I do not remember the exact date.  When he came to Romania for the formal launch of the Presidency, I think he changed his opinion.  He realised Romania was ready to assume all of its obligations.  As the committee will know, in any country there are political parties in opposition to the government parties, as they should be.  They have to have some conflict, as otherwise they would not be in opposition.  This is an overarching objective of foreign policy of Romania.  I am confident, as are the Government and the President of Romania, that the Presidency will show Romania at its best, as I am here to prove.  Of course, I am only one ambassador for one country of the European Union, but even in this modest role in the whole equation of the EU Presidency I will prove that Romania is very committed to showing that it has the capacity to manage difficult dossiers.  <\/p> <p>  Another question was on migration.  I will tell the committee about Romania's outline migration policy.  It is a controversial issue within the European Union.  In its capacity as President of the Council of the European Union, Romania would like to smoothen the disparities and reconcile the positions of all of the countries that want quotas and those that do not.  As part of the intra-EU relocation programme, Romania has already relocated 728 persons.  It also advanced an offer to relocate 2,100 persons to Italy and Greece.  Among member states, it has made one of the most consistent contributions.  On resettlement, we have transferred 43 Syrian refugees and in 2019 we are going to take another 109 Syrian refugees from Turkey.  Romania was also one of the main contributors to Frontex, sending 180 experts to the agency.  We have made other technical contributions, including the provision of equipment, vessels, helicopters, thermal vision equipment and 32 other vehicles.<\/p> <p>  On migration, when it is my own opinion, it is easy to express, but when it is the opinion of the EU Presidency, it is more difficult to do so.  Of course, it is a very important component of the European agenda.  In its Presidency Romania would like to adopt a comprehensive approach, paying special attention to the external dimension and strengthening co-operation with countries of origin and transit, while also looking to the internal security aspect of migration.  It hopes some progress will be made at the EU-Arab League summit which will take place during its Presidency.  Of course, the right approach should involve tackling problems in the countries of origin, including through development aid.  In that respect, we share the Irish position.  We will make all efforts to advance the negotiations in this difficult and sensitive chapter of the European Union debate.  Romania and the European Union have invested considerable energy and Romania will try to coagulate all opinions to forward the dossier during its Presidency.  This is the overarching principle under which Romania will act.<\/p> <p>  On Brexit, it is a personal issue for me as I am married to a British citizen.  My husband is British and we felt conflicted in the initial days after the referendum.  However, the situation has not become simpler for Britain, Ireland or the European Union.  As mentioned, Romania was a supporter of the Irish position, circumscribing its position to the solitary EU position on the issue.  We reiterate our support for the Irish position.  Romania would not like to see a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  I was impressed by the declaration the German Minister of Foreign Affairs recently made in Dublin, saying the Border was a matter of European identity.<\/p><p>Needless to say, members know better than I do that the ball is in the hands of Britain.  Once the United Kingdom produces its position, it will be easier for everybody, including Romania, as holder of the Presidency of the Council, to take steps forward.<\/p><p> I could make a lot of how I felt.  Reference was made to the impact Brexit would have on Ireland.  My view at the time of the referendum result, paradoxically, was that countries in the eastern part of Europe would be affected even more.  I will not enter into the details, but suffice it to say, I refer not only to cohesion funds and the way they will be directed or limited but also to the fact that the European Union is not the same as it was when we dreamed of joining it.  The European Union has changed.  I want it to become what we dreamed of joining years ago.  It should become a place of peace and prosperity, which it largely is.<\/p><p> The enlargement process is important.  If I was living in a candidate member state, I would think as I thought many years ago, namely, that the European Union was an ideal and that we wanted to join because we wanted to be part of the democratic and prosperous countries, countries governed by the rule of law.  That is what we wanted.  I perfectly understand the position on countries in line to join the European Union.  In that respect, it is a guarantee that the European Union has not lost its relevance.  There are many critics of the European Union, both inside and outside, but with Turkey, Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova, Georgia and the Balkan countries wishing to join, there are over 100 million people who would like to become members of it.  That says something about its values that we should defend.  Romania is in favour of enlargement of the European Union and will try to advance in that regard.  It is important to unite.  There is a gap between what was eastern Europe and western Europe.  We should never forget the countries of the Eastern Partnership which are on the eastern border of the European Union.  We want to be surrounded by a space in which there is peace, predictability and prosperity. <\/p><p> The future of Europe is another important topic.  All of the countries have been through the process of debate on the future of Europe.  I followed with great interest the debate in Ireland and was delighted to see that it included representatives of minorities, including the Romanian ones, as well as the new communities.  It was a very successful process in Ireland.  The summit in Sibiu will be another opportunity for the leaders to get together and share their views.  What do we expect?  We expect a vision in line with citizens&rsquo; expectations.  There was a very important process to share views with voters, citizens, who need to feel close to the European Union.  <\/p><p> The Senator said I was an expert on the European Union.  I contradict the Senator publicly by saying I am not.  It is a very complicated mechanism, which is why I believe it should be explained better to the people in order that they might understand the benefits.  It is also a question of talking about how the European Union has shaped Europe, the obligation to continue with the transformation and how we will continue to transform the Union to dispel the populist tendencies that have emerged, surprisingly for me, in the last year. <\/p><p> Did I respond to everybody?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019012300002#D00200","nonspeaker":"H.E.

The purpose of the meeting is to examine in detail the reasons for the huge projected cost overruns at the children's hospital and the impact these increased costs will have on other capital projects in the health sector.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Colm Desmond, Ms Tracey Conroy, Ms Aonraid Dunne, and Ms Fionnuala Duffy from the Department of Health, and Mr. Dean Sullivan, Mr. Jim Curran and Mr. John Pollock who are representing the HSE.<\/p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.

The members are quite disappointed that the Department declined the offer and the committee feels it has been treated with disrespect in this regard.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform felt it was neither necessary nor appropriate to attend this meeting or to attend any other sectoral committee meetings.  The Joint Committee on Health has only asked the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to attend it on two occasions, this being the second, and on both occasions the Department has declined.  We believe that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has had to be consulted in relation to the cost overrun for the hospital and also the negative knock-on effects that this will have.  It will have to provide &euro;50 million extra capital funding for 2019 and find &euro;220 million extra capital funding in 2020 to 2022, inclusive.  Therefore, we think it has a responsibility to explain to the committee how this will be provided.  The committee also believes that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has responsibility in relation to procurement, which is the central issue to the cost over-run.<\/p><p>I now ask Mr. Colm Desmond to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019012300002#F00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548234000,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Tracey Conroy, assistant secretary in the acute hospitals policy division, Ms Fionnuala Duffy, head of the acute policy unit, and Ms Aonraid Dunne, principal officer in the finance unit.<\/p> <p>  There are many challenges before us to deliver a new national children&rsquo;s hospital.  The infrastructure and the fragmented nature of the existing children&rsquo;s hospitals in Dublin are not fit for purpose to deliver the best possible service for children and young people in Ireland.  We must not lose sight of the ultimate goal to deliver a new children&rsquo;s hospital that will provide national services of the kind that can only be provided in a centre with the scale of services, critical mass of clinical expertise and highly specialised healthcare facilities.<\/p> <p>  Last week in this committee, the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board outlined the current position on this project, including progress in the completion of foundation works at the St. James&rsquo;s campus, phase A, and work on the two urgent care centres, together with approval to proceed with the main construction contract, phase B.<\/p> <p>  On 18 December 2018, the Government approved the construction investment to allow the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board to instruct the main contractor, BAM, to proceed with phase B of the hospital at an overall capital cost of &euro;1.433 billion.  To complete the build of the hospital and outpatients and urgent care centres, an additional &euro;450 million will have to be found over the period 2019 to 2022, including an additional &euro;100 million in 2019.<\/p><p>The total of &euro;450 million requires net additional Exchequer funding of &euro;320 million, of which &euro;50 million is VAT, and an additional &euro;130 million in philanthropic funding.  This is a very significant and disturbing escalation in cost.  On balance, the Government decided to proceed with the project in the face of these higher costs because of the importance of the project for children&rsquo;s healthcare.  At the same time, a full independent review of the cost escalation has been commissioned and is under way.<\/p><p> In February 2018 Project Ireland 2040 and the national development plan were launched and included a very significant overall increase in capital funding for health services in the next ten years.  The new children's hospital is a major element of public health investment provided for in the national development plan.  The capital funding provides the opportunity to reform and modernise the health service to deliver one that is fit for purpose, that citizens can be proud of and that can meet the needs of the growing and ageing population.  Capital funding for the health service will be 165% higher for the next ten years than it was for the last ten.  We have an ambitious plan to build a better health service for the future through the combination of a significant capital investment programme alongside the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare reforms.<\/p><p> Looking at capital investment plans for the public health sector, in addition to the new children&rsquo;s hospital, there are many other health capital projects under way and at various stages of development in the public health sector.  They include the national programme for radiation oncology in Cork, Galway and Dublin, building the new National Forensic Mental Health Service hospital at Portrane, County Dublin, redeveloping the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, the primary care centre construction programme, the replacement and refurbishment of community nursing units for older people and long-term residential care units and housing in the community for people with disabilities and the ongoing need to maintain and update buildings and healthcare equipment and ambulances in response to critical clinical risks.<\/p><p> In the coming decade the national development plan will also support reform in the public health sector, in line with health policies and the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare, including integrating healthcare and a decisive shift towards primary care, investment in maternity hospital relocations in line with strategy, delivery of additional health capacity, including the development of dedicated ambulatory, elective-only hospital facilities which will be provided in response to demographic changes and future demands and investment in health service ICT infrastructure to enable the integration of services and the flow of information across and within hospitals, primary care and community care services.<\/p><p> The health capital allocation in 2019 is &euro;567 million for the construction and equipping of health facilities.  This represents an increase of &euro;129 million on last year&rsquo;s provision.  In the 2019 budget the Government has also provided for additional capital of &euro;50 million in 2020, bringing the 2020 provision to &euro;659 million.  Following publication of its national service plan for 2019, the Health Service Executive is developing its capital plan for 2019.  The capital plan will determine the projects that can progress in 2019 and beyond, having regard to the available capital funding, the number of large national capital projects under way, the cashflow requirements attaching to each project and the relevant priority.  A number of projects in progress are contractually committed to and nearing completion, including the National Forensic Mental Health Service hospital at Portrane and phase 1 of the National Rehabilitation Hospital.  <\/p><p> In developing its capital plan for 2019 and future years the HSE must consider a range of issues, including the expenditure that is contractually committed to, the annual requirement to meet risks associated with clinical equipment, ambulances and healthcare infrastructure and the total capital Exchequer funding required for the new children&rsquo;s hospital in 2019.  The impact of the increased costs for completion of the new children&rsquo;s hospital will, based on the HSE&rsquo;s analysis and Government priorities, see the timing of non-contracted capital commitments managed within the available health capital allocations.  <\/p><p> In line with statutory requirements and consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Health and the HSE are engaged in a process to finalise the HSE's capital plan for 2019, informed by the Government's decision on the children&rsquo;s hospital.  Details of total capital investment in 2019 will be set out in the plan and the HSE will be required to manage its capital expenditure within the agreed plan.  In line with the recent Government decision, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is to revert to the Government in the near future on capital allocations post-2019.  <\/p><p> In terms of the financing of the children&rsquo;s hospital project in 2019, &euro;150 million had already been included in draft HSE capital profiles for the project in 2019.  Based on the outcome of the guaranteed maximum price process, an additional &euro;100 million is required to fund the project in 2019.  The Government decided &euro;50 million of this sum is to be provided from the health capital allocation.  The balance will have to be met by reductions in the capital allocations for all Departments out of a proposed capital allocation of &euro;7.33 billion in 2019, which is an increase of &euro;1.33 billion, or 22%, on the 2018 allocation.  Overall, a total of &euro;10.9 billion is provided for the health sector in the national development plan in the period 2018 to 2027, inclusive.  As regards meeting the additional funding requirements for the project in future years, the Department is engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the HSE.  <\/p><p> The new children&rsquo;s hospital project includes a national hospital being developed on the campus shared with St James&rsquo;s Hospital.  Together with its two paediatric outpatients and urgent care centres on the campuses shared with Connolly and Tallaght hospitals, it will provide all secondary, or less specialised, acute paediatric care for children from the greater Dublin area.  The hospital will become the single national tertiary and quaternary centre providing specialist and complex care for children from all over Ireland.  The fundamental aim of the project is to ensure best possible health outcomes for children with significant ancillary benefits through the creation of a research intensive academic healthcare institution.  There are also significant wider economic and community benefits.  The new children&rsquo;s hospital development is the most significant capital investment project ever undertaken in the healthcare sector in Ireland, a hospital designed and built to support its staff to deliver the best care and treatments for Ireland&rsquo;s sickest children. <\/p><p> In terms of construction and development, considerable progress has been made on the project since April 2017.  Enabling works on the main hospital site are complete, while phase A construction works, substructure works on the main site, commenced in October 2017 and are now also nearing completion.  Development work is also well advanced on the paediatric outpatients and urgent care centres.  Works at Connolly hospital are on target for practical completion of the building in spring 2019, with the opening scheduled for July.  Works at Tallaght hospital are under way, with a target hand-over date of July 2020.  A fully aligned construction programme has been agreed to, with main hospital construction to be completed by July 2022.<\/p><p> A key milestone in the programme of work under way to integrate the paediatric services across the existing sites in advance of the move to the new facilities is the Children&rsquo;s Health Act which was signed into law at the end of November and commenced in December.  The Act provided for the historic establishment of a new body, Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland, CHI, which has taken over responsibility for the paediatric services provided by the three hospitals from 1 January 2019.<\/p><p> As the committee is aware, operational responsibility for the delivery of the construction project lies with the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board which is charged with planning, designing, building and equipping the new children&rsquo;s hospital and outpatients and urgent care centres.  It is headed by a board, appointed by the Minister for Health, the chairman of which the committee met last week.  The board has full statutory responsibility for the design, procurement, building and equipping of the new hospital.  A comprehensive review of the governance structures for the children's hospital project and programme was undertaken in 2017 by the Department and the HSE, in collaboration with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, in the context of embarking on a new phase of the project.  Revised governance structures, including the establishment of a children&rsquo;s hospital project and programme steering group and a children&rsquo;s hospital project and programme board, were approved by the Government in April 2017.  They were implemented in recognition of and to reflect the need to prepare well in advance of completion of the facilities for the integration of the clinical and non-clinical services of the three children&rsquo;s hospitals, preparation for the opening of the outpatients and urgent care centres and the need to manage dependencies across the various components of the project which will support the operation of the new hospital.<\/p><p> The children&rsquo;s hospital project and programme board which is chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health oversees and monitors progress on the children&rsquo;s hospital project and programme.  The children&rsquo;s hospital project and programme steering group is chaired by the deputy director general of the Health Service Executive who is also before the committee today.  The steering group directs the overall programme of work within agreed parameters and reports to the children&rsquo;s hospital project and programme board.  The national paediatric development board receives its capital funding for the project from the HSE, as the sanctioning body for the new children&rsquo;s hospital programme.  The paediatric development board provides regular updates on progress on the capital project for the HSE chaired children's hospital project and programme steering group.<\/p><p> It is acknowledged that the challenges and operational environment for the project will be fundamentally different in some respects as the project moves into phase B.  In particular, the focus on design and value engineering will switch to construction management.  The construction activities and monitoring of the guaranteed maximum price will need constant and active management as the project proceeds and oversight by the governance arrangements.  When the Government approved, on 18 December 2018, the construction investment to allow phase B of the hospital to be constructed, it also made very clear its concerns to ensure the project would be delivered on time and within budget.<\/p><p>There is no doubt but that the additional costs associated with the project are of great concern and we must have assurance that phase B of the construction project will be delivered within budget and timescale.  Accordingly, the Government has also approved the commissioning of an independent review of the escalation in cost in determining the adjusted contract sum, a review of the existing oversight arrangements between the Department of Health, the HSE and the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board and a scenario analysis to identify potential costs of any residual risks to the capital project.  The independent review of the escalation in cost in determining the adjusted contract sum, which commenced last week, will examine the contributory factors and associated responsibilities in order that any potential weaknesses are identified and comprehensively and speedily resolved in the interests of the successful completion of the project and the effective management of public funds.  The Department, the HSE and the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board are fully committed to collaborating with these reviews and to implementing any recommendations arising.<\/p><p> In parallel with the building of the new children&rsquo;s hospital and the urgent care centres, the integration of the three existing paediatric hospitals and the transfer of services to the new hospital facilities represent a highly complex project in its own right.  Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland is leading this major programme of work of integration and change management to, first, run integrated services on the existing hospitals&rsquo; sites and, second, achieve a successful transition to the new facilities as they open.  My colleagues and I are happy to address any queries members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019012300002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Desmond","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548234000,"counter":35,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I am deputy director general in charge of strategy and planning for the HSE.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss the increased costs for the national children&rsquo;s hospital, an issue which is clearly of significant concern.  I am accompanied by Mr. Jim Curran, head of estates within the HSE, and Mr. John Pollock, project director within the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.<\/p> <p>  I would like to provide members with an overview of the structures and processes in place and the HSE&rsquo;s role in regard to the children&rsquo;s hospital project and programme.  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board was established as an independent board through statutory instrument in 2007.  The statutory instrument conferred on the board the functions of planning, designing, building, furnishing and equipping the national children&rsquo;s hospital in accordance with a brief approved by the HSE with the prior consent of the Minister for Health.  The chair of the development board and the 12 board members are appointed by the Minister for Health.<\/p> <p>  The HSE is the sanctioning body for the new children&rsquo;s hospital and the associated urgent care centres and is the principal capital funder for the programme, which must be managed within the overall capital plan.  The HSE provides funding for the programme based on approved plans submitted by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board and approved by the Minister.<\/p> <p>  As outlined to the committee by the Department, in May 2017 the Department of Health set out revised governance structures for the children&rsquo;s hospital project and programme.  The programme board is chaired by the Secretary General and I have been chair of the steering group since May of last year.  The responsibility of the programme board is to oversee progress of the project and programme to ensure the programme is delivered against the agreed parameters in regard to timeline, scope and funding.  The responsibility of the steering group that I chair is to direct the overall programme of work within agreed parameters and, crucially, to ensure an integrated approach is taken across all the different programme elements.  Both the programme board and the steering group include director-level representation from the Department of Health and the HSE.  The steering group considers monthly progress reports in regard to the capital project, the integration of the three hospitals, workforce, ICT and other relevant issues.  These monthly steering group reports form the basis for updates to the programme board.<\/p> <p>  As committee members are aware, the procurement process for the national children&rsquo;s hospital involved a two-stage tender process.  This approach was agreed in 2014 with the Government contracts committee for construction.  The substructure for the building, that is, phase A, was tendered on the basis of a full design, while the associated tender for the main hospital building, phase B, was on the basis of a preliminary design with an approximate and re-measurable bill of quantities.  Consistent with this approach, and following a competitive tendering exercise, the work on phase A was commenced in October 2017 and, in parallel, the second-stage detail design work was initiated to determine the cost for phase B.  The outcome of phase B is a cost which is considerably in excess of that envisaged following the initial tender process.  As has been noted already, this escalation in costs is of significant concern and will undoubtedly impact on other priority health investments.<\/p> <p>  An independent review of the escalation in cost in determining the guaranteed maximum price has been commissioned by the HSE in discussion with the Department and commenced this week.  This review will examine the contributory factors and associated responsibilities in order that any potential weaknesses are identified and comprehensively and speedily resolved in the interests of the successful completion of the project and the effective management of public resources.  This review is expected to be completed in March of this year.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt an urgent need for a new children&rsquo;s hospital to care for sick children and their families in Ireland.  The development of the new hospital and the two urgent care centres is central to the implementation of a national paediatric model of care, a model in which children receive the care that is appropriate to their needs, delivered as close to home as possible.  That concludes my opening statement.  With my colleagues, I am happy to answer any questions the committee may have. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019012300002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dean Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1548234000,"counter":37,"content":"<p>Thank you.  To open proceedings, I will ask three questions.  First, having listened to the evidence given to us last week by the development board of the hospital, we heard of the two-phase tendering process.  We feel the cost overrun is particularly identified in that two-phase tendering process.  Phase A was tendered on the basis of full design but phase B was tendered on the basis of preliminary design, with approximate and re-measureable bills of quantities, and this is where the cost escalation arises.  Phase A was agreed without knowing the cost of phase B or agreeing the cost of phase B.  When it came to agreeing the cost of phase B, the cost had escalated by &euro;320 million.  Mr. Desmond might comment on that.<\/p> <p>  The second question is in regard to the reporting process.  In his opening statement Mr. Desmond outlined the reporting process, which seems overly cumbersome.  We have the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, which receives funds from the HSE and provides regular updates to the HSE.  We have the children's hospital project and programme board, which is chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and is tasked with the integration of clinical and non-clinical services; preparing for the opening of the outpatient department, OPD, and urgent care centres; and managing dependencies across various components.  We then have the children's hospital project and programme steering group, which is chaired by Mr. Sullivan and is to direct the overall programme.  Mr. Desmond might go into detail on those reporting processes.<\/p> <p>  The third question is in regard to the knock-on effects this will have on other capital programmes.  The Department has identified that where contractual arrangements have already been entered into, projects will continue, such as at the forensic hospital and the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, but all other projects seem to be subject to the knock-on effects of the excessive cost of the children's hospital.  Mr. Desmond might comment on those three items.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019012300002#H00400","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548234000,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I ask my colleague, Ms Tracey Conroy, to commence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019012300002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Desmond"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548234000,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I will start with the first question.  In regard to the evidence around the two-stage procurement process, it is important to say that, owing to the size and complexity of the project, and there was some discussion at the committee last week in this regard, it was decided at an early stage that the traditional design and tender method of procurement was not suitable or realistic.  A procurement strategy was developed to ensure the new children's hospital would be delivered without further delay, as well as to deliver value for money, comply with public and EU procurement rules and reduce risk.<\/p> <p>  It is important to say there was extensive collaboration with the Government's contracts committee for construction.  That committee recognised the challenges a project of this size and complexity would face in attracting contractors with the skill and capacity to undertake it.  The Government's contracts committee accepted the principles of the procurement strategy in February 2014 and its procurement subcommittee agreed the detail of the strategy in May 2015, which is some way back in time.  In regard to the investment decision for phase A, the Government was advised in April 2017 of the two-stage contract process, with stage one consisting of a scope refinement and value engineering process based upon tendered rates, as the Chair has mentioned, to finalise the contract sum and a guaranteed maximum price.<\/p><p>The Government was advised at the time that a risk contingency allocation had been set aside to fund the guaranteed maximum price.  It is important to talk a little bit about the key components of that two-stage strategy.  <\/p><p> The tendering of the substructure, or phase A, works on the basis of a full design with a full bill of quantities reflecting that, while then at the same time tendering the main project works, or phase B on a preliminary first stage design with an approximate and re-measurable bill of quantities, reflecting the preliminary first stage design.<\/p><p> Having started the phase A works on site, the second design phase for the phase B works could be completed, and the bill of quantities updated to reflect this.  <\/p><p> By agreeing a guaranteed maximum price for the contractors involved, reflecting that detailed design, which requires the contractors to take all of the risk for the quantities thereafter, and limits their recovery of additional costs to clearly define scope challenges and changes and inflation in excess of 4% which might occur post-July 2019, it significantly de-risks the project.  That was the decision was taken at a time.<\/p><p> In considering the benefits of two-stage procurement process-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019012300002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Tracey Conroy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548234000,"counter":41,"content":"<p>On this point, was a maximum price ever placed on the construction of the hospital by the Department of Health or the Government that could not be exceeded?

Owing to the complexity of the programme and project and the number of stakeholders required to ensure the project is safely delivered, we put in place new governance oversight arrangements, which were agreed by the Government in May 2017.  First, the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board has statutory responsibility for the delivery of the capital project.  It is headed by an experienced board and is facilitated by a strong executive team and experts, of which the committee was advised last week.  This board reports to the HSE and to the Departments on its functions through the children's hospital programme and project governance structures.<\/p> <p>  As the Chairman has already outlined, the children's hospital programme and project board is chaired by the Secretary General of the Department, as Accounting Officer, and it has responsibility for overseeing the project in its entirety.  The children's hospital programme and project steering group has responsibility for the delivery of the project.  It is chaired by the deputy director of strategy section, a delegated function from the director general of the HSE.  It has responsibility for ensuring that the project is delivered within its parameters.<\/p> <p>  It is important to say that the various roles of the various parties, namely, the build board - we call it that for shorthand - the children's hospital programme and project board and the children's hospital programme and project steering group all flow from legislation, including the Health Acts, with the respective roles of the Secretary General of the Department as Accounting Officer and the director general as accountable officer.  We believe in the Department that these governance structures are appropriate.  They were put in place to reflect the move, post the government decision on construction of phase A, from the design process into construction of phase A.<\/p> <p>  The committee will be aware that as part of the Government decision in December, it requested an external review of the oversight arrangements.  These refer to the governance and oversight arrangements of the project as between the Department, the HSE and the build board.  The intention is that the review of cost escalation, which will be completed in March, will inform and feed into that review.  This will start in March once the first review had been completed.<\/p> <p>  While we feel that the arrangements are robust, were agreed and considered in close consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and were approved by Government, in the light of the cost overruns here there certainly is a need to have a look at those arrangements to see if there are any weaknesses that need to be identified in the context of the move now to phase B of the project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019012300002#J00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Tracey Conroy"},{"type":"speech","time":1548234000,"counter":49,"content":"<p>The last question concerns where Mr. Sullivan said that the cost escalation will undoubtedly impact on other priority health investments.

As to Limerick and Cork, we will certainly have to examine carefully what we can now manage going forward and that is a process that is under way.

In two years, the cost has gone from &euro;650 million to more than &euro;1.7 billion, which is more than &euro;1 billion in additional funding.

When the client paid the &euro;1 million, he or she would pay twice as much per bedroom as the most expensive house of this kind that anyone has ever built.  There is a guy in Sweden who built a house like this and it is the most expensive of its kind ever built.  Per bedroom, the hospital will cost twice as much as his.

It is obvious that there are grave concerns.  Mr. Desmond stated that there is no doubt that the additional costs associated with the project are of great concern.  I am sure the people sitting at home and the members here who are worried about their local projects and the knock-on consequences of this catastrophic overrun will take a massive amount of comfort from the fact that senior people in the Department are greatly concerned about the project.  We are here to find out what, if anything, was being done to curb it.  Mr. Desmond also stated, \"we must have assurance that phase B of the construction project will be delivered within budget and timescale\".  I thought that was a joke, but apparently it is not.  Who will be providing that assurance?  Presumably, the Department is dealing with the same personnel it has been dealing with all along.  There is no significant change in personnel.  I share the view on what does and does not constitute competency in respect of the board, based on the actions and this overrun.<\/p> <p>  From whom will the Department get the assurance, particularly in view of the fact that it states that it must be assured that phase B of the construction project will be delivered within budget and timescale?  Perhaps the witness could answer in two parts.  First, there is why that assurance was not available initially.  It is becoming increasingly obvious that senior people went into this project with a hands-off approach to spending, which is why we are here.  Now the Department is concerned about the spending, which is welcome if a little late.  However, it is going back to the same people to seek assurances on phase B.

Obviously there are three hospitals feeding into the design on this and they were looking for all of their requirements.  Is there some duplication in respect of the overall size of this project?  Will we have the same situation as we have now in Cork?  We may open this project in 2022 and then ten years later find that part of it is not properly in use.  I am wondering if that process was looked at.  Each of the three hospitals, like everyone here, will have fought its corner.  Was that really analysed?  We are now talking about a huge project of 6,150 rooms.  I know other people will just focus on the number of beds but it is more than beds.  It is about rooms.  From last week, I understand something like 141 outpatient departments will be running at any one time.  Will there be duplication and will we end up with facilities lying idle?  Are we satisfied that every part of this building will be fully operational from the day it opens?  Obviously it will be a phased opening and will not be all in on a single day but two years from opening, will every aspect of this hospital be fully operational?  I hope we will not have the scenario that we have in Cork.  This is not just in Cork but in other hospitals around the country where facilities are lying idle because there is not funding available for staffing or to set them up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019012300002#O01300","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548234000,"counter":180,"content":"<p>In general terms I agree.

This is the first major significant hospital facility bringing together three hospitals.  It is of its nature a very significant project anyway and it brought challenges with it.  My colleagues can deal with the historic issues the Senator raised regarding the earlier phases of this.  We deal very closely with our colleagues in HSE estates in respect of what we can negotiate with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform each year regarding the capital envelope.  We have to operate within that each year and, within that, we then consider what is actually required from a contractual point of view and what it needed from the point of view of policy development so that we can meet those requirements within the funding available to us.

This project has had a chequered and difficult history.  We have been talking about building this national children's hospital for decades.  Lessons were learned in the context of the project's previous history, particularly leading up to the failure of the planning permission at the Mater site.  Those lessons were learned and addressed in the appointment in August 2013 of two competency-based boards; the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, with the competencies required to design, build and equip the hospital, and what was then the children's hospital group administrative board, which acted as the client for the build board and was responsible for planning the integration of services.  That has been known as Children's Health Ireland since the enactment and part-commencement of the Children's Health Act 2018.<\/p> <p>  While I acknowledge I am speaking in the context of significant cost overruns that are of grave concern, in fairness, if we chart the history of the project from the appointment of those boards in 2013 to where we are now, there have been very significant achievements and progress in the timelines of the project.  I refer to the design, the key milestone of the achievement of the planning permission and the start of construction since the Government decision in April 2017.  All of those timelines are now within parameters.  The build board is on time in respect of completing phase A of the project shortly.  Phase B will have commenced on site by the end of this month.  Mr. Pollock will correct me if that is wrong.  The project is on track where the outpatients department, OPD, and urgent care centres are concerned.  We are looking forward to completion of the Connolly hospital facility in spring of this year and an opening in July, as well as an opening at Tallaght Hospital in spring of next year.  They are very significant milestones.<\/p> <p>  The enactment of the Children's Health Act 2018 and the establishment of Children's Health Ireland are very significant achievements.  We went from having three voluntary children's hospitals, which came together and worked with the Department in a highly collaborative fashion.  They practically wrote that legislation with us.  It is really elegant legislation that achieves a good balance between accountability and authority and will oversee a radical transformation of children's health services in this country.  They are the lessons learned on the project to date.  We need to continue to learn lessons, however.  The external review on the cost escalation will not just have implications for this project.  It will also have learnings for other capital projects.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019012300002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Tracey Conroy"},{"type":"speech","time":1548234000,"counter":185,"content":"<p>The question I asked concerned the children's hospital as currently proposed and what was proposed for the Mater.

That will mean a gradual ramping-up and phased opening of services for this hospital.  That is the appropriate thing to do.  The activity and capacity planning started as far back as 2007 in order to get it right-sized.  That has been continuously refreshed and amended, as my colleague has said, with a view to demographics and, more importantly, the changing clinical practices and the model of care that is right for children in this country.  That has informed the capacity.  In fact, rather than having idle capacity we were more concerned with having sufficient capacity in this hospital to meet the demand.  Two things were really important in that regard.<\/p> <p>  The first of those was to gradually ramp up the staffing, which we have been doing.  Over the last few years and in the years leading up to the opening of the new hospital, we have been investing in expanding the workforce from a revenue perspective.  That is particularly apparent in 2019.  The HSE's service plan includes significant investment in expanding the workforce in order that we can open the urgent care centre in Connolly hospital this year and plan for the opening of the Tallaght Hospital facility next year.  It is very important that we ramp up that workforce because attracting and retaining the calibre of staff we need may be a limiting factor.  We need to do that incrementally.<\/p> <p>  We found it equally important to avoid excessive demand on this hospital from the regions.  Starting this year, we have been investing revenue in expanding the regional centres for paediatric care in Cork, Limerick and Galway.  We are working to ensure the Dublin hospitals work very closely with them to keep providing children and families with services close to where they live rather than obliging them all to come up to the new hospital and the existing services.  There is a lot of activity and workforce planning happening to get the capacity right, to get the regional capacity right and to attract and build up the workforce well in advance of the opening of the hospital. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019012300002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Fionnuala Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1548234000,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I would like to go back to forward planning.

Regarding the children's hospital there has been huge collaboration and engagement with the three existing children's hospitals on the design, scope and progression of the capital, as well as the integration programme.  Any decisions that have been taken by the Government around capital projects on which we have been engaged as a Department in recent years have been informed by a very strong evidence-based policy.  I refer to the maternity strategy and the decisions taken by the Government on the principle of trilocation of maternity hospitals with acute hospital sites.  That was all done in collaboration with the key stakeholders.  We are engaging with the National Maternity Hospital and St. Vincent's University Hospital.  Decisions have been taken by the Government on the provision of maternity hospitals.  The moves of the Coombe and the Rotunda hospitals, as well as a Limerick maternity hospital, are all included in the national development plan.  There will be detailed consultation with all of those hospitals in that regard.<\/p><p>We have a national trauma strategy, which was written by the key clinicians, patients and hospitals involved and is now being implemented by the HSE in a groundbreaking consultative fashion.  Mr. Sullivan may want to speak about this because there have been recent consultations in this regard.  We have also published a national cancer strategy that makes recommendations on capital infrastructure, which will also be the subject of detailed engagement with the hospitals concerned.  The elective hospitals, including those in Cork, will be no different.  A process is required on decisions on policy in the first instance, then engagement with the hospitals on that policy and engagement on implementation and timelines.  I agree that when we look at the scale of what is proposed in the national development plan we need to improve the system to fast-track the delivery of these projects.

I welcome and thank the witnesses and my colleagues for the detailed scrutiny and questioning.  At a public level, and especially at the level of families who have children with serious chronic conditions and the many organisations and other interests that support them, this is a frightening scenario.  I do not say this to be difficult but it is.  They feel this is a runaway horse.  Whether or not it is, it is the feeling people have in their guts about it.  It is important to make this statement.<\/p> <p>  Ms Conroy stated several times there are lessons to be learned and this is very helpful.  It is important these lessons are put in the public domain as quickly as possible so we can have a good open discussion and consideration of them.  This is one challenge I am putting to the witnesses.  One learning might be for us to be forensic outside the project building element.  Ms Duffy made reference to staffing capacity and planning and this is one example.  The cost of the capital project will be what it will be, and certain decisions have been made.  I know it is an awful political statement but we are where we are.  None of us likes where we are.<\/p> <p>  We also need to start looking at how the hospital, which is not just a building on a piece of ground, will link with, for example, a local GP in Clare, people and families, and how it will be able do more and have support.  There are issues outside of health with regard to the conditions in which people live, such as housing, their incomes and their remoteness or closeness to services, support and education.  I strongly underline this.<\/p> <p>  More specifically, I want to discuss Mr. Desmond's opening statement.  When dealing with the capital plans he stated seven projects are on the move at present.  I will take one, the redevelopment of the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, as an example.  Since I started working in the Irish Wheelchair Association as a young fellow in 1980, I have constantly heard about capacity and development issues.  Ten or 15 years ago there was talk of having another unit in Cork.  Last year, we had bed closures.  I cannot remember the detail but in the middle of last year there were also issues with a consultant on the children's side. There are people in that hospital, and I have met some of them, who are there not because they need to be there but because they cannot be at home.  In recent times the best thing we have been able to do is put them into a less acute residential or nursing setting rather than have them at home.  I am simply making the point.  We get best value when we look at what is happening around and outside as well as at the dysfunctions and issues.  I am interested in any comment or remark on this.<\/p> <p>  How will planning identify where the problems are?  All of us are familiar with the HSE stating it will be in a position to look at the support needs of a person when he or she gets a house while the local authority states that until the HSE is able to tell it the support package is in place it will not move on the housing side.  This is happening today and will happen tomorrow as well as having happened yesterday.  It is not just history.  Many issues impact on this.  We will have retrospective consideration of these matters if we do not look at parallel issues now.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the governance structure of the hospital, I want to underline the fact it is about what happens outside as well as within the operation.  It is not the actual eye of the discussion we are have this morning but it is about value for money and getting the best bang for our buck for the people and families who need the services.  I would welcome any remark from our witnesses on this and I welcome the fact the committee will specifically look at this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019012300002#Q00400","speaker":"1419"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548234000,"counter":199,"content":"<p>I cannot disagree with the Senator on the priority we would like to see on care being provided to individuals and individuals being accommodated, if that is the appropriate issue, closest to where their need is and, ideally, in a community or primary care setting.

There are also the primary care programme, community nursing units, disability and other work of which the Senator is aware.  The focus of Sl&aacute;intecare is entirely to support this.  The Minister supports this and an implementation plan is in process.  Deadlines are in place with regard to when it will move forward.

It arose out of various reports on rehabilitation so at least the development of the hospital was based on evidence.

I know Mr. Pollack is very fluent on this in terms of describing how the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, in progressing the capital project, even at this stage and prior to completion, is engaging with the local community to harness the economic benefits of the project, from a health and other points of view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019012300002#R01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Tracey Conroy"},{"type":"speech","time":1548234000,"counter":213,"content":"<p>Yet, it is my experience and I would say is the routine experience of other Members of the Oireachtas, that one public body, in the way that it does its work, trumps another body so there is a nil all draw.

I wish to make a number of comments and ask questions.  I thank the officials from the Department of Health and the HSE for coming here.  The committee extended an invitation to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform but no officials from that Department are in attendance.  Their non-attendance is akin to staging a production of \"Hamlet\" without the Prince of Denmark.  Their non-attendance is not the fault of the witnesses present.  I wish to put it on the record how disappointed I am that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform decided not to send any officials to the meeting.<\/p> <p>  As we all know, a quarter of the population are under the age of 16.  Without doubt, they deserve the very best of services but the overspend on the national children's hospital is very worrying.  If this matter was not so serious it would be funny.  I listened to what the witnesses said this morning and it seems the costs have snowballed.  Plans were made but the hospital will cost so much more than originally planned.  Would the witnesses define the costs as an overrun or an underestimation?  Both aspects are very serious, unacceptable and unprofessional.<\/p> <p>  Many members have watched the television programme \"Room to Improve\" where the architect Dermot Bannon comes up with great ideas for house extensions and improving houses.  On the programme, he has a very able quantity surveyor who manages the project and ensures that he does not do anything that was not part of the original contract.  The hospital is a very big plan so surely there was someone in a similar role who should have said, \"Stop\", reminded people that the expenditure was not part of the original agreement and asked people to curb expenditure.  Who signed off the original contract?  What name is on the contract?  Is the initial contract not binding?  What projects will be delayed due to the overspend?  What are the knock-on effects of the overspend?  I am a great believer in looking forward and accept that the past cannot be changed.  What lessons can be learned from this debacle?<\/p> <p>  I wish to ask a few questions about the opening statements.  Mr. Sullivan said that an independent review is ongoing and will be completed in March.  Does he think that completion time is acceptable?  I believe it is too long to wait, particularly after he mentioned how much the project will cost.  Let us remember that taxpayers' money will be used to pay for the building project.  Taxpayers will also pay the extra cost for the review.  Does he see it as value for money?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Desmond said that there is a \"disturbing escalation in cost\", which is putting it mildly, and that \"the Government decided to proceed with the project\".  Can he tell me the exact date the Minister for Health and the Taoiseach were made aware of the \"escalation in cost\"?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Desmond mentioned also that there are different health capital projects under way.  I especially welcome the fact the plans include the radiation oncology unit in Cork as it is very difficult for patients to travel from Cork to Dublin for a treatment due to the distance involved.  Can he outline the status of that project, please?  If he does not have the information to hand then he can forward it to me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019012300002#R01400","speaker":"1262"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548234000,"counter":215,"content":"<p>The Deputy has asked a wide range of questions, some of which are appropriate to other colleagues here.

We are subject to the process involved in that case.  With regard to radiation oncology, the programme continues in 2019.  The CUH unit will be equipped, commissioned and become operational by the end of 2019.  That is the timeframe given at this point in time.  The enabling works contracts to facilitate the construction of the unit in Galway University Hospital campus has commenced and construction of the main building will commence before the end of 2019.

At each stage of the process when it became clear or when the build board indicated an escalation in costs, the Minister was apprised.  We referred to post-April 2017.  An issue arose in September 2017 with regard to potential additional costs of &euro;60 million.  The Minister was apprised as soon as the Department became aware of it.  The issue was the subject of detailed discussion, including with regard to mitigation measures and the use of contingency funds and so on, between the steering group, the CHP&amp;P board and the build board from September 2017 to August 2018 when the further indication of the escalation of costs was indicated by the build board to the Department.  That was on 24 August 2018.  The Minister was apprised on 27 August.  In other words, 24 August was a Friday and the Minister was told on the Monday.  I will emphasise that it was an indication of escalation of cost.  At that stage, the build board was in the process of finalising the guaranteed maximum price for the contractor.  It was going through that process.  The Department advised the Minister of that.  The build board then went through its process of finalising the negotiations, having a guaranteed maximum price agreed and making a recommendation, which it did in November to the HSE and the Department.

Maybe it is not fair to say but it strikes me that it dawned on the witnesses in April 2017 that things were not going right, that the board was not fit for purpose, so instead of discharging the board, they decided to create another layer, which is typical of the HSE, to my mind.

The numbers relating to all of this are potentially confusing.  As Ms Conroy stated, in April, as signed off by the Government, there was an expectation that the total cost for the construction element will be of the order of &euro;983 million and that was what was sanctioned at the time.  There was a recognition, however, that the procurement process being taken forward under the auspices of the development board involved a fully specced-out design phase A and that phase B was designed to a high percentage but there were details to be worked through.  As Ms Conroy also stated, in April 2017 when Government sanction was issued and the new structures were put in place, not to change the role of the development board in any way but simply to evolve the governance arrangements with respect to which it reported, the figure was &euro;983 million.  The first time that figure changed, as we discussed earlier and as was described by Mr. Pollock and Mr. Costello last week, was when there was a &euro;60 million or so pressure reported in the period October to December 2017 and into the early part of 2018.  No pressure at all was reported in April 2017.  That was effectively the start of the process.  Contracts were signed in October 2017, phase A works were under way at that point and phase B was taken forward as well in terms of speccing out what the final project would look like.  However, all the way through the back end of 2017 - October to December - and into early 2018, the extended issue or pressure on the &euro;983 million was that &euro;61 million.  Mr. Costello previously explained the components of the &euro;61 million.<\/p> <p>  The first time the development board, the steering group to which it reports or the board to which the steering group reports were aware of significant pressure over and above the &euro;61 million was in August 2018.  Again, we have discussed that.  That was finally bolted down and crystalised within the GNP report that was shared in November 2018, which takes us all the way through to the overall pressure of &euro;450 million on top of the &euro;983 million.  It is complicated, but not that complicated.  In April 2017, there was no pressure.  We had sanction to proceed with an overall expected cost envelope of &euro;983 million.  The &euro;60 million pressure emerged towards the end of 2017 and the beginning of 2018.  That grew to a pressure of approximately &euro;200 million in August.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019012300002#V02900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dean Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1548234000,"counter":375,"content":"<p>From what did it arise?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019012300002#V03000","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548234000,"counter":376,"content":"<p>A comprehensive analysis was provided last week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019012300002#V03100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dean Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1548234000,"counter":377,"content":"<p>Can I have specifics?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019012300002#V03200","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548234000,"counter":378,"content":"<p>I am very happy to that hand over if it would be helpful to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019012300002#V03300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dean Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1548234000,"counter":379,"content":"<p>We will get that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019012300002#V03400","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548234000,"counter":380,"content":"<p>That detail was gone through last week.

I see the impact of this daily on local communities.  In 2015, people from the local community asked questions at the oral hearing of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which lasted for three weeks.  Many of these questions were swept under the carpet.  I did not consider the questions minor.  They related to irritants for communities, including problems with dust, noise, roads and lighting, all of which is impacting on us.  BAM frequently does not adhere to requirements.  Trying to get through to the company is a problem, but that is another issue for the board and BAM, one we will return to outside of this meeting.  Who will pay the costs of ancillary works and the clean-up, for example, window cleaning in neighbourhoods adjacent to the St. James's site?<\/p> <p>  With regard to Ceannt Fort and Mount Brown, we are all aware of the case that is ongoing regarding subsidence and major cracking and movement of houses on the right hand side of O'Reilly Avenue heading towards the site.  The core houses at the end of the road have been particularly affected and have required remedial work.  Residents have to be decanted elsewhere to have kitchens and conservatories to the rear of their homes rebuilt.  We told An Bord Plean&aacute;la at the oral hearing and we also told the hospital board and Dublin City Council that the land was unsuitable for building on.  In 1917, when building started in the area, it was known as McCaffrey's orchard.  It became one of the first estates to replace tenements in Dublin.  It was also one of the first estates in which the British provided front gardens for the health of people in Dublin.<\/p><p>The estate was completed and O'Reilly Avenue was added much later because even 100 years ago with less technology and information it was known that the soil was unstable, yet the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board and An Bord Plean&aacute;la maintained in December 2015 that the black soil was perfect.  That is where the early warning systems came in, but the information was ignored.  What is the projected cost of rebuilding part of these houses, the cost of ongoing monitoring and legal services?  Cracks are also appearing in houses on the opposite side of O'Reilly Avenue.  As residents, we alerted the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board to the unstable land way back then.  I would like to get an idea of the costs involved.<\/p><p> Houses at the South Circular Road end of the site are also impacted on and surveys of some of them have been completed, but no surveys have been carried out on the opposite side of O'Reilly Avenue.  At the demand of the residents, they were initially carried out on the right hand side.<\/p><p> The children&rsquo;s research and innovation centre, CRIC, building is not on HSE land.  Has it been bought or is it leased?  What is the cost and is it included in the overall overspend?<\/p><p> Our Lady's Children's Hospital has transferred to Children's Health Ireland.  A figure of &euro;2 million per acre has been suggested.  I do not know how true that is as I am not a valuer.  Discussions on the future of the site are ongoing.  Part of the deed dating from the 1950s required that it be kept for institutional or community use.  However, other parts could be sold.  It is zoned 15.  When will the discussions finish and when will we know the plan for that public land that has been handed over?<\/p><p> How well is the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board working with Dublin City Council because the cost of parking for residents in the surrounding areas has jumped?  There is now 24-hour paid parking in the area and the cost is being borne by residents through no fault of their own.  It reflects the decreased number of parking spaces in St. James's Hospital and also the cost differences.  The problem of parking has been pushed to local streets.<\/p><p> The projected cost of the maternity hospital is &euro;300 million.  I am sure many with an interest in construction and making a buck are looking at this with glee.  If the same happens in the next phase of St. James's Hospital, they must love this overrun in costs.  By how much will the &euro;300 million jump in the meantime?<\/p><p> Are there other hidden costs in the St. James's Hospital or the development of the national children's hospital of which we have not yet been advised?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019012300002#Y00600","speaker":"1388","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548234000,"counter":472,"content":"<p>As a number of broad-ranging questions have been asked, I suggest I deal with the overall capital piece in terms of finality.

Under its founding legislation, Children's Health Ireland is given specific responsibility to engage in fundraising and philanthropy for the new children's hospital project.  We previously had a commitment of &euro;20 million factored into the capital project but it was considered there is significant scope for philanthropy.  It reflects international practice in children's hospitals.<\/p> <p>  There is very significant scope for attracting philanthropic funding.  Children's Health Ireland is proposing to establish a single chargeable foundation called Children's Health Ireland Foundation and it will be tasked with raising the funds.  In that context, the three children's hospitals in Dublin each have a separate independent charity affiliated with them which fundraise for various projects.  There is a lot of experience in that regard and it will be captured in the context of Children's Health Ireland Foundation.  It has some interim steps already because it has been giving significant consideration to this.  The Children's Hospital Group, before it became Children's Health Ireland, had been giving consideration to the potential for philanthropy over many years.  After the establishment of Children's Health Ireland, with the right governance arrangements in place, it can really hit the ground running with regard to philanthropy.  Children's Health Ireland and the three hospital foundations in existence have established a short-term philanthropy steering group consisting of two board members from each of the four organisations and their lead executive.

I am speaking on behalf of my colleagues, Professor Farrell and Dr. Suiter, but also on behalf of a wider group of political scientists who work on elections and referendum research in most of our universities.<br\/><br\/>Ireland has a long and proud democratic tradition.  Citizens have quite high levels of trust in the electoral process, and participation in elections and referendums has been stable, although at a relatively modest level, over recent decades.  Audits of Ireland's electoral processes conducted by the Electoral Integrity Project confirm there are high levels of integrity and trust in the process among citizens but they highlight a number of problematic areas that are sometimes obscured by the overall trust levels.  These include the electoral registration process, party financing and access to the electoral process for women and minorities.<br\/><br\/>Irish democracy is resilient and it emerged more diverse from the economic crisis, but this has not been the experience everywhere.  The rise of radical-right populist parties and violent-protest social movements in a number of states points to high levels of voter dissatisfaction and clear points of weakness in democratic politics.  Democracy is not an inevitable political outcome.  We have seen considerable democratic backsliding around the world in recent decades, which highlights the need to nurture and invest in the democratic process.  <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Elections and referendums are the cornerstone of our democracy.  In recognition of this, we are here today to argue for the creation of a permanent democratic audit process, which would be a study of each referendum and election.  In most democracies funding is provided, usually to the political science community, to carry out elections and referendum research.  This research generates evidence that is usually used to inform public debates, shape policy-making and enhance political campaigns.  It can be used not just by political scientists but also by members of parliament, the policy-making community, political parties, and civil and voluntary organisations.  The evidence is used widely.<br\/><br\/>A funded election study was put in place between 2002 and 2007 and operated through the Irish Research Council but since then political scientists have been unable to secure consolidated funding for election or referendum research.  In 2011 and again in 2016, political scientists scraped together funding to study the elections in those years but the resources were hardly sufficient to produce the type of study required for a proper democratic audit.  Referendum voting has never been studied systematically.  Any research that has been carried out has been <i>ad hoc<\/i>and the objectives are shaped by the priorities of the funding agency or commissioning agency, which is often a newspaper, RT&Eacute; or a Department.  Departments are usually interested when a referendum fails.  We know a great deal about why people do not vote for things but a lot less about why they do vote for them.  This is an unusual position to be in.<br\/><br\/>A national election and referendum study would provide an in-depth understanding of the way representative democracy functions in Ireland.  It would deliver unique insights into Irish public opinion, political participation, attitudes towards politics and explanations of electoral outcomes.  The data from 2002 to 2007, and the partial studies in 2011 and 2016, have been used by Oireachtas committees, broadcasters, political parties and civil and voluntary organisations.  The evidence collected has informed debates and public policy in areas including voter registration, political education, reform of political institutions and populist political communication.  Ireland is an old democracy, celebrating its centenary this week.  It has much to offer in terms of its democratisation and consolidation experience, and it is frequently included in international studies.  Although the election and referendum research conducted in Ireland has often been imperfect due to the lack of funding, the Irish experience of democracy has been central in informing policy debates internationally on political institutions, electoral reform and electoral integrity.<br\/><br\/>The form and scale of election and referendum studies vary around the world but the research is usually conducted in the pre and post-vote stages and involves questionnaires administered by professional polling companies.  Most of the questions included in the surveys are tailored to the political environment in Ireland but there are some questions from cross-national studies, and that facilitates international comparison and the location of Ireland in a wider experience of democracy.  It also enhances the quality and usefulness of the data generated.  The topics covered are diverse but in recent election research in Ireland, questions have been asked on attitudes about the following: political institutions; the role and performance of public representatives; populist political views; and reasons for voting and non-voting, which are important because there is much interest in these.  Those questions were possible in the period 2002 to 2007, when there was better funding.  We have had questions on political reform and political values.<br\/><br\/>Between 2002 and 2007, the funding for the election study came from a combination of the Programme for Research in Third-Level Institutions and the Irish Research Council.  Owing to changes in the funding environment due to the economic crisis, it has not been possible to secure a regular funding source for election and referendum research, and only very limited studies were possible on the elections in 2011 and 2016, using <i>ad hoc <\/i>arrangements.  No funding has ever been provided on a permanent footing for referendum research.  Small amounts of funding have been secured from RT&Eacute;, Google and sometimes the Houses of the Oireachtas to put together the smaller studies but they have been very imperfect.<\/p><p>I highlight in particular the marriage and abortion referendums, in which there has been huge international interest.  Despite this interest, there has been very limited research conducted in Ireland on those referendums.<\/p><p> Since 2007, political scientists have engaged with the Irish Research Council, the Central Statistics Office, politicians and civil servants in an effort to secure permanent stable funding for this type of research.  While there is wide support for the research owing to its extensive use and dissemination, funding efforts have been unsuccessful.  Part of the reason for this is that elections and referendums often happen at short notice, as the members know, and on an irregular schedule.  The research required is time sensitive, which means it must be carried out immediately before and after the electoral event, usually within a number of weeks.  These are the unusual features of the work involved and are among the main stumbling blocks to establishing a permanent funding stream.<\/p><p> As is the case in other democracies, a dedicated and flexible budget line needs to be established.  This could be managed from a Government Department or an electoral commission or channelled through the Irish Research Council.  We are asking the committee to make a recommendation to support funding for election and referendum research in Ireland.  We believe this research is vital to inform public debate, public policy and political campaigns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019012300002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Theresa Reidy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548234000,"counter":642,"content":"<p>We are happy to take questions from members of the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019012300002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Jane Suiter"},{"type":"speech","time":1548234000,"counter":643,"content":"<p>I have a few practical questions which will give the committee some more information.

Will they tell us about the mechanics of setting it up, for example, deciding what would be asked and who would be asked, as well as costing the particular study?  What were the key findings?  Some members are perhaps not as familiar with the details of it, and a little bit more flavour of it could be useful.<\/p> <p>  One can do small pieces of research on an ongoing basis or larger pieces.  Will the witnesses talk the committee through the range of options available if the Government was of a mind to fund such research on an ongoing basis?  Are there examples, from the point of view of political science, of best practice in comparable EU member states?  What is the best option from an evidence based point of view?  <\/p> <p>  As a strong supporter of an independent electoral commission, it would seem to me that an electoral commission is the logical place to locate such a fund.  Do the witnesses have views on that?  Do they believe that the research element in place at the Irish Research Council might make it more appropriate, or are they neutral on it?  <\/p> <p>  A key issue in research is who decides what questions to ask and how the terms of reference are framed.  It is not that we are all suspicious and cynical people here, but that is clearly a big question in terms of the utility of such information to people like us.  Will the witnesses discuss how that process worked between 2002 and 2007?<\/p> <p>  I am a big supporter of any evidence based research that gives people more information about what goes on in our political process, and I believe that the more evidence we have the better.  This committee spends a large amount of time trying to prise information from Departments.  One of the values of publicly funded research such as this is that everybody has access to all of the data, meaning that smaller political parties which cannot afford opinion polling, local community based groups and advocacy groups, and committees like this get access to all of them.  As a committee, it is important that we understand that this is not just some technocratic exercise which allows a group of political scientists to do what it likes to do.  Rather, it produces a resource which, if done right, gives everybody in our democracy access to something that today only large newspapers, Government Departments, the European Commission and larger political parties can afford.  That in itself give the proposition that we consider these recommendations real merit.  We will discuss that in private session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019012300002#C00300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548234000,"counter":644,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked many questions, and I hope I will be forgiven if I do not get through them all.  For the 2016 study, the most recent study, we cobbled together what moneys we could find.  We accessed whatever remaining research funds we had in our pots, collaborated with RT&Eacute;, got a small bit of funding from the Oireachtas - I cannot remember which Department it came from - and ended up with somewhere between &euro;50,000 and &euro;60,000.  This was highly inadequate.  To provide a sense of that, part of this was the RT&Eacute; exit poll, where the sample was split in three ways, meaning that we had samples of 1,000 each.  However, the questionnaires were not able to speak across the piece.  We have some questions in one part of the sample that do not allow us to look at the relationship with questions in other part of the sample.  In addition, we commissioned Red C to carry out two telephone polls.  Each of the samples in those telephone polls do not speak to the RT&Eacute; samples, nor to each other.  I apologise for being too technical, but we effectively ended up with five separate samples that do not speak to each other.  We were able to generate a volume from that.  We published a book a few months ago in conjunction with Manchester University Press, covering a number of interesting themes, including whether we are seeing the emergence of populism in Ireland.  We are not, but there are perhaps hints that something like that is on the way.  We would love to have had better data in order to look at that properly.  We would have liked to look at non-voters as well.  However, the nature of the data we had available meant that we could only really focus on people who are engaged in politics.  One of the most important aspects of an election study is that one wants to tap those who are not interested in politics and understand what drives those people and where they are going in terms of their behaviour and attitudes.  That is the big constraint we experienced during our recent research.  My colleagues might add to that if I have left anything out.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the question of the electoral commission versus the Irish Research Council, we have had several meetings with the latter at this stage.  The strongest point to emerge from those meetings is that because the electoral commission's budget is annualised, it can simply not cater for an election study.  It cannot predict how many elections will occur, when a general election will occur or where the cost of an election will fall.  It sent us to other places for that reason.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Broin that the electoral commission could well be the best vehicle in which to locate something like this.<\/p> <p>  For an election study to be run in the way we believe it should be run, it should be as open, transparent and widespread across the research community as possible.  We tried to do that in the 2011 and 2016 studies.  We had a large committee of political scientists, both new and established, including PhD students, post-doctoral workers and full-time members of staff, where people could come up with ideas for questions.  There was an attempt to ensure that this was spread as widely as possible.  The data are shared across the research community, and as the Deputy pointed out, they were shared more widely.  These data are widely available for people to access.  Perhaps my colleagues can add more to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019012300002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Professor David Farrell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548234000,"counter":645,"content":"<p>In terms of how the questions are decided, there are three main components to the study.  We often think about the values that people have, including their fundamental views about the nature of democracy and the political system.  There are many questions asked in that area.  We also ask about attitudes with more surface level questions, including policy issues of the day, and also international questions relating to global trends.  We also ask questions focused on the behaviour of people, including items like how one engages with politics, how interested one is and how one follows it.  The analysis afterwards combines these different components to come up with deeper ways of understanding patterns of behaviour and the trends over time in the political system.  In terms of how that is communicated, in the year after the election we have a little roadshow.  I have been to Sinn F&eacute;in, Green Party and Social Democrats events, and events for Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il.  We engage fairly widely with the research communities as well as making the data publicly available to anybody who wants to use them.  At the moment, we are also engaged in a separate process which is trying to put all of the partial studies we have conducted in the past in one place so that they will be more accessible to parties and interested civil and voluntary groups which want to use them.  That is one of the things we are doing to increase access at the moment.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin asked about the best option.  The funding is fairly modest.  We are talking about a couple of hundred thousand euro.  The amount would go up or down depending on whether there was an election in a given year, or a referendum, or whether two or three referendums were being carried out together.  That is really what would determine the amount of funding required.<\/p><p>As long as it is designed in a non-partisan way with serious academic credentials, we are agnostic about the mechanism for funding.

The gold standard of these is a panel study, which is what we had from 2002 to 2007.  We would start off with several thousand people and follow some of those same people over the five years.  By doing so, we get to see how people are changing at an individual level.  If a panel study was to be done, in year one an election study might cost between &euro;250,000 and &euro;300,000 and then one would have an annual cost of about &euro;100,000.  A referendum study might cost between &euro;120,000 and &euro;150,000 to do really well.  There are a number of moving parts but those are the ballpark figures.<\/p> <p>  To reiterate what Mr. Farrell and Dr. Reidy said, for much of the time we have had to piggyback on RT&Eacute; exit polls.  Naturally, an exit poll gets canvassers from Red C to stand outside various polling stations.  By definition, the canvassers can only capture people who have just walked out of a polling station.  This means the views of all those who did not make it to the polling station are never asked and we do not know anything about them.  Not only do we not know why they did not turn up, but we do not know anything else about them.  These are the people who are most dissatisfied with democracy and it is very important that we understand more about them.  That is why it is really important to have an election study, rather than just piggybacking on exit polls.  That is a crucial point.<\/p> <p>  We are agnostic about where the money comes from.  An electoral commission might be the right place but an electoral commission is an Irish perennial.  I know the Oireachtas is discussing legislation on an electoral commission but when will it come into being?  I am reluctant to say this should definitely be put through an electoral commission because who knows when that will happen.  Maybe that is where it should be based in the long term but in the short term, for the next general election, the Department should fund this in advance of an electoral commission being set up.  It would be great if this was done through the Irish Research Council but that would be hard to do because we simply do not know when elections and referendums will be held, as members are well aware.  The Department should have a funding line for this research until the electoral commission is established.<\/p> <p>  On the questions asked, there is considerable best practice available.  One wants to make sure questions are asked in a way that do not try to lead people to give certain answers.  Members know that if a big brand was asking a question, the survey answers always come out in a way that favours the brand.  We have to be highly scientific and particular about that and follow the way questions are asked internationally and the way we have asked them previously in order that we can make comparisons.  There is absolutely no reason there should not be wider consultation about the kinds of questions asked.  If the committee wanted to be involved in terms of the kind of issues on which questions would be asked, there would be no reason we would not engage in that kind of way.  The actual wording of the question would obviously have to come down to scientific best practice and so on.  However, there is no reason input into the questions should not be wider than it has been in the past.<\/p> <p>  What is important is that this is about our democracy and everybody and outside of this room has a stake in that.  We all want to understand where the people are and why Ireland has been so successful.  Why are we one of the few countries without a radical right-wing populist party when we see this happening elsewhere?  We do not completely understand why that is the case but we need to understand the reasons for it if we are to ensure it does not happen.  Everybody has a stake in that and having a broader study is very important in helping us to understand the state of our politics and what people are doing.  In the meantime, the Department has to own the budget.  If that were the case, it might even be in place before the next election, whenever that is, but it should be in place before that.  I am sure an electoral commission will not be in place before the next election.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019012300002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Jane Suiter"},{"type":"speech","time":1548234000,"counter":649,"content":"<p>I am a supporter of a properly funded, democratic audit process, which is not <i>ad hoc<\/i>but is in place on a permanent basis.  This is a democratic issue because if there is no public process, the only process is private and there are private processes.  We are then left with corporate media and big political parties being the only forces in society which gather, analyse and process the data.  From the point of view of a genuine democratic approach, there has to be public funding for this process.  In fact, it is anti-democratic if it is not in place.<\/p><p>I am interested in finding out which countries have the best practice internationally and which countries lag behind.  One of the reasons I ask is that this issue is a bit of a litmus test.  I suspect that the societies that do not fund this research also lag behind on other democratic litmus tests and that the countries that fare better on this front are those in which governments have put in place, or have been forced to put in place, more democratic rights and measures.  It is a poor reflection on the Irish State and the approach of successive Governments that people who are clearly extremely well qualified and professional and who can hold their heads high in an international forum are forced to go around with begging bowls and are scrambling to get snippets of information from different groups to enable them to put forward an overview analysis of elections and referendums in this country.  It is poor and amateurish and reflects badly on the State and successive Governments that professionals and people who have these skills and abilities are forced to scramble around like that.  I ask the witnesses to give us a flavour of it is like to have to scramble around for those bits of information in order to put forward such an overview. <\/p><p>It struck me as interesting that whereas funding was in place between 2002 and 2007 when the economy was booming, it was not provided during the austerity period.

As people who go knocking at doors, we have experience of this.  Where there is an issue that people feel really strongly about - which we saw in the abortion referendum - people who traditionally do not vote, including the young, see a reason for it then.  For a variety of reasons, but in large measure, the big parties are seen as the same menu being offered.  A lot of people are switching off and it is really important to get feedback and information that goes beyond the anecdotal to give an insight into what people are saying and thinking, and not just the people who are coming out to vote.  That is a really important point.

Ireland is pretty unusual in Europe in not having a permanent study.  Nearly all of the new and old member states of the European Union do this.  There are different models and ways of doing it.  Finland is a very good example where the funding is managed by the Ministry of Justice because it is responsible for handling the electoral process.  A tender is put out and a consortium of political scientists - usually based on all of the universities in Finland - tender for it.  That is how it is funded.<\/p> <p>  This comes to the point made by Senator Grace O'Sullivan about the independence and integrity of the study and to manage it in that open and transparent way, perhaps through something like an electoral commission.  The Irish Research Council has partnered with Departments and the Constitutional Convention in various ways and carries out that process.  The funding has come from Departments but the actual management of the process and the recruitment of the researchers has been carried out by the Irish Research Council.  Effectively that is what the council does all the time.  It has all the processes and procedures in place to ensure the integrity of the process and it has lots of international peer reviews and evaluation.  That would be one way of guaranteeing the independence and integrity of the study.<\/p> <p>  Austria is another good example of how to manage the process.  It has a very well run and well-funded study.  Switzerland might also be interesting from Ireland's perspective because - strangely enough - the referendum study has a higher priority than the election study and a lot more money is allocated to the referendum study.  Switzerland has a very interesting procedure for doing that.  We could also give examples and highlight some data from there.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made in the questions to how the study changes in involving people.  I shall give some concrete examples that may be useful for the committee about what kinds of questions we ask and why we ask them.  In 2011, for example, we asked lots of questions about political institutions and people's views on the D&aacute;il, the Seanad, political parties and public representatives.  We asked lots of questions about how and why people engaged with their public representatives and on what kinds of topics.  This is the information we imagine would be of interest to all political parties and also to people from no political background.<\/p> <p>  Another element that is worth mentioning is social media.  We started to ask many more questions about that in 2011 and again in 2016.  We asked about what kinds of information people get from social media, whether or not they trust social media and how they use it during political campaigns and whether it is different to when it is outside the political process.  In tandem, there is a public consultation process taking place separately that is looking at the role of the online digital media and how it interacts with our democratic processes.  This is part of a global debate that is happening.  It was discussed on Facebook by Sheryl Sandberg yesterday.  We have some data on there but they are quite limited.  One would imagine that this is part of the election study that will grow and become more significant in understanding how digital media interacts with our democratic process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019012300002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Theresa Reidy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548234000,"counter":655,"content":"<p>There are countries that do not have it.  Greece is one such prominent example.  Our political science colleagues in Greece found it so frustrating that they were unable to track what the hell was going on, whereas we had some funding and were able to get some sense of how voting was panning out in 2011 and 2016.  That is a prominent example of bad practice.<\/p> <p>  When we cobbled together funding, and we begged, borrowed and stole from everyone we could for the studies in 2011 and 2016, there would eventually be particular conversations with agencies, which I will not name.  They would tell us that they would give us funding for the study but that they required us to ask a bunch of questions so that if they were asked questions by public representatives or others about how their budget was being spent on such a thing, they would have to show that the questions that mattered to that agency were being asked.  Unfortunately, that means that we must ask questions that are of no use to us whatever.  There are questions from the 2011 and 2016 surveys that we do not make any use of but we were obliged to ask in order to get a few other questions in there.  <\/p> <p>  It is crucial go after non-voters in the studies.  Sampling is so important and is the practice in countries with a well-funded election study.  In newspaper opinion polls, their polling agency will use an existing panel of respondents to track voting behaviour.  By definition, their panel of respondents are people who are interested in politics who are more likely to vote.  A properly funded election study specifically seeks the people who are very hard to find in a normal private opinion polls because one really wants to track those who are uninterested in politics.  We have been unable to do that since 2007.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Reidy has commented on how to ensure that this is done properly and in a truly independent way.  As social scientists or scientists, and as academics, we are required to follow ethical procedures.  We must get ethical clearance for any research we do in advance which would specifically include survey works.  We must abide by certain ethical standards and we must declare any conflicting interests that we may have.  To secure funding, we will have had to secure the judgment of our peers to ensure that they are satisfied that this meets the best international standards.  Ultimately, as academics we want to publish our research and that goes through a peer review process.  If we write something substandard or which does not meet good scientific rigour, it will not get published and we must abide by those standards.  <\/p> <p>  The Austrian election study has been particularly useful on the matter of votes at 16 years.  When Austria moved to votes at 16 years, the election study which followed was able to focus on that and how it impacted on voting behaviour.  I am a very strong supporter of votes at 16 years.  There is good political science research that demonstrates that that is a better age to trap or secure voters.  People are more likely to engage in voting practice in future elections if they start doing so early in their lives rather than at a later stage, such as 18 years.  It is a very important development which Austria has taken.  Other places are considering it and we should too.<\/p> <p>  Senator Boyhan asked us to say a little more on women and minorities.  There are a few dimensions there.  One matter, which may refer more to an electoral commission than the topic of today's meeting, is that a well-run electoral administration would do whatever it could to make it easier for people to vote.  That would include experiments, something we see in other countries, such as being able to vote in advance of polling day, providing information in different languages - something that is done here but of which more could be done - making it easier for people with disabilities to vote, trying online voting - which is not very popular here - as well as trying other methods of voting that do not require turning up at the polling station.  There are ways which could be explored to make the method of voting easier.   That is one example of how to better engage certain communities that are not so actively engaged in politics.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019012300002#F00100","nonspeaker":"Professor David Farrell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548234000,"counter":656,"content":"<p>In addition to noting which counties have such a study, it is important to look at how they use it.  Certain countries might have it but no one in the political system looks at it.  If we do it, and it comes through this committee, it is more of a public thing.  What is important is that politicians, parties and interest groups look at it and recognise that it is a valuable resource to them.  In some countries, the study is undertaken by academics via a research council and published in academic-type publications, where it might not inform internal debate as much as it might.  I would like to see the members here use it and bring us in to talk about it more.<br\/><br\/>I concur with the comments about running around trying to secure <i>ad hoc <\/i>funding.  We are researchers not salesmen but we must go around as though we are trying to make sales.<br\/><br\/>As Professor Farrell and Dr. Reidy noted, the crucial thing is its independence.  The way one does that is through peer review and multi-institutional co-operation.  Three different institutions are represented here, for instance, namely, UCD, UCC and DCU.<br\/><br\/>I agree with Professor Farrell about the voting age.  Dr. Reidy has done some research on this and can discuss it further, but crucially 16 year olds are at home with their parents and when their families go out to vote, they will too.  By the time they are 18 years, they may no longer live at home.  Starting voting at 16 years gets them into the habit earlier than at 18 years.<br\/><br\/>On women, minorities and young people, part of it is making it easier to vote but much of it is the numbers on the register.  Our register is such a mess and we must make it much easier to register.  It is not easy to add one's name to the register.  The student unions put in Trojan work on voter registration prior to the marriage equality and eighth amendment referendums.  When one is a student, there is a matter of where one is registered to vote, but it is also tricky to get on the register, which closes quite a bit in advance of the election.  I do not know why that is the case, as in other countries, it is possible for a person to add his or her name to the register up to the day before an election.  That is one issue around access that should be considered, although this might be a matter for an electoral commission rather than this forum.<br\/><br\/>Dr. Reidy has done a lot of work on younger voters and may care to speak on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019012300002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Jane Suiter"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548234000,"counter":657,"content":"<p>On the practical matter of voter registration, Ireland is quite unusual in having voluntary voter registration.  Most other European countries have automatic registration where people are added to the electoral register based on their social security number.  That means that we have particularly acute issues around younger voters.  They are not eligible to go on the register until they are 18 years old, at a point where many people lose formal interaction with the State and many more move out of home.  Therefore it is very difficult to get young people registered in a systematic way.  While universities and other third level colleges do considerable work on this, there remains a whole cohort of people who are not registered, often including some of the most socially disadvantaged people so a cycle of disadvantage is built in.  One thing that a change to the voting age would achieve is that it would get people while still in school.  A person may or may not get to vote at 16 or 17 years, depending on the electoral cycle, but one thing we could do would be to build a system of registration where one goes on the electoral register at the age of 16.  It would not take a referendum but could be introduced for local elections and European Parliament elections immediately, as there are no constitutional impediments or barriers.  Those are practical methods, and were there an electoral commission, more systematic and sustained efforts at voter education would be possible.  They could be targeted at a wider group of people.<\/p><p>The evidence internationally is that such changes do have an effect, albeit over a long period of time.  We would not expect an immediate transformation.  Evidence from Austria and Finland has shown that such registration has, over time, been helpful in engaging with younger voters.  To answer the Senator's more precise question about why young voters do not participate at the same level, the reasons are complex but there are a couple of important points.  One relates to how interested young people are in politics, which intersects with how much they think politics matters to them and how they see it affecting their lives.  Another issue is their level of knowledge about politics.  Again that is connected to political education in schools.  To make concrete policy in these areas, evidence is needed and that evidence must be built over longer periods.  The general international experience is that the more younger people are informed about politics and the more they feel politics matters to their lives, the greater the chances of them turning out to vote are.  That is very connected to political education in schools and to access to the polls.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019012300002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Theresa Reidy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548234000,"counter":659,"content":"<p>Professor Farrell spoke about the elections of 2011 and 2016.

We looked at whether people were voting on European issues or on national issues and at questions of that kind.

Official hustings are run in all secondary schools during the period before the elections and the students all vote on the same day.  It is covered by the media.  Two weeks in advance of the election people get to hear how the secondary school students have voted.  It actually impacts on the debate.  They can be seen coming in.  They are run officially.  The national candidates might not go into all the schools, although sometimes they will go to some of the bigger schools, but the candidates for the local elections or the European elections will go into schools and speak at these hustings and debates in the schools.  It is a really powerful way to bring home the kind of debates that are going on.  Something like that could be considered as part of an electoral commission as a way to bring home the importance of political engagement to younger people.<\/p> <p>  My last point is that we know very well when people turn 16 because we cut them off from child benefit unless they are still in education.

Dr. Suiter clarified that the local elections in 2004 were covered as a result of that funding.  Are the witnesses looking at a similar level of funding or do they need more to achieve what they want to achieve?  Can that question be answered?  What has their interaction with the Department been so far?  How is that interaction going?  We had the Department in here before but we would like to get the witnesses' own view in respect of that interaction.<\/p> <p>  A lot of the issues from my own point of view have already been raised.  The register is a problem.  Voter turnout is becoming a problem.  There is a difference between a general election and a referendum.  Referendums seem to get the young people engaged because they involve social issues to which they can relate.  We seem to lose them for general elections.  It is critical that we do more surveys in respect of the local elections and try to get a better understanding of that area.  Young people can see direct effects in their communities through the work that local councillors do on the ground in respect of community stuff.  I have been informed that there is a budget line in the Department of the Taoiseach in respect of referendums.  Perhaps we, as a committee, could make a proposal that some funding from that budget line be set aside to carry out some research as a starting point.

There was a panel in the first year, which was kind of door to door, which is the best practice because that is where we will get the people who do not vote.  People will answer their door, whereas if they are rung up and asked to do a survey on elections, those who are very disengaged from the political process will say \"No\".  It is easier to do it door to door.  A sample of those would have been kept, with people then surveyed by post afterwards, and fresh samples were then put in to make sure the numbers were kept up.  That covered the local and European elections in that cycle.<\/p> <p>  I agree it is very important to cover the local and European elections because that is fundamental.  There are many people living in this country now who are not eligible to vote in national elections, although they might be in time, but who are eligible to vote in the local elections, which have a different range of candidates and different issues.  That is very important.  We know when local and European elections are because they are fixed in time, so it is fairly straightforward.

However, the CSO has very fixed times, so one could easily have a referendum or a national election and the CSO would not ask anyone any questions until three months later, when everybody has forgotten why they voted in a particular way or why they did not vote.  Normally, when people are asked if they voted, 85% say \"Yes\", when we know 85% of people did not turn out.  The ESRI did the questions in 2002 and it had access to the marked registers, so it was able to tell who did and did not vote, although it was completely anonymised before anybody like me saw it.  This meant we knew who did and who did not, and we were able to look at different things rather than just relying on self-reporting.

We thank the committee for the opportunity to brief members on the current electoral reform initiatives that are underway in the Department.  I will outline the key elements of our reform agenda priorities.<\/p> <p>  In December, two public consultation processes were launched and both will run until mid-March.  One related to the proposed establishment of an electoral commission and the other is seeking views on the modernisation of the electoral register.  I will address the establishment of an electoral commission and its context.  The Government made a commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government to establish a commission.  A number of reports on electoral commissions have been published over the years.  The most recent report, which is largely informing current deliberations on the establishment of a commission in Ireland, was published by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht in January 2016.  That report contains a series of recommendations regarding the establishment of an electoral commission, including functions that should be assigned to it.  While there is significant public trust in our electoral system, it is expected that the establishment of an independent electoral commission will build on that trust and help bring better cohesion and co-ordination to the electoral system, improving the administration of elections.<\/p> <p>  Electoral commissions carry out vital functions around the world and while their role may vary from country to country, generally they are independent bodies that oversee and support the running of free and fair elections; set performance standards; regulate and monitor political funding and election expenditure; manage the registration of political parties; conduct research into electoral matters and develop and implement voter participation and engagement programmes.  These are the types of functions being considered for Ireland's electoral commission.  In December, the Department published a regulatory impact analysis, RIA, on the establishment of an electoral commission.  The establishment of such a body will constitute a significant reform to the current regime which has been in place since the foundation of the State, and it is, therefore, right and proper that we dedicate sufficient time to allow interested parties to inform our deliberations and to have input to that reform project.  The RIA puts forward a number of options for consideration about how an electoral commission might be established including the functions that could be assigned to it.  All inputs received as part of the public consultation will be analysed and the content will be used to inform a preferred option for establishing an electoral commission, which will be brought to Government for consideration.  The closing date for receipt of submissions is Friday, 15 March 2019.<\/p> <p>  Significant work was done by the Department in 2018 on a project to modernise the electoral register, and, in December, the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, launched a public consultation which is seeking views on a set of proposals.  The proposals include the introduction of a simplified registration process; a reduction in the number of application forms; online registration as an optional alternative to paper-based registration; and the move from household-based registration to individual registration.  Verification of identity through the use of personal public service numbers, PPSNs, is also proposed.  The proposals arise from a commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government to examine the voter registration process.<\/p> <p>  The current system has served us well and will continue to do so.  The proposals on which we are asking people's views in the public consultation are aimed at enabling people to register in simpler yet secure ways.  As well as removing an excessive number of steps involved in applying to be included on the register, the proposals would further increase the register's ability to keep up to date with changing individual circumstances and, therefore, enhance its integrity.  Reducing the number of different registration forms, allowing people to register online, and introducing a process of continuous or rolling registration would make the registration process much more user-friendly and similar to the way people interact with other State services.  Having a registration process that recognises and facilitates more frequent changes of address is crucial to maintaining an accurate register as efficiently as possible.<\/p> <p>  The proposals for the establishment of an electoral commission and the modernisation of the electoral register represent two significant electoral reform initiatives.  The public consultations that are under way in respect of both initiatives will run until 15 March.  The outcome of the consultation processes will inform the development of detailed proposals for implementation and the Department is encouraging everyone to consider these proposals and have their say.  My colleagues and I will be happy to further discuss the electoral reform initiatives if members have questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019012300002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Quinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1548234000,"counter":678,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Quinn for the presentation.

If it requires a full legislative code to be in place before it is established, time would be needed to get through the legislative process.  It depends on the mix of options selected.

Have the witnesses ever considered providing for automatic registration at 18 years of age, in respect of which the individual would have the option to opt-out?  The current system is inefficient.  We need to energise and exercise as many people as possible to vote in a democracy.  We need a mechanism to bring people to the table.  I hope that between now and 15 March 2019, the Department will do everything possible to encourage people to register because the local and European elections are coming up.  With the rise of digital media, the Department has not only its website but Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and so on to encourage people to register.  The current system, in terms of application, is inefficient and unattractive to young people.  I say that as a mother of a 19, 21 and 27 year old, who without parental push and shove might not have bothered to register.  The Department must do everything it can to encourage individuals to register and to inform them on why they should do so.  It should also try to reach those who may feel disenfranchised.  Not everyone has sufficient information to want to register.  The Department must use all mechanisms available to it to encourage people to register such that we can have a strong democracy.<\/p> <p>  In our earlier session I mentioned Seanad reform and the implementation group's report.  Has the Department considered the group's proposed changes to the electoral system?  For example, in terms of the proposed new electoral commission, could this work be incorporated into the work of the new commission or should it be separate?  The cost of a commission was also mentioned.  The witnesses in our earlier session referenced a budget for research conducted between 2002 and 2007.  Could funding be made available to support evidence-based research to help in the years ahead in order that people would have access to independent information to help them in their deliberations in terms of upcoming elections? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019012300002#K01100","speaker":"1385"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548234000,"counter":694,"content":"<p>I will address some of the Senator's questions and then ask my colleagues to respond to the others.  On the challenge of engaging young people in particular, it is one of the issues we have called out in terms of the consultation on the electoral register reform.  We should look at the option of provisionally registering 16 and 17 year olds, perhaps through a schools programme, with individuals then having the option to opt-out when they reach 18 years of age.  This proposal definitely merits consideration as part of work on the electoral register.<\/p> <p>  On the Senator's question about research, again, the consultation on the electoral register sets out that that is one of the functions that should be considered in regard to the establishment of an electoral commission.  As I am sure she will be aware, elsewhere in the world there are independent bodies similar to an electoral commission that carry out or oversee the carrying out of research in regard to electoral matters.  From our perspective, it is something we will be considering as part of the functions of an electoral commission, which we consider might not need a legislative basis if a commission was to be established on an administrative basis initially.  This is an area that we will examine.  In the normal course of events in regard to research, we would welcome all proposals in that respect.  We have to be mindful of public finance procedures, procurement, etc. but research is an important function of an electoral commission<\/p> <p>  I will hand over to my colleague, Mr. Ryan, to respond to the Senator's question on Seanad reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019012300002#K01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Quinn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548234000,"counter":695,"content":"<p>The Senator asked what percentage of people are eligible to vote.  There is no definitive percentage of people who should be registered.  The register is what it is.  Sometimes comparisons are made between the register and census figures.  This always comes with a health warning in that they are two different processes.  The census takes place every five years whereas the register is compiled on an annual basis.  The census is also a snapshot of a particular night in question.  That said, local authorities, in compiling the register, could refer to the census figures at electoral division level.<\/p><p>Figures could be compared to see if there are any large discrepancies or, indeed, a question of over-registration in a particular electoral division that needs to be addressed.  While there is not a specific percentage, the best comparison is with the census but that does come with a health warning.

We received it last week, along with the draft Bill that accompanies the report, and we will consider it.  <\/p><p> Turning to attempts to encourage people to vote, Ms Quinn touched on young people as did Senator Grace O'Sullivan.  I have a 19 year old at home and some of us have experience of giving young people encouragement to go on the register.  We run an information campaign every autumn, in November, when the draft register is being compiled.  We encourage people to check the draft register and make sure they are included.  Information leaflets are another useful aspect, particularly as we approach local elections.  They are distributed to local authorities and published on our website.  One of those leaflets focuses on the process of registration.  We publish the leaflets in 17 different languages.  <\/p><p> Alongside that, we have been working with the Immigrant Council of Ireland which has recently published a series of videos, in a number of different languages, encouraging people to register to vote as we get closer to the local elections.

There is always a deadline a few months, perhaps two or three months, before general and local elections when a person has to go the Garda station with identification to get the form signed.  That is one of the main deterrents and it puts young people off going on the register.  I refer to having to go into the local Garda station and finding the time to do that.

When the document states much work has been done, that refers to the preparatory scoping work.  There is a significant technical input for a project of this type, so we have been looking at all of the potential methods we can try to address these issues.  To address the Senator's point on PPSNs, that is a good example and certainly one of the options we have been looking at.<br\/><br\/>We have much consultation with local authorities and the experts in those authorities who run the franchise sections.  On the data aspect, there are data protection issues regarding the PPSN.  We are clarifying all of those things and that is the preparatory work we have been doing.  It has led us to a series of proposals, which can be seen in the document, on what we should examine.  Regarding young people and how to better engage them in registering, one of the things we are proposing is that we would look at optional online registration for that cohort and generation.  That is probably a method those of that age would prefer rather than paper-based methods.  We will need a balance because some people will still prefer the paper-based approach and we will have to cater for them.<br\/><br\/>If we want to look at optional online registration, as we propose as one of the suite of options, from our perspective we need to balance the security concerns and requirements that arise from that.

During the talks for the programme for Government, we in the Rural Independent Group lobbied for this and we are glad that there is movement.  The present situation is archaic.  I know of old people who have voted in every election, and who value their vote, being knocked off the register and not realising it until they arrive at the polling station.  That is inherently unfair and unjust.  I have seen tears and trauma at every election I have been involved in since 1979.  That is very unfair.  In some cases a whole household or a whole street of houses have been knocked off.  In a situation like that, where people have always been on the register and always voted, there should be some mechanism for a quick-fix when it is discovered that they have been removed.<\/p> <p>  In many rural communities, the people presenting are well known to the presiding officer.  It is very unfair that a situation like that should arise and surely the system should be able to adjust for that.  There has to be use of the PPSN so that people can go online and register immediately.  I refer to the current system of dates, closing dates, the supplementary register and advertisements for all of that.  It is chaotic and people easily miss those dates.  We know why the present situation involving the Garda station was instituted.  It is unfortunate as well but it did happen.  <\/p> <p>  Turning to the issue of fraud, and some issues that were not fraud, there was much duplicated and triplicated voting in the past two referendums.  A man contacted me who received five polling cards.  He did not believe that was fraud; it was just inertia.  He had registered in every place he had moved to work and it happened that he ended up with five voting cards for different parts of the country.  Some of them were not too far apart, perhaps within a 50-mile radius.  That must be rectified.  I salute the staff that worked in South Tipperary County Council especially.  They have been courteous and helpful over the years.  In recent years, since the amalgamation of the councils, there has not been the same number of staff.  <\/p> <p>  I was astounded this year.  Invariably on polling day, someone would turn up at a polling station and he or she would not get a voting paper.  He or she would then ring a politician that he or she knew.  This year no staff were on duty in Tipperary and people were referred to Waterford County Council on the day of the vote.  I accept they are busy before the vote.  I could not believe on the day of vote, however, that people were on leave or whatever.  They are, of course, entitled to leave but it should have been organised differently to ensure there was somebody available to answer calls from whomever made them, be that the citizens themselves or a politician's office.  <\/p> <p>  People who had been at the polling booth and had not got a ballot paper walked into my office in Clonmel.  Those people were greatly exercised.  They had made the effort to go to vote, had a vote and expected to have a vote.  It was inherently unfair and hurtful to them that they did not get a ballot paper when they had made that effort.  A serious and deep analysis needs to be done as to why there was such inertia and such a volume of mistakes.  In every election one street or another somewhere is knocked off.  A whole convent of sisters was knocked off the last time.  They cherish their votes.  I am not aiming that comment at anyone; I am just saying they were knocked off.  <\/p> <p>  I had an 88 year old man at one stage who had voted in every election since 1918.  He went to vote and could not.  He was devastated and could not be consoled.  There must be some mechanism in this modern day and age to deal with that.  We will have to look at best practices in other countries such as America where people can register up to 24 hours before the vote.  It is the nature of the beast that we want people to be involved in politics, we want people to vote and exercise their franchise but the system must be made voter-friendly and accessible.<\/p><p>With all the creative ideas of the various politicians, political parties and machines, it may be down to the last minute before people get focused on issues.  This needs a major overhaul and there must be a consciousness of people who are outrageously offended by the system.  They had votes but were unceremoniously knocked off the register.  There was no sympathy, empathy or engagement.  It was just tough.  We then have the massive fraud in the past two referenda about which there were boasts and lies.  People voted in different places.  A French student contacted me who got a voting card but who should not have.  She got one at her digs in Galway.  That is blatant abuse but not a word was said about it.  It was grand.  It is disgraceful criminal activity and it should not be tolerated.  It needs to be very tight and very reflective of people's views and feelings.  They must be able, if they are knocked off inadvertently, to have a process to facilitate them.  They are not trying to deceive anyone.  They have their identity and are known to the people involved, yet they are suddenly off the register.  There are lots of questions to answer and there is a great deal of deep research to be done.  I hope there will be a good engagement with the consultation, but getting that out there is the problem.  It is about being heard effectively.  Like all consultation, it is not easy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019012300002#L01700","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548234000,"counter":709,"content":"<p>Listening to the stories alleging massive fraud in the latest referendum, I wonder if Deputy McGrath will be like those Japanese soldiers who were still coming out of the jungle 30 years after the war as he continues to try to fight the referendum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019012300002#M00200","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1548234000,"counter":710,"content":"<p>I did not address the Deputy and I am not interested in listening to him either.

It is the one on which we had the group in to discuss earlier.  The group was making the case for what was described as a permanent democratic audit process.  I support strongly what was argued for.  The example was given of European countries such as Finland, Austria and Switzerland, which provide permanent funding for research and surveying of election results, referendum results, social attitudes among those who do not vote and so on.  I am convinced that this would be beneficial for Irish society.  If funding is not provided for that, it will be done by private organisations like corporate media and large political parties and will not be available to the mass of the people.  There is a democratic issue there.  From the information provided earlier, it appears this can be done for relatively low sums.  It is something we should prioritise to get in line with best international practice.  It is something in respect of which we should make funding provision on an annualised basis.  There are some details to work out as to exactly how to do it but the principle is something I support strongly and it is a point I want to register in this discussion.  There are other points I would like to make about the register, but I will leave it at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019012300002#M00800","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1548234000,"counter":716,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses.  I have read their submission and it made for interesting reading.  I do not want to dwell too much on the past but do I want to look too much into the future either.  From the deliberations with both panels today, it is clear that something is going to happen.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to establish some sort of electoral reform.  There is a genuine commitment to examine it, albeit how it happens is another day's work.  I want to bring us to the present.  I saw a statutory notice in a local paper which related to my own local authority in respect of an application to the registrar to strike off a number of people.  It so happened that on the same day I received from an elderly woman of 80 years a note to say she had received a letter to say she was no longer registered at her address or able to live there.  She had lived there for 48 years and her son and his wife had come to live with her, put an extension onto the house and joined the register.  As a result, the local authority presumed the older or other person had died.  It was a presumption but there was no basis for it.  I was told initially that she would have to make an application because there had a been a statutory process of notice in all the papers.  I saw it in Carlow and in a number of provincial papers where it was advertised.  This exercise happened only in the past few weeks.  After making a bit of a fuss, the local authority reluctantly &ndash; it was an effort &ndash; agreed to put her back on.  However, it said that technically she should be giving evidence that she was in her home.  It is a mess and the electoral register is in a mess.  Subsequently, I made inquiries with a number of local authorities which told me they had no obligation in law or on any other basis to do outreach anymore.<\/p> <p>  We used to have officials who called to doors or take samples to make checks but none of that is happening in local authorities which say they have no funding.  Nevertheless, a number of budgets I looked at provide such funding.  The line on funding needs to be clarified.  Is there money from central government for local authorities or do the latter set aside money for it?  We have a situation in which it is not a priority for most of the 31 local authorities and that is an issue I ask the witnesses to address immediately.  Perhaps when they go back to the office today, they might raise the matter with the head of the franchise section within the Department.  A circular should be issued to all 31 local authority chief executives stating clearly that they are obliged to get out there and engage.  If it is a resource issue, let us address that.  Let us hear why, however, local authorities are not engaging and doing field work door-to-door, which is important, or some other form of work.  We will have a local election in a few months so this work is important.  I ask for a commitment from the officials to engage with the chief executives of the 31 local authorities in the coming week to provide them with additional funding or to ensure they prioritise within their budgets the cleaning up of registers of electors.  They are totally out of date.  People who are dead remain on the register ten years later.  Other people are duplicated on the same register within the same local electoral ward.  It is incumbent on us to ensure the register is as clean as possible, in particular as we go into two elections in May.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019012300002#M00900","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1548234000,"counter":717,"content":"<p>To pick up on Deputy Barry's question, the witnesses caught the tail end of the political scientists' presentation and they know them all well.  My question is not about the consultations and whether we get an electoral commission; it is about the meantime as we wait for those.  Is the Department, and this section in particular, considering whether to fund some form of electoral research this year and next year while the larger issue of a commission and tasking it with ongoing research is decided?  We may have a general election and a number of referenda this year or next year.  We have local and European elections this year.

I will let Mr. Ryan deal with some of the issues.  On the register, we accept certainly that it could be improved.  That is why we are promoting this significant project and dedicating resources to it.  On people coming on and off the register, Mr. Ryan will be able to talk to the committee as he engages on an ongoing basis with local authorities.  It is a local authority function to manage the register.  Local authorities take whatever they feel are the necessary steps to do so.  That includes going door-to-door where necessary.  I cannot confirm that it happens all over the country, but it certainly happens.  From my own experience, they have certainly called to my door in the past few months.  From all of our perspectives, there is an onus on individuals to ensure their information on the register is up to date.  We do not have any significant indications that there are problems with fraud.  The electoral register and the process are well respected and generally held in high regard in Ireland.  If someone behaves in a fraudulent manner, it is an offence and he or she should be prosecuted.  It is important that those mechanisms are utilised by people who have that information.  From our point of view, it is not a significant issue.<\/p><p>In particular, the fact that unique identifiers are not attached to people's information can lead to duplication on the register.  That does not necessarily mean people will behave in a fraudulent manner in voting.  We do not have any significant evidence to support that.<\/p><p> Some of the options we outlined in the consultation will look at trying to address some of these matters so the position can improve and it becomes a more up-to-date and efficient method of managing that information.  If we are looking at data sharing and somebody is deceased, for example, it should be possible for us to consider trying to get that information, which another element of the State already holds, to update the register automatically.  I know it can upset people if they receive voting cards for somebody who is deceased.  It is an important activity that we can certainly consider.  The point on older people refers to something else I mentioned.  We absolutely recognise that whereas many young people in particular are very interested in managing their information online and in a timely fashion, perhaps logging in on their phone at any point to update their address if they need to, there is another cohort of people who have voted throughout their life and we must ensure we provide for them in whatever system we set up going forward.<\/p><p> From our perspective and the discussions we have with local authorities, it seems people are not taken off the register without a number of steps being involved in the process.

That would cut through many of the issues discussed here and there would be no need at that stage for any supplements to the register if it was being continually updated.  People could register up to a particular point in time before polling day, and this could be quite close to polling day.  Clearly there would need to be some gap to allow polling cards to issue and so on.  By doing away with the supplement, it would do away with the issue of asking people to go to a Garda station and so on.  It is a key initiative.<\/p> <p>  The Senator mentioned the timeline of cleaning up the register before the local elections.  It is important to clarify the legal status.  The register is compiled annually and the process starts the summer before a register is published in the following February.  November is the time of publication of the draft register, with people being able to examine it to ensure they are on it, make claims and so on.  Between the end of November and the beginning of February, local authorities tidy up the register before it is published on 1 February each year.  It becomes effective on 14 February.  That is cast in stone.  There is no question of removing or adding anybody to the register for the next 12 months.  There is scope in the compilation of the supplement to the register in the run-in to polling day.  That is where we are now in terms of local and European elections.  The compiling of the supplement is the issue and the register will be published in a couple of weeks.<\/p> <p>  Ms Quinn mentioned that door-to-door canvassing happens and some local authorities are more active than others in this space.  In fairness, local authorities indicate the process has become a more complex operation and, for example, access to gated communities and so on is not as straightforward as it used to be.  The door-to-door canvass has its limitations compared with many years ago.  This is why one of the initiatives with online registration is to make it easier for people to register.  Whether it is a personal public service number or not, a unique identifier would address the issues being aired about excess on the register or people being on the register a number of times.<\/p> <p>  There is the point about people being taken off the register.  Registration authorities should engage with people on a number of occasions before anybody is removed.  Local authorities should be able to demonstrate a paper trail and efforts to engage.  This includes knocking on somebody's door to clarify who is in a house and writing to a person.  A person might not engage and may not have been in if somebody called to the door, and people may not engage with correspondence, so such people may be taken off a register.  Certainly there should be a paper trail in a local authority to demonstrate why somebody has been removed from the register.  People should not be taken off the register for no reason or on an assumption.  There should be evidence that somebody has passed away, moved on, or whatever the case might be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019012300002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Ryan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548234000,"counter":721,"content":"<p>The other question was from Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Barry and related to the research piece in particular.  We had a brief discussion around this with Senator O'Sullivan.  Elsewhere in the world, electoral commissions have this role.  I take the point as to what happens until an electoral commission is established.  It is one of the very desirable functions that an electoral commission would have and it would bring independence to the process.  The commission would be able to manage the research without any sort of political involvement and report on a range of topics, including election results, registrations or whatever the proposed subjects would be.  From the Department's perspective, our prioritisation is on trying to progress these two initiatives.  If we move to a point where a policy decision is to be taken that an electoral commission could be established on a non-legislative basis, as I mentioned, we would see it happening within a relatively short timeframe.  It could conceivably be within 2019 and therefore some of the functions on a non-legislative basis could be assigned as set out in the consultation around research, voter engagement and the raising of awareness.  In the interim we are always willing to receive proposals and, as has been mentioned, we are in contact with earlier witnesses to the committee.  We are always willing to consider anything they might send to us in the meantime.

I am the professor of human rights law in the school of law at Queen's University Belfast.  I led a project funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC, called Brexit Law NI, looking at the consequences of Brexit for Northern Ireland in the areas of human rights, equality, conflict transformation and constitutional law in practice.<\/p> <p>  I will speak to three themes: context; Brexit rights and equality; and strengthening the protection of human rights.  With regard to context, there is a rights and equality deficit in the North.  I would put it as strongly as saying that there is a crisis in the North relating to rights and equality.  Brexit is one part of that but it is not the only part.  That said, I acknowledge that there have been advances since 1998.  There is the Human Rights Act, the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland and the section 75 equality duty.  There have been important advances since 1998 in the protection and promotion of human rights but I would like to make clear at the start that the context in the North of this island is profoundly troubling.  There is an ongoing crisis relating to human rights and equality.<\/p> <p>  We know that the UK is leaving the European Union.  EU law is one part of a complex arrangement of rights and equality protections in the North that have fundamental significance and importance in supporting and underpinning the peace process in areas such as human rights, equality and socio-economic guarantees in areas such as employment law.  The picture is complex but there is no doubt that Brexit will have a serious impact on rights and equality.  We must acknowledge that rights and equality have made their way onto the agenda for the Brexit negotiations.  I take this opportunity to acknowledge the people both in and beyond this room who made sure that rights and equality featured in that conversation.  There was a real risk at the start of all this that rights and equality would be airbrushed out and this would be a narrow conversation.  That has not proved to be the case and that is not an accident, due to extensive mobilisation relating to rights and equality by people in and beyond this room.  We can see that in the recognition in the joint report from December 2017, the withdrawal agreement, the protocol and the political declaration.<\/p> <p>  The protocol and withdrawal agreement contain an intriguing formula in respect of the protection of human rights.  The agreement indicates that there will be no diminution of Good Friday Agreement rights in the rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity section.  It lists relevant provisions of European Union law.  The protocol refers to dedicated mechanisms for enforcing the obligation relating to no diminution.  We will hear more today about the ongoing conversations regarding those dedicated mechanisms, what they will be and how effective they will be.  It recognises the common travel area and its ongoing operation.  In the context of the level playing field discussions, we have seen important references in the protocol to socio-economic protections.  Important mechanisms are in place in the withdrawal agreement and protocol for enforcement and implementation.  They are detailed and complicated and we can talk more about them today.  We know there will be a specialised committee in Northern Ireland as one mechanism under that agreement.  If the protocol is made operational and enforced, it is clear that rights will inform many elements of the process.  As members know, that is a very big if.  Even if the withdrawal agreement is secured in Parliament, getting it implemented in practice via legislation passed by Parliament will be an interesting and challenging task.<\/p> <p>  It is worth noting that these rights elements of the protocol and withdrawal agreement seem not to be the principal source of contention.  The real task ahead will be maximising the potential and rights in the withdrawal agreement.  Rights are also outlined in the political declaration on future relations.  Discussions regarding rights and equality at this phase of the process need to be carried forward.<\/p><p>As many people have stated, it is disappointing that rights of Irish citizens in the North and questions about the identity provisions of the Good Friday Agreement have not featured more prominently than they have in these legal arrangements.  Both Governments could address this but it is fair to ask why more was not said about it at this stage.  We can discuss that further today.<\/p><p> In terms of strengthening the protection of human rights on the island, as a matter of principle it is important that human rights frame the conversation going forward because it is important the conversation focuses on all of the people of the island of Ireland.  In terms of rights reform, it is clear solutions to the human rights and equality deficit exist.  There are proposals on the table.  The problem is not the lack of solutions.  There are credible legal proposals for the North, for example, with regard to a bill of rights, equal marriage, language rights and women's rights.  There are, therefore, credible legal ways forward.<\/p><p> It is important the statutory bodies on the island of Ireland in the areas of human rights and equality are fully resourced and supported to do their work.  It is important to note the recognition these bodies received through the withdrawal agreement and the recognition that human rights received through the political declaration.  Equally important has been the work of civil society on the island of Ireland.  In terms of protecting the human rights culture, North and South, it is important that civil society is also supported and resourced effectively to do its work.  It is no good talking about civil society and its role in mobilising rights and equality if it is not adequately resourced and supported to do so.  There is a crisis in that area right now.<\/p><p> It is important that the joint committee is given a much more central role on human rights on the island of Ireland.  Its role could be widened and deepened and its work could be further expanded.  How could it include the voices of civil society?  How could it speak to many of the questions we will address today?  The joint committee will have a fundamental role in the time ahead, not least in protecting the notion of equivalence, which is in the Good Friday Agreement and needs to be revisited by another solution to some of the questions we are talking about today, including the neglected charter of rights on the island of Ireland.  There have been proposals for a bill of rights for the North since 2008.  There is advice from the joint committee on a charter of rights for the island of Ireland in 2011.  Both those matters need to be urgently revisited in the context of the conversation we are having now in addition to the conversations we are having around the withdrawal agreement and the protocol and its implementation.  <\/p><p> On strengthening the promotion and protection of human rights, there is a conversation ongoing.  That conversation is not regarded as helpful by everyone on the island of Ireland but there is a conversation taking place about the constitutional status of the North.  It is reasonable to have this conversation given the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.  It is equally important that the discussion on constitutional status includes a human rights and equality framework.  Let us be in no doubt, whether it is regarded as helpful or unhelpful, that this discussion has started.  It is better to be prepared and plan and frame the conversation around rights and equality protections for everyone on the island.<\/p><p> In the North, there is a crisis and a deficit in regard to rights and equality.  We are not starting on a blank page.  There are legally credible solutions and proposals to address that crisis.  The question I have with regard to the current discussions around Brexit is whether there is a willingness politically - that is where we are at - to confront and address the human rights and equality crisis in the North because legally credible solutions exist to solve that crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019012300002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Colin Harvey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548234000,"counter":746,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Harvey for his written submission.

The Committee on the Administration of Justice is a Belfast based independent human rights organisation which founds its analysis on international standards and takes no position on the constitutional position of Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt Brexit would damage and reduce protections for human rights and equality in a range of ways.  However, today I will concentrate on the damage that may be done, and which to an extent has already been done, to the peace agreement which has brought 20 years of relative peace and stability to our island.  Since conflict means a bonfire of rights, defending the peace is the first priority for human rights activists.<\/p> <p>  We still do not know if Brexit will actually happen or, if it does, in what particular way it will happen.  However, the events of the past two and a half years have already damaged the peace settlement and relations across this island.  We have no devolved institutions in Northern Ireland and the two major political parties are on opposite sides of an increasingly fractious debate.  In our view, whatever happens, we need to rebuild our intertwined societies on the basis of a new dispensation based on human rights and equality.  In the coming years, there will be further dislocation and disagreement, whatever happens with Brexit, as the constitutional status of Northern Ireland again comes to the fore with a probable Border poll.  We need a resilient society and politics with institutions across the island which people can trust to be fair and transparent.  In the briefing we make some proposals that come out of our enhanced understanding of the weaknesses and pressure points the Brexit debate process has laid bare.<\/p> <p>  The citizenship issue is an example of how basic assumptions of the Good Friday Agreement have been undermined.  It recognises the birthright of the people of Northern Ireland to hold Irish or British citizenship on the basis of equality.  The basic breach of this principle of equality by Brexit would be that Irish citizens would remain EU citizens whereas British citizens would not.  It amounts to a new focus of division between the two main communities.  It has also become clear that Brexit could make the status of Irish citizens born in Northern Ireland constitutionally and practically insecure.  If Brexit goes ahead, Irish citizens will be EU citizens living in a non-member state.  What rights do they have to live, work, access health and social services and fully participate in social and political life in the state where they were born?  There are several possible answers to that question.  The first possibility is that the Home Office will regard Irish citizens as really British since UK nationality law decrees that most of those born in the UK have British citizenship.  The second possibility is that the common travel area will sort all this out but, as the Human Rights Commission has suggested, common travel area rights are built on sand.  The third possibility is that under the withdrawal agreement, EU citizens living in the UK can retain many of their current rights by applying for settled status.  One must make an application to the Home Office before the transition period ends.  Theresa May magnanimously withdrew the &pound;65 charge on Monday afternoon.  <\/p> <p>  None of these options is appealing as they all involve the implication that those who choose Irish identity are in some way second-class citizens.  Their rights as full participants in Northern Ireland life would depend on either a denial of their Irish nationality, as yet unknown bilateral agreements between the UK and Ireland about the common travel area or asking the Home Office to graciously allow them to leave to live in the land of their birth.<\/p><p>The reality is that Irish citizens born and living in Northern Ireland have no legal connection to the jurisdiction in which they were born.<\/p><p> Legislation is needed both in the UK and Ireland to recognise the particular status of Irish citizens born in Northern Ireland and their unequivocal right to participate fully in that region and as fully as feasible in Irish society, and full equality in the rights British and Irish citizens can access.  A treaty enshrining these provisions in international law would repair some of the damage done to the principle of the agreement.<\/p><p> We also propose the following measures to protect rights in this coming situation of political turmoil.  To prevent a racist immigration policy and the territory of Northern Ireland becoming one big border, we propose that the Irish Government reject any practices of racial profiling and begin an open and transparent debate about how immigration into the common travel area is managed.<\/p><p> The charter of rights for the island of Ireland signed by political parties should be revisited.  Commitments to decision-making based on human rights and equality, with all the principles of transparency and public involvement that would involve, could be the basis of an island-wide code of political behaviour.<\/p><p> Equivalence in the protection of rights North and South is a basic principle of the agreement.  It is important that some way of guaranteeing that rights are and will in perpetuity be protected in an equivalent manner in both jurisdictions is developed.  This could be either in compatible legislation or in a treaty.<\/p><p> Abuses of power, sectarian decision-making and a corrosive lack of trust between the two major parties in the North led to the downfall of the devolved institutions.  We need an equality-based and a human rights-based return to devolution based on the full implementation of the rights provisions of the peace settlement, particularly the bill of rights, but also addressing international rights obligations and working fully within the existing rules. <\/p><p> Brexit threatens human rights and equality protections in a number of specific ways.  However, its main impact has already been to destabilise both the provisions of the peace settlement and the relations between the two jurisdictions on this island.  The current uncertainty and political turmoil may subside to an extent, especially if Brexit does not actually proceed, but trust and confidence have already been undermined.  Questions of identity and citizenship have been opened up in a way not seen since well before the agreement and those genies cannot be put back in the bottle.  We therefore need a set of measures, across the island and, where possible, on the basis of formal treaties between the two sovereign states involved, which can stabilise trust and build resilience as we move into a future of change and challenge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019012300002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Gormally","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548234000,"counter":749,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Gormally for his presentation and also for the very useful document circulated previously to members.<\/p> <p>  I now invite the chief commissioner of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, Mr. Les Allamby, to deliver the opening statement on behalf of his organisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019012300002#F00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548234000,"counter":750,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation.

I am very pleased to be here with our colleagues from the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, addressing the committee on this occasion in our capacity as the joint committee of both commissions established in the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p> <p>  The Belfast or Good Friday Agreement has legal status within international law as a peace treaty lodged with the United Nations.  The agreement laid down not only a mandate for both national human rights institutions, but also the mechanism to ensure strong co-operation between them by way of the joint committee with representatives of the two bodies North and South \"as a forum for consideration of human rights issues in the island of Ireland\". <\/p> <p>  As members can see today, there is strong trust and a strong shared sense of purpose across both commissions.  Today is an important opportunity to recall the commitments made back in 1998, which were grounded in the human rights and equality provisions of the 1998 agreement.  However, as members know, the human rights and equality framework contained in the agreement assumed that the UK and Ireland would continue to be members of the European Union.  Although the joint report of December 2017 committed to protecting the agreement in all its parts, Brexit negotiations currently depart from that common framework creating risks for both rights and remedies. <\/p> <p>  While the joint committee has worked collaboratively for many years, I will limit my remarks to the joint committee&rsquo;s work relevant to today&rsquo;s discussion.  As a joint committee, we were pleased to see the UK&rsquo;s commitment to no diminution of rights as to protecting the Good Friday Agreement, in the joint report of December 2017.  In March 2018, the joint committee published its policy statement on the matter and made six key recommendations that ought to be adhered to in the UK-EU negotiations on the withdrawal agreement that followed. <\/p> <p>  First, we strongly recommended the retention of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights in UK law, as well as a clear and enforceable commitment to no diminution of human rights and equality standards following withdrawal.  The UK Government committed in December 2017 to ensuring that no diminution of rights is caused by its departure from the European Union.  The draft withdrawal agreement published in November 2018 narrowed this commitment to the rights included in the rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity section of the Good Friday Agreement 1998 insofar as those rights or standards are protected by EU membership. <\/p> <p>  We called for the withdrawal agreement to provide for the continuing North-South equivalence of rights.<\/p> <p>  We believe that the offer of continued EU citizenship or equivalent rights should be extended to all the people of Northern Ireland as defined by the Good Friday Agreement, given recognition of \"the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may so choose\".  The last situation we wish to see is one where the people of Northern Ireland feel forced to choose an identity based on what they think their post-Brexit entitlements might be.<\/p> <p>  We believe that any increase in border controls would impact negatively on the exercise of rights.  People on both sides of the Border between Ireland and Northern Ireland regularly cross the Border to exercise their right to work, to access public services, including health and education, and to visit family, for example.  The protection of Border communities and migrant workers remains paramount when we consider issues that go beyond the common travel area arrangements in terms of protecting rights.<\/p> <p>  The fifth recommendation is about ensuring evolving justice arrangements comply with the commitment to non-diminution of rights, which continues to be a concern for the joint committee.  These include the operation of the European arrest warrant; how prisoners are repatriated and transferred between member states; how policing co-operation takes place when the UK is no longer a member of Europol; how information and data are shared for criminal justice purposes; and how cross-Border justice arrangements will take place on the island of Ireland.  The protection of human rights is closely linked to ensuring accountability for human rights violations and co-operation in criminal justice investigations is, therefore, critical. <\/p> <p>  The final recommendation by the joint committee is the right to participation in public life, another aspect of the North-South equivalence of rights under the 1998 agreement.  It is important to consider how those in Northern Ireland, to whom EU citizenship is to be offered exceptionally after Brexit, will continue to be represented in EU democratic institutions. <\/p> <p>  I repeat and reiterate Professor Harvey's point about recognising the contribution of people both here today and beyond who have ensured that human rights and equality have been given the attention they deserve.<\/p><p> For the purpose of the meeting, I will chronicle the efforts of the joint committee North and South, particularly throughout 2018.  It started by meeting the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, and the Brexit co-ordination team in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  We met ambassadors and key officials in the UK and Irish permanent missions at the United Nations Office in Geneva and the EU in Brussels.  We met the Article 50 task force on three occasions in 2018, including chief negotiator, Mr. Michel Barnier, deputy chief negotiator, Ms Sabine Weyand, and Northern Ireland adviser, Ms Nina Obermaier.  We travelled to Westminster to meet with Mr. Robin Walker MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department for Exiting the European Union, and his officials.  We also met Lord Duncan, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, at Stormont House a number of times.  In each of these meetings, and in particular with the task force, we made clear that, as a joint committee with a mandate in statute, we wished to have as formal a role as possible in the post-Brexit monitoring of human rights and equality on the island of Ireland.<\/p><p> In November 2018, we launched research commissioned by the joint committee and carried out by academics at Newcastle University, Durham University and the University of Birmingham.  The research recommended that both the Irish and UK Governments should look to secure a &ldquo;gold standard&rdquo; approach through a new intergovernmental common travel arrangement, provided through a treaty.  Such a treaty would formalise common immigration rules, travel rights, residency rights and related rights to education, social security, work, health, security and justice.  Of particular concern in our work at this crucial period of the negotiations, and possibly also of concern to the justice and equality committee, are the issues of North-South equivalence of rights on an ongoing basis and the guarantee of equality of citizenship.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for the invitation to appear before it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019012300002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Emily Logan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548234000,"counter":756,"content":"<p>I call Mr. Allamby to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019012300002#G00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548234000,"counter":757,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation.  I start by endorsing Ms Logan's remarks on the level of engagement we have had with the British and Irish Governments and the Commission's Article 50 task force, and paying tribute to the work of human rights non-governmental organisations.  Both the organisations, which are present, and others in civic society have played an active role in the campaign and debate about the ramifications of leaving the EU for human rights and equality.<\/p> <p>  The six recommendations of the joint committee that were outlined by Ms Logan had twin aims, namely, to preserve the existing human rights protections and keep pace, at the least, with human rights and equality developments as they progress within the EU in the future.  We recognise, therefore, both preservation and development as key aspects of the matter.  Our view is that the draft withdrawal agreement suggests substantial progress has been made but there are also significant gaps.  I will start with the good news before speaking about where work still needs to be done.<\/p> <p>  The Ireland-Northern Ireland protocol contains a number of important provisions, which should not be underestimated.  First, the UK Government has a commitment to ensuring no diminution of the rights contained within the rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity section of the 1998 agreement as a result of leaving the EU.  I emphasise that I refer to one part of the agreement rather than the whole agreement, although ideally we would have liked to have seen a commitment to the whole agreement.<\/p> <p>  Second, a number of specific EU directives will continue to have effect in Northern Ireland covering equal treatment such as in accessing goods and services, employment, self-employment and social security alongside equal treatment between persons of racial or ethnic origin, which extends to other groups. Those commitments cover both existing protection and keeping pace with future EU protections, which gives Northern Ireland some additional protections to the rest of the UK.<\/p> <p>  Third, and importantly, the UK and Irish Governments will continue to be able to make arrangements for the common travel area, including offering more favourable treatment between the two countries than to other EU citizens in certain circumstances.<\/p> <p>  Fourth, existing North-South co-operation will be maintained in a number of areas, including justice and security, which is particularly important, and both Governments may continue to build on the provision of the Good Friday Agreement in other areas of North-South co-operation while respecting EU law.  <\/p> <p>  Fifth, institutional arrangements will be put in place to oversee the protocol and, in turn, those arrangements can fit into the full oversight architecture within the withdrawal agreement, the importance of which Professor Harvey mentioned.<\/p> <p>  A number of outstanding issues, however, remain to be resolved.  First, the scope and extent of the protections provided by the non-diminution commitment within the rights, safeguards and equality of opportunities section of the 1998 agreement needs to be determined.  That section was not drafted with EU law in mind, as the assumption was that we would remain within the EU.  It contains a number of specific commitments to rights but also embraces broader aims, such as social inclusion; the advancement of women in public life; respect, understanding and tolerance in relation to linguistic diversity; and victims&rsquo; rights to remember and contribute to a changed society.  How these broad concepts will be translated and interpreted with reference to EU law remains to be seen.  We take an expansive view but whether the courts will take the same view is a matter of conjecture.  We have argued strongly that explicit reference, as a minimum, should be made to a number of other EU directives, for example, on parental leave, rights of pregnant workers and rights of victims.  We argue that they should also be covered by the non-diminution commitment.  Whether they will be remains to be confirmed but the equality commission and the joint committee have made strong representations in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Second, there is the UK Government&rsquo;s decision to be no longer bound by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.  The charter largely mirrors the rights contained in the European Convention on Human Rights but goes further by including a number of economic and social rights.  As Mr. Gormally outlined, the 1998 agreement envisaged a bill of rights for Northern Ireland supplementing the rights contained in the convention to reflect the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland, drawing on international instruments and experience.  In effect, a bill of rights was to provide a \"convention-plus\" approach to human rights protection.  Although the charter post-dates the 1998 agreement and applies it only in conjunction with EU law, the charter remains the closest equivalent to a \"convention-plus\" approach contemplated in a bill of rights. <\/p> <p>  It has been argued that while the draft withdrawal agreement does not incorporate the charter into Northern Ireland law, other provisions within the withdrawal agreement mean that the charter would apply extensively.  Moreover, the UK Government has argued that much of the charter will be retained in either common law or statute law.  Nonetheless, the loss of the EU charter in its current form would lead to a loss of legal certainty and consistency, as legal cases would have to argue that the charter applies as well as how it applies.  In addition, the charter is an accessible document and the wider understanding of rights would be hampered through the failure to incorporate it within the draft withdrawal agreement.  The retention of the charter would also provide a degree of continuing equivalence of rights throughout the island of Ireland and, therefore, is in line with the spirit of the 1998 agreement.  For all those reasons, the commission continues to hold that the charter should be retained for Northern Ireland at least until a bill of rights for Northern Ireland is introduced. <\/p> <p>  Third, while confirmation that the common travel area will continue is welcome, leaving the EU changes the legal dynamic underpinning the existing and future arrangements, particularly for freedom of movement.  The formal legal underpinnings are relatively scant, as outlined in the work the joint committee commissioned, and rely on the provisions of EU law governing freedom of movement and other associated rights.  Although I recognise there is no desire in the UK or Irish Governments to dilute common travel arrangements at this point, to safeguard against any future dilution we recommend that the two Governments should agree a common travel area treaty, covering common immigration rules, travel rights, residency rights and related rights to education, social security, work, health, security and justice.  Moreover, access to some rights in a cross-Border setting remains determined by EU law rather than the common travel area, and childcare support within UK social security benefits is one example.  The common travel area, therefore, is not the answer to all the ills of rights for cross-Border workers.<\/p><p>Fourth, is the extent of the commitment made in the 2017 report that people who are Irish citizens will continue to enjoy rights as EU citizens.  What that means in practice remains unclear.  Focusing solely on those who identify as Irish within Northern Ireland creates a potential towards unequal citizenship counter to the principles of the 1998 agreement unless those rights are extended to all the people of Northern Ireland, whether they identify themselves as British, British and Irish, or Irish.  The commission's assessment, on the basis of what we have seen since the December 2017 report, is that the ambition of those initial intentions from within the EU 27 have been significantly tempered and we would like to see clarity as to what exactly the rights and entitlements will be for Irish citizens in Northern Ireland when the UK leaves the European Union.<\/p><p> Fifth, the long-term arrangements on the issues of justice, security and data sharing arrangements are very important and have yet to be agreed.  That includes the continuation of the European arrest warrant, and the question of how oversight and redress is maintained given the UK Government's red line that it wishes to leave the Court of Justice of the European Union.  We still do not know in detail what the bespoke alternative is.  It is the fine detail that always counts on these issues.<\/p><p> On the sixth recommendation, EU law has provided significant rights and protections for people living in Northern Ireland.  The withdrawal agreement cements some of those protections but by no means all of them.  It seems to us that there is a real likelihood of Northern Ireland diverging from Ireland and other EU member states in EU-led rights protections.  We have seen how Northern Ireland has fallen behind other parts of the UK in terms of the single Equality Act, equal marriage, rights to abortion, etc.  Those are all issues that we could see in the future where Northern Ireland would be a back marker rather than a leader in the development of rights, without the important value of EU law to provide some underpinning protection.<\/p><p> Finally, there is the value of the dedicated mechanism alluded to by Professor Harvey.  Its effectiveness will be determined by the statutory powers and the mandate given to the two commissions and the joint committee and the resources provided to the commissions.  Alongside that, we have also argued very strongly that there must be individual rights of enforcement, with access to legal aid for those on low incomes.  Separate individual rights enforcement have not been confirmed in the protocol, although we anticipate that will happen.  We do not think that the commission should be the only place that people should be able to enforce their rights.  People should have the choice to do that of their own volition as well as through the commissions.<\/p><p> There remains a great deal to be done, assuming the withdrawal agreement eventually comes into effect.  We are committed to continuing to battle for those issues that we have identified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019012300002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Les Allamby","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548234000,"counter":759,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Allamby and Ms Logan for their joint approach.

There is a fair amount to get through in terms of the contributions and in addition to them.  I have a number of questions, which I wish to hone in on, with the indulgence of the Chairman.  On Mr. Allamby's fourth point on citizenship rights post-Brexit and the rights that will continue to be enjoyed or will not be enjoyed, he is right in that regard but I would add on to that that a failure to recognise, implement or legislate for Irish citizens in the North sustains an inequality, in itself.  I accept the point that we need to include and recognise all the citizens in the North.  However, we also need to be careful that we do not leave a significant chunk of the population behind by not legislating for their rights in the current context.<\/p> <p>  The second point I wish to make is on Mr. Gormally's presentation and it touches on some of Professor Harvey's points around the basic assumptions of the Good Friday Agreement being undermined by Brexit.  He is absolutely right.  I have been saying from the very start of this.  The European Parliament's constitutional affairs committee said from the outset that Brexit would require an alteration of the Good Friday Agreement.  This also flags the point that so many aspects of the Good Friday Agreement remain unimplemented in terms of our rights.  He made a number of points about the constitutionally and practically insecure nature of our rights of Irish citizens who are resident in the North.<\/p> <p>  The points around the British Home Office, in particular, are pertinent and are live because of the de Souza case.  I do not wish to go to deep into that because there is an ongoing appeal in relation to that case.  The point around the possibility of the Home Office regarding citizens as British is not a presumption, it is happening.  The de Souza case shows us that this is happening.  The presumption is that people like the de Souzas and people like me and everyone in the North are automatically presumed to be British citizens, and that is the legislation that applies to them.<\/p> <p>  For me, who is nowhere near as eminent as our witnesses on these issues, that is in direct contradiction to the citizenship aspect of the Good Friday agreement.  The point was made about both Governments legislating but I do not sense an appetite within the British system to legislate for our rights given what it is inflicting on us at the moment.  How does the Irish Government legislate or bring proposals forward that protect and uphold our rights as citizens?  I have been asking it for a long time what our rights as Irish citizens are, beyond the holding of a passport, but it has not been able to tell me.  Could our witnesses expand on some ideas around that issue?<\/p> <p>  On the issue of democratic representation and voting rights, that is, to continue to elect representatives to the European Parliament, my colleague, Martina Anderson, MEP, sought legal advice.  The Irish Government could have provided the additional two seats allocated to Ireland for people who are resident in the North but it decided not to do so.  Is it too late?  Are there other avenues or examples where people may have the opportunity to elect people to elected fora outside of the jurisdiction?<\/p> <p>  I would like to ask all the witnesses, but, in particular, Mr. Allamby, about the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages.  The British Government is signed up to the charter.  Limited and marginal as it is, it is probably the only protection for indigenous and minority languages in the North.  Has any research or scoping been done, given the political dynamic around language issues and the demand for proper legislation?  That is really the only thing we have.  Are we in danger of losing that and what threat does it pose?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019012300002#H00300","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1548234000,"counter":761,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

I was disappointed to see, in the context of paragraph 52 of the joint report from December 2017, that there has not been more progress in respect of the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland in this conversation.  These are precisely the types of questions on which we need clarity.<\/p> <p>  There are two matters with regard to the birthright issue.  First, it is not well understood either in Britain or on this island.  Some of the matters we are talking about today will require work by the British Government but a number of them will require work by the Irish Government to make them legally meaningful.  The birthright provisions of the agreement are not well understood, and we are talking about an international treaty that brings obligations with it.  There is also something that many of us here are tired of saying, which is that the Good Friday Agreement has not been effectively implemented in domestic law in the UK.  There has been a failure of effective and comprehensive implementation of the agreement and this is one example of that.  There is the issue of misunderstanding but there is also the issue of follow through and changing domestic law to reflect the complexities of this provision.  Otherwise people will find themselves in a bureaucratic mess.  That also relates to the European Union in its negotiations on this with regard to providing necessary assurances in the context of the current conversation.  The bill of rights proposals from the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission in 2008 need to be dusted off.  There was an attempt in those proposals to grapple with some of this and to formalise aspects of the agreement that had been neglected.  In other work I have been doing with Dr. Anne Smith at Ulster University on the bill of rights we talk about a formalisation gap.  Given that people are so keen on the Good Friday Agreement we need to see some of it implemented more effectively.<\/p> <p>  That is also true of the conversation we have heard regarding the common travel area.  There is much talk about the common travel area but what has emerged as a matter of absolute urgency in both jurisdictions is the need to formalise and codify the common travel area.  Mr. Les Allamby spoke about it being written in sand.  There is an emerging consensus that there must be a bilateral treaty, and it should be a comprehensive treaty, to make the common travel area rights meaningful in practice.  There is a formalisation gap in that regard too.  These are issues for the Irish Government.  Ireland has to be sure that its domestic law, policy and practice respect the common travel area as well.  We need to have that conversation on this island, so there are things that could be done.<\/p> <p>  Voting rights for the European Parliament is something that frustrates me.  Throughout the Brexit negotiations people have used language referring to imagination, creativity and flexibility, but that has not been evident in the discussions on, for example, voting rights.  There is a view that this is possible and doable.  If there is political will in this jurisdiction to do this, it can be done.  This is an area where a little imagination and creativity should be exercised by the Irish Government with regard to voting rights for the North.  It is very disappointing to hear people say it is unrealistic and impossible when it is quite clear that aspects of it are legally doable.  Some of that would also address some of the problems that are emerging in discussions around the protocol.  One of the criticisms of the protocol on the backstop is about the democratic deficit.  Perhaps one way to deal with an aspect of that is around the extension of voting rights in the North and handling the complexities of that, whether that is on this island or in the context of the EU-UK negotiations.<\/p> <p>  The big issue for me is that Brexit is highlighting a formalisation and codification gap in respect of the Good Friday Agreement and the common travel area.  There are things the Irish Government could be doing to follow through on this.  It is important that it does its bit in the context of this discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019012300002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Colin Harvey"},{"type":"speech","time":1548234000,"counter":766,"content":"<p>If our guests wish to respond to something particular in the Senator's contribution it is open to them to do so.

We must look at what the Good Friday Agreement was meant to do when considering the citizenship issue.  Generally, human rights organisations do not get involved in citizenship because human rights are human rights irrespective of citizenship.  In this case, however, the Good Friday Agreement was about creating a geographical and political space that could be shared by people with different national identities and allegiances.  That was at least one of the fundamental principles under the agreement.  As part of that, full equality between people's choice of citizenship must be maintained.  As we said earlier, the British Government unilaterally deprives British citizens born in the North of their right to be EU citizens.  We suggested treating everybody born in the North as EU citizens on the basis of a reciprocal arrangement that would allow free movement into the North and would make this island a unit from that point of view.  That has not been taken up.<\/p> <p>  As to what the rights of Irish citizens as EU citizens are, as Mr. Les Allamby has said that is still not clear but-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019012300002#J00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Gormally"},{"type":"speech","time":1548234000,"counter":768,"content":"<p>That is the pertinent question at the heart of this.  In addition, what are Irish citizens' rights as Irish citizens?  Before the EU can legislate for us, the Irish Government must legislate for us.  I can apply for an Irish passport and travel around the world with it.  I can move freely at present around the island of Ireland.  Beyond that, however, as the de Souza case shows, the unilateral presumption by one party to the Good Friday Agreement is that, despite what the Good Friday Agreement says, its legislative outcomes and its lodging with the UN, EU and so forth, all of us born 20 years after the Agreement was signed are British until such time as we renounce this citizenship we have never held and do not want, with the greatest respect and no harm.  That relates to everything Mr. Gormally just said about competing nationalities and allegiances.  There is a legislative requirement, and despite what the Home Office said it is taking people through the courts.  It is defying the word, letter and spirit of the Good Friday Agreement by saying all of that is well and good.  The Irish Government, and I understand it up to a point, remains silent on that.  We are in the middle of a negotiation and there might be a degree of sense in doing that, but there is no evidence for me or for the people who have to go through this that the Irish Government is legislating for our rights in this circumstance.  It is not happening.  Essentially, we have British citizenship imposed on us not just in that case but also unless there are the legislative instruments required from this jurisdiction and from the EU to protect us against it.<\/p> <p>  This comes back to Mr. Les Allamby's point.  I will not be a second class citizen but a third or fourth class citizen resident in the North because of what we are seeing transpire and also because the Irish Government, which adopted all the parts of the Good Friday Agreement in the Constitution, is not legislating for our rights.  I appreciate this is just one point but it is one I feel strongly about.  It is one that institutions, society and rights and civic organisations here must absorb and understand.<\/p><p>Irish citizens in Donegal, Omagh, Strabane and Belfast are not quasi-Irish citizens or some other category but are Irish citizens whose rights are in jeopardy at present.

An Irish citizen does not by virtue of his or her Irish citizenship have the right to live and reside in Northern Ireland under UK law.  That is what needs to be changed.  The UK needs to legislate and very likely the Irish Government also needs to legislate; what we would argue is that should be given international legal effect by a treaty.  That is what is necessary to underpin the Good Friday Agreement.  It has taken two and a half years of debate for the realisation to become clear that there is not the same legal underpinning of the rights of Irish citizens as there are of British citizens in terms of the rights within the territory of Northern Ireland.  These may seem abstruse legal technicalities but as the Senator's impassioned points have demonstrated this actually goes to the heart of identity.

I recognise that the Good Friday Agreement was very much about identity rights, it was also about parity of esteem.  What we have tried to do as a joint committee in our discussions with the UK Government has been to seek to recognise that this entails recognising both the rights of those who are Irish and those who are British in Northern Ireland.  This has different dimensions.  I think there are some answers.  As Professor Harvey has suggested it is one of the areas that was interrogated in some detail in the advice that was given by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission in 2008.  In terms of solutions, a bill of rights is one of the places in which some of these issues could be dealt with.  I am not sure that it could be comprehensively argued but the common travel area and having some kind of international treaty or bilateral agreement is where one potentially could deal with some of the issues.  It is clear from an White Paper on immigration in the UK that it will, to put it slightly simplistically but not far off the mark, be treating EU citizens in the future broadly in the same way that non-EU citizens are currently treated, so the issue of freedom of movement and the rights of Irish citizens makes the common travel area and some of these other issues even more important.  I think answers to some of these questions could be found.<\/p> <p>  I should comment on the Good Friday Agreement.  The rights and what I term the participatory elements of the Good Friday Agreement are unfinished business.  It is not just a bill of rights for Northern Ireland, it is the all-Ireland charter of rights - which was mentioned by Professor Harvey, it is the civic forum or some equivalent, none of which has been put in place 20 years on.  That is a big gap in terms of the Agreement.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of the representation rights, I think that while there are clearly some EU elements to this, a great deal of it probably falls within the remit of the Irish Government.  There are other member states where citizens from outside of the country can vote in elections, so it is not as if that is not an issue that has been addressed in many other member states.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019012300002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Les Allamby"},{"type":"speech","time":1548234000,"counter":773,"content":"<p>The major irony and the obvious point is that the Government is telling us that it will legislate for constitutional reform to give voting rights for presidential elections to Irish people living outside the State.

That may be a bit simplistic but it is certainly a point that jumps out at me right away.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019012300002#K00600","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548234000,"counter":774,"content":"<p>It is clear that Irish citizens in Northern Ireland will still have access to EU institutions.  That is one of the areas where the EU 27 are on record about what Irish citizens will retain.  An interesting aspect for me is that access to those institutions are probably the only area where they have been clear about what rights will be retained by EU citizens.  Beyond that, freedom from discrimination, freedom to assert one's national rights have been set in very broad terms but what they mean in practice is very unclear.  My guess is that the Irish Government is hoping for an EU 27-wide UK negotiated solution, in other words the UK Government is on record as wanting for example all UK citizens to retain access to the European health insurance card, access to educational opportunities across the EU in the Erasmus programme etc. and therefore if that kind of agreement is reached then the gap between Irish citizens in Northern Ireland and those who identify as British in Northern Ireland will be relatively small.  If, on the other hand, there is no agreement on some of those core issues, when one moves outside of Northern Ireland to the rest of EU, then the gap between the Irish and British citizens will be very different and one has the internal issues that Professor Harvey has alluded to around Irish citizenship, the De Souza case etc.<br\/><br\/>The third issue, the European Charter of regional and minority languages, the question of trying to get within the withdrawal agreement some reference to what will be covered in terms of language rights, given that it is in the relevant section of the agreement has been a point of discussion between the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the UK Government.  I am not sure we have convinced them that it should be explicitly put into any kind of document that might follow the withdrawal agreement to flesh out the detail but it remains in play.  How one translates the rights contained in the Good Friday Agreement and some of the broad concepts into EU law will become a matter for the withdrawal agreement.  No doubt people will come to both commissions, people may come to lawyers and I suspect that is an issue that will be in play if the withdrawal agreement is introduced.  What the outcome of that will be remains to be seen.  I would be surprised to see it explicitly put into any kind of document that states definitely that, yes, it is contained.  I do not think that one can legitimately put in a document that it is not, so I suspect that it will be one of those areas where we will see how it is interpreted in practice.  <b><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019012300002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Les Allamby"},{"type":"speech","time":1548234000,"counter":775,"content":"<p>Does  Ms Logan wish to add anything? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019012300002#K00800","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548234000,"counter":776,"content":"<p>I am more than happy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019012300002#K00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Emily Logan"},{"type":"speech","time":1548234000,"counter":777,"content":"<p>Is Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile happy?

One of the challenges learned from the Good Friday Agreement, the British-Irish Agreement, is that people have been saying for a long time that aspects of it have not been implemented or enforced.  There is very little we can do about that.  Domestic law in the UK - the British constitutional context - really matters given the peculiarities of the British constitutional system.  One of the challenges of the Good Friday Agreement, the British-Irish Agreement, was what to do if there is a breach in domestic law within the UK.  That has informed the debate around the negotiations with the EU and the discussions on the withdrawal agreement, the protocol and everything else.  In terms of the conversations we are having on rights, it is no good thinking one has paper rights if they are not enforceable.  That applies to the broader human rights conversation.  That is really important for the future UK that is out of European Union, where we lose that European Union background and framework.  The important lesson in all this is to make sure the rights one has signed up to are enforceable and one can do something about them.  Brexit is exposing that and people are trying to learn the lessons from that.<\/p> <p>  To switch to a separate conversation, a similar issue arises with the common travel area.  The Commission's work has pointed this out.  People talk about the CTA as if it is a thing but what research has found, and the Commission has pointed out, is that it is built on sand, legally.  It needs to be codified and written down.  The reason people are emphasising a treaty is that we need not just to think what are the rights but what to do about them.  Irish citizens in the North and Britain need to know that in 20 years' time, without exaggerating this, they will not end up in a Windrush scenario in a British or Northern context.

I thank all the speakers for their attendance, presentations and answers to the questions.  Inevitably, there will be a bit of a crossover but I will try my best not to repeat too much.  Some supporters of Brexit and Brexiteers have tried to argue that the Good Friday Agreement is in no way in conflict with the attempts to leave the European Union.  The issues that Brexit throws up for the Good Friday Agreement and for citizens' rights in the North has been well identified here.  Obviously, a large part of it was that the Good Friday Agreement presupposed Britain and Ireland being members of the European Union with all the rights related to that.<\/p> <p>  On the question of citizenship, it is important to say it is not just an abstract thing and it can have real and meaningful consequences for people.  I will give examples to illustrate the implications for people.  I came across an Irish citizen living in the North whose partner is an American national.  The Irish citizen was seeking a visa for this American national.  The British Government insisted that this Irish national obtain a British passport in order for his partner to be able to obtain a visa.  It was not possible to do that through any Irish legal route.  That happened relatively recently and I am not sure what the current position is.  There was an obligation on this Irish national to go to the British Government in order that his partner could get a visa to travel to the North.  That is one example I came across.<\/p> <p>  The other example relates to a non-EU citizen who is resident in the North and whose children are Irish citizens.  If resident in the Twenty-six Counties, this person would be entitled to naturalisation on the basis of their children.  However, being resident in the North, this person had to go through the British system in order to achieve naturalisation, even though their children were Irish citizens living in the North.  I am putting these examples on the record to illustrate concrete examples of how the uncertainty around citizenship can have an impact on people's lives where it relates to naturalisation and visas.  There are probably countless other examples.  Obviously, that is being discussed in the de Souza case.<\/p> <p>  Is it fair to say that the citizenships are not properly understood both here and in Britain?  Would be fairer to say they are not properly defined?  At what stage does somebody who identifies as Irish, and wishes to be an Irish citizen, become an Irish citizen?<\/p><p>At what stage is that legally recognised to be the case?  Mr. Gormally indicated that generally it is when one seeks a passport that one vindicates the rights associated with Irish citizenship.  Are there any other means of doing so?  If one takes a court case in the South, is that seen as a vindication of Irish citizenship?  Are there any other routes?  Is the stage at which a resident of the North is recognised as an Irish citizen entirely unclear?  I ask all of our guests to respond to the questions I have asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019012300002#M01300","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548234000,"counter":815,"content":"<p>To be honest, the detail of the Deputy's final question would probably have to be put to an expert in Irish nationality law.

Even though I am English by birth - as the members of the committee can probably tell from my accent - all of my children carry Irish passports.  That is their choice, not mine.  This right is perfectly well recognised and there is no difficulty about it whatsoever.  The point is that this category of Irish citizenship does not provide rights in Northern Ireland, except insofar as the UK state says that people in this category are also British.

When we have left the EU, it will be up to the UK to decide which parts of EU law it will retain.  While I do not anticipate that it will get rid of EU law substantially overnight, the UK Parliament will have an opportunity to do so.  I will set out what this means in practical terms for someone who has a partner or family member from within the EU.  Based on what the UK Government is stating, EU citizens within the UK will have quite significant protections.  Five or ten years from now, such people will not have the benefit of EU law.  The issue of freedom of movement will go.  The common travel area will deal with some issues for individuals that relate to freedom of movement and the common travel area.

Language rights are part of a long list of issues that are blocked at the moment in the North.  What is remarkable, in terms of the power-sharing institutions, is that in some senses a mechanism that was set up to protect rights, like the petition of concern, now looks as if it is standing in the way of progress on a range of issues.  That sounds awfully despairing so I will make an interesting and evidential point.  Across a range of human rights and equality issues in Northern Ireland, the situation is not unlike the position in Dublin, London, Manchester, Glasgow or Cardiff.  The evidence clearly shows that there is an emerging progressive majority for change in Northern Ireland.  To end on a slightly optimistic note, the key question is how one can harness such change to move forward on language rights and a range of other issues that have been mentioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019012300002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Colin Harvey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548234000,"counter":830,"content":"<p>Let me give an unusually succinct Northern Irish answer to the question.  Yes, the commission's mandate is framed on international standards of human rights.

On that basis, our commission has recommended that those recommendations be enacted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019012300002#O00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Les Allamby"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548234000,"counter":831,"content":"<p>My first answer is \"Yes\", but I will expand on that.  As part of the St. Andrews Agreement, the UK Government pledged to legislate for an Irish language Act but, subsequently, it passed that commitment to Stormont in Northern Ireland where it has been blocked.  We completely accept the need in the agreement for mechanisms that ensure that one community does not oppress another in the Legislature.  That is why there are particular arrangements for coalition and consent in voting, the petition of concern and so on.<\/p> <p>  Our concern, which we mentioned in our paper, is that mechanisms that exist to prevent the oppression of minorities are being used to prevent measures that would increase the rights of minorities.  We need a human rights and equality-based return to a devolved Administration in the North.  It must be on the basis of the implementation of some of the weaknesses that we have all spoken about all morning.  I mean the full implementation of the promises of the agreement and the proper operation of the mechanisms that were set up.  For example, when a petition of concern is triggered, it is supposed to go to a special committee on human rights and equality to decide if it is in line with that.  Unfortunately, that has not happened.  We have listed a range of issues in the briefing paper.  Perhaps not every single one needs to be implemented.  However, the underpinning of devolved government must be put on a secure basis of human rights and equality.  The language issue is just one of those matters.  It is particularly important to people in symbolic terms and in other terms.  It is the reassertion of the fairness of institutions across this island, which has been the main message that I have tried to convey this morning.

As co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government clearly has a pivotal role.  In fairness, the EU 27 have been very strong in recognising the Agreement.  The first matter to note is that the Government made representations and continues to do so on a bill of rights.  A bill of rights is very important.  It is a slightly populist point, but I always compare a bill of rights to a job description in employment.  A bill of rights comes into its own and demonstrates its value in times of economic and political instability.  It is a little bit like one's job description.  If a job is going well and one has a good relationship with one's employer, one is not rushing off to see what one's job description says all the time.  When things go wrong or are more difficult, one tends to go back and see what the arrangements are.  That is what a bill of rights can do.  Whatever one's views of Brexit, we are entering a period of political and economic instability.  A bill of rights and continuing to push for the other parts of the Agreement is important.  The second matter is the common travel area.  It is clear that the Irish and UK Governments are actively involved in discussions around the common travel area and where it will sit once the UK leaves the EU.  It is not that either Government is sitting on its hands, but it would do no harm to continue to push the Irish Government towards some bilateral or international treaty arrangement which ensures that when we leave the EU and do not have the underpinnings of EU law, the common travel area is placed on a formal legal footing with a greater clarity not just about what is covered but what enforceable rights exist.  Those are two things the committee could continue to push for.  The Irish Government will not be surprised at either and will not say it has not been working on them.  However, it does no harm to continue to use the committee's good offices to see where things are moving in those directions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019012300002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Les Allamby"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548234000,"counter":840,"content":"<p>If one looks at the paper, it includes a few recommendations on the Irish Government taking the initiative in legislation and so on.  An example is the common travel area which has been mentioned several times.  A few days ago, the T&aacute;naiste said there would be a treaty on the social security aspects of the common travel area while the rest would be covered by a memorandum of understanding.  The problem with memoranda of understanding is that they are not, generally speaking, legally enforceable.  It is not clear to us why only certain aspects of the common travel area should be made subject to treaty.  After all, to mention a word which has not been mentioned thus far, the idea of the backstop is that it is legally enforceable.  Something which is not legally enforceable is not worth very much in fraught international negotiations like these.  That is one point.  While I mention the backstop, I note the importance of the Irish Government standing firm.  The question of the Border, which we have not dealt with to a great extent today, is very important for those who live along it.  It is important for the 300,000 people who cross it every day.  It is also important in its psychological impact.  The freedom to move backwards and forwards across the Border today is a measure of how far we have come since the peace Agreement of 20 years ago.  Any change in that regard will give rise to concerns and fears among people that we are going backwards and that what they thought was settled is not.  There will be concern that we are going backwards and that confidence in the Agreement is being undermined.  While there is a great deal of pressure from many directions, the Border is not just a practical issue from a Northern point of view.  It is a border of the mind as well as of geography.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019012300002#P00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Gormally"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548234000,"counter":841,"content":"<p>It is important for the committee to ask the Irish Government the hard questions and ensure where there are areas in which it can take action to address some of the points we have raised, that such action is taken.

While I acknowledge its enormous efforts in the negotiations, the Irish Government must follow through on some of this stuff too.  The committee's role in that regard is important.  One of the remarkable aspects of the Brexit process has been the mobilisation around rights and equality issues.  It has given life and renewal to the work of the joint committee of the human rights commissions on the island of Ireland.  That has been a great outcome.  The joint committee has been doing great work which should be encouraged.  Where this committee can support the work of the joint committee, I ask the members to think about how that work can be developed and deepened.  The joint committee should be invited to meetings like this more regularly to speak with one or two voices on some of the human rights issues.  Why not integrate the joint committee on human rights into the work of the committee across a range of issues, including some of the justice issues Ms Logan and Mr. Allamby have already mentioned?  When policing and justice are being discussed, the joint committee and others should be invited to talk to the members here about that and about the human rights implications to mainstream its work.

It is blocked in seeking party political consensus and stuck in relation to the Assembly.  The British Government is abdicating its responsibility to take reform measures forward in these areas.  What I am saying is that in the context of the conversation on human rights, Britain is perfectly willing to take forward measures on Brexit without political consensus, but it is not unlocking some of the human rights reforms at Westminster, which would be perfectly acceptable, for example, when it comes to expectations about Irish language legislation.  If one looks at the Good Friday Agreement and the section on a Bill of Rights, it is explicit that it was supposed to be done through legislation passed at Westminster.  Obviously, one way forward would be for Westminster to unblock it.  The reasons are well known and include the lack of party political consensus.  My view is that it should not stand in the way of achieving the human rights and equality reforms about which we are talking.<\/p> <p>  On the Assembly and power-sharing institutions, to refer again to the previous point, the North is falling behind, but it seems that politics is behind the people because from the evidence we have seen across a range of these issues there is majority support in Northern Ireland for change in the area of human rights and equality.  If some of the measures need to be taken through the Assembly, there is a very familiar ongoing debate about the petition of concern and the way it is being used to block change and reform.  We will need to give the issue serious attention in the time ahead to unlock the potential for change in Northern Ireland in a range of areas, but we do not have the Assembly.  I am increasingly of the view that there is no excuse for the Government at Westminster, obviously in discussions with the Irish Government, not to unlock these issues through legislative reform at Westminster.

If there are discussions on some of those issues, we need more clarification around that in terms of what is happening, what has been agreed or if anything has been agreed.

It struck me as a little odd.  The other point about it is the right to participation in public life.  That is not just exercising our right to use our franchise to exercise our right to vote.  The right to participation in public life also includes the role I and my colleagues play as elected representatives.  I would think it has to be taken in its full gamut.  On a personal note, the loss of the three representative seats in terms of the North of the island is unfortunate.  What is the number in that regard?  I looked through all of this earlier.  There are 73 representatives from across Britain and the North, and we have 11 here in the Republic.  It is increasing by two, but I would imagine that the greater number of people here of all political opinion would say at least those two should have been granted to people North of the Border to allow them continue that participation, that voice and that linkage.  I would hold that view very strongly.<\/p> <p>  It is apparent that there is an across the board acceptance in terms of 29 March.  What happens if there is an extension because as we speak there is no provision in terms of a European parliamentary election on 24 May North of the Border?  It is not being provided for at all.  I wonder about all of that.  The allocation of these additional seats is predetermining that this is done and dusted, whatever will happen.  It closes down possibilities, in my opinion, and I am very worried about that.<\/p> <p>  I have a few final points.  Mr. Gormally mentioned 300,000 people traversing the Border but among that number, and I have lived in the shadow of the Border all my life, there are tens of thousands who are cross-frontier workers, so described.<\/p><p>I know people where I live who are cross-frontier workers and those who travel from South to North are entitled to free access to medical care in this State, irrespective of their economic circumstances.  That is a very precious thing.  The National Health Service operates north of the Border; we have no such thing here.  It is built into the provisions of the medical card that by the very fact of these people being cross-frontier workers, they are entitled to a full medical card in this State.  Tens of thousands of people and their dependants could very well lose that entitlement, which most definitely would be absolutely catastrophic for some.  Would any panellist like to reflect a little on the issue of cross-frontier workers?  I refer not only to those going from South to North, but also to those who go from North to South, because as Mr. Gormally has suggested, this is a significant part of daily reality for many people.  What will their reality look like post Brexit?  Would Mr. Gormally like to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019012300002#R01800","speaker":"1269","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548234000,"counter":876,"content":"<p>Obviously, the details of the entitlements and so on can be quite complex in terms of social security and things like that.  A couple of months ago, I listened to a presentation from one of the advice workers at the Centre for Cross Border Studies.  She said that at the moment, they only have to ask people who make inquiries two questions, namely, where do they live and where do they work?  These are cross-Border workers and the advice workers can work out what their entitlements are, who pays their pension, and everything else from those two pieces of information.  After Brexit, the whole situation will become more complicated but, as yet, we do not know in what ways.  The other point, which was mentioned earlier, is that the T&aacute;naiste has stated the social security aspects of the common travel area will be put into a treaty.  The extent to which that will deal with frontier workers as a specific section is not known.  If I were such a worker, I would want to know what my entitlements would be with a certain degree of legal certainty.  I am not sure that a memorandum of understanding would meet that level of legal certainty.<\/p> <p>  The other thing is that the common travel area refers, of course, to the entirety of the UK and Ireland.  While it is an extremely important and historic set of freedoms and represents good neighbourly behaviour, there are specific issues concerning the Border on the island of Ireland and the people who cross it daily for work as well as, as I mentioned earlier, the psychological impact of the Border in terms of how far we have come with regard to peace and whether we are going backwards.  It seems that there is a lot to be talked about with regard to the terms of a treaty between Ireland and the UK to deal with the common travel area.  There certainly also will need to be specific provisions for cross-Border workers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019012300002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Gormally"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548234000,"counter":877,"content":"<p>With regard to the point the Chair made about my comment, I just want to make sure I have been clear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019012300002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Emily Logan"},{"type":"speech","time":1548234000,"counter":878,"content":"<p>It was on the use of the word \"exceptionally\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019012300002#S00400","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548234000,"counter":879,"content":"<p>Yes.

What do the arts mean to me?  Inherent in this question is the flawed thinking we tend to fall into when discussing the arts.  This is not to denigrate the opportunity to articulate my view or the passion with which I will attempt to communicate it to the committee.  The problem is that the question suggests that there is an abstract entity in society called the arts which has greater or lesser degrees of meaning to different individuals.  This is simply not true.  Instead, I believe creativity is fundamental to every human being and that we are all creative beings at each and every moment of our lives, irrespective of background, education or the communities in which we live.<\/p> <p>  Fundamental to all human activity is the capacity to imagine.  If there are some, like me, who become professional artists - I earn my living by using my imagination to collaborate with others in the making of professional theatre - I am only distinguished from the person who uses to his or her imagination to watch that theatre by who pays our paycheck at the end of the week.  I always think of myself as an accidental artist.  Nothing in my background suggests the life I was destined to live.  Born in Ballaghdereen in the hungry 1950s, the daughter of an exceptional teacher father and an open-minded, supportive mother, I was privileged enough to expect an education at least to my late teenage years and, if I was fortunate, a university education.  This gave me the greatest gift of all, time to explore who I might become.  In the usual act of teenage rebellion, I spent most of those years actively pursuing a life outside Ireland.  It was only through those early clumsy forays into putting on plays that I discovered how to be Irish and that the plays of an Irishman born almost 100 years before me, John Millington Synge, spoke more to my heart and sense of self than all the American plays by my contemporaries.  In those formative years I was doing what we all must do to live meaningful lives - I was becoming part of a community.<\/p> <p>  What is profoundly terrifying to me now is how carelessly and stupidly we are allowing ourselves to become isolated from one another, broken into blocks of entitlement and self-interest that ruthlessly disregard our need for the common good.  For me, the fire and definition in my life and the lives of all others is the act of imagining, but that imagining, which is the practising of art however instinctive its origins and whether it is in performance, singing, painting, making film or making music, always needs to be protected and nourished.  It requires the making of structures to enable it, to facilitate participation in it by all and to create the circumstances whereby makers can live decent and respected lives.<\/p> <p>  On that point, I wish to outline some stark facts for the committee.  They were recently published by Theatre Forum Ireland, the forum responsible for theatre performances.  One third of all performers in Ireland earn less than the minimum wage and four fifths of the jobs in our sector, the performing arts, are deemed to be precarious.  Some 74% of actors rely on other income and 73% of organisations that make and produce theatre do not make employment or health contributions to their members.  This is shocking and if it applied to any other industry in the country all of us would hang our heads in shame.  Instead, it is tolerated.  It is not acceptable in Irish society today that Irish actors earn less than the living wage.  It is also not acceptable that one of our major national institutions is apparently so lacking in governance that fundamental disagreements as to its role and function in Irish life remain chronically unresolved.<\/p><p>Members of the Joint Committee on Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht should note this and many other examples of our failure to protect our culture are not acceptable.  I will finish with what I believe are prescient words from the final commencement address of Dr. Joseph W. Polisi to his students at the Juilliard School, a major school for the arts in New York, on his retirement, who stated: &ldquo;Rather than being a subject of pious platitudes, the arts must be viewed as an essential part of our existence which can be easily neutralized by an uncaring populace or an insensitive political leadership.\"  This is a warning we would all do well to heed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019012300002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Garry Hynes","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548250200,"counter":893,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas don Chathaoirleach agus don choiste.  Is on&oacute;ir domsa a bheith anseo os comhair an choiste inniu.<br\/><br\/>Looking at the pictures coming from the Mansion House on 21 January, 100 years on, it is a prescient time.  The reference that the Taoiseach and many other speakers, including the President, made to the Democratic Programme was indeed a reminder of the time when the State was founded.  I must say, 100 years on we in the world of arts and creativity find ourselves in a very difficult place.  I concur absolutely with everything Ms Hynes has said and the numbers she mentioned.  I will not rehearse that again here. <br\/><br\/>The arts matter for at least four sets of reasons.  First, because creativity, culture and the arts are essential to our well-being and valuable in their own right as uniquely irreplaceable human activities.  Second, they matter for the individual and personal benefits they confer by enabling us to imagine, invent, interpret and communicate diverse ways of seeing the world.  Third, they matter for the communal and societal value and diversity they create, promote and share and fourth, they matter for the value they add to our reputation globally and for their potential to strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s role in bilateral relationships by enriching common ground.  Sir John Tusa, former director of the Barbican in London and executive at the BBC, puts it like this:<\/p><blockquote>The arts matter because they embrace, express and define the soul of a civilisation.  A nation without arts would be a nation that had stopped talking to itself, stopped dreaming, and had lost interest in the past and lacked curiosity about the future.<\/blockquote> <p>When I was on the Arts Council a new report about the value of the arts would often arrive from Indecon.  We would look at the executive summary of that report.  The beginning of the report would always say that for every euro invested in the arts, a return of X would be generated.  We would hotfoot over to the Department of Finance with the new report, run up the stairs and say we have it now.  The officials in the Department would look benignly at the report and thank us for bringing it to their attention, and nothing would happen.<br\/><br\/>As I was saying a little earlier, I attended the funeral of the late M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; S&uacute;illeabh&aacute;in.  He and I worked together a lot over the years.  One day we were chatting about the value of the arts and why they matter.  We were talking about numbers, and he said to me that there is no metric for the priceless.  Many years ago I wrote that down.  How true is it?  I ask the committee to imagine something.  If one looks at the depictions of Irish people as they left here in their hundreds of thousands after the Famine, one might say they are not carrying any worldly goods.  They do not have anything of value with them.  If one was being unkind, one might say these people are fairly worthless.  However, when they arrived in their destinations, particularly in Philadelphia, Boston and New York, the great cities on the eastern seaboard of the United States, as well as Chicago, and they unpacked their emotional baggage, something of rare and powerful value became apparent.  I wish to read into the record a poem written by the Donegal poet Moya Cannon.  It is called &quot;Carrying the Songs<i>&quot;. <\/i>She writes:<\/p><blockquote>It was always those with little else to carry<br \/><br \/>who carried the songs<br \/><br \/>to Babylon,<br \/><br \/>to the Mississippi &mdash;<br \/><br \/>some of these last possessed less than nothing<br \/><br \/>did not own their own bodies<br \/><br \/>yet, three centuries later,<br \/><br \/>deep rhythms from Africa,<br \/><br \/>stowed in their hearts, their bones,<br \/><br \/>carry the world&rsquo;s songs.<br \/><br \/>For those who left my county,<br \/><br \/>girls from Downings and the Rosses<br \/><br \/>who followed herring boats north to Shetland<br \/><br \/>gutting the sea&rsquo;s silver as they went<br \/><br \/>or boys from Ranafast who took the Derry boat,<br \/><br \/>who slept over a rope in a bothy,<br \/><br \/>songs were their souls&rsquo; currency<br \/><br \/>the pure metal of their hearts,<br \/><br \/>to be exchanged for other gold,<br \/><br \/>other songs which rang out true and bright<br \/><br \/>when flung down<br \/><br \/>upon the deal boards of their days.<\/blockquote> <p>It is exquisitely poignant, but what it tells us is that when those migrants - and they were migrants - left here, they carried in their heads, their hands and their feet the emotional baggage of a whole country.  When they unpacked it and the Irish songwriters in Tin Pan Alley met people like Irving Berlin, the Irish and the Jews formed the music business.  I emphasise &quot;music business&quot;.  Victor Herbert founded the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, ASCAP, the first collection agency for collecting copyrights on songs.  Not only that, we left an indelible thumbprint on the making of the great American songbook with which America colonised the world.  When I turned on my radio as a 1950s boy in Cork city, I watched the radio heat up, caught the smell of the valves and heard rock and roll coming from the American Forces Network based in Germany.  I was turned on.  I bought a pair of jeans and a harmonica.  I bought into the thing, because where culture goes, commerce follows.  <br\/><br\/>We are beginning to realise that here, little by little. The granular, metric argument does not wash because we are dealing with something priceless.  Ms Hynes alluded to it as well.  We are in a world that has become a little bit more virtual, augmented and artificial.  However, we have something in our bag of imagination that enables us to be tactile, human and engaging in a way that is a very powerful antidote to what I call &quot;the digitally lonely life&quot;; a screen-dominated life.  We have that in spades in this country.  When Members of the Oireachtas talk to Intel and people in DCU, they are beginning to talk about science technology, engineering and maths, STEM, and STEAM.  With the insertion of the A of arts into that acronym, we are looking at something very powerful.<br\/><br\/>Two things are absolutely true.  The arts and what they can deliver are absolutely central to this proposition.  I emphasises that anything that cannot be automated is going to become very valuable.  Second, we have reached a century of independence, and independence by my definition is paying our way in the world in an independent way.  If we do not create the conditions where we grow, own and monetise our own intellectual property, we will never have a real wealth proposition that will address health, housing, education etc.  It is the resource that Ms Hynes refers to, the naturally occurring resource of imagination, that gives us the song, the poem, the film and the Oscar award, and designs the chip that goes into the Intel box.  It is the same thing.<\/p><p>These powerful elements of engagement and empathy are a <i>sine qua non<\/i>to a civilised, independent society.<br\/><br\/>I will conclude by reiterating what Ms Hynes said.  It is shameful that we do not look at this resource and treat it with respect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019012300002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip King","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548250200,"counter":895,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.

A six-day rebellion that ended in their execution and elevation to near-sainthood.  But are they Ireland&rsquo;s greatest heroes?  Is the GPO Ireland&rsquo;s most sacred place?  To me, it represents the birth of a pious, bitter and narrow-minded version of Ireland I couldn&rsquo;t wait to escape.  <br \/><br \/>But there was another version of Ireland, dreamt up by a poet ... His vision was mythical, romantic, truly heroic and beautiful.  That was the Ireland I could never leave behind.<\/blockquote> <p>Both Bob Geldof and Oliver St. John Gogarty agree.  There is no Free State without Yeats, and both imply that Ireland does not exist without the arts.<br\/><br\/>Others have suggested that since the beginning of the 20th century and the founding of our Free State, we swapped British rule for three alternative colonisations: a particular brand of nationalism; a home-grown blend of Catholicism; and the prevailing western culture of scientific realism.  We may agree or disagree but one thing is certain: the 21st century is a cultural tsunami that has hit the whole world and washed away most signposts and values which constituted the western world as we have known it up to now.<br\/><br\/>As we sit here now in Leinster House at the beginning of 2019, when all the &quot;isms&quot; of the previous century have worn thin, where do we go and to whom do we turn for a compass and a guideline on the way towards the future?  It is not for me, or for anyone else for that matter, to provide a justification for art.  Art needs no justification and will survive and endure even where repudiated and persecuted.  The words, supposedly issuing from Nazi Germany, about reaching for a gun whenever the word &quot;culture&quot; is mentioned, have less dramatic and more subtle forms of asphyxiation, which are more regularly applied.<br\/><br\/>In the ten minutes allotted, I will give at least one good reason art in this country must be supported and promoted at all costs.  We cannot leave the future of Ireland to politicians alone.  Our great dilemma is that we are trying to prepare ourselves for a world which we will never be able to forecast.  Only imagination can help us to prepare for the future.  How could any of us who grew up in the 1950s, 1960s or 1970s have prepared ourselves for the world of text, Twitter and tweet?  The future is not something we step into as an already designed space.  The future is ourselves as we choose to become.  The future is alive with possibility to the extent that we are open to change.  Change occurs most profitably in the wake of fundamental shifts in our way of being and these occur mostly because someone has imagined and described them.  Works of art are the first hints we get, and artists are there to harvest possible shapes for the future and to sketch in outline what we might become.<br\/><br\/>The future is in our hands.  Obviously, there are forces working, influences abounding and pressures surrounding, which diminish our autonomy and lessen our responsibility.  However, it is still possible for those of us who live on this island as we approach the third decade of the 21st century to shape our future within the limitations and constrictions which global membership of the universe imposes.  There are many imperatives and considerations which should determine the steps we take, but prominent among these should be the voice of artists and the educating influence of art.  It is not the only factor but it should be a decisive one.  Art can provide an accurate and unflinching cardiograph of the present and a prognosis of possibilities for the future, and politicians and leaders ignore this at their peril.<br\/><br\/>There may have been other times in history when truth was made available through politics, religion or philosophy, but these grand narratives have been found wanting.  Nowadays, we have to rely on sleuths with a keen sense of smell.  Artists are the best trackers that we have got.  Art is a secret logic of the imagination which subverts actual worlds in the name of possible worlds.  The artist may not even be aware of what is happening through their work.  In certain cases he or she is used as a mouthpiece for the psychic secrets of the times in which they live.  Art of the future has no template, no guide and no intellectual categories; it feels its way forward, finding words beyond the vocabulary of any language we currently know how to speak.<br\/><br\/>A dialogue must happen between artists and the rest of us.  Others do not have the sensitivity, the authenticity or the flair for capturing the originality we need but others have to build the future.  We are those others so, in whatever way and to whatever extent is possible, we must become aware of the direction in which the trailblazers are pointing.  That does not mean we all have to be artists.  It does not mean even that we have to appreciate art ourselves.<\/p><p>What it means is that someone has to produce the appropriate work of art and that our sociocultural ambience has to become infused with the understanding that such art inspires so that whatever movement we take forward, whatever way we instigate the future, whatever way we are energised or directed, we must be informed by the spirit of that art that shapes the space which should cleared for us towards the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019012300002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Fr.

Instead, I want to pick up on some of what Ms Hynes and Mr. King said.  I also want to pick up on the submission made to the committee from the National Campaign for the Arts, which seemed to provide an accurate, provocative and helpful analysis of what is to be done on the purely practical level in terms of funding the arts.  I not want to talk about that.  What I want to say is that there is no such thing as the arts.  Nobody ever rushed home from work, threw off their clothes, jumped in the shower, dressed again, grabbed a sandwich and a glass of milk and rushed out to the arts.  They went to the theatre, they went to a concert, they went to a book launch or they went to the opening of an exhibition.  It is important to understand that art takes distinct forms.<br\/><br\/>Nobody can like everything.  One of the difficulties with the way poetry is taught in schools is the poor misfortunates are expected to like everything they see.  I have a passion for hurling.  I appreciate that football is a kind of a sport in its own way but, for me, passion is about hurling.  This does not mean that I think we should break the legs of a football team in order to improve the prospects of a hurling team.  We need to start relaxing about this inherited post-colonial idea of the arts as something that all right-thinking people are in favour of because what follows from that is one does nothing about it.  Art is made by individuals and by collectives of individuals who are driven by a passion for a particular form.  Some people will cross over - backwards and forwards - but that is generally true.  In every estate in this country, in every parish in every small town and every single street in every district, there is somebody learning to play an instrument, there is somebody whose most meaningful moments of the day are when he or she sits down to listen to the music he or she loves, and there is somebody who wants to go to a theatre.<br\/><br\/>I appreciate what Fr. Hederman is saying when he talks about the particular native genius in the imagination of the artist but art is not complete until it meets its audience.  When I make a poem, I send it out into the world and I have no further interest in it.  I do not own it.  If it lodges in somebody's mind and imagination and means something to him or her, then the poem is doing its work.  Without audience, there is no artist.  When we talk about supporting the arts in Ireland, we are not talking about piously making a small allocation towards a few curious individuals who seem to have inexplicable passions for adding words together, adding notes together to make a tune or making lies on a stage in order to tell some kind of truth.  We are talking about all of us together.  One cannot grow a field of wheat by deciding, stalk by stalk, where to apply one's cultivation.  One provides for the entire field.  One trusts chance to see what comes up but, generally, there is a harvest if we are prudent.  The links between culture and agriculture are not accidental.  We have to cultivate ourselves - those of us who have the fortune, or, maybe, the misfortune, to make a life as artists but also those with whom, for whom and towards whom we make our work.  It is absolutely critical to understand that.<br\/><br\/>The Democratic Programme states, &quot;  It shall be the first duty of the Government of the Republic to make provision for the physical, mental and spiritual well-being of the children&quot;.  My father worked in a factory.  My mother, until she married, worked in a factory.  I am the eldest of a very large family.  In the late 1960s, the late Donogh O'Malley went home for the weekend, he sat there and then it dawned on him that everybody should have access to secondary education.  He came in on Monday and called his senior civil servants together and said, &quot;We are introducing free secondary education.&quot;  The folklore is - I am putting this delicately so as not to cause offence to anybody, pensioned or still in employment - that the civil servants went berserk.  They came up with more reasons than Sir Humphrey could imagine about why this could not be done.  When they were finished telling the Minister why it could not be done, he told them to go away and do it.  Donogh O'Malley's answer was akin to Humpty Dumpty's famous remark.  When Alice questioned Humpty Dumpty about the king, he said, &quot;The question is ... which is to be master ...&quot;.  In this democracy, we elect our representatives, Opposition and Government, at the same time to be master, to decide on large matters of public policy and to issue the instruction that they be implemented.<br\/><br\/>When the First D&aacute;il convened, all the sensible people laughed.  One can go back through the newspaper archives.  The realists thought it was hilarious that a bunch of jumped-up culchies, disaffected petit bourgeois and dodgy trade unionists imagined themselves to be the Parliament of a free Ireland.  Guess what?  It was.  It was the first Parliament of a free Ireland and the direct antecedents of the Government in which some of the members serve and of the Government some of which the members hope to be part.  That is where we started.  We imagined ourselves and it went from there.  We imagined a state, which we do not yet have, where all the children of the nation would be cherished.  Having so many thousands of children homeless is not the State we imagine ourselves to live in but we have to work at it.<br\/><br\/>This committee will make a report to the Minister and the Minister will make submissions to Government.  What I hope is that the members' imaginations will be harnessed to this.  The committee has received submissions from distinguished people who know their business and who care passionately about it and who have laboured against all forms of discouragement to open the doors of the imagination to the children of this nation.  They have made poems, they have built art centres, they have built world-famous theatres and they have made television series that have, to the glory of Irish music, gone around the world.  They have done that in the face of what I would call the terrorism of neglect.  The truth is - I hope the committee will say this in its report - that we have chosen to be poor in the service of the imagination.  We have elected to be poor.  This is so much against the grain of who we are supposed to be that there are times when I have looked in the mirror and asked, &quot;Are you mad?&quot;  However, I keep going, Mr. King keeps singing and Ms Hynes keeps making theatre because this is what we do.<br\/><br\/>The members should imagine themselves in that situation and finding that the State that one lives in, the people among whom one lives and the children whom one hopes will follow in one's footsteps are being treated with patronising neglect.  I am sorry to say so but it is patronising to tell us that Ireland's reputational value leans on its artists when the vast majority of those who commit their lives to this path are living in abject poverty.<br\/><br\/>Humpty Dumpty's point was a good question.  Who is to be master?  Master of what?  What do we live for in this country?<\/p><p>Are we just statistics in an economist's nightmares or are we people - people of each other, for each other, by each other, with each other?  We go to funerals and weddings together.  We go to Croke Park and Thomond Park together.  We understand ourselves and, without having to explain it in deep philosophical terms, we understand that we are a people.  What kind of a people are we, though, when we claim the glories of our artists and treat them so shamefully?  The only question that is really important in public life is &quot;Who do we want to be?&quot;  One may imagine objecting to or taking part in the Rising on Easter Monday 1916, and we can all project ourselves back in history and say with the benefit of hindsight that we would have done this, that or the other.  I take a radical but simple view - these were men and women who thought that liberty mattered and that we should be free to imagine ourselves as a free people.  In dribs and drabs, in institutional Ireland down through the years we have made faint stabs at that.  This is a very good moment to again ask, with absolute seriousness, &quot;Who do we want to be?&quot;.  How can we best imagine ourselves in the 21st century, and the 22nd or the 23rd?  What foundations are we prepared to lay for who we can be?<br\/><br\/>There has been a lot of popular history in the past 1,000 years but there is a kernel of truth in it.  Ireland was a <i>lumen mundi<\/i>- a light to the world.  In a line from Brest down through France, Switzerland across as far as Slovenia, one will find Irish placenames, based on centres of learning set up by people who brought their complex cultures across Europe at a time when it was ruled by economists with hatchets, people who knew the price of everything but the value of nothing.  In our modest but real way, we brought a light to the world.<br\/><br\/>The current reflexes towards right-wing populism are spasmodic, knee-jerk reactions to globalisation.  Globalisation aims to remove what is distinct.  It aims to remove things of the mind, heart and soul and turn us into obedient consumers.  It is the logic of the market but we should have the strength of character to think of ourselves differently, as people who value the imagination in business, in commerce, in street sweeping and, above all else, in governance.  This committee has the opportunity to go back to Government and ask how much better it can imagine itself to be, as a Government.  Can it take responsibility for the depth and the wealth of imagination in the Irish people?  These include the child yearning to be able to play the fiddle well enough to be at a Comhaltas session and the young man starstruck at the thought of walking the stage and inhabiting invented characters.  We have to take responsibility for those people.  We have the good fortune to be able to look at practitioners, administrators and artists who have walked this road before us.  It is a resource to be tapped into and only one thing is needed for that to happen, namely, the cultivation of respect.  I would like this committee to propose that the Minister says to Government that it is time we showed respect to those things we profess to value.  We will all be the better for it.<br\/><br\/>I do not know if any members are old enough to remember &quot;Green Acres&quot;.  I remember the character in the programme who got entirely carried away whenever he became passionate about a subject.  It is not my intention to hector or to lecture the committee.  My beloved Paula says that if I were a country, my national anthem would be &quot;Indignation Once Again&quot;.  To a certain extent, I am indignant.  I am indignant about the fact that we have an enormous opportunity to fashion ourselves as a model for the world.  More than that, we could create a hospitable environment for the children of the nation and show we cherish them, not by imagining that everybody can become an artist but by offering them the fruits of our work and the practice of creative imagination as an integral part of their formation as citizens and as people.  We should give these freely, with no foretold outcomes or demands, as a gift to help them disclose their imagination to themselves so that they can go and make what they will of the future.  This committee has a marvellous opportunity, 100 years on from the First D&aacute;il, to drive this back into the heart of a democratic programme for the 21st century.<br\/><br\/>I will end on a slightly dark note.  The RT&Eacute; archives for 1966 contain a record of Ernest Blythe saying that everyone thought of the democratic programme as the hoisting of a flag and that nobody ever meant it to be taken seriously.  On another occasion, the late Deputy Se&aacute;n MacEntee said he did not think the working class would have believed in their bona fides and that, besides, the farmers would not have stood for it.  What would they not have stood for?  Would it have been cherishing children and providing for their health and welfare, both mental and spiritual?  There is a dark way of looking at this, which is to say that the very first D&aacute;il passed a high-sounding programme and then proceeded, fully consciously, to do nothing about it.  That is a cycle that could usefully be broken.<br\/><br\/>I do not have to make an argument for why the arts matter because everybody knows it, apart from a handful journalists who are still affected by post-colonial cringe but I challenge this committee to produce a report that makes the arts matter.  The committee should make a case to Government that makes it impossible not to see why and for whom they matter.  They matter for living children and those yet to be born.  A child was born about 30 seconds ago in the Rotunda Hospital and I would go to that child for a political analysis before I would go to Bob Geldof.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019012300002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Theo Dorgan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548250200,"counter":904,"content":"<p>I thank all four of our guests for their presentations and for their interesting questions.

We must create an environment for a young person participating in Comhaltas for the first time or a potentially great actor treading the boards in a one-act drama in Roscommon, in which they feel at home and in the place they want to be.<\/p><p>As to whether we urgently need to examine the funding structure as currently constituted, I acknowledge that it is underfunded but excellence always seems to win out in terms of the largest portion of that structure.  We seek to support and acknowledge excellence at the top of the pyramid instead of looking at the highways and byways, the school yards or the next Kodaline rehearsing right now in some kid's garage in Limerick.<\/p><p> I know some of the local authority arts officers in the west well.  I know of their knowledge of the arts and their passion for nurturing them.  Every year, and regardless of where they are in the country, they often tell me that they do not have the resources to fertilise and encourage nascent artistic endeavour.  Do we need to invert the pyramid?  Should excellence be able to fund itself?  Should those who might be capable of creating excellence in future be the major recipients of arts funding?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019012300002#F00500","speaker":"1241","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548250200,"counter":909,"content":"<p>Are we taking all of the questions together?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019012300002#G00200","speaker":"1427"},{"type":"speech","time":1548250200,"counter":910,"content":"<p>No.  The Minister of State indicated that he has to-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019012300002#G00300","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1548250200,"counter":911,"content":"<p>I am grateful, as I have to leave.

Local authority spending on the arts has decreased year on year.  This year, it is 27% less than it was last year.  I am not convinced that local authorities are, with sufficient passion and sense of service to their communities, committed to funding and developing the arts.  The local authorities are perhaps a good place to start with cultivating the beginnings of talent.<br\/><br\/>Mr. King and I happened to be on the same iteration of the Arts Council from 2003 to 2009.  Given that the Arts Council was doing a great deal to support emerging artists, one of the first questions we asked was about what we were doing for them after they had taken the council's encouragement, made the leap of faith, declared themselves as artists and committed themselves to the path, at which point we left them high and dry.  It was a way of focusing on the fact that we must provide for the artists, just the makers themselves, from the beginning through to the end of their careers.  It is the voluntary embrace of poverty.  I am sorry to keep harping on about this, but that is the material consequence of electing to assume the life of an artist.  Some few will be lucky - be it because of the <i>zeitgeist<\/i>or the quality of their talent, it is always impossible to say - and become self-sustaining.  The fact that there are a small handful of artists who are self-sustaining can often serve to mask the fact, and the value, of investment across the board.<br\/><br\/>We are in thrall to defective economic thinking, so we want to know the outcome before we make an investment, but a hurling, rugby and camogie team cannot be built like that.  At some point, we have to make a leap of faith, and investment in the arts is a leap of faith.  We cannot tell in any one instance whether an investment will be returned, but we can say that, financially and using all other metrics, it will be returned from across the sector.<br\/><br\/>If we are to fund the arts, we must do it on a radically democratic basis.  We must make it as available as possible to the largest number of people and not attempt to secure premature guarantees of the outcome.  However, the Minister of State is right that there can be an excessive focus on excellence, but that raises a difficult question.  If someone is really good and has an international reputation but is not making a living and cannot afford VHI - the majority of artists cannot afford private health insurance - do we stop sustaining that person?  Using the metaphor of the field of wheat, one must cultivate the whole field.  If some shoots do better than others, that is the luck of the draw, genetics or whatever.<br\/><br\/>On the practical side, and as imperfect as it is, the Arts Council is not an anonymous arts agency, not least because it employs peer review for much of its considerations in terms of individual artists.  It is not a bad mechanism and it has the virtue of at least not attempting to produce regime art or harness prematurely the outcome of a work of artistic creation for the purposes of political propaganda.  It places faith in people's maturity, intelligence and moral probity.  That is a good thing, but it need not be the only model of support.  In many sectors, the powers of local authorities have diminished simply by choking off central funding to them.  Does one go to an impersonal bank or one's local credit union for a loan?  Especially for people at the beginning who are tentative or intend to become accomplished but remain amateurs in their lives - I use the word &quot;amateurs&quot; in its etymological sense, that is, lovers of something rather than people who are less good than professionals - it would be better to go local, for their local authorities to fund them and for local authorities to have far more funding for scholarships, sessions, schools and every aspect of art support.  However, that has to come from central government and would require a revolution of a kind none of us here wants to see, with local authorities wandering around like so many medieval barons levying their own incomes as it pleased them.  It comes back to the same question that legislators face when considering national level funding for the arts - how much are we prepared to put our political weight behind adequate programmes of funding?<br\/><br\/>For many years, the Arts Council has attempted to build partnerships with local authorities, but it is not in a position to fund the authorities.  Some of them have performed miracles with the funds at their disposal while others have been lethargic, but how are they to make these decisions without funding?  It is like deciding which child will be allowed to die.  If their central funding is earmarked - I do not know, as I have not thought it through to that level - and increased and there is an incentive to develop arts supports programmes, local authorities have an important role to play.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019012300002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Theo Dorgan"},{"type":"speech","time":1548250200,"counter":914,"content":"<p>If none of our other guests wishes to comment, I will turn to Deputy Niamh Smyth.

We have proved ourselves in recent months to be worthy members of that Union but the funding must be increased.  It must stop being something that is done after everything else is done.  It has to stop being at the root of arguments whereby people ask how we can increase funding for the arts when people are waiting for houses, hospital beds and so on.

Ms Hynes spoke eloquently in Dublin Castle recently at an event organised by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to celebrate 100 years of the diplomatic service and to discuss Ireland 2025, under which we want to increase our influence and our global footprint.  It is a statement of intent by the Government.  How do we make ourselves audible and visible?  If we are not audible and visible, we will not be considerable and will not be a consideration.<\/p> <p>  On the question of STEM and STEAM and the insertion of the arts, we must have an all-of-Government approach.  I spoke to a person involved in tourism about a project in which I was involved.  I was asked how many bed nights it would generate.  The yardstick by which things are being judged is in terms of a granular outcome.  I understand that when public money is involved, one must justify the investment but that is not replenishing a resource.  Finance needs to talk to arts, arts needs to talk to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and so on.  Everyone needs to talk to each other and to leave behind the silo mentality that sees the arts as the responsibility of only one Department.  It has gone beyond that.<\/p> <p>  As I alluded to earlier, we have a significant national resource which is not being minded, husbanded or tended properly.  One can talk about the human dimension in terms of healthcare and all of the usual things to which every citizen has right.  However, we are making a hugely valuable contribution in a world that is more digital, more virtual and more artificial.  It is a national resource, which puts us on the map and makes us audible, visible and considerable.  It is both criminal and shameful not to invest in this resource.  This committee, as our representative, must take that message to the heart of Government.  We are not asking members to do that for us.

It is a real privilege to be here today.  I was told not to become a member of this committee because there are no votes in it.  That in itself is very telling.  This is my first time on the arts committee, which raises another question.  This committee used to be called arts and sport.  Then it became arts and tourism followed by culture, heritage and the Gaeltacht.  We refuse, within the arts, to name the cats.  We will not name what we are speaking about.  It has become globalised and amalgamated into something called culture.  There is nothing wrong with culture, heritage or the Gaeltacht.  Equally, there is nothing wrong with sport or tourism.  Arts is all right if it is connected with tourism or the economy but on its own, we are not too sure.  The arts cannot stand as an independent cat.<\/p><p>We lost out politically, in the first instance, that it is not an independent cat, sitting there with all the radii of its own circle and not attached to something here, there and everywhere.<\/p><p> It was interesting at the D&aacute;il100 celebration the other day that what moved the audience and the point at which one could hear a pin drop was \"The Coolin\" played on the violin and the O'Carolan piece played on the harp.  It brought everybody right back to their stomach.  It raises the point that the expressive arts, creativity and imagination are important regardless of whether someone takes them up.  As a performer, it is important for well-being and not feeling useless.  <\/p><p> I wrote a study on bereavement and death in Ireland and whether we do dying well.  We do it well ritualistically but we are sometimes not good on grief.  Arts people are turned to all the time for the language of grief, to go somewhere when life became meaningless or valueless.  That is true for young people, not necessarily as performers, but somewhere to fill up.<\/p><p> Ireland has a politics that says it is all right to give 25 points to mathematics in the leaving certificate but it is not all right to give points to an imaginative passion or creativity like visual arts, dance, theatre, literature, poetry or spoken art, which is completely neglected, or music.  We do not think that is a good thing.  A good place to start would be to allow young people find a way through communication.<\/p><p> We are also fighting hedges and birds here.  We should not fight those issues even on this committee because we will not name the cat.  First, we should restore the performing and expressive arts and the creativity and imagination of that radii to its own Department which makes its own decisions and is not messing around in trying to balance.<\/p><p> I could go on about the full meaning of imagination.  I could go on about Palestine.  I could go on about how the arts is above politics, territory and the Kalashnikov.  We could replace the Kalashnikov with the expressive arts.  Let us consider the East-Western Divan Orchestra of Mr. Daniel Barenboim, or El Sistema, or Sing Out With Strings.  I think of the way the performing arts have elevated people in the worst situations and it is sometimes the only way through when politics has completely let people down.<\/p><p> In Europe, I rarely see the Commissioner for Arts or the Commissioner for Culture or Heritage standing in front of the flags.  It is always the bloody economist, or the banker, or the insurance man who is telling us how things should be in front of the waving flags in Europe.  We need better speakers and, whether the Government appoints people such as the witnesses, or appoints them internally, we need greater vocalness about it.  I ask the witnesses their opinions of what I have said.<\/p><p> One of the problems with national theatre is, as Mr. Hederman said, akin to a cardiograph or a pulse.  That pulse or rhythm has been lost.  Did we lose that because we have no training school there?  What is wrong there and, without being political, what can we do to fix that?  Is that Arts Council vocal enough?  That is not a political question either.  Do the witnesses think we are not being vocal enough?<\/p><p> I saw from my work on dying, death and bereavement that people thought those issues had only to do with health when it had to do with travel, the arts and education.  This is across all Departments.  Every Minister should have a fool, like in \"King Lear\", to tell them that a certain route is not the right way to go.  There should be an artist sitting in every Department who will say that there is a way forward and a communication level here.  My basic point is that we must go back to having an independent creative arts Department that is not a part of something else.  We must make the arts - music, drama, theatre, poetry, dance, spoken art - a subject, or rather a discipline, capable of its own independence within education and its own passion within the leaving certificate points system so people can do it for themselves as well as for practicality.<\/p><p> I have made a speech because I am so delighted to have the witnesses present.  I always felt the words \"elevation\" and \"joy\" around the arts.  If I am looking for the truth, I will not go to the press, the TV, the radio or politics, I will watch theatre, or listen to a piece of music, or read a poem, or listen to what Mr. Hederman has to say because I am elevated and brought somewhere by them, both in pain and in joy.  There is a truth in what is being said and we are missing that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019012300002#H01300","speaker":"1427","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548250200,"counter":931,"content":"<p>I rather like the Senator's idea that we should have a Ministry of the national imagination but I can just see the reaction in some quarters in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to an announcement that we are going to have a Minister for the Imagination.  I, of course, completely agree with the Senator in substance.<\/p> <p>  I would like, for a moment, to go back to Deputy Smyth's question about practicalities.  The committee would hardly expect us to come up with a programme of investment and a blueprint for how money is to be spent.  The crucial change that is needed is to shift from a mindset that money is given or granted to the arts to a firm and unshakable understanding that we are talking about investment.  If the collectivity of arts activity in this country was to be brought together under a shareholders' offering and offered on the market, as it were, as a business, we would be beating off investors.  <\/p> <p>  I agree with Mr. King that, when the Indecon report came out, everybody thought salvation was coming without reckoning with the Department of Finance and its absolute inability to grasp the concept of investment.  In 1968, the Arts Council grant-in-aid was &euro;68 million, &euro;47 million of which directly came back from arts organisations funded in PAYE, PRSI and VAT.  The return to the economy from the &euro;21 million of investment was &euro;147 million directly attributable to those organisations.  If someone gave me &euro;21 and, at the end of the year, I gave them &euro;147 back, is it not the height of foolishness to give me &euro;19 next year?  If the situation was reversed, I would give that person &euro;42 the following year if I had it.  We need to understand this is investment in an enormous collectivity of entrepreneurs.  We fetishise the quality of the entrepreneur in this country but, in fact, every artist, theatre company and arts centre is an entrepreneurial enterprise.<\/p> <p>  I want to turn again from the idea that we want to somehow emphasise the special position or privileges, or notional privileges, of the individual artist.  I want to look at all of us.  The population of our Republic is 8,000 people more than the population of metropolitan Boston.  The population of the metropolitan area of Boston is 4.6 million and we are something like 4.68 million at the moment.  There is no comparison between the reputational value accruing to the State of Ireland from the work of its artists to that which comes out of Boston.  I cannot, off the top of my head, think of a world-renowned figure from Boston and I could keep us here all day talking about the quality of Irish artists of considerable worldwide achievement.  We should not be asked to demonstrate the value of what we do any longer.  We should not be going, cap in hand, as it were, to ask for a dig out and for more to do what we do.  We should turn the question around and ask who we want to be, as a proud people.  What do we do, in the 21st century, for meaning in a post-religious, polyvalent culture with people from all over the world joining us in citizenship and bringing the streams of their inheritances to bear?<\/p><p>I can tell the committee there is a generation of new Irish poets coming through who will blow the minds of committee members.  I am beginning to see these seeds coming through.<\/p><p> This is a new Ireland.  This is a country with a proud history but a shameful reputation in being proud of itself and in cherishing one another.  That is true.  There are deep elements of shame in how we treat many of our citizens.  Yet, we do not have to be like that.  One hundred years ago, who would have said that the little island of Ireland could set in train the dissolution of the biggest empire the world had ever seen?  Anyone suggesting that would have been told they were insane even to think about it, but we imagined it otherwise.  That is my recurrent question.  If we can imagine ourselves as bigger and better and filled with right pride &ndash; not grandiosity but actual pride - in ourselves and in one another, then what would we not do for one another?  This will involve material resources but it also involves a commitment to changing a mindset that does not believe in supporting the arts in schools.  Who has that mindset?  The people of Ireland believe in doing so.  I am asking about those making the decisions.  If I go into a secondary school in this country and ask people whether they would rather economics or music, can members guess what the answer would be?  We all know what the answer would be.

In 2001, the Golden Gate University in San Francisco held a festival of Irish writing organised by our consul general.  After the first session, he turned to me and I said there were 22 chief executives of Silicon Valley companies in the audience with whom he had been trying to get meetings for six months.  He could not get meetings with them for six months but they all turned up to hear poets and novelists speak.  One of the people present was Chelsea Clinton.  Chelsea was there because she was then a student of the poet Eavan Boland, who has done so much to open access to poetry for Irish women.  I had just edited an anthology of Irish poetry and I gave a copy to Chelsea.  Two days later I was in the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington D.C. because I was presenting a programme of Irish writers.  Jean Kennedy Smith told me there that the book I had given to Chelsea was on Bill's desk.  In one weekend, drawn purely by the arts, we had a presence on the desk of the President of the United States as well as before 22 chief executives of Silicon Valley companies.  I came away inspired.  I remember saying to the ambassador in Washington that every Enterprise Ireland delegation that comes out there should have as the keynote of its mission an arts event, a performance of a play, a concert of music or a poetry reading.  They should harness what Mr. King has aptly called \"soft power\" and work in conjunction with those in the arts.<\/p> <p>  The Senator said that the Departments should be working together &ndash; of course they should.  There should be no trade delegation anywhere in the world that is not linked to a high-profile cultural event.  It is a simple proposition.  Trust me: it works.  When President Higgins went on a state visit to China and he presented the President of China with an edition of W.B. Yeats's poems translated into Chinese, the man took President Higgins's two arms in his two hands and said it was the most meaningful gift his people had ever been given by a Head of State.  When President Higgins made a state visit to Athens in February, he presented a beautiful volume, printed by Stoney Road Press, that included two of his poems translated into Greek.  That was his gift to the President of Greece.  I was there and the Greek President had tears in his eyes and said it meant so much.

Let us consider one small thing: \"Waiting for Godot\" by Samuel Beckett.  We made that piece of theatre two years ago.  It played in our theatre in Galway, which seats 100 people.  It played for two weeks.  Luckily, it was not enough.  Everyone else wanted to see it.  The arithmetic of that made no sense whatsoever.  It requires a subsidy of &euro;40 to &euro;50 per seat for Irish people to see it.  If that was where it had ended, that would be simply an example of why subsidy is required in the making of theatre, but that was not where it ended.  The last performances were at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts to an audience of 700 or 800, who were all guests of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  They included heads of mission to the United Nations from all over the world.  They were there as part of the process whereby the Department was attempting to gain a seat on the UN Security Council.  It is precisely the same point.<\/p> <p>  I wish to address the Senator's remarks about the problems at the Abbey.  It is a problem that I am, unfortunately, only too aware of having been artistic director there over 30 years ago.  I thought long about this during my time there and I have thought about it subsequently.  Essentially, it is a problem of governance.<\/p><p>The board of the Abbey must lay down narrative and agree a purpose, role and function with the major stakeholders, including the Minister, the Arts Council and various other bodies.  Once that is done, it will be the context in which the artistic directors are appointable and to which they are held accountable.  It is crucial that the Abbey has sectoral responsibilities, which is why the letter was such a bombshell last week.  As it receives 50% of the performing arts funding in this country, it has sectoral responsibilities over and above other organisations in training, development, health and what it pays people, and it must be part of the narrative of governance of the organisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019012300002#K01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Garry Hynes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548250200,"counter":943,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for allowing me to join the committee.  It is not my usual committee and I thank the members for accommodating me.  I thank the witnesses for their wonderful presentations and for the work they do all the time.<\/p><p>I will pick up on one aspect of the bigger picture before moving to more specific aspects.  The analogy of agriculture which was given could be built on further if we look past agriculture to the ecosystem.  When we think about the arts, it is important that we do not focus on the predictable outcome, the tallest tree in the forest or the one with the sweetest fruit because it may well be that excellence may not be in a form that will be financially rewarded or even politically or socially welcomed.  Rather, we must recognise all of those parts.  It was described eloquently in terms of the experiences of every person who touches in on an exhibition, sends a picture of his or her classroom, goes to a show, is moved by something somewhere, reads something written on a bench or whatever it is.  The full picture of the community creates an ecosystem of creativity, imagination and culture.  The dividends for that are immense but they are hard to understand.  The one idea I would quibble with is that of the entrepreneur because the benefit can be isolated.  We need to see that the benefit often arises elsewhere.  We know the significant financial dividends to be gained from the arts that have been described, and we know about them in areas such as tourism.  <\/p><p>The case of proposition E, which was recently passed in San Francisco, is an interesting flip of the bed night analogy.  A levy on bed nights was put into a general fund for public art because the environment generally created by art in the city was recognised.  It was interesting although I know we need direct central funding as well as that kind of levy.  The benefit is also seen in science, creative thinking, relationships and difficult conversations, such as in the Magdalen laundries, where many tough issues did not come through until they were faced and confronted through the arts.  <\/p><p>It also makes for better politics.  The international power and considerable impact Ireland has through the arts, as well as how we have made our mark in our founding moments and in presenting ourselves to the world, were eloquently described, but it is important to note that power is also recognised in the inverse.  Around the world, when we see bad politics and the rise of authoritarianism, the arts are one of the first areas to be restricted.  During the dictatorship in Brazil, the first thing to be banned was a little instrument, based on a turtle shell, which was used in folk music.  Paulo Freire, Augusto Baol and others created the Theatre of the Oppressed, as part of what is targeted by those who wish to curtail the imagination.  At this time, when many resources are being focused on a narrowing of perspectives and the cultivation of fear, connections that challenge through the arts rather than divisions are immensely important, globally necessary and possible.  <\/p><p>On a practical note, like others I come from Theatre Forum.  I arrived late to the meeting of the committee because I was speaking at Theatre Forum's annual meeting.  I was reminded of Pirandello's <i>Six Characters in Search of an Author<\/i>, which expressed the idea that actors and performers are often treated like their characters, and that artists come into a glorious bloom when they are needed for special occasions but then disappear between those occasions.  While we have described the importance of the arts for full humanity in a society, we must also recognise the full human lives of artists.  This is about an increase in funding, as was said clearly, but it is also about how the funding is spent.  There is something to be said for examining how we do our procurement and contracts in order that employment is strongly considered from the beginning.  Local authority funding was mentioned.  The centres and venues, which are a great resource, need to be resourced further to allow them to become sustained employers.  Will the witnesses comment on that and on how we can build in progression?  Artists in Ireland move between employers very often.  How is it charted that artists move up rather than start again with each new scheme and project, that progression is built in, and that a pay scale that works across the sector rather than just within one institution?<\/p><p>On social protection, I know there is controversy about the scheme.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection and I await the report of the culture committee to bring it before the social protection committee.  Within the social protection system, there is a deep lack of understanding of what it means to craft a life in the arts.  It can be quite punitive for artists, who often live in fear and scrutiny.  While the social protection system should not be a safety net, reward or hand-out, it should be a recognition of the contribution everybody makes and one of our mechanisms of redistribution for the public good.  <\/p><p>There is not much time remaining but if the witnesses have any thoughts that I could bring back to my committee, I welcome them.  Otherwise, I am happy to follow up separately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019012300002#L00200","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548250200,"counter":944,"content":"<p>What the Senator has articulated is very pertinent.

The questions the Senator asked are important and we should address them in whatever way we possibly can, in our own work, which, I hope, we are doing, and as part of the various fora.  We need to make the various organisations, such as the Arts Council, decide that while it is critical that artists make art that we think they should make, such as art for children or people who live in remote areas, as Druid Theatre does, it is also critical that we fund artists in order that the individual actor or maker of art does not suffer.

If I have had a lousy day or if I am in tears, or whatever, I will go home and lash it out on the guitar or sing, as I always have done.  I would probably die without it.  The difference is that if I was still working on the road, I would either have moved to America or I would be living at home.  That is the benefit of working in here on a good wage compared to friends who live at home.  I cannot separate the arts and the struggle of artists from housing in this city.<\/p> <p>  I wanted to make a point on the local authorities, which I believe should have a bigger role.  At the moment they have a similar budget to the Arts Council as a whole, if one counts up the spend across all local authorities.  However, the disparity in spend is troubling and ranges from &euro;18 per head of population to 50 cent per head.  There are inequalities that need to be addressed, and I do not see this as a threat to Arts Council funding.<\/p> <p>  What are the witnesses' views of the neoliberal mindset?  CSO statistics last year stated that artists were earning 3.5% less in quarter 1 of 2018 than in 2013, and in 2013 Arts Council funding was &euro;60 million.  We could throw 25% more money at the Arts Council or the local authorities but wages might not go up.  The conversation around the Abbey Theatre should be a trigger.  Where the State is involved, we should expect the highest standards.  That is what I took from Ms Hynes's comments.  I struggle to believe wages will go up unless we make interventions on wages alone.<\/p> <p>  I wanted to get into the nitty-gritty of art forms, two of which I know well - film, which I studied in GMIT, and music, which I know from life in general.  Mr. King mentioned that Austin wanted to keep music at the heart of the town.  I was at an event the other night organised by Give Us The Night, a campaign around licensing laws and venues.  Many venues, particularly queer spaces where I would dance, are closing and while hotels are being thrown up and the Hard Rock Cafe is due to open next year, we are losing places to dance.  The campaign approached the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and tried to make a case around the culture of the night, but we were told: \"That is not our responsibility.  It is a justice issue.\"<\/p> <p>  Some of the campaign's ideas are around staggered opening hours and closing times, places to go and public transport home.  It got me thinking around a different idea we have, which IMRO has called for over some time, that is, a music strategy for Ireland.  This is something to run with now because by the time Creative Ireland has had its day, in 2022, we should have certain strategies in place, and a music strategy is one of them.  I would be reluctant to get involved in arts forms specifically and the Arts Council should play that role.  However, I believe music has its place in all of our art forms.  Where does Mr. King see the sector, the music industry and emerging artists going?  Does he see the need for a music office as a one-stop shop for young or emerging artists?  Where does he see the infrastructure of music?  Royalties online is obviously a huge issue.  Spotify is good compared to YouTube but people would still be left waiting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019012300002#M00400","speaker":"1372"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548250200,"counter":951,"content":"<p>The model of the music industry at the moment is a very difficult model for any artist and for anybody creating intellectual property.  On the one hand, very large record companies, like Universal, when signing an artist will sign them to what they call a 360 deal, which means they will advance some money in the form of a loan in return for the recording rights and the publishing rights, but they will also attach gigging income to the 360 deal because they deem that, by promoting the artist, they have made the artist commercially viable and they want a kick-back from the gig receipts.  When I started out in music, an artist released a record and then went on the road to promote the record.  Now, it is entirely the other way around, and the artist puts out a record to promote the tour, and their only income is from those places.  It is a very different world.<\/p> <p>  There are various different organisations that do extremely good work and it would be very good if they all came together.  The mission of the Other Voices model is to celebrate what is about to happen and to give a platform to the generation of musicians who will be the musicians of the future.

It does not recognise rock and roll either, which is quite odd.  Therefore, when an artist is looking for funding and goes to the Arts Council, there is no subhead under which a rock and roll artist can say, \"This is what I do\", because it has no box for that.

It is magical thinking but, leaving aside and understanding the social welfare aspects and thinking of the artist first, not the building, as Garry Hynes said, because we preserve buildings before people, what radical thing might our four guests do or suggest if they were the Minister of an independent Department, which is the first place we should go?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019012300002#N00400","speaker":"1427"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548250200,"counter":959,"content":"<p>To lighten the atmosphere a little around here, I would begin each session of the Seanad and D&aacute;il with a poem and conclude it with a piece of original composed music.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019012300002#N00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Theo Dorgan"},{"type":"speech","time":1548250200,"counter":960,"content":"<p>That is very good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019012300002#N00600","speaker":"1427"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548250200,"counter":961,"content":"<p>Instead of being a silo Department, isolated and called the Department of arts, it would be essential to have buy-in across the Government that would be inter and intra departmental.

There are two items of information which the witnesses might enjoy and which the members should take on board.  Next week, representatives of the Abbey Theatre, some of the people who wrote the letter and representatives of the Arts Council will appear before the committee because it is so important.  It will not be to delve into the specifics but, as Garry Hynes said, to deal with the overarching issue of how we got to this position and how we can get out of it.  It is not necessary to be always argumentative.  Hopefully, members of the committee will benefit from that.  Others will probably attend to give their tuppence worth.<\/p> <p>  The other item, which is interesting, is that every year there is an arts budget and the Minister must appear before the committee.  The Minister will appear before the committee with the Estimates on 6 March next.  The information the witnesses have given us arms us to argue with her that the budget presented is not strong enough to deliver on policies that have been presented to the people.  Platitudes have been given to the arts over the years but one should put the money where one's mouth is or one's mouth where the money is.  I do not know which applies in this context.  There was some talk about the cost-benefit analysis.  That is the first question for every investment.  That has been shown and proven so there is no need for us to continue that argument.<\/p><p>That is an argument that prevailed in the current climate.  I ask Fr. Hederman to elaborate on his point that there are many imperatives and considerations which should determine what steps we take to shape the future.  He said that prominent among those should be the voices of artists, about which there is no doubt.  He referred also to the educating influence of art.  Mr. Dorgan and perhaps Mr. King alluded to the fact that this is a small country on the edge of the world.  While we have had a huge influence, it seems that in future the world will be more technologically structured.  To do that, the world needs artists and people with imagination.  We would not have all the new gadgets we have, on which kids are sometimes stuck, if someone had not imagined.  Unless we value imagination, which is a hard thing to quantify, and educate the influence, it will affect everything that is happening in technology in future.  Art or imagination is stuck in there somewhere which is important.  How do we get that across?<\/p><p> Some people know about the influences on me of artists and everything to do with the arts.  I have known many artists over the years and I note the bravery and courage of those artists who seek to reflect their imagination, interpretation of the world and music and so on to eke out a living.  It is literally an eking out.  I have seen people in absolutely dire straits saved by other artists who have managed to be a little bit better off.  The vast majority of artists in this country have not made a living from art alone.  That is the biggest scandal considering what the witnesses have said about the influence of Irish artists on art around the world and on our standing in the world.  That is an economic contribution as well as on our standing as people.  If there is anything in what I said to which the witnesses wish to respond, I ask them to fire away.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019012300002#N02300","speaker":"1235","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548250200,"counter":979,"content":"<p>I agree with every word the Chairman said, really.

The Chairman referred to technology and the all pervasive screen life, the antidote to which will be in the human tactile and visceral engagement enabled by art and its humanising quality.  It is something that will differentiate Ireland's offering to the world and its own people.  Of that, there is no doubt.  At the risk of repeating myself, we are looking a gift horse in the mouth.  We have the resource.  Other societies and places in the world would kill for what we have but we take it for granted that it is there and will tip away.

I spent 20 years in local radio at Shannonside Northern Sound, which Deputy Niamh Smyth will know very well.

I will outline their roles.  Ms &Aacute;ine Stapleton is assistant secretary for corporate affairs, Ms Aoife O'Grady is head of corporate support and communications and Ms Jane Lawlor works with Ms O'Grady on the issue of governance co-ordination.  Mr. Ray O'Leary and Mr. Kenneth Spratt are members of our management board.  Mr. O'Leary chairs our risk committee and Mr. Spratt is chair of our governance committee and a member of our internal audit committee.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to speak on the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport's corporate governance framework.  The Department has a wide remit with high level goals in its statement of strategy covering public transport investment and regulation, roads and road safety, aviation, maritime transport, tourism and sport with an annual budget of &euro;2.3 billion.  Good governance is essential to the effective operation of a Department of this complexity and breadth.  The arrangements in place help to provide assurance to me, in my role as Secretary General and as Accounting Officer, that we are effectively discharging our responsibilities.<\/p> <p>  I will begin by focusing on the departmental arrangements.  While Civil Service Departments have always valued strong governance, a greater focus on formalising our arrangements has its origins in a 2014 initiative, Strengthening Civil Service Accountability and Performance.  That paper recommended a written governance framework as a platform for strengthening the overall management of Government Departments.  This concept was incorporated into the 2014 Civil Service renewal plan which, in Action 3, committed to a common Civil Service Government standard.  Our corporate governance arrangements for the Department are, therefore, grounded in the corporate governance standard for the Civil Service which was led by the Civil Service management board as part of its implementation of the renewal plan.<\/p> <p>  Chapter 1 of our framework document frames our overall activities by setting out a general overview of the Department's structures, ethos and strategy.  It sets out our mission statement which is to shape the safe and sustainable development of transport, tourism and sport, and to support economic growth and social progress.<\/p><p> Chapter 2 defines the roles and responsibilities of ministerial and senior management staff, the Department&rsquo;s relationship with the Minister and the Minister for State and provides an overview of senior management governance roles and responsibilities.  The chapter also looks at how responsibility is assigned to officers of the Department for the performance of functions under the Public Service Management Act 1997. <\/p><p> Chapter 3 sets out the primary management structures within the Department to provide a means to develop it&rsquo;s capacity, including the capabilities of the leadership team, management and staff.<\/p><p> Chapter 4 details the mechanisms through which the Department ensures risk and performance are adequately managed through robust internal control systems and effective performance management practices.<\/p><p> Chapter 5 details the Department's relationship with the 24 agencies under its aegis and provides an overview of the approach applied to external governance and oversight.  In engaging with stakeholders the Department strives for openness, transparency and accountability which are delivered through our robust governance structures and the relationship we have in place with our agencies. <\/p><p> With a view to continuous improvement of its overall performance, including a desire to strengthen its approach to governance and improve its strategic focus, I recommended that the Department participate in the pilot organisational capability review, OCR, in 2017 under the Civil Service renewal programme.  It was a valuable exercise which led to the development of an action plan in January 2018, aligned with four pillars, namely, investing in our team; communication and integrated working; stronger strategic focus; and policy implementation.  A key part of ensuring effective delivery of the four pillars involved reorganising internal structures to provide for strategic leadership and ownership at both management board and divisional level as implementation commenced.  The changes were implemented to strengthen all areas of governance and demonstrate our commitment through a range of actions.  In January 2018 I centralised the corporate and policy co-ordination functions under a new assistant secretary post to give a stronger strategic focus to our corporate affairs and policy co-ordination.  This reconfiguring of all corporate functions within the remit of one assistant secretary provides overarching responsibility for the Department&rsquo;s governance structures.  It included creating a dedicated governance division, which deals not only with the Department&rsquo;s overall governance requirements but also the oversight of the 24 agencies under the aegis of the Department.  The centralising of the governance role has provided for consistency throughout the Department, with a central contact point to manage governance requirements and oversight of the governance structures in place.  I am confident that the revised arrangements, together with structural changes made earlier last year, will help to bring a clearer focus to the successful delivery of the Department&rsquo;s business objectives.  The reconfiguration of the corporate functions is central to it by providing the Department and all staff with the necessary support to deliver to the highest standards.<\/p><p> In addition, the introduction of new structures has allowed for the consideration and refinement of implementation actions by heads of function, HoF, through the newly established HoF forum.  As part of this structural change, my management board colleagues and I gave approval for the establishment of a governance committee to oversee and advise us on the ongoing development of a good practice governance framework for the Department; the arrangements to ensure compliance with the Department&rsquo;s corporate obligations; the implementation of the framework for the governance of State agencies within the remit of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport; and the liaison arrangements with the risk management committee and audit committee on an ongoing basis.  This structure has worked very well in providing additional governance support for the management board and is underpinned by a governance calendar which records all governance requirements across the Department in ensuring the meeting of corporate obligations and the extent to which they are being met in accordance with an agreed calendar of activities.<\/p><p> The management board continues to play a central role in overseeing the governance structures in place.  It includes but is not limited to engaging in business planning with each sector to ensure our high level goals are being carried into annual business planning and that good progress is being made in their implementation; reviewing on an annual basis the Department&rsquo;s&rsquo; corporate governance framework; keeping under review the governance arrangements in place with the commercial State agencies under the aegis of the Department; keeping under review the governance arrangements in place with the non-commercial State agencies under the aegis of the Department.  Given the broad remit of the Department and the diverse range of functions carried out through the 24 agencies, strong corporate governance measures for our agencies are essential building blocks in our overall governance structures and procedures.  The approach to the governance of our agencies takes account of the Civil Service framework and is also grounded in the revised code of practice for the governance of State bodies which was published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in 2016.  It is the principal framework for best practice governance arrangements applicable to commercial and non-commercial State bodies.  It is intended to take account of developments in oversight arrangements, with the parent Department and internal practices of the State body including reporting requirements and the appointment of board members.<\/p><p> In March 2018 we adopted a new framework document for the Department&rsquo;s oversight of the governance of both commercial and non-commercial State bodies.  The core objective of the document was to establish the means by which the Department as a whole would oversee the governance of its State bodies and how I, as Accounting Officer, and the wider management board could be assured on compliance by our State bodies with the revised 2016 code of practice.  The framework assists with strong governance in a number of respects.  It provides guidance for all stakeholders on the Government&rsquo;s current objectives for State bodies and their subsidiaries and enables us to maintain a consistent and structured approach to governance.  It clearly defines the Department&rsquo;s relationship with State bodies and the mechanisms to monitor output, outcomes and performance.  The document also outlines the roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders in keeping with the governing legislation for the State bodies involved.  To ensure consistency and quality in terms of outputs, the Department has provided templates for shareholder expectation letters, performance delivery agreements, oversight agreements and a compliance checklist to be filled in by the State body and returned with the chairperson&rsquo;s comprehensive report each year.  Implementation of these arrangements is reported to the management board, with follow-up actions taken to deal with outstanding issues.<\/p><p> I have also put new arrangements in place to give the management board a stronger role in assessing requests from our non-commercial agencies for additional staffing to ensure a stronger whole of sector approach is taken to such issues.  Good governance is, of course, not just a theoretical framework but is intended to lead to better outputs for the Department and its agencies.  The corporate governance arrangements in place play an important role in helping us to achieve our goals and objectives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019012300002#D01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Graham Doyle","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548250200,"counter":1017,"content":"<p>I propose that we proceed with questions in our usual manner, starting with representatives of Fine Gael, to be followed by the representatives of Fianna F&aacute;il of Sinn F&eacute;in and then independent members and members of other parties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019012300002#E00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1548250200,"counter":1018,"content":"<p>Mr. Doyle is most welcome.

It shows professionalism in the Department, which I welcome.  Corporate governance incorporates rules, practices and processes.  It is a balancing act between the many stakeholders involved.  There are the shareholders which include the Government, the management team or departmental officials and customers or the community.  It is welcome that this is happening and that we are five years into the process.  I suspect a strong private sector influence as I have noticed how many Departments have good knowledge.  I am pleased to see people coming from private sector and that there is balance.  I see this at the committees on which I sit, including this one and the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  People have come from the banking sector and bring a valuable approach.  It is the way forward.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Doyle referred to the creation of \"a dedicated governance division which deals not only with the Department&rsquo;s overall governance requirements but also with the oversight of the 24 agencies under its aegis.\"  The Department has a huge number of agencies under its aegis.  How did it come to this?  Was outside help looked for from other agencies or did the Department look internationally to see how it was managed in other countries?  Our membership of the European Union has been very important.  Germany and other countries adopt different approaches.  Are there other countries - I refer to other small countries such as New Zealand - at which the Department has looked?  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Doyle said the framework \"clearly defines the Department&rsquo;s relationship with the State bodies and the mechanisms to monitor output, outcomes and performance.\"  That is welcome as everyone should be held to account.  <\/p> <p>  I wish Mr. Doyle well in the future.

I thank Senator Feighan for his comments.  As we look at the rules and practices around governance, it is very much a balancing act across all stakeholders and agencies, and most important, whoever is the client ultimately, that is, the citizen, the taxpayer and person living in the State.  Balancing those is a critical part when look at how what we do at a departmental level influences what our agencies do.<\/p> <p>  The Senator is right that there is a far greater private sector influence in the public sector as we look, for example, across the renewal programme in the Civil Service.  The Senator spoke of people from the private sector coming into government, and he qualified it quickly by acknowledging the work of civil servants.  I came from the private sector.  I am a chartered accountant by profession.  I came into the Department at assistant secretary level about five years ago and then took over the Secretary General role.  We see some of those influences happening.  It is interesting to come into it from outside the system as someone who had a long career in the private sector and to see how thinking is changing regularly.  I worked for PricewaterhouseCoopers for a long time.  I was on secondment to the Department, which was a forerunner to this Department, back in 2004-2005.  It is very interesting to come back and see the changes that have taken place over the period since then.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked about other external influences in how we deal with governance, managing agencies and so on.  One significant change we have made in the past 12 months is that we have come to a memorandum of understanding, or terms of reference, with NewERA.  As part of our work in the governance space we asked if it would form a stronger relationship with us, and that has been very beneficial.  The people there have brought their expertise to bear, especially their financial expertise.  There is a NewERA member seconded to the Department who is available to the divisions in the Department to deal with routine issues in the first instance, and there is much wider expertise for that individual back at NewERA headquarters.  We have also volunteered, as opposed to it being mandated under legislation, which I believe it is in other cases, to have commentary from NewERA on some of our larger agencies as part of its annual report.<\/p><p>That was something which we felt it would be useful to sign up to, even though it was not mandated.  That is again part of our overall focus.  Senator Feighan asked about international influence.  The main principles of the written governance framework were developed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  A number of other Departments were part of a group looking at how that would be brought about.  On international comparisons, from memory - and I may be wrong on this - I believe there was some comparison with New Zealand, Singapore, the UK and certain other countries.  Many of the principles actually come from the OECD governance principles for the public sector.  That was one area which was drawn upon.  <\/p><p> The Senator also talked about the focus on outcomes.  Again, that is something we have tried to bring about as an ethos within the Department.  We have two-yearly sessions with the division of the Department under each assistant secretary.  All management board members take part in those to try to bring an overall focus and, because we have such a broad remit, learning and questioning from other parts of the Department to try to balance things out as sometimes a person in a particular area might not be able to see the wood for the trees.  Since the organisation capability review we are now also engaging in a lot of cross-departmental work, particular in respect of policy forums and sessions wherein particular policy matters can be teased out.  I believe that covers those issues.<\/p><p> On our work plan for this year Deputy Munster referenced the budget and the extent of additional funding under it.  In recent years it has been difficult for Departments to find additional current funding.  That has been a challenge for our Department.  We have been very successful in arguing for much more significant levels of capital funding.  We are one of the biggest beneficiaries of funding under the national development plan.  The work plan which the Deputy mentioned is very much about rolling out that national development plan through our agencies over the coming years and about working with them and ensuring that the Department has oversight and can engage in guidance and risk management around the roll-out of that plan.<\/p><p> On the work that we have done, when I took over the position of Secretary General we had reached a low point in terms of the numbers of staff available to us in certain areas post-recession.  We had lost many very experienced staff.  In order to be able to be faithful to our work programme and to roll it out we had to engage in a rebuilding exercise.  The resources that have been provided allow us to do that.  We have had the scope to do that.  <\/p><p> On the freedom of information issues, I am very sorry to hear if there has been a particular difficulty in a particular case or two.  I apologise if that has come about.  I do not know the specifics, but I would be happy to talk to the Deputy separately in that regard if that would be helpful.  The number of freedom of information requests has risen significantly in recent years.  Looking back at 2014, just under 100 freedom of information requests were received.  In 2018 it was closer to 350.  That number is growing very substantially as part of the work within the Department.  We try our very best to deal with freedom of information requests.  I am sorry if the Deputy has had a particularly difficult experience.  If it reached that level of seriousness there is the potential for complaints to go to the Information Commissioner, but I do not think we have had an instance of that or of any serious issues arising around it.  Would Ms Stapleton like to say anything on freedom of information before I finish with it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019012300002#F02300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Graham Doyle","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548250200,"counter":1043,"content":"<p>It might be useful to add that we appreciate that there are ongoing challenges with record management.  Again, we regret if some of the records Deputy Munster had sought had been misplaced.  It is our intention to put more of a focus on that in 2019.  We hope to bring an archivist onto our team to bring us some specialist guidance on how best to do that.  We are probably not alone in the Department in finding it a challenge to cope, particularly in respect of the large volumes of electronic records.  We want to make sure that we are doing this in a way that is aligned will with our statutory obligations under freedom of information legislation, the GDPR, and other statutory provisions, but that also looks forward to make sure that what we do now will meet our obligations under the National Archives Act 1986 in the future.  We recognise that we are on a pathway to improving our records management.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019012300002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Stapleton"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548250200,"counter":1044,"content":"<p>I know the Chairman has just cautioned us in respect of Brexit overall and some elements thereof.  I will try to answer Senator Mark Daly's questions at a general level.  Brexit has been identified as our number one risk.  It has been dealt with across the Department which, again, has that very broad remit to which I referred.  As part of our restructuring we took a unit that dealt with a very broad range of European affairs and issues generally and refocused it under a very experienced principal officer who reports to Ms Stapleton.  We use that unit to try to manage the risks around Brexit.  The early stages of this approach actually go back before the Vote.  We use and resource that unit to co-ordinate the Department's work because there are very few aspects of the Department that are not touched upon by Brexit in some shape or form.<\/p> <p>  There are various structures.  I feed into some structures at Secretary General level and Ms Stapleton also feeds into various structures.  We have six assistant secretaries on our management board.  They head up particular sectoral areas and have very broad remits.  There are structures into which they feed.  The heads of division also feed into a variety of structures.  Within the Department we have overall Brexit co-ordination.  As I said, whether one goes up or down the structures, one will see that there is a huge amount of work involved in Brexit.  I often say - I said it to the Chairman as we were chatting briefly outside - that, as everyone is aware, there is a huge amount of work going on across Government Departments here, in the UK and in Europe generally.  Whenever we get to end of all this, the time that has been spent on this and the focus put on it will, without doubt, have had an opportunity cost but we are trying to avoid the key risks.<\/p><p>The most significant issues the Department has had are on the flying rights of aircraft, the rights of Irish hauliers to access the UK itself and the EU by transiting the UK and the impacts on the Irish tourism industry of negative factors in the UK, which is one of our key markets, particularly given the weakness of sterling.  We have also tried to contribute strongly to whole-of-government matters, in particular the requirements of the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Health and the Revenue Commissioners to carry out the checks they may need to do at ports and airports once the UK becomes a third country.  We are also working with colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to try to influence positively the application of checks at UK and mainland European ports, particularly French ports, through which Irish hauliers transit, as well as considering alternatives in terms of the routes to European markets.<\/p><p> There is a range of other issues the Department has been addressing and many of them are of some importance.  What I have outlined are the most challenging we have dealt with.  We have had very substantial progress on aviation issues, including in a potential no-deal scenario, to ensure that connectivity for airlines only controlled in the EU continues.  The Commission, with influence from Ireland and other interested member states, has a contingency in place that will ensure aircraft fly.  It will be a temporary arrangement, if reciprocated by the UK, but for something that could have been a massive negative, to say the very least, there has been substantial progress on it.<\/p><p> There has also been substantial progress on the issue of licensing matters and the right of hauliers to enter and leave the country under arrangements that, if reciprocated by the UK, will allow vehicles the required market access for the immediate period following a potential no deal.  While it will be a temporary nine month arrangement with the European Commission, up to a week before Christmas the scenario was a fallback position on European Conference of Ministers of Transport, ECMT, licensing.  I will not bore the committee with the details but it would have meant that 7% of trucks needing to access the UK or go through the UK could be licensed.  It is a tremendously difficult issue to deal with and to try to plan for.<\/p><p> These are some of our main issues.  I do not want to make my answer too long by going into others.  These are probably the top two issues.  Brexit overall was identified as the number one risk by the Department and we have applied a huge amount of focus on it.<\/p><p> With regard to border issues, many people in the media are commenting in various ways on borders but they are not issues for the Department and it would be damaging for me or my colleagues to comment on them.  I do not want to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019012300002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Graham Doyle","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548250200,"counter":1046,"content":"<p>It is not a matter for the committee as such.

Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann completed a detailed report on the development potential of Rosslare in recent times.  It has a &euro;15 million plan to transform the port, and that has been approved by the board.  We met Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and the management of the port prior to Christmas.  That involved all elements of the Department which can interact with the port, from the issue of roads to the port to the maritime issues to Brexit issues.  Separately, there will be a significant amount of investment in State facilities at the port.  That will show a significant commitment by the Government also.  I cannot give the Chairman a figure on that.  Investment in the port and in some of its facilities is a matter for the company and it is looking at raising that capital and making that planned investment.<\/p> <p>  In the context of Brexit, additional customs checks, agriculture, sanitary and phytosanitary checks and health controls will be required when the UK leaves the EU.  Certainly, Rosslare is one of the key locations where that impact is felt, the others being mainly Dublin Port and Dublin Airport, particularly in the handling of ro-ro traffic.  As the Senator will be aware, there are plans under way.  The Government is looking at myriad possible Brexit outcomes and considering planning underneath all of those.  It has been planning under a central case scenario, which does not look a million miles from what was voted on in Westminster, and obviously the no-deal scenario.  Regardless of whether we are talking temporarily or in terms of permanent facilities required at Rosslare, that is being co-ordinated across Government with the various Departments, the client Departments being the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Health and the Revenue Commissioners.  Facilities are being planned and acted upon in terms of bringing them to bear by the Office of Pubic Works.  This Department is very much playing its role in ensuring that the affected ports, Rosslare being one of the main three, and airports are co-operating in full, identifying locations, providing land where they have it or helping source land where it is zoned by others.<\/p> <p>  Under the central case scenario, in terms of the facilities for the end of a transition period, we would be looking to put in place significant parking facilities for trucks in Rosslare, inspection bays to carry out control checks, a dedicated border control post for live animals, and accommodation space for customs, agriculture and health officials.  Aside from the port's own investment in the facilities that are required, I expect the State's investment will be higher.

I will not accept their exact wording for obvious reasons but I have put forward wording which will achieve the same aim and make the necessary consequential amendments.  These amendments provide that when an application for a development to the airport is made to the planning authority, that application will then be provided by the planning authority to the noise regulator.  The noise regulator will adjudicate on whether there is a noise dimension in the development application that needs to be assessed under EU Regulation No. 598 in line with the balanced approach.  Where the noise regulator makes a determination that an application does fall within Regulation No. 598, the planning authority must wait for the outcome of that assessment before making a final decision on the planning application.  Once the noise regulator has completed its work and made a regulatory noise decision following the necessary public consultation, it will inform the planning authority.  The planning authority will then be in a position to make a final decision on the development and must adopt the regulatory decision of the noise regulator as planning conditions to the development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019012300002#B00200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1548259200,"counter":1141,"content":"<p>For clarity, is the Minister submitting amendments on Report Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019012300002#B00300","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1548259200,"counter":1142,"content":"<p>No, I am submitting them now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019012300002#B00400","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1548259200,"counter":1143,"content":"<p>Apologies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019012300002#B00500","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1548259200,"counter":1144,"content":"<p>We raised this issue following the briefings with departmental officials and there was a gap in the original draft.

Furthermore, a notice will appear in national newspapers stating that the noise regulator has made a decision and detailing how that decision and any associated report can be accessed.  It is also worth noting that any person who participates in the process, that is, any person who made observations or submissions during the public consultation phase, will also be notified directly and in writing by the regulator.

This amendment provides for a second scenario which strengthens the hand of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I am advised that it stems from a suggestion from Deputy Darragh O'Brien in discussions with my officials and I wish to acknowledge his contribution on this.  With this amendment, steps are set out for circumstances where the noise regulator decides, in the context of section 11, that a development proposal does not require a noise assessment.  In such a scenario, the noise regulator informs the planning authority that a development does not have a noise impact that would warrant assessment under Regulation 598\/14.  The planning authority then moves through the planning process and makes a planning decision.  Where the planning decision is subsequently appealed, this amendment provides for the board, in considering the appeal, to have the power to undertake the balanced approach process itself where it believes there will be a significant impact to the noise climate around the airport, contrary to the views of the noise regulator.  The board will have all of the normal powers of the noise regulator in these circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019012300002#C08900","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1548259200,"counter":1260,"content":"<p>Could the Minister repeat his two final sentences?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019012300002#C09000","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1548259200,"counter":1261,"content":"<p>I will reread the final paragraph.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019012300002#C09100","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1548259200,"counter":1262,"content":"<p>Yes, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019012300002#C09200","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1548259200,"counter":1263,"content":"<p>Where the planning decision is subsequently appealed, this amendment provides for the board, in considering the appeal, to have the power to undertake the balanced approach process itself where it believes there will be a significant impact to the noise climate around the airport, contrary to the views of the noise regulator.

The Minister will know from meeting residents that the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, currently controls who is included in or excluded from noise insulation schemes and how expansive such schemes are.<\/p><p>I met with the Minister's officials earlier on today and it was a very useful meeting.  The early part of the definition in No. 20(1)(a) is to: \"expand the existent noise insulation scheme to all homes affected by any and all flight paths into the airport, including those created by any future developments at the airport\".  I know that we may have to look at improving on that definition and I say that on the basis that if the odd plane was flying over Rathmines on the way in or something such as that, it is not my intention to have that included, my intention is to look at the communities that are directly affected by the existing runway and those that would be affected by the second parallel runway when that is built because I have had lengthy discussions with the DAA about the need to expand that.  This amendment, therefore, would provide under section 2 of the amendment that: \"The competent authority shall be responsible for evaluating the design and implementation of the airport authority&rsquo;s noise insulation scheme, with a view to ensuring maximum benefit for local residents.\"  It is about the balanced approach and it is about looking for an evaluation of the existing scheme that is there but the competent authority would decide on what areas should or should not be included.<\/p><p> This amendment strengthens the Bill and I look towards the independence of the new noise regulator as well because it will remove the full responsibility for making a decision from the DAA.  It will not be just the DAA deciding who is in or who is out.  When we have an airport noise authority, that makes a lot of sense and there should be an appeals mechanism for local residents to raise complaints on the noise insulation scheme.  The noise regulator would effectively become the independent arbiter, which makes sense.  That is what we want it to do and I am asking it to take over the responsibility for deciding what the extent of the noise insulation scheme is.  We can work on more of the detail of that on Report Stage.  There is a bit of an imperfection, unintended as it might be, in No. 20(1)(a) and I agree that we need to tweak that.  I do not want the whole east coast taken into the scheme because then we will not have the resources to deal with the areas that are most affected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019012300002#C11400","speaker":"1228","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548259200,"counter":1286,"content":"<p>My officials met with Deputy Darragh O'Brien earlier today on this issue and they were impressed.  When they presented me with the arguments the Deputy had presented them with, I felt that they had some merit.  There are obviously one or two difficulties in the way this is framed but there is an opportunity for a discussion between now and Report Stage which will accommodate what Deputies Darragh O'Brien, Clare Daly and Brendan Ryan want as well, without in any way impacting adversely on the Bill.<\/p> <p>  I understand the Deputy's concerns for local residents and noise insulation is clearly a proven measure to offset the impact of noise.  While I am of the view that this amendment, as currently framed, is not a workable solution, I am prepared to look at what can be done on Report Stage to address the concerns the Deputy has and to honour the intention of his proposed amendment.<\/p> <p>  It is important to recognise that the Bill provides full legal powers for the new noise regulator to include any and all noise mitigation measures as it sees fit, in order to reduce the impact of aircraft noise at Dublin Airport.  This includes home insulation schemes, which would be introduced based on a detailed noise assessment at the airport that would determine who is affected by aircraft noise and to what degree.  It is the regulator's noise assessment, which we should remember will be the subject of full public consultation, that will make sure that those most affected would be protected.  I accept that it is for the future and that the Deputy is concerned about the present.  While I have every confidence that the Bill allows for the regulator to take into account current schemes in any future regulatory decision and incorporate any additions or improvements to those schemes' example, I will see if there is a way of making that more explicit on Report Stage.<\/p> <p>  There is an important point to be made about the regulatory framework that we are providing here and there are a number of amendments before us today which reinforce this point.  Simply put, if the DAA does not comply with a noise regulator decision, the regulator has strong enforcement powers and if the decision of the regulator is deemed insufficient, then that can be appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the board has sweeping powers within this Bill to look at any and all matters again in full.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019012300002#D00200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1548259200,"counter":1287,"content":"<p>The Minister's positive response is to be welcomed.

It is true that the competent authority has the power to deal with this but it is sufficiently important to have this grounded in the Statute Book anyway, particularly when we all know that the DAA's intention is to use this legislation to attempt to lift the night noise restrictions.  We have to be clear that one of the reasons the present noise insulation scheme is so limited and ineffective is precisely because there was a protection provided by the night noise restrictions and any loosening of one will necessarily require a much bigger investment in insulation and so on.  It is important and it is in line with the balanced approach.<\/p> <p>  I like section 3 of the amendment, particularly the idea of the residents having access to an appeals mechanism around the noise insulation scheme.  I know that there is an overall appeals process within An Bord Plean&aacute;la but that does not negate a separate and easily utilised mechanism around insulation which residents can access because as the airport grows the scheme will have to be accessed more readily.

I am not sure about it and it is certainly inadequately drafted by me in its present form but I will explain the idea behind it and we will see what we can do between now and Report Stage.<\/p><p>This is the section that deals with the issue of enforcement notices.  We are obviously talking about an enforcement notice being served primarily on the DAA, which is a massive institution.  The idea that it would ignore an enforcement notice is abhorrent and it would be outrageous for that to happen.<\/p><p>The State needs to have some meaty mechanism if that is to arise.   This legislation proposes that the authority can be brought to the High Court.  However, bringing the DAA to the High Court would take forever, and all the while a noise enforcement notice which had been issued could be ignored.  Organisations like the DAA have unlimited resources and can draw out High Court proceedings for a long time while residents would be left unable to have their rights enforced.  That is a problem.  What I am trying to do with the amendment is provide for more ready and immediate financial penalties to strengthen the hand of the competent authority to enforce compliance.  That is the theory behind it.  The wording is poor because I was trying to cover many broad issues.<\/p><p> How do we put a cost on this?  Manchester Airport imposes financial penalties.  It has a clause under which it charges &pound;750 for every decibel by which an aircraft exceeds the noise limit.  I used a figure of &euro;1,000 and did not even provide that this would apply for each additional decibel.  As such, it is inadequate.  That was one option that I had.  Obviously, if we are talking about a major development and the DAA did not implement a measure costing hundreds of thousands of euro, a fine of &euro;1,000 would be ridiculous.  I accept that the amendment is not drafted properly.  However, the principle of having some accessible, immediate financial or other penalties to bring the DAA to heel is necessary.

The Deputy said there would be a delay in the High Court.  Under a provision we will discuss later, the High Court can expedite proceedings in such cases where it considers it necessary or important to do so.  I do not anticipate circumstances in which the DAA would defy an enforcement order.  It would be extraordinary if that were to happen.  I know it is a strange and powerful creature but it would be very odd for the DAA to defy an enforcement order from an authority of the State.  That would be very rare indeed, although perhaps would happen.  There is certainly a need for enforcement.  It is a matter of how an order is applied and ensuring that it is applied speedily and effectively and is a deterrent.  I am not sure &euro;1,000 for each breach would be a deterrent but we will see.<\/p> <p>  This provision concerns the relationship between the regulator and the regulated entity, namely, the DAA.  I am fully in agreement with the Deputy on the need to have strong and robust enforcement measures.  Section 22 provides power to the noise regulator to direct the airport authority or an airport user to undertake actions in order to comply with a noise mitigating measure or an operating restriction.  The section gives the very enforcement powers around noise to Fingal County Council that have been highlighted as a deficiency in the current noise action planning process.  I am providing that the noise regulator will have recourse directly to the High Court to enforce any notice that it issues.  This is the most effective form of enforcement and was given extensive consideration, including legal assessment.  What the Deputy's amendment proposes is an extra administrative layer before court action.  While I do not believe that is the intention of the amendment, it is certainly its effect.  I am advised that administrative binds such as the one Deputy Daly is proposing are problematic and often not effective.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019012300002#E00200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1548259200,"counter":1298,"content":"<p>I accept the Minister's point that this scenario would be extremely rare but it is not unheard of.  If it was never going to happen, we would not be providing a substantial section of the legislation to deal with it.  We can anticipate that it may arise.  I do not accept that what I am proposing creates an extra layer.  Those against whom the enforcement orders would be placed would be the big organisations, not just the DAA.  Let us say, for example, Ryanair is using an aircraft in breach of the limits, although the competent authority has said it wants the lowest emissions and the quietest aircraft.  Say the competent authority sets a decibel limit for aircraft as part of the balanced approach, and one of the airline operators breaches the limit.  In such cases, it is not realistic for the competent authority to keep going to the High Court.  Where is provision made for something similar to the penalties that airports like Manchester can apply to airlines?  In Manchester Airport, the penalty is &pound;750 for every decibel over the threshold.  That adds up for the airline operators and seems to be an easier option than litigation.  Litigation might be effective in the case of outright defiance by the DAA or a big organisation deliberately and in black and white refusing to do something.  However, breaches or abuse of some guidelines or breaches of decibel limits could happen regularly.  How do we enforce the rules if there is not a financial penalty?  How could the competent authority do something like what is done in other airports if we do not provide for it in law?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019012300002#E00300","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1548259200,"counter":1299,"content":"<p>This would be a very strong message to send to the DAA.

This is the key point.  The Minister is correct there are no specific planning applications or existing permissions mentioned in this, and that would be entirely inappropriate.  However, it would also be utterly la-la for us to sit here without mentioning the giant elephant or 747 in the room, namely, the open and declared intention of the DAA, supported in many quarters, that immediately after this legislation is in place, it will be relying on it to seek changes to the current restrictions on night noise, night movements and so on.  This is the issue which has caused huge concern for residents and it relates to the points I made earlier.  Those conditions were put in after a very long battle, as we discussed the last day, and they were put in to protect human health.  We have dealt with the issues around the impact on health, which is the nightmare reality for people.<\/p> <p>  If we take these provisions in the context of what the Minister has said and the discussion that was had the last day, when we were told there was an urgency in this regard and that it absolutely had to be done, we know what this means.  It means the DAA has asked for this, and we have seen that its correspondence refers to uncertainty.  I do not accept there is uncertainty.  I am in favour of development at Dublin Airport.  I got my livelihood from the airlines, and my constituents and former workmates rely on the airport.  We want a healthy and vibrant airport.  However, in the modern era, it has to be one which respects residents and works in tandem with them.  The night restrictions that are in place can be kept in place and work alongside a growing and developing airport; it just requires a different outcome for the airline operators.<\/p> <p>  It is okay for the DAA to say Ryanair and Aer Lingus will decamp and go to Honolulu or whatever but they will not.  What they will have to do is make changes.  The current restrictions propose 65 night movements once the second runway is up and running and there is a restriction on night-time hours.  At present there are some 99 night movements per night so it is true, on the surface, that once the second runway is operational, there will be a one third reduction in night flights from the present figure.  However, on the basis of a new runway and much more movement during the day, what it means is not fewer flights overall, just fewer flights during that time.<\/p> <p>  What does this mean and why is the provision there?  It is there to suit the likes of Ryanair utilising aircraft on a certain day in order to maximise its profits.  It wants the aircraft going out at 6 a.m. so it can bring them back two and three times a day.  It does not suit Mrs. Mop who is going to Tenerife to get up at 4 a.m. to drive up from Limerick to get that aeroplane, and it would actually suit her better if it was after 7 a.m. and would suit the residents in that area also.  How do we square the circle?  It is very easy.  The airlines have multiple staff employed on aircraft scheduling and utilisation.  What they have to do is match their fleets to the requirements.  With regard to the 65 flights during the night, the businessmen going to London or businesswomen going to Berlin should be accommodated on an early flight and the airlines have the information available to accommodate that.<\/p><p>However, somebody going to Tenerife or Lanzarote does not need to get up in the middle of the night and disturb residents in St. Margaret's, Portmarnock and Swords.  We have to start thinking like that because it is unsustainable for the aviation industry to carry on, unfettered.  In that sense, having a balanced development in tandem with the way in which the airport operates is the best way forward.  These conditions should be protected and the best way to reassure residents is to keep them in place.  At the moment, they cannot be changed.  This legislation is being introduced to deal with noise regulation but the DAA has said that it is going to use it to change the conditions.  The reality is that it can change the conditions without this law but by structuring this Bill, which is good legislation, in this way with these two clauses in it, we are giving the DAA a platform to change those two conditions.  If we do that and lose control of our democratic say in this part of the process, then we are abdicating our representative responsibility to the residents.

I am not a great lover of the DAA, as the Deputy will be aware, but it would not be right to exclude it in any way.  The legislation has been introduced simply because of EU Regulation No. 598 which will provide consistency across Europe.  If one of the consequences is, as the Deputy suggests, that the DAA will appeal those restrictions, and I am sure she is right about that, that is fine.  Let it appeal them but to prejudge the result of that appeal is not something I am going to do.  It would be absolutely wrong to do so and would be an expression of no confidence in the noise regulator in advance.

It is anticipating a decision from the noise regulator to take a stance like that.

I urge them to put their trust in the competent authority.
