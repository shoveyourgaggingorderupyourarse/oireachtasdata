It described the Government's medium-term budgetary plans as not credible.  It said the Government's budgetary plans were not conducive to prudent economic and budgetary management.<\/p>  <p>  The next report from the council will be due in approximately three weeks.  It will make for interesting reading given what has emerged since the previous report was published six months ago.  We now know the overall cost of the national children's hospital has spiralled to &euro;1.73 billion and the Government is prepared to commit up to &euro;3 billion on the national broadband plan.  All of this is new information that was not accounted for in the previous budget.  We have heard no plan for how these commitments will be funded.  In fact, these two projects on their own leave a very big hole in the Government's numbers.  We know from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform memorandum of earlier this month as well as from parliamentary questions tabled by Deputy Barry Cowen that the national broadband plan contract would require almost an extra &euro;500 million over the next three years alone to 2022.  This comes to a total of &euro;1.6 billion extra over the lifetime of the national development plan to 2027.  The extra amount needed for the national children's hospital over the next three years is &euro;385 million.  Between the two of these the Government needs to find an extra &euro;900 million over the next three years.  The overall shortfall for these two projects is in the region of &euro;2 billion over the lifetime of the national development plan.  These are not Fianna F&aacute;il's numbers.  These are the numbers from the Government's spending watchdog, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p>  <p>  Again, I wish to emphasise that these are additional costs, above and beyond what was provided for only a few months ago.  On top of that, the Taoiseach made a political promise in recent months that he would give a &euro;2.3 billion income tax cut in the lifetime of the next Government, if he was lucky enough to be leading it.<\/p><p>In effect, the Government has made unfunded commitments of more than &euro;4 billion over the next number of years.  It seems to me that the Government is committing money it simply does not have, and these commitments are essentially unfunded.  All of this is against the backdrop of most economists predicting that there will be a slowdown in growth over the coming years, that the risks we are facing are now on the downside, and that we need to plan accordingly.  Most worryingly of all, the T&aacute;naiste's report to Cabinet today states that the risk of a no-deal Brexit has never been greater.<\/p> <p> Will the Taoiseach explain to the House, and more importantly to the people, how he is going to fund this shortfall of &euro;900 million in the next three years, and indeed &euro;4 billion out to 2027?  If he is to keep his promises, then he has a few simple choices.  He can raise taxes, cut spending, borrow more money, postpone or cut other capital projects, or he can simply hope that the booming corporation tax receipts we have enjoyed in recent years continue indefinitely.  Which of these options is it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100003#A00200","speaker":"1223","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558443900,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  First, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, is an independent body which the Government set up because we thought there should be an independent fiscal advisory council in the State.  It was set up as part of the response to the financial and economic crisis which the Deputy's own party had a very large hand in creating in the first place and mishandling thereafter.  Around the middle of June, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, will present the summer economic statement in the normal way.  The summer economic statement, as has been the case in previous years, will update our financial projections by taking developments in revenue, employment, expenditure, and so on into account.  That will be presented in the normal way in the middle of June, as it has been for many years.<\/p>  <p>  As I have informed the House already, the national broadband plan, NBP, will not have a fiscal impact on 2019 and will have a minimal one on 2020, given the carry-over of the money allocated for the NBP into 2020.  However, it will have an impact from 2021 onwards, and we will have to provide for that.  We are confident that we can provide for that from revenue.  It is also important to bear in mind that Project Ireland 2040 and the national development plan provided for contingencies.  I cannot remember the exact figure.  I thank there might have been between &euro;5 and &euro;7 billion set aside for a contingency, but that is later in the ten-year period and we will have to look at that too.<\/p>  <p>  When it come to the Deputy's question, what should be the most important news is the labour force survey, which came out at 11 o'clock this morning.  That shows that there are now 2.3 million people at work in Ireland, which is more than ever before.

To enable these funds to do their thing, the Government has designed a tax system that incentivises the funds to buy even more loans, which the banks are more than happy to offload despite the dire consequences for the borrowers.  Many vulture funds are now structuring their arrangements in such a way that they pay no tax at all in this State.  Ulster Bank has a particular fondness for selling loans on to vulture funds.  Last year it sold a portfolio of loans known as Project Scariff which was worth &euro;1.6 billion but was sold to a vulture fund, called Promontoria Scariff.  It consists of about 3,600 family homes and 2,900 buy-to-lets.  A company called Cabot Financial Ireland is administering these loans and its actions to date in dealing with borrowers have been absolutely disgraceful.  A number of weeks ago, it wrote to its buy-to-let customers who were behind in mortgage payments and demanded that the arrears be cleared within 30 days.  I have received correspondence from a number of those mortgage holders which shows that they were in very small arrears, in some cases less than &euro;3,000.  The statement they got from the vulture fund demanded full payment, not just of the arrears but of the entire loan.  They are being given seven days to make the payment, and to come up with hundreds of thousands of euro in some cases.  Some of the borrowers have serious health concerns in their households and the vultures which are sending the letters know about these concerns but they continue to issue the letters and the demands without any regard to what is happening.  They are paying no regard to the fact that arrears are less than &euro;3,000 in some cases and they are not facilitating any arrangements with borrowers.  It is not just borrowers who are affected by this.  As they appoint fixed-asset receivers, the tenants in these houses will be turfed out onto the street and they need somewhere to live.  Two sets of lives are being destroyed as a result of this policy and it is utterly chaotic for the families involved.  It runs roughshod over any level of common decency in the way vultures and banks should be dealing with customers in arrears.<\/p>  <p>  All of this is a direct consequence of Government policy, which is to roll out the red carpet to these leeches.<\/p><p>They can do this, and will do it, because they know that the Government will do nothing to stop them.  That is why they are playing hard, fast and very loose with these customers.

The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, is doing that in advance of the budget, which will be in October.  That is the prudent thing to do.  Tax incentives are brought in at a time to stimulate particular activity but are then removed at a later time when they are no longer necessary.

In addition to that, the Deputy will be aware of legislation going through the Seanad in the next couple of days to extend protections for tenants; to increase notice to quit periods so that people are given much more time to find a new place to live or rent if they need to; to extend the rent pressure zones and work out how they are calculated differently; and to extend protections to new entrants to the property market in recent years.

It is obvious that prices and rents are out of control in London and New York, which are among the most unaffordable housing markets in the world.  London and New York have serious housing problems because housing is now an investment for speculation.  As we have heard, it is clear that speculative investment in housing is happening here too.  The most recent OECD report warns that the Irish economy is vulnerable to a recession due to a disorderly Brexit.  I understand the T&aacute;naiste has indicated that the prospect of a disorderly Brexit is even more likely now.  The OECD report also warns that the presence of foreign investors in the property market is a particular risk to us.  More than half of all investment in commercial property is coming from outside the State.  Student accommodation and buy-to-let properties are crowding out housing developments for people right now, for the simple reason that they are more profitable.  It is a textbook example of how a free market approach cannot and will not deliver affordable housing.  Does the Taoiseach understand that?  These kinds of speculative investments are taking construction workers, scarce land and scarce capital.  When housing becomes just another investment that focuses on maximum profit, this forces people to pay more and more in housing costs.  That is what is manifestly happening.<\/p>  <p>  The reliance on financial investment also pushes down standards.  We have seen this in the ludicrous co-living proposal, which attempts to normalise cramped living conditions and erode public housing standards that we have spent most of our lives trying to improve.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government has become an apologist for those who wish to push down the quality of housing.  As I have said, we have spent decades trying to have decent standards for people.  All of this shows that the Government is out of touch with the reality of the lives of the vast bulk of working people.  Not everyone is privileged enough to go from college into a well-paid professional job, and quickly earn enough to be able to put down a deposit on a family home.  The Minister's assumption seems to be that co-living would be an acceptable option for someone on this gilded path.  It shows a complete lack of understanding of the kinds of jobs that are available to most people.  While I welcome today's jobs figures, I remind the Taoiseach that one in four of the workers to whom he has referred is on less than two thirds of median earnings, or little more than &euro;23,000 a year after tax.  Working people need affordable housing.  I have a simple question for the Taoiseach.  Will he admit that the strategy that has been pursued by the Minister and his Government colleagues is not working?  Will the Government change direction in favour of a State-led housebuilding programme, like that which has been outlined in some detail by my party?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100007#E00600","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1558445700,"counter":45,"content":"<p>The type of development to which the Deputy has referred probably accounts for less than 1% of the new homes being built in the country at the moment.  There could be as few as half a dozen developments of this type this year and next year.  It is important to put this in context.  The type of housing may be a choice for some people.  We live in a country that has an increasing population, which is a good thing.  Our population is approaching 5 million, if it has not reached that level already.  We live in a country where new households are being formed all the time.  As people get married and start families, they need their own homes.  We also live in a country where there was almost no construction activity for seven years.  As a result, there is an overhang of demand for housing that was not met for a long period.  In my view and in the Government's view, we need new housing of all different types and sorts, and lots of it.  We need social housing for people who are on the housing list, many of whom have been on that list for far too long.<\/p><p>We need new homes for people to buy because the vast majority of people still want to be able to own their own home, and indeed 70% do.  We need new places for people to rent involving cost rental models and private models.  The solution does not lie in any particular model, whether it is State or private sector.  It is going to require all of those things - State-led development, private sector-led development, and co-operation between the State and the private sector.  That is how we will produce the volume of additional housing that we need in Ireland to cater for the demand that built up during those seven years and the new demand that arises every year.<\/p> <p> We are making some real progress.  Last year 18,000 new homes, comprising houses and apartments, were built in Ireland, which is the highest number in a decade.  We know from figures released by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, in recent days that new home building is up another 25% this year so far.  We will certainly see somewhere between 22,000 and 25,000 new homes being built in Ireland this year.  We need to go higher again the year after and higher again the year after that, but it is simply not the case that there was ever a Government policy or measure that could get us from a situation where only 4,000 or 5,000 homes were being built in Ireland to 35,000 in a year or two.  We have to do it in the only way that it can be done, in a stepwise manner, rebuilding the construction industry and rebuilding the social housing programme.  That is what is being done.  Last year, for example, around 8,500 new homes were added to the social housing stock-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100007#E00700","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558446300,"counter":47,"content":"<p>There were 74 homes built in Dublin last year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100008#F00200","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1558446300,"counter":48,"content":"<p>-----which is a very significant number.

The residents of six flats were given notices to quit by July.  These people had paid their rents and had not broken their leases.  The previous landlord died late last year and the property had been inherited by a nephew.  This nephew no doubt noted that the rents were relatively low.  He handed out the notices to quit and announced that refurbishment was needed.  I have no doubt that, after refurbishment, the rents will double or treble.  One of the residents, Brendan, went to the council housing department and was advised to look for a house or apartment share in the private rental sector - co-living I suppose.  Brendan is 42 years of age and said that he would not and, in fact, could not share.  He was advised that if that was the case, he should check out the Simon Community.<\/p>  <p>  Brendan is not the only one of the residents facing eviction into homelessness.  Under this Government, more than 10,000 people are officially homeless.  Two thousand years ago, a revolutionary Palestinian carpenter named Jesus Christ entered a temple, overturned the tables of the money changers and denounced the profiteers for organising a den of thieves.  This country is crying out for a Government which will cleanse our modern-day den of thieves - the greedy landlords, get rich quick merchants and vulture funds, such as Ires REIT whose profits nearly doubled last year and which pays no corporate or capital gains tax.  The Taoiseach and his Government refuse to act.  They refuse to ban economic evictions and evictions into homelessness.  They refuse even to put a moratorium on evictions until such time as this crisis has passed.  Instead, the Taoiseach and his Government support the new European Commission directive which will restrict the rights of member states to impose their own regulations on vulture funds.  <\/p>  <p>  This is not a surprise.  Four members of Cabinet are landlords, as are five Ministers of State.  Nearly one third of members of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party are landlords.

Some 5,000 families were lifted out of homelessness and provided with secure tenancies in the last year.  Some 18,000 families are now living in houses that did not exist a year ago.  There are many good stories of people who are being lifted out of homelessness and people who are getting homes for the first time.  As I mentioned earlier, 9,000 families were provided with new social housing last year.<\/p>  <p>  Government is working hard on the issue of tenants' rights.  We appreciate that the rights of tenants need to be enhanced.  That is why we are being active in this area and legislation is going through this House and the Seanad.  This will do a number of things to provide more secure tenancies for people who are renting, for example, by extending the notice to quit period.  People who are asked to leave by their landlord will be given much more time to find somewhere else to live and rent.  That is a big change which will be welcomed by most people.  We are also enhancing the resources of the RTB to allow it to take enforcement action against rogue landlords where they mistreat tenants.<\/p><p>We have extended the rent pressure zones to other areas and to new tenancies.  As a result of the rent pressure zones, hundreds of thousands of people have had no increase or an increase of less than 4% in their rents in the past year or two.  We have also brought in strict criteria on refurbishment so that we do not have rogue landlords using refurbishment as an excuse to increase the rent.

This is an important issue, as the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and others are aware.  The Bill aims to tackle directly antisocial behaviour in housing estates.  It forms part of a broader suite of measures Fianna F&aacute;il has put forward, such as boosting the number of garda&iacute;, expanding antisocial behaviour orders, and putting residential support workers in place in social housing estates.  Too many communities throughout Ireland are being intimidated by a handful of households.  From outright antisocial behaviour to letting their properties fall into disrepair, which casts a shadow on the entire estate, a small minority is damaging the quality of life for the majority.<\/p><p>This Bill will allow any third party to complain about antisocial behaviour to avoid specific neighbours being intimidated.  In addition and importantly, it sets out standards for the exterior of a property that must be maintained, such as cleaning up rubbish and maintaining gardens, and it expands the powers of the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, to terminate a tenancy in extreme cases.  Many of us are able to spot the properties in housing estates that are rented, particularly at this time when we are canvassing with candidates and councillors throughout the country.  Much of this is due to landlords not taking responsibility for the external upkeep of those properties.  When complaints are made by neighbours of the affected properties, the RTB will not step in and log them as formal complaints.  This can have a detrimental effect on the quality of life in the estate and also on the appearance of the estate.<\/p><p>This is an important issue.  The Bill would give additional powers to the RTB.  It would mean that I as a Deputy for Dublin Fingal could lodge a complaint on behalf of a resident in an estate.  It would also mean that the landlord would have the responsibility of ensuring the property externally is kept up to standard.  Currently, if litter and rubbish is being left in front or back gardens, the local authority will only get involved if it is deemed that there is an environmental health risk to neighbours or people living in the estate.  I am introducing this Bill today and I intend to use Private Members' time in the coming weeks to move it forward on Second Stage.  It will amend the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to give these additional powers to the RTB and to expand the definition of affected parties, thereby giving neighbours in an estate the ability to lodge complaints about antisocial behaviour carried out by tenants, or indeed complaints about landlords who do not take responsibility to keep dwellings up to standard, which happens regularly in residential housing estates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100016#O00200","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1558451100,"counter":195,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100016#O00300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1558451100,"counter":196,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100016#O00400","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1558451100,"counter":197,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1558451100,"counter":198,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100016#O00600","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1558451100,"counter":199,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100016#O00700","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1558451100,"counter":200,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Planning and Development (Climate Measures) (Amendment) Bill 2019: First Stage","time":1558451100,"counter":201,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100016#O00900"},{"type":"speech","time":1558451100,"counter":202,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Planning and Development Act 2000 in order to restrict certain developments in oil, gas (including liquefied natural gas terminals) or other fossil fuels from certain strategic development infrastructure projects, to revise the procedure for making applications directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and to ensure that regard be given to the State&rsquo;s climate goals and to provide for related matters.<\/blockquote><p>This Bill proposes to remove any application for fossil fuel related infrastructure, such as gas, oil or other fossil fuel related infrastructure, from the provisions of the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act that allow fast-track planning for what is called strategic infrastructure development.<\/p><p>If we are serious about the climate emergency that was declared, it is simply unacceptable that fossil fuel companies seeking to profit from the destruction of the environment could develop infrastructure to lock us into further dependency on fossil fuels, which are choking and poisoning the climate, under a fast-track process whereby they essentially pay &euro;100,000 to go straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and bypass the normal planning process.<\/p> <p> There is a great deal at stake.  In the past ten days or so, we had the D&aacute;il declare a climate emergency, and rightly so.  That was done as a result of the agitation of school students who went on strike, the extinction rebellion and the growing mass movement demanding that the political establishment take emergency measures to address the climate emergency.  The Government did not oppose that but while its representatives were paying lip service to dealing with the climate emergency, others were busy in Europe at the European Commission adding the Shannon liquefied natural gas facility to the list of projects of common interest within the European Union.  The Government was seeking to add to that list, in other words backing further fossil fuel related infrastructure to import US fracked gas into Ireland and, in doing so, lock Ireland further into dependency on fossil fuels for decades.  A better example of climate hypocrisy and of a Government speaking out of both sides of its mouth when it comes to the issue of climate change could not be more evident.  Such hypocrisy also extends to the European Union, which is now supporting &euro;1.3 billion worth of gas-related infrastructure projects.  The EU is fast-tracking these projects to the benefit of fossil fuel companies.<\/p> <p> Sometimes the Government will try to justify this by suggesting that gas is transitional and better than coal or oil.  All the bodies seriously looking at this have made it absolutely clear that gas is every bit as bad as coal and oil.  It is a fossil fuel.  Moreover, fracked gas from the US has significant methane leakage and the net impact of fracked gas on the environment and climate is every bit as bad that of coal or oil.  It is simply nonsense, hypocrisy and dishonesty on the part of the Government to maintain that gas is transitional.  Such infrastructure is tying up resources and crowding out the investment that should be going into developing renewable energy.  It will lock us into dependency on highly expensive infrastructure that promotes and continues the use of fossil fuels.<\/p> <p> I want to say something important, which may be news to some.  The High Court action taken by Friends of the Irish Environment is the only reason the Shannon facility is currently blocked.  That action is blocking the application for the time being.  It may be worth noting that New Fortress Energy, the company behind the facility, essentially offered to bribe the organisation with &euro;1 million to drop the case.  Thankfully, because those involved are principled environmentalists they refused the money and are maintaining their High Court action to block the Shannon LNG facility.<\/p> <p> The Bill is about saying that we should not give favoured planning status to this kind of fossil fuel infrastructure.  This infrastructure will continue to poison our environment as long as the Government continues to support it.  This position exposes the Government's complete dishonesty in claiming it wants to deal with the climate emergency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100016#O01000","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558451400,"counter":204,"content":"<p>Is the Bill being opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100017#P00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1558451400,"counter":205,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100017#P00300","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1558451400,"counter":206,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1558451400,"counter":207,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100017#P00500","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1558451400,"counter":208,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100017#P00600","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1558451400,"counter":209,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Proposed Approval by D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann of Sectoral Employment Order (Electrical Contracting Sector) 2019: Referral to Joint Committee","time":1558451400,"counter":210,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100017#P00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1558451400,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That the proposal that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the following Order in draft:Sectoral Employment Order (Electrical Contracting Sector) 2019,a copy of which has been laid in draft form before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 9th May, 2019, be referred to the Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation, in accordance with Standing Order 84A(4)(<i>k<\/i>), which, not later than 30th May, 2019, shall send a message to the D&aacute;il in the manner prescribed in Standing Order 90, and Standing Order 89(2) shall accordingly apply.&rdquo;<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100017#P00900","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1558451400,"counter":212,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna - Questions","time":1558451400,"counter":213,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100017#P01100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Freedom of Information Data","time":1558451400,"counter":214,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100017#P01150"},{"type":"question","time":1558451400,"counter":215,"qnumday":1,"qnumall":"[16349\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100017#P01300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"to set down the number of freedom of information requests received by his Department to date in 2019; and the number of requests fully and partially refused, respectively.

A total of 20 requests were either transferred, withdrawn or handled outside of the Freedom of Information Act.  From January until the end of April this year, my Department received 205 FOI requests.  Of these, 36 were granted, 74 were part granted, seven were refused and no records were held in respect of 32 other requests.  A further 56 requests are still ongoing or were withdrawn, handled outside the freedom of information framework or transferred to another public sector body.<\/p><p>There has been an increase in the number of FOI requests received in my Department since the new Freedom of Information Act came into operation in 2014.  In 2013, my Department received 92 requests.  This figure rose to 290 in 2015 and 490 in 2018, which constitutes a fivefold increase in five years and the upward trend is continuing this year.<\/p><p>Records may be part granted or refused.  Material is redacted for a variety of reasons, as provided for in the Freedom of Information Act.  Examples of grounds commonly used by FOI decision-makers in my Department for withholding material include: where Government records less than five years old are concerned; where the material, if released, could have an adverse impact on the international relations or the economic interests of the State; where commercially sensitive information is involved; or where it is necessary to withhold personal information, such as personal email addresses or mobile telephone numbers.<\/p><p>The majority of requests submitted to my Department are non-personal requests from the media.  All requests received in my Department are processed by designated officials in accordance with the Freedom of Information Acts.  If a requester is not satisfied with an FOI decision, he or she can seek an internal review, followed by appeal to the Information Commissioner.  The freedom of information statutory framework keeps the decision-making process at arm's length from the political head of the Department.  I have no role in the decision-making process for requests received in my Department nor do I see copies of decision letters issuing.

Staff from across the Department are also involved in processing requests in addition to their routine duties, for example, in respect of searching and retrieving records and making decisions on requests received.  At times, complicated and detailed FOI requests are received that involve significant time and resource implications for the staff involved.  Section 8 of the Freedom of Information Act 2014 requires each FOl body to prepare and publish a publication scheme.

He will recall that the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act was one of a suite of transparency reform measures introduced, and it is very important.  Other measures included the Freedom of Information Act, the Protected Disclosures Act, which was to protect whistleblowers, and the Regulation of Lobbying Act, so that we know who is lobbying the Government or senior public officials and to what end.<\/p>  <p>  It was understood that there would be a significant increase in applications once we made the amendments.  They were made to allow for additional freedom of information requests because the Act at that point was so restrictive.  Nevertheless, there are some grounds for concern.  The Taoiseach has given the figures.  There has been a 500% increase in FOI requests in his Department.  That would have been expected because we facilitated it and public transparency was the objective of the exercise.<\/p>  <p>  Last year's findings by the Information Commissioner indicated an unacceptably high response time for FOI requests, and that is concerning.<\/p><p>Is the Taoiseach monitoring these issues himself?  Does the transparency of Government concern him and is he looking at these issues?  I was very anxious to drive the reform agenda as an intrinsic part of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and I presume that is where it still lies.<\/p> <p> I refer to perception.  Less than two years ago a European Commission report found that 86% of Irish people think corruption is a major problem, which is an extraordinary figure, and more than 30% of Irish companies said they believed they had lost out on a public contract due to corruption.  In essence, we need to not only deal with the reality but also deal with the perception, and complete transparency and openness is the way to do that.  Does the Taoiseach take a hands-on view of these matters and will he give me an assurance that the reforms that were brought in will be reviewed to see if we need to go further?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100017#P01700","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558452000,"counter":221,"content":"<p>Over the past number of months there have been two landmark cases concerning the Freedom of Information Act in the Court of Appeal and the High Court.  Those cases, one involving UCC and the other involving Enet, fundamentally undermine the principles of the Act, and have far-reaching consequences when it comes to freedom of information, FOI.  Freedom of information is crucial for any functioning democracy, and the information obtained through FOI requests has served the public interest in shining a light on serious social and political issues in recent years.  The starting point should always be a presumption in favour of disclosure and that amending legislation should be introduced if necessary.  Without the circulation of information regarding public bodies, good and transparent governance is impossible.  Does the Taoiseach believe the Information Commissioner should appeal these judgments to the Supreme Court?

The great benefit of it is that it ensures the public can see the reality of what is occurring as opposed to what the Government wants to present itself as dealing with.  It has been beneficial legislation.  I acknowledge it makes life uncomfortable for civil servants and in many respects, civil servants may have changed their methods of doing work as a result of the Freedom of Information Act.  Nonetheless, it is useful legislation.<\/p>  <p>  I am conscious of the recent decision by the courts, mentioned by Deputy Quinlivan.  They are significant decisions, but I do not know whether the Taoiseach will be able to answer as to whether they should be appealed.  We need to ensure that we do not allow the rights available to both citizens and journalists under the Act to be eroded.  I am also conscious, however, that the Government should try to disclose to the public the actuality of what is happening in government as opposed to waiting for journalists or members of the public to come along and make FOI requests.  It is hard to ignore the fact that in recent days there has been a blizzard of announcements from Departments.  A cynic might suggest that this is to do with the forthcoming local elections, but I am sure the Taoiseach will disabuse me of that notion.  We should be able to get the papers out as to why all of these announcements were made in the run-up to the local elections.  We also had the unusual announcement from the European Commission recently about some funding for Irish farmers.  It, again, seems unusual that such an announcement would be made in the run-up to the EU elections, but I am sure the Taoiseach will disabuse me of those concerns.  If we got the papers out, there would be no difficulty in establishing what the truth is. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100018#Q00300","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1558452000,"counter":223,"content":"<p>Deputy Howlin gave examples of some progressive legislation introduced by the previous Government - often by himself as Minister - relating to FOI, protected disclosures and the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015.  In time, people will see how progressive that legislation was, and many people now look to us as an example or world leader when it comes to some of that legislation, particularly around lobbying.  It is not perfect, but no legislation ever is, and we will need to amend it as we go along.  Other example of reforms put in place by the previous Government that are worthy of mention are further restrictions on political and corporate donations, and spending limits on local elections, which had not existed previously.<\/p>  <p>  Stamping out corruption and the perception of corruption is something in which I take a personal interest.  We produced a white-collar crime and anti-corruption package approximately two years ago, and we review its implementation on an ongoing basis.  Some of it is legislative, involving legislation on money laundering and corruption.  We are also transforming the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, into a much stronger body.  Rather than being an office of the Department, it will be a stand-alone agency in its own right and will be a much tougher, much better resourced body, which will be able to pursue and prosecute white-collar crime.  On foot of the planning tribunals, we will also bring in an independent planning regulator.<\/p>  <p>  My general approach is to be transparent with requests as much as I can.  If something is published on a Department's website, there is no need for an FOI request, and no need for anyone to claim it is some sort of big reveal when they are issued with a rather mundane document.  That is why information on expenses, Government jet use and so on are regularly issued, rather than needing to be subject to an FOI request.<\/p>  <p>  I was asked my opinion on a few judgments, but I have not read them so it is probably better that I do not express an opinion on them.  It is, of course, up to the Information Commissioner to take an appeal should he choose to do so.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the procedures to deal with FOI request used by my Department, we follow the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's code of practice in dealing with FOI requests, and I am satisfied that the Department is following the code.  It is a long-standing practice that successive taoisigh, including myself, as political heads of the Department, have no role whatsoever in processing FOI requests.  When one reads in the papers that I refused to release something or tried to block its release, that is always untrue.  Every request received under FOI is assigned to the FOI unit and the decision-maker in the relevant section of the Department.  The functions of general examination and primary decision-making have been delegated to assistant principal officers, and a few administrative officers, AOs, or higher executive officers, HEOs, in specialist areas who do this in addition to their normal duties.  The function of internal review has been delegated to officials of not below principal officer grade, and all requests are monitored by the Department's liaison officer.<\/p>  <p>  Replies are sometimes issued outside of the normal four-week deadline, and this can happen for a variety of reasons.  Some involve a large number of records, and third parties are sometimes involved who have to be consulted.  In many instances ,the deadline is extended by modest periods by agreement with the requesters, for example, when the decision-maker is busy attending other duties, or for pressure of work reasons.  My Department is committed to meeting its obligations under the Freedom of Information Act 2014, including responding to FOI requests within the specified time frames, and it makes every effort to ensure that the volume of late replies is kept to a minimum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100018#Q00400","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Church-State Relations","time":1558452000,"counter":224,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100018#Q00500"},{"type":"question","time":1558452000,"counter":225,"qnumday":4,"qnumall":"[16388\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100018#Q00600","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"his plans for a new covenant between church and State.

We need to help our institutions and the Catholic Church in their evolution.  It is also important that the political system is not seen as completely disinterested in, or dismissive of, those communities as they are an important part of the overall community.  We have seen what can happen in other countries when one creates a sense in certain communities being ignored or left behind.

Their contribution frames the broad outline of what is happening in the State and suggests where a dialogue with faith communities might fit in.  I suggest some of these authors, who are not from any one community but who have been thinking about this matter, be included at the event the Taoiseach is holding in July.  We should all support a dialogue so that the divestment of our education patronage can proceed and so that we can have diversity in our hospitals and care systems, while not dismissing or undervaluing the benefits that come from faith communities and other communities. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100019#R00100","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1558452600,"counter":231,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach repeated the comments he made at the time of Pope Francis's visit that he believed the time had come for us to build a new relationship between church and State in Ireland and a new covenant for the 21st century.

It is complicated and one probably has to go back to the 16th century Tudor conquest of Ireland to understand its origins, and then to the penal laws and Catholic emancipation.  This would partly explain why, when the country gained its independence, there was such a bias in favour of the Catholic Church.  Prior to that, there had been significant discrimination against the majority Catholics.  Today, however, a significant number of people in the country are not members of the Catholic faith and do not profess any religion but find themselves suffocated by the involvement of religion in their lives.  This is sometimes overstated but in the area of education, if a parent is an atheist and does not wish to bring a child up within a religion but the religion is imposed by the only available national school, that is a problem.  It is imperative that we seek to recognise a new covenant, which will understand the significant and unique role played by the Catholic Church in education in Ireland.  We have to remember that there was a time when no one else in the country provided an education for the majority poor population.  In the 21st century, we need to recognise that parents who do not want their children brought up in a faith-based school should be given the opportunity to exercise that wish.  Similarly, the significant number of parents who want their children educated in a Catholic school, a Church of Ireland school, a Jewish school or an Islamic school should also be facilitated, as diversity works both ways.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100019#R00300","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1558452600,"counter":233,"content":"<p>People before Profit believe in the complete separation of church and State, particularly in health and education, and we think the Government has failed, even in its own terms, in the school divestment programme.  Despite the rhetorical commitment to divestment, 96% of schools continue to be controlled by religious bodies, particularly the Catholic Church.  The Taoiseach is always going on about wanting choice for people, but I will give an example of the failure of the Government to deliver for those who want multidenominational, rather than faith-based, education.  Last night, there was a big public meeting in D&uacute;n Laoghaire attended by hundreds of parents to discuss the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Educate Together school.  After a rather convoluted voting process two years ago, in which people had to vote for which school patron they wanted, there was an overwhelming preference for an Educate Together school but the kids whose parents voted this way have been in prefabs ever since.  One of the parents said, very emotionally, that she had to take her child out of the school she wanted the child to be in, because the child's needs were incompatible with being in prefabs.  The parents asked where the permanent site was, which parliamentary questions had indicated would be provided a year ago.  It is not on.  This is an aspect of how, even at this level, the choice the Government talks about is not being provided.  It is completely unacceptable for kids to still be in prefabs.  It has been revealed today that &euro;100 million has been spent over the past six years by the Government to keep children in prefabs rather than permanent school buildings.  Can the Taoiseach comment on that?  Will he look into the issue a permanent school for D&uacute;n Laoghaire Educate Together?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100019#R00400","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1558452600,"counter":234,"content":"<p>This is an important subject and it is not straightforward.  I very much welcome the dialogue promised by the Taoiseach but I am not sure what the new covenant means.  It sounds good but I do not know what will come out of it.  It is an ambition worth exploring.  Most of us who have been in the House a long time will recall the two previous referenda on divorce.  If we contrast those with the ongoing referendum on the same matter, we will see how transformed society is but it has been transformed in a complicated way.  The latest census revealed that nearly one in ten people registered in Ireland has no religion and that an increasingly large number have a variety of faiths, who all have to be accommodated.<\/p>  <p>  As I have, the Taoiseach has talked to senior Catholic Church figures about divestment and these are important matters.  We do not want to build a set of parallel education establishments to create individual silos, which has happened in other countries as they became multicultural.  We have siloed populations and that causes a difficulty into the future so we have to give some care and some thought to how we are going to structure the new shape of education in Ireland.  People need to have a legitimate choice over whether to have a faith-based education but this should not be done in a way that is separated out from different faiths.  The consequences of doing so can be seen in Northern Ireland, where the separation of faith schools has made a contribution to the separation of society.  We have to think carefully about the future and I would be interested in a structured dialogue in this House first, so that we can share views and see how we can move forward in building a new education system and a new health provision system that are not replicas of what exists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100019#R00500","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1558453200,"counter":235,"content":"<p>I very much agree with Deputy Eamon Ryan's initial sentiments on this issue and I will consider whether we should include other thinkers in the dialogue in the meeting that is going to happen in July and whether we should precede that with some sort of debate here in the House as well.<\/p>  <p>  When I talk about a new covenant, I suppose what I mean is what I said at the time - a relationship in which the church and faith-based organisations are no longer at the centre of Irish life but one in which they still have a place.  That is what I would like the main topic and the high-level topic of the discussion in July to be about.  It is not for me to determine the outcome of that dialogue but to offer my opinion.  It is probably a new relationship that is more about pluralism than about absolute secularism.  That means, for example, in education greater choice for parents through the availability of more Educate Together schools, community national schools and Gaelscoileanna, and the divestment of some existing religious schools to the community sector should parents want that, while still having a role for State funding of faith-based charities and voluntary organisations, whether those are our hospices like the St. Francis Hospice and Our Lady's Hospice and Care Services.  An absolute secularist approach would see their funding taken away or their being taken over and the voluntarism and ethos that exist there removed.  I would not agree with that.  We see how many faith-based organisations have made a huge contribution to helping us deal with the housing shortage, whether it be Crosscare or Depaul.  If we took an absolute secularist approach, we would either defund them or take them over.  I am not sure that would be the right approach.  In fact, I am sure it would not be.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of school buildings, we have a massive school building programme under way.  New schools are being built throughout the country.  There are extensions and refurbishments, but there are also a lot of prefabs.  They need to be replaced, but as is always the case, we have to prioritise.  Due to the demographic bulge that we have had in recent years, we have had to prioritise new schools where there would otherwise have been no school over refurbishments and extensions to remove prefabs.  However, as the birth rate falls, and it has been falling for a couple of years, there is an opportunity for us to do more refurbishments and to replace more prefabs in the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett asked specifically about the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Educate Together national school.  This is something that the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, raised with me only today.  I am advised that there are multiple school site requirements in the south Dublin city area, including for the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Educate Together national school.  Several viable site options have been identified and are being progressed with relevant stakeholders, including State bodies.  Once all the critical information is to hand, a determination regarding the optimal configuration of school sites will be made.

All areas of our lives are being transformed as these technologies become embedded in daily life, supporting greater connectivity and more personalised products and services.  Technologies like artificial intelligence and robotics are already disrupting entire industries.<\/p>  <p>  Digitalisation also poses major questions as to how governments legislate, regulate and deliver public services.  The Government is developing a new national digital strategy to help Ireland maximise the economic and societal benefits from digitalisation and its transformative effects.  The strategy is a shared effort by the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  An interdepartmental group, which includes representatives from all Departments, is guiding the formation of the strategy.  This approach reflects the broad spread of policy areas impacted by digitalisation.<\/p>  <p>  The strategy is being shaped by insights from Departments and agencies, public consultation, stakeholder engagement and expert consultations with academia and industry.  A public consultation to allow citizens and stakeholders to feed in and influence the development of the strategy took place at the end of last year.  More than 300 responses were received.  In parallel, there were extensive consultations with stakeholders and experts.<\/p>  <p>  The strategy will set out Ireland's vision and ambition across thematic areas, including digital infrastructure and security, trust and well-being, effective use of digital by citizens, communities, enterprise and government, and the digital economy's impact on the labour market.  Importantly, it will also position Ireland internationally and within the European Union, where we are active promoters of the digital Single Market.  I anticipate that it will emphasise issues such as connectivity, cybersecurity, greater use of open data, proactive regulation, public trust in digital, improved online public services, greater understanding of digital well-being, digital skills, and the digital intensity of SMEs.

The key difference between the two is ownership of the assets at the end of the contract term.  In gap funding, the bidder would own the assets outright.  If there was a concession agreement, the State would be the ultimate owner.<\/p>  <p>  In July 2016, the then Minister, Deputy Naughten, stated that he was advised that, under a full concession model, the entire cost of the project would be placed on the Government's balance sheet, with serious implications for the available capital funding for other critical expenditure items such as climate change, housing and health, which he said he could not justify.  In short, he implied that the gap funding model would not appear on the Government's balance sheet and that that was the reason for it being selected.  According to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's memo to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, in January, however, either option would ensure that all of the assets and their cost would be classified as on-balance sheet.

These precise IT corporations - Google, Facebook, Apple and all the rest of them - pay pitiful percentages in tax.  In most cases, they pay less than 1% in tax.  As we know, many of them are based here.  In light of the challenges for our society that are posed by the IT revolution, some of the impacts of which revolution are adverse, does the Taoiseach not think it would be fair and reasonable for these people to pay a little bit more tax?

Will the Taoiseach tell us what is happening in respect of the strategy that was announced more than six months ago?  It is was promised at that time that the public submissions would be published, but they have not yet been published.  I would be interested to hear why that is the case.  The national digital strategy has probably become entangled with the national broadband plan, the history of which we all know too much about.  Is the national digital strategy completely entwined with the broadband plan or is it separate?  What is the reason for the delay?  It is important to note in the context of what Deputy Boyd Barrett has said that we are having progressively more serious problems with bullying of young people as a result of the online activities of others.  The Houses of the Oireachtas will have to deal with this issue at some stage.  I agree that the technology companies need to take active steps to deal with bullying.  They need to fund sections within their companies to ensure there is an anti-bullying czar.  They need to target online bullying actively in the same way that they actively target the receipt of money from advertisers.  If they put the same effort into tackling bullying that they put into accumulating profits, I do not think we would have a problem with online bullying.

It seeks to balance the opportunities and benefits provided by the Internet with the need to ensure people are informed and supported to deal with the risks.  The implementation of these actions is under way across relevant Departments and agencies.  The key achievements of the action plan to date include the creation of an online safety hub; the establishment of the new National Advisory Council for Online Safety, NACOS, which is advising the Government on Internet safety policy issues; the establishment of a new cybercrime area of responsibility in the Department of Justice and Equality; the development of dedicated advice hubs for young people, parents and teachers; the provision of new digital capacity and resources for primary schools and public libraries; and the roll-out of mental health initiatives, including media campaigns and text line supports.  The newly formed NACOS recently issued a progress report on its work, which included proposals for the development of practical guidance for online safety, the adoption of a proposal to conduct a phased research project on online safety during 2019 and the provision of an Irish research base to inform policymaking on further research.  The members of NACOS are drawn from a range of stakeholder groups and sectors, including representatives of children's and parents' organisations and major online platforms and experts on online matters.<\/p>  <p>  The Digital Safety Commissioner Bill 2017, which was introduced by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, has been referred to the relevant Oireachtas committee and is the subject of detailed scrutiny.  The Bill presents a number of legal and operational issues, including the absence of a definition of the \"harmful content\" about which the proposed commissioner would exercise his or her takedown powers.  The Action Plan for Online Safety covers a range of activities that are relevant to the proposed office of digital safety commissioner, including education and awareness raising, communicating with the public, and oversight and consultative structures.  The action plan contains a commitment that the Government will engage with the issues raised by the Bill and highlight the upcoming transposition of the revised audiovisual media services directive, which requires member states to put in place oversight structures for video sharing platform services.  On 4 March last, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment gave a speech in which he outlined new proposals for legislation to tackle the spread of harmful online content.  He launched a six-week public consultation on the regulation of harmful content on online platforms and the implementation of the revised audiovisual media services directive to seek views on the shape that the proposed legislation should take.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, plans to bring a draft proposal to the Cabinet for the development of an online safety and media regulation Bill and a regulator, including an online safety commissioner.<\/p>  <p>  As I have mentioned in the D&aacute;il previously, the initial five models were reduced to two - the gap funding model and the concession model.  The gap funding model was adopted by the Government on the advice of the then Minister, Deputy Naughten, having been assessed on a number of occasions by the Government and independently.  One of the advantages of the gap funding model is that it involves a lower cost for the taxpayer.  As we are all aware, some people feel that &euro;3 billion is too much to invest in rural broadband.  I do not agree with that.  There are many people who feel that &euro;3 billion is too high a cost to connect 1.1 million people to high-speed broadband.  It would have cost more - upwards of &euro;3 billion - if we had gone for the concession model.  The gap funding model also involves greater risk sharing by the private sector.  As people know, under this arrangement the risk for the public sector and for taxpayers is capped, but the risk for the private sector is not.  Crucially, this arrangement incentivises the company to continue to upgrade the fibre and the fibre optics, which would not necessarily be the case if it were being handed over to the State at the end of 25 or 30 years.  As I have said previously, the real infrastructure, the thousands of poles and ducts throughout the country, is privately owned.  It went into private ownership 20 years ago when Telecom &Eacute;ireann was privatised as Eircom.  The only physical asset that could possibly revert to the State would be the fibre running within privately owned ducts.  That fibre has to be replaced every 25 or 30 years in any event.  This system is cheaper, involves greater risk sharing by the private sector and incentivises the private sector to invest in upgrading that fibre.<\/p>  <p>  We are working on the assumption that all of this will fall on the Government balance sheet.  This really arose on foot of EUROSTAT's decision to classify Irish Water and, more recently, some affordable housing bodies in the UK as being on the Government balance sheet.  That may yet change.  This is a &euro;5 billion to &euro;6 billion project.  Less than half of the money is coming from the taxpayers of this State in subsidies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100021#T00300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1558453800,"counter":249,"content":"<p>Why did the former Minister, Deputy Naughten, believe it was off-balance sheet?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100021#T00400","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1558453800,"counter":250,"content":"<p>We decided, in the interests of caution and prudence, to assume it is all on the balance sheet unless EUROSTAT decides otherwise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100021#T00500","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1558453800,"counter":251,"content":"<p>It just gets worse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100021#T00600","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speech","time":1558453800,"counter":252,"content":"<p>That is the reverse of the mistake that was made in the case of Irish Water, when it was assumed that it would be off-balance sheet, but it was not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100021#T00700","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1558453800,"counter":253,"content":"<p>The former Minister said it was all off-balance sheet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100021#T00800","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1558453800,"counter":254,"content":"<p>I cannot answer questions on behalf of the former Minister, unfortunately.

A cost-benefit analysis benefits report and a detailed benefits calculation annex were published in 2015.  This analysis was updated over the last four years and the finalised cost-benefit analysis was published earlier this month.  Alternative options for delivering high speed broadband were also considered in the context of only one bidder remaining in the process and this analysis has also been published.  Each of these alternatives was considered against the cost-benefit analysis framework.  In stress testing a number of alternative options, it is not expected that a full cost-benefit analysis will be carried out.  Rather, the approach is to evaluate the salient changes that other options would bring in the context of the general framework of benefits and costs.  Some options sought to reduce the area covered, alter the technology, delay the roll-out or alter the model underpinning the tender.  This all involved an examination of costs, potential changes in timing and roll-out, state aid requirements and so forth, depending on the alternative under consideration.  That analysis concluded that these alternatives would take longer to reach 100% of the premises in the intervention area and in some scenarios would involve leaving some premises behind.  In addition, the analysis concluded that the alternatives considered could potentially result in a higher cost to the State and would require a consultation on a new strategy, along with a new procurement process and state aid application.

The directive requires member states to prepare a national air pollution control programme, NAPCP, to identify the programmes and measures that will deliver on these reduction targets.  Ireland&rsquo;s NAPCP is currently open for public consultation.  <\/p><p>While Ireland&rsquo;s air quality compares favourably with more industrialised and urbanised countries, we have specific challenges which need attention.  In terms of overall annual emissions, we have a particular problem with ammonia from agriculture and, to a lesser extent, with NMVOCs and NOx.<\/p><p>Separate from annual emission levels, Ireland faces challenges with ambient air pollution - the concentration of a particular pollutant at a particular place and time.  Thresholds for ambient air are established in the clean air for Europe directive, 2008\/50\/EC.  We have a problem with particulate matter in our smaller towns and villages, associated with the burning of solid fuel for domestic heating.

By that, I mean online communication as opposed to visible, verbal communication in that something written online can be interpreted in a very different way when compared to the same thing being communicated face-to-face, given there is no body language, no tone of voice and so on, which means things can often be misinterpreted.<\/p>  <p>  Second, when inappropriate behaviour happens online, in particular cyberbullying, which affects the mental health side, we have to educate people and give them the tools and equipment to be able to deal with that and to understand the nuances behind it.

It is a maturing environment and we are trying to alter the culture for our young people as they grow up.

In stress testing a number of alternative options, it is not expected for a full cost-benefit analysis of each to be carried out.   Rather, the approach is to evaluate the salient changes that other options would bring and evaluate them in the context of the general framework of benefits and costs. Some options sought to reduce the area covered, to alter the technology, to delay the roll-out or to alter the model underpinning the tender.  All of this involved an examination of costs, potential changes, state aid requirements etc.<\/p>  <p>  In developing alternative options, my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform were in regular and ongoing engagement.

That fails to recognise the tremendous amount of money that will be spent in marketing, connecting and building a customer base that is projected to comprise 400,000 customers after the 25-year period.  The asset in question here is the value of that connection and monopoly access to that pool of customers and its revenue-generating capacity.  As the Minister has indicated in this House, each of those customers will pay &euro;30 per month.  It does not take a mathematician to work out the value of that.

The individual tenderer which has now been successful has to conclude deals with subcontractors.  If we publish the tentative costings, it will undermine the ability of that tenderer to get value.  Similarly, if we priced those alternatives and published those costings, we would undermine our ability to get value for money for the taxpayer if in the end it does not go ahead and we have to go back to the market.  That is the reason for the redaction.<\/p>  <p>  The development of the customer base is crucial to the success of this company.  However, the company carries that risk entirely.  One of the oft-cited critiques by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform concerned what will happen if this company does not get sufficient take-up.  In that eventuality the company is at risk, not the State.  That is included in the terms.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding whether this is going to be a huge and lucrative company, I pointed out that this is an entirely regulated price.  There is a fixed price which is currently set in the contract and in the future will be set by ComReg.  It is comparable to the price in urban areas.  There is not some super-price to be charged in rural areas.  It is the same price.  The projected turnover on the take-up the Deputy refers to is &euro;150 million.  Some &euro;220 million of investment will be made in equity and working capital.  That gives an idea of the scale of the company.

The State will be left to pick up the tab.  When one looks at it in the round, it is an exceptionally bad deal and there is potential for further delays.  If at some inflection point the contractor walks away, it will take the Minister some time to pick up the pieces and start the roll-out again.  None of this seems to have been factored in.  This undertaking was entirely based on the belief that this was the only option.  The Government has been taking that approach for four years.  The fundamentals have changed on so many occasions and the Government has simply proceeded with the same approach, hoping for some other outcome.  When one gets into the detail, it beggars belief.

This approach has been worked out as the best way of protecting the State while creating an incentive for the operator to continue to invest, upgrade and future-proof the network.

There is an agenda in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  On legislation, the committee did not envisage separate sectoral legislation but rather legislation that would create a set of targets, namely, five-year budgets, as referred to by the Deputy, with the responsible Ministers to report back within those targets to the Oireachtas.  A set of legislative measures in each sector is not envisaged; it is more about creating a framework and seeking that the players within those sectors act creatively to deliver on the targets.  It will not all be regulation.  I recognise that in certain areas we will need to look at regulations by way of statutory instrument or fresh legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100029#BB00300","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Climate Change Adaptation Plans","time":1558458600,"counter":356,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100029#BB00350"},{"type":"question","time":1558458600,"counter":357,"qnumday":59,"qnumall":"[21476\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100029#BB00400","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the steps he is taking to ensure that a just transition is a key element of the forthcoming All of Government Plan on Climate Disruption; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1369","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1558458600,"counter":358,"content":"<p>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to take this question on behalf of Deputy Burke.

In that light, we need to ensure that policy is in place to support transition for those worst affected.<\/p>  <p>  A range of measures will be considered in this context, including helping enterprises and workers in sectors particularly affected to adapt; ensuring that revenues from carbon prices are transferred back to help households cope and adapt; developing the economic opportunities that will come with the scaling up of renewables, retrofitting, managing resources in a sustainable way and smarter working and living; and, in particular, that regions particularly affected benefit from these economic opportunities.  It will also involve building climate resilience into the framework for key funds for climate action, rural and urban regeneration and disruptive technologies in order that early movement can protect our communities.<\/p>  <p>  The work we are undertaking in the midlands embracing a whole-of-Government approach and along with Bord na M&oacute;na, enterprise agencies, education institutions, social protection agencies and local stakeholders to commence planning and development of policy is providing a working model which can be developed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100029#BB00600","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1558458600,"counter":360,"content":"<p>As the Minister indicated, some sectors will be affected more than others.

Since then several things have changed.  In the area covering the Dublin 2 and Dublin 1 postcodes, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has started impounding and detaining these vehicles and taking them away.  In recent times, the Road Safety Authority, RSA, has decided to update the advice on its website in respect of these vehicles.  The website was not clear.  Perhaps this reflects the lack of clarity in the law.<\/p>  <p>  One year ago, I raised this issue with the Minister in a parliamentary question as a member of the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport.  I forewarned of this issue.  At the time, the Minister said it was not envisaged that the position with regard to the need for regulation or legislation in respect of these vehicles would change in the immediate future.  Does he now accept that the position has changed and that there is a need to clarify in law and regulation the status of these vehicles?<\/p>  <p>  In the past hour, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party has belatedly agreed with this position and is launching its proposed legislation on the plinth at 2.30 p.m. tomorrow.  This is to be welcomed, as is further focus on this issue.  I wish we had foresight in respect of the problems that have so predictably arisen with this new technology.  We must now nevertheless legislate for it in hindsight.  Fianna F&aacute;il's move in this regard is welcome.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, I met representatives of several institutions and companies that are interested in this area.  Many of them are setting up in this country and many others have started operating here.  I met representatives of several companies on the DCU Alpha campus in Glasnevin.  They are world leaders in creating technology in this sector.  It is impressive stuff.  Ireland could become a leader in this area but to do so requires foresight to allow the sector to grow and develop.<\/p>  <p>  In the absence of law, there are now far in excess of 2,000 users of these vehicles in the city.  Lest we forget, they are also used in many European cities where they are effective.  They are a reflection of many of the values the Government espouses, including many of the aspirations of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  They are green and environmental.  They reduce congestion and increase the onus on us to improve cycle lane investment.  I am at a loss to understand why the Department has been stonewalling on this issue for so long and why responsibility for it has been handed to the Road Safety Authority one full year after I first raised it in the House.  I am also at a loss as to why we have been reactive instead of proactive on this issue. <\/p>  <p>  In reply to my most recent of many parliamentary questions, the Minister cited several international experiences that were negative.  Much of what was put to me on the record in reply to my parliamentary questions about the international experience was not correct and was, in fact, erroneous.  There are many positive international experiences and lessons that could be brought to bear in light of the first wave of these vehicles that occurred some years ago.  We can now do things with technology that we could not do three or four years ago to safeguard pedestrians and other road users as well as allow for the effective and safe use of these vehicles.<\/p>  <p>  I was surprised and alarmed by the conservative approach taken in the most recent reply to my parliamentary question.  I would welcome it if the Minister clarified his remarks.  I would welcome some clarity in respect of the overall issue.  Is the Road Safety Authority report available?

I will start by advising the Deputy of the current legal position in respect of such vehicles.  It is important that we get such clarity on the matter before we go any further or make any statement about it.  The Road Traffic Act 1961 defines a mechanically propelled vehicle as a vehicle intended or adapted for propulsion by mechanical means, including a bicycle or tricycle with an attachment for propelling it by mechanical power, whether or not the attachment is being used.  It also includes a vehicle, the means of propulsion of which is electrical or partly electrical and partly mechanical.  Electric scooters and powered skateboards fall into this category and are, therefore, considered to be mechanically propelled vehicles.  Any users of such vehicles in a public place, as defined in the Road Traffic Act 1961, must have insurance, road tax and a driving licence.  There are penalties under road traffic laws, including fixed charge notices, penalty points, fines and possible seizure of the vehicle, for not being in compliance with these requirements.<\/p>  <p>  As it is currently not possible to tax or insure electric scooters or electric skateboards, they are not considered suitable for use in a public place.  As the Deputy knows, I have requested the Road Safety Authority to research how electric scooters and other such vehicles are regulated in other countries, particularly other EU member states.  I am keen to understand the road safety implications of the use of such vehicles on public roads, especially when interacting with other vehicles.  Road safety is paramount.  I am due to receive the outcome of the authority's research within the next few weeks.  Until I have received it, I will not make a decision on what actions, if any, to take.  I will need to be persuaded that permitting such vehicles on our roads will not give rise to safety concerns for the users themselves and for all other road users, including cyclists, pedestrians and motorists.  In this context, I expect the Road Safety Authority to include in its consideration whether there is a potential inability of the scooterist to obey some basic rules of the road; difficulties with lighting electric scooters so that they are easily visible to other road users; the absence of suspension or shock absorption, which places the scooterist in danger on an uneven road surface; and insurance issues in the event of a collision.  The Deputy should further note that, should I decide the benefits derived from the use of electric scooters outweigh the risks associated with using this type of transport, an amendment to primary legislation would be required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100031#DD01000","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1558459800,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  The genesis of this issue, and of the different perspectives from which we are coming at it, arises from the definition of a mechanically propelled vehicle in law.  There is an ambiguity in this regard.  For instance, the Minister referred in his answer to a vehicle being powered by mechanical means.  He needs to clarify his answer in that regard because it raises a question as to whether he meant a vehicle that can solely be powered by mechanical means.  The Minister left out the crucial word \"solely\".  He has effectively dragged electric bicycles into this grey area along with electric scooters on account of the vagueness of his answer.  He gave a similar answer to a previous parliamentary question.<\/p><p>As anyone who uses an electric scooter or who has watched the RT&Eacute; \"Prime Time\" report on them knows, it is impossible to achieve 100% of any journey on an electric scooter without manually intervening.  One needs a manual intervention to start up these vehicles, and must reach 5 km\/h via manual propulsion to start them.  It is only then that an electric motor kicks in, and one continues the journey from there.  The journey is, therefore, not 100% mechanically propelled and, accordingly, it is commensurate under the current law with electric bicycles.  There is no threshold for which a mechanically propelled vehicle can be defined in law currently.  The vagueness of the law needs urgent clarification.  The incomplete understanding of various State agencies is exactly why there is ambiguity right now.  That ambiguity is precisely what will end up being challenged in court and it, therefore, needs to be clarified in law urgently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100031#DD01100","speaker":"1304","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558460400,"counter":392,"content":"<p>The Deputy is asking me to take a position on this before the RSA completes its report.

The purpose of seeking it is to get clarity from the Minister of State on the timelines for the implementation of the section of the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018 that relates to minimum unit pricing.  I emphasise once again the futility of enacting this Part of the Act in the absence of any similar minimum pricing in the North of Ireland.  The rumour has been doing the rounds in the trade, from the chambers of commerce to Retail Excellence Ireland members and some members of the Vintner's Federation of Ireland, that the Department may be on the verge of enacting or implementing this Part.  Every Member will be aware of the importance of minimum unit pricing and a majority of this House, including myself, saw, and still see, fit that this Part be enacted.  When we debated this issue, the necessity that this legislation would have to operate simultaneously on the island of Ireland was flagged, otherwise there would be an outflow of shoppers to the North of Ireland, not just to buy alcohol, but to do their weekly shopping as well, thus inflicting problems on the retail industry, be they pubs, bars, off-licence trade, or the livelihoods of small shopkeepers who lose out to the larger supermarket outlets, particularly in the Border region.  In 2015, when he was Minister for Health, the Taoiseach stated in the Seanad:<\/p><blockquote>While we are not writing it into the Bill, it is our intention to go ahead with minimum pricing at the same time as Northern Ireland.  We have an agreement with the Northern Ireland Executive that it will also introduce minimum unit pricing.  We intend to do it at the same time for all the obvious reasons.  It would be totally counterproductive if people just went north of the Border.  While it is not written into the legislation, as we do not want to totally tie our hands, it is certainly the intention.<\/blockquote><p>The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, when addressing the issue in the Seanad in 2017 stated: <\/p><blockquote>I take the point about Northern Ireland and acknowledge Senators from the Border area, including Senators O'Reilly, Wilson, Gallagher and any I have missed, who raised this issue.  I understand that we always have to be conscious on the island of Ireland of the impact of what we do in one area on the other.<\/blockquote><p>He went on to state:<\/p><blockquote>There is a Government decision on trying to do this alongside Northern Ireland.  We need a government to talk to in Northern Ireland but that is for another day.  Northern Ireland was moving in this direction but the Government will commence this at an appropriate time.  The purpose of the Bill is to put the legislative framework in place to enable the Government do that.<\/blockquote><p>I support the Taoiseach and the Minister of Health's stances on that and the need to continue with it, once we have similarity in approach both north and south of the Border.  The activities of some supermarkets in using alcohol as a loss leader, especially last Christmas, were probably the most extreme abuse of alcohol as a product to date.  In one outlet, a bottle of Captain Morgan rum was on sale at &euro;10, when the combined excise and VAT on that product was &euro;12.30.  Another outlet was selling six bottles of wine with a 25% discount and a &pound;10 voucher.  This offer, again, was below the combined excise and VAT for the product.  I could go on, but I would not want to blame the Minister of State for being tempted to introduce minimum unit pricing on account of this activity, as what is often missed is that the State is subsidising this activity of below-cost selling through the VAT system.  I urge him not to be influenced by that greed<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100032#EE00700","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speech","time":1558460400,"counter":398,"content":"<p>I am stepping in for the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris.  I thank Deputy Breathnach for raising this important issue.  The Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018 was enacted on 17 October 2018.  Its primary policy objectives are to reduce alcohol consumption to 9.1 litres of pure alcohol per person per annum by 2020; delay the initiation of alcohol consumption by children and young people; reduce the harms caused by the misuse of alcohol; and regulate the supply and price of alcohol in order to minimise the possibility and incidence of alcohol-related harm.  These objectives were developed in recognition that alcohol causes harms to health and significant costs to the Exchequer, and that alcohol consumption in Ireland remains very high.<\/p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Act provides for a minimum price of alcohol products of 10 cent per gram of alcohol.  Government approval was originally given in 2013 for the introduction of minimum unit pricing of alcohol on the basis that it would be introduced simultaneously in the North of Ireland.  As the Executive in the North of Ireland is not currently operating, minimum unit pricing cannot be introduced there and, therefore, the Minister for Health is constrained from implementing this measure due to a circumstance that was not foreseen in the original decision.  As he outlined in the Seanad last October, he intends to return to the Government to seek approval for this measure and will do so shortly.  Minimum unit pricing will target cheaper alcohol relative to its strength because the price is determined by and is directly proportionate to the volume of pure alcohol in the drink.  This means that the price of individual products will depend on their strength.  It sets a floor price beneath which alcohol cannot legally be sold and targets products that are currently very cheap relative to their strength.<\/p><p>A sample application of a 10 cent minimum price per gram shows that it will affect only the cheapest of products sold in off-licences.  The prices of products sold in the licensed trade are unlikely to be impacted by a minimum price of 10 cent per gram.  A pub measure of whiskey would cost &euro;1.12, a measure of vodka would be &euro;1.05 and a pint of Heineken lager, Guinness stout and Bulmers cider would be &euro;2.25, &euro;1.89 and &euro;2.02, respectively.  The aim of minimum unit pricing is to target harmful drinkers - those who drink so much that they are putting their health in danger.  The measure is targeted and it attempts to minimise the impact on moderate drinkers and the minimum price will make little difference to those who only drink low or moderate volumes of alcohol.<\/p> <p> Effectively, the price of alcohol products will depend on their strength.  Minimum pricing is considered effective because international evidence shows that those who consume alcohol at harmful levels tend to purchase cheaper alcohol relative to moderate drinkers and, therefore, the policy impacts harmful drinkers the most.  In addition, a minimum price will mean that strong alcohol products are not cheaply available for children and young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100032#EE00800","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558461000,"counter":400,"content":"<p>Will the Minister confirm that the Department will introduce this portion of the Bill shortly?

I am going to speak for the small businesses that will be seriously affected by the introduction of this.  Unless there is a reciprocal arrangement on an all-island basis, we will go back to the days of smuggling, illicit trade and losses to both businesses and Revenue.

It is a condition that involves a great deal of management and it can involve a great deal of hardship.  It involves invasive finger-prick tests and so on.  I attended a protest at Cork University Hospital, CUH, yesterday morning, led by the parents and families of children and teenagers who have type 1 diabetes.  Their frustration has been building up over some time at the lack of services and the difficulty they have in seeing a consultant at CUH.  They were full of praise for the support they got from nurses in the hospital and for the consultant, Dr. Stephen O'Riordan, who is alone responsible for some 400 children and teenagers with type 1 diabetes, as well as for all sorts of other endocrinology disciplines such as Addison's disease, thyroid disease and coeliac conditions.  More than 200 children are currently waiting to be seen in CUH, of whom almost 30 have been waiting for more than a year, with many more waiting between six and eight months.  International best practice recommends that children and teenagers with type 1 diabetes be seen every three to four months but the HSE is falling far short of that in respect of these children in Cork and the surrounding areas.<\/p><p>One of the parents told <i>The Evening Echo<\/i>in Cork that her son, who suffers from type 1 diabetes, had not seen a consultant endocrinologist for almost two years, since one of the consultants retired.  That is not good enough.  These parents feel let down and they are worried.  There is evidence that suggests the better care one receives when young, the less likely one's condition will deteriorate or that there will be further complications later in life so it is vitally important that these children and teenagers get a quality service when they are young.  They are not getting that at the moment and this is causing a great deal of anxiety and worry for their parents, as well as discomfort for the children and teenagers themselves.<\/p><p>The issue of psychological support was also raised.  This condition can be traumatic and can cause stress for children but it has been difficult for them to get support in this area too.

Regarding paediatric diabetic services generally, the Deputy may be aware that the HSE developed a model of care for paediatrics and neonatology in Ireland to underpin the delivery of healthcare for children, both in the present and into the future.  Key steps in its development were wide consultation with all healthcare professionals, involvement with parents and parent groups, a detailed analysis of the current clinical activity of all paediatric medical and surgical subspecialties, including paediatric endocrinology and diabetes, and a study of how paediatric clinical care is distributed with reference to international best standards.  The HSE model of care for paediatrics includes the proposed model of care for paediatric diabetes services.<\/p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>High-quality diabetes care is complex and requires intensive consultant-delivered care.  It is recognised that diabetes care provided by a multidisciplinary team, including clinical nurse specialists, dietetics, social work and clinical psychology, results in fewer days in hospital, a higher level of participation in diabetes self-care practices, decreased readmission rates and delayed development of complications.  Diabetes technology also provides an opportunity to improve control and quality of life in selected patients and is expanding rapidly, with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, or pump therapy, increasingly used in the paediatric population.<\/p> <p> The model for service provision proposes that all hospitals providing acute paediatric care will have staff trained in the acute care of newly diagnosed diabetes.  Children whose diabetes is diagnosed in level 1 hospitals that do not have access to a paediatrician with endocrinology training will be referred to their nearest diabetes multidisciplinary team once they have been stabilised in accordance with local agreed guidelines.  In addition, the HSE has advised that seven clinical guidelines have been published and disseminated to the delivery system to guide and support service delivery to this patient cohort.<\/p> <p> Regarding services in the Cork area specifically, CUH is a centre for paediatric diabetes and provides care for patients in the south west.  More than 400 paediatric patients attend the diabetes service in CUH, with one to two new cases of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, IDDM, diagnoses per week.  The paediatric diabetes service in the hospital has provision for two consultants, 2.8 diabetes nurse specialists and one dietician.  The second consultant post is currently being recruited for and the candidate is expected to take up the position in January 2020.  CUH is working actively to expedite this start date and, in the interim, is seeking to secure a locum consultant endocrinologist.

It is a fact that, since the CUMH opened in 2007, that theatre has remained closed.  Last January, Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, others and I attended a briefing from Professor John Higgins, the clinical director of the maternity directorate in the South\/South West hospital group.  He provided an update on the positive and significant progress that had been made in dealing with what had been a lengthy gynaecology outpatient waiting list at CUMH.  It was as long as 4,700 women in April 2017, but the latest parliamentary reply that I received from the Minister, which issued just last week, puts the outpatient waiting list at 1,854.  That is a reduction of almost 3,000.  I acknowledge the work of everyone involved in the maternity directorate in achieving that.  The directorate at CUMH also covers University Hospital Kerry, University Hospital Waterford and South Tipperary General Hospital.  The initiatives that it has taken to eat into the backlog have proven successful.  Many of the consultant gynaecologists at the hospital commenced additional gynaecology outpatient clinics out of hours; a weekly outreach outpatients' clinic was held in the Mallow primary healthcare centre; the number of new patients seen at all clinics was increased; additional daily gynaecology clinics were set up from July 2018; and, in January of this year, a comprehensive drive to see an additional 500 outpatients at out-of-hours clinics was planned.  To my knowledge, the consultants achieved that, which contributed to the reduction.  While I welcome all of these initiatives, I do not want women simply being transferred from the outpatient list to the inpatient and surgery waiting lists.  This concern is shared by the clinicians.<\/p>  <p>  The second operating theatre has lain idle since 2007.<\/p><p>In recent times, however, CUMH has rented theatre space in the Mater Private Hospital in Cork.  While I do not have any ideological hang-up about the use of spare capacity in the private system, I believe the operating theatre that is lying idle in the CUMH building should be put into use in the first instance.  I understand that the Minister, Deputy Harris, signed off on the gynaecology business case, which involved initiatives for dealing with the outpatient waiting lists, in 2017.  We need the funding and the staffing to be provided in order that the second theatre can be opened without any further delay.  I am not a medic and nor is the Minister of State, but both of us are well aware of the impact of this delay on the quality of life of many women who are on the waiting list for inpatient and day case surgery procedures.  Some of them are continuing to wait long periods.  The overall number of women on the waiting list is 421, some 12 of whom have been waiting for over two years, a further 23 of whom have been waiting for between 18 and 24 months and a further 31 of whom have been waiting for between 12 and 18 months.

I welcome the opportunity to address the House on it.  The HSE advises that while it has not been possible to provide funding this year for the opening of the second gynaecology theatre, a new commissioning process has been established by the HSE through which all proposals for funding will be considered within the framework of the annual Estimates process.  I am advised that the HSE is reviewing all possible ways to achieve a sustainable solution to the challenges being experienced in CUMH in the short and medium terms.  It has advised that the possibility of NTPF support is an option that will be considered.  It has further advised that a funded and targeted waiting list initiative is under way in Cork specifically to address the gynaecology outpatient waiting list in the region.  This has resulted in a decrease in the number of patients on the outpatient waiting list from 5,000 in early 2017 to just over 1,500 patients on 2 May last.  The South\/South West hospital group is aiming to reduce this number to 1,000 by June 2019.  The initiatives being pursued to meet this target include the commencement of additional out-of-hours gynaecology outpatient clinics, the commencement in November 2018 of a weekly outreach outpatient clinic at Mallow primary health centre in conjunction with the GPs in the clinic, an increase in the number of new patients being seen at all clinics and the establishment of additional daily gynaecology clinics from July 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Last year, the support of the South\/South West hospital group and funding from the NTPF to the CUMH enabled the treatment of 87 long waiters from the waiting list.

The total that is due to be received from NTPF in 2019 is over &euro;630,000.  The Department of Health recently convened a working group to develop a scheduled care improvement plan.  The objective of this working group, which comprises representatives of the HSE and the NTPF as well as departmental officials, is to examine medium to long-term initiatives to improve access to outpatient services, in particular.  Gynaecology will be among the specialties examined by the working group.  The group is examining the current models of care, the current and projected demand and capacity of services, the short-term, medium-term and long-term initiatives to improve access for patients at community and acute hospital level, the best way to move care to more appropriate settings and the best way to provide care at the lowest level of complexity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100035#HH00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1558462200,"counter":412,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.  The bottom line is that the women in Cork and surrounding counties who are on the waiting list for day case procedures and inpatient surgery want to know when the second operating theatre will open.  The reality is that it has been lying idle for 12 years while the HSE has been paying for capacity in the private system through the NTPF.  In my view, the NTPF should be used primarily where the capacity does not exist in the public system.  The capacity exists in this instance.  An operating theatre is lying idle.  The business case was made by the maternity directorate to get the necessary funding in place to enable the theatre to open.  I have acknowledged the significant progress that has been made with the outpatient waiting list.  Very dramatic progress has been made.  Other areas within the HSE could learn from the initiatives that have been undertaken by the maternity directorate.  While the numbers outlined by the Minister of State when he spoke about the reduction from approximately 5,000 patients to approximately 1,500 patients are impressive, we do not want women who have been seen by a gynaecologist, and in respect of whom a referral for surgery has been made, merely to go onto another waiting list for that inpatient or day case surgery to take place.  Although I welcome initiatives like the establishment of working groups and the new commissioning process, I did not hear anything in the Minister of State's reply that gives me confidence or, more important, gives the women concerned confidence that the second operating theatre at CUMH will open any time soon.  I ask the Minister of State to take up this issue within the Department of Health, the HSE and the South\/South West hospital group in order that this project can be accelerated.  It should be a priority.  The infrastructure is in place.  It was paid for by taxpayers 12 years ago.  It is a great shame to see it lying idle while women are on waiting lists, in some cases for over two years, for what could be life-changing surgery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100035#HH00300","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1558462200,"counter":413,"content":"<p>I take the Deputy's point on the capacity issue.  I strongly accept the point that the reductions in waiting times are impressive.  It is a key priority of the Government to reduce patients' waiting times for hospital operations and procedures.  The Minister and I acknowledge that waiting times are often unacceptably long.  We are conscious of the burden they place on patients and their families and on hospital staff.  We take that point.  I will bring the Deputy's message in respect of confidence back to the Minister.  The overall outpatient waiting list, which includes those on gynaecology waiting lists, remains a significant challenge.  Therefore, I welcome the great co-operation of the CUMH and its continued work to reduce outpatient waiting lists this year.  The Minister welcomes the engagement of the South\/South West hospital group and CUMH with Sl&aacute;intecare and the NTPF.  I share the Minister's position.  I encourage all hospital groups and individual hospitals to engage with the NTPF to develop proposals for waiting list initiatives for inpatient day case procedures and for outpatients.  Under the scheduled care access plan, the NTPF will provide funding for 40,000 new outpatient appointments this year.  The HSE advises me that a new commissioning process has been established through which all proposals for funding will be considered within the framework of the annual Estimates process.

It contains proposals to amend the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978 to facilitate the acquisition of freehold title to their properties by ground rent tenants.  The Government&rsquo;s strong support for the Bill is evident in the tabling of the Bill in Government time this evening.  I thank Senators Gallagher, Swanick and Ardagh for introducing this Bill in the Seanad.  The Bill seeks to address the effects of a Supreme Court decision in a case in Carrickmacross, County Monaghan, which has repercussions throughout the country.  I acknowledge the presence here this evening of a number of people from Carrickmacross.  In particular I acknowledge the work of Mr. Pat Byrne, Mr. Tony Donagher and Mr. Michael Fisher in highlighting this important matter.<\/p><p>As indicated during Seanad discussions, it has been necessary to subject the Bill to detailed legal analysis and scrutiny to ensure, as far as possible, that its provisions are consistent with the property rights safeguards enshrined in the Constitution and to ensure coherence with other statutory provisions governing the purchase of ground rents by ground rent tenants.  For that purpose, following the Seanad&rsquo;s approval of the Bill, I was pleased to work with the Minister for Justice and Equality to establish a small expert group comprising senior officials from his Department and the Office of the Attorney General together with a number of outside experts in the area of land law, including Professor John Wylie, who is a leading expert on Irish land law.  I thank Professor Wylie for his interest and work on the expert group.  The group&rsquo;s task was to examine the provisions of the Bill and determine what amendments would be necessary to address the issues raised by the Supreme Court ruling in the Shirley case, while remaining within constitutional limits.  The group has reported and has made a number of detailed technical recommendations which, following extensive discussions with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, the Minister for Justice and Equality intends to table as Committee Stage amendments to the Bill in due course.  These amendments will seek to ensure, as far as possible, that the Bill&rsquo;s provisions will not be subject to successful constitutional challenge.<\/p><p>As Deputies here today are aware, the rights of tenants occupying property under long leases to acquire freehold title has been a contentious issue since at least the 19th century.  Such tenants are normally required to pay a small yearly rent to the ground rent landlord, and the issue that arises is the nature and extent of the tenant&rsquo;s rights to acquire the freehold title in the property.  Statutory reforms introduced by successive Governments since the 1960s have sought to strengthen the rights of such tenants to acquire the freehold in the property.  The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act 1967 gave statutory effect to the principal recommendation of the report of the Ground Rents Commission under the chairmanship of Judge Conroy.  Under the Act, certain ground rent tenants, both business and residential, acquired the right to purchase the ground rent in their property.  The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978 prohibited the creation of new ground rents in respect of dwellings, and leases after that date are only valid if they operate as a renewal of an existing lease.  The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978 gave the then Land Registry, now the Property Registration Authority, responsibility for operating a low-cost scheme for tenants acquiring the freehold of dwelling houses.  To date, tenants have bought out well in excess of 80,000 ground rents under this statutory scheme.  These important statutes have sought to establish an appropriate balance between, on the one hand, the tenant&rsquo;s right to acquire the freehold title for reasons of public interest and, on the other, the property rights of ground rent landlords that are protected under Article 40.3 and Article 43 of the Constitution.<\/p><p>The Bill that we are discussing seeks to address what are seen as adverse consequences for ground rent tenants arising from a Supreme Court ruling in 2012.  On 2 February 2012, the Supreme Court delivered judgment in protracted legal proceedings, the Shirley <i>v.<\/i>O&rsquo;Gorman case, concerning the right of ground rent tenants to purchase ground rents in their properties.  The case in question arose from an application to acquire freehold title in Carrickmacross, County Monaghan.  While the tenant&rsquo;s application in this case was ultimately successful, the manner in which the Supreme Court interpreted certain technical provisions of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act appears effectively to have narrowed the scope of ground rent acquisition rights under that Act.  The ruling means that certain ground rent tenants who had been eligible to acquire the freehold title in their properties may no longer be able to do so.  This narrowing of the grounds on which a ground rent tenant is permitted to acquire freehold title affects other ground rent tenants in Carrickmacross and elsewhere in the State.<\/p><p>As I mentioned, a ground rent tenant&rsquo;s right to acquire the freehold in property, that is, to purchase the ground rent, was first introduced in the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act 1967.  While this legislation remains relevant in the case of many commercial properties, the later Landlord and Tenant Ground Rents (No. 2) Act 1978 contains the statutory rules that generally apply to acquisition of the freehold title in the case of dwellings.  Sections 9 and 10 of the 1978 Landlord and Tenant Ground Rents (No. 2) Act specify the criteria that determine a ground rent tenant&rsquo;s eligibility to acquire the freehold title in the case of dwellings.  Section 9 provides, <i>inter alia<\/i>, that such tenants have a right to acquire freehold title where there are permanent buildings on the land, that these buildings are not an &quot;improvement&quot; within the meaning of the Act, and that one of the conditions set out in section 10 applies to the property.  One of the most widely used conditions in section 10, condition No. 2, is where the lease in question is for a period of less than 50 years and the annual ground rent is less than the rateable valuation of the property.  Moreover, while this condition recognises that there were buildings already on the land when such a lease was granted, there is a statutory presumption arising from the fact that the rent is at a low level that the buildings were not erected by the ground rent landlord or the landlord&rsquo;s predecessor in title.  However, that presumption may be rebutted in any particular case.<\/p><p>In its ruling in the Shirley case, the Supreme Court appears to take the view that the ground rent tenant is ineligible to acquire the freehold unless all the buildings had been built by him or her and not by the landlord.  Second, the court ruled that the definition of &quot;predecessors in title&quot; should be interpreted in a wide manner to include works by all previous owners, that is, not only the ground rent landlord but also any earlier tenants of the property in cases in which the landlord had taken repossession between tenancies.  The overall effect of the ruling in the Shirley case appears to be a narrowing of the scope of the ground rent purchase arrangements.<\/p><p>The Private Member's Bill before the House today seeks to address the matters arising from the Supreme Court in its ruling in the Shirley case by means of amendments to sections 9 and 10 of the Landlord and Tenant Ground Rents (No. 2) Act 1978.  The Bill proposes to repeal both subsection 1(b) and subsection (2) of section 9 of the Act which contain the &quot;improvement&quot; conditions and to insert a revised definition of &quot;permanent buildings&quot; in a new subsection (6).  It would provide that the right to acquire the freehold would in future apply where additions, alterations or extensions to the original buildings had caused it to lose its original identity or had caused an extension in its useable area by not less than 50%.  In addition, the Bill proposes an amendment to condition No. 2 in section 10 that would seek to make it clear that the reference to &quot;predecessors in title&quot; would exclude any building works carried out by any previous tenants of the property.<\/p><p>While there is considerable merit in the Bill&rsquo;s objective to broaden ground rents tenants&rsquo; right to acquire the fee simple of property, the amendments to the Landlord and Tenant Ground Rents (No. 2) Act 1978 contained in the Bill could give rise to further legal challenges on constitutional grounds and may also have unintended effects for other existing ground rents legislation.  For these reasons, as I mentioned, the Minister for Justice and Equality will be tabling detailed technical amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage.  These amendments flow from a detailed examination of the Bill by the expert group.<\/p><p>As I also stated, the Government supports the aim and policy objective of the Bill, as demonstrated by the fact that Government time has been dedicated for discussion of the Bill this evening.  Moreover, the amendments on Committee Stage will seek to ensure that the Bill&rsquo;s provisions are, as far as possible, consistent with other ground rents legislation and with the Constitution.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100036#JJ00200","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1558462800,"counter":416,"content":"<p>The relatively bland title of this legislation disguises the fact that the origins of and reasons for this Bill can be found in the rich and complicated history of this island and, in particular, in the history of Carrickmacross.  I am conscious that the Minister and many of the people in the Public Gallery this evening are from Monaghan and know much more about Carrickmacross than I do.  I thank Senator Gallagher, who is also in the Public Gallery, who did a huge amount of work on this Bill, bringing it through the Seanad.  I also acknowledge my D&aacute;il colleagues, Deputies Brendan Smith and Niamh Smyth, who have been very supportive.  They all know a lot more about Monaghan than I do.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to understand the origins of the Bill and why we are here this evening.  To do that, we have to go back to 1576 when Queen Elizabeth granted the Barony of Farney to the Earl of Essex, when she wanted that land to be planted.<\/p><p>It stayed in the hands of the Earls of Essex until the 1640s or 1650s, at which point the third earl died intestate.  His estate was subsequently divided among his co-heirs, one of whom was a man called Sir Robert Shirley.  He met a bad fate.  He backed the wrong side in the English Civil War, which is to say the royalist side, and was executed in the Tower of London.  Obviously the royalists ultimately won out but he was unfortunate to be caught on the wrong side at the wrong time and lost his life.  Ultimately, the Shirleys remained landlords of a very significant amount of land, which includes the town of Carrickmacross, for hundreds of years thereafter.  They were absentee landlords for many years.<br\/><br\/>The reason we talk about the Shirley estate is that the Shirleys own the ground rent and the fee simple in respect of much of the property in Carrickmacross to this day.  I first became aware of this issue shortly after I was elected to the D&aacute;il in 2016.  I got a call from Dr. Rory O'Hanlon, former Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy for Cavan-Monaghan.  He asked if he could bring a group of people from Carrickmacross to meet me.  I could not understand why people from Carrickmacross wanted to meet me, but I soon became aware that the issue identified by the Minister in her speech here this evening was of great concern to this group.<br\/><br\/>The legislation from 1978 gave people an entitlement to buy out the ground rents.  There is a significant advantage in doing so.  The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978 gives a lessee a general right to acquire a fee simple interest.  This is an important right for many reasons.  Lending institutions, for instance, will not give loans on properties on which the leasehold has less than 70 years left to run.  Houseowners eliminate this as a problem by buying out the freehold.  There was a benefit and public interest to the 1978 legislation, which allowed people to buy out the freehold, and a reason it was introduced.<br\/><br\/>An acute problem arose, as the Minister has said, because of the decision of the Supreme Court in 2012 concerning the current holders of the fee simple and recipients of the ground rent, John and Lucy Shirley.  They brought an appeal to the Supreme Court which was dismissed on the grounds that they did not have standing to take the case.  It should be noted that it was found in the Supreme Court that the Shirleys were not disadvantaged by the correct interpretation of the disputed provisions of the 1978 Act and that they therefore had no <i>locus standi<\/i>to challenge its constitutionally.  However, in giving his judgment on behalf of the Supreme Court, Mr. Justice Fennelly gave a very wide interpretation of the disputed provision in section 10.  We can all agree that this has had a significant influence and negative effect with regard to individuals' ability to purchase the fee simple as was intended under the 1978 legislation.  If the interpretation presented by the Supreme Court continues to be followed, the owners of fee simple interest in properties will be allowed a greater opportunity to avoid the compulsory sale of such interest under the 1978 Act.  It is recognised that there is a public interest in allowing people to buy out the freehold.  That has now become much more difficult as a result of the decision of the Supreme Court in the Shirley case.<br\/><br\/>It is important to note the specific findings of the Supreme Court and how they have affected the rights of not only people in Carrickmacross, but many people throughout the country who may wish to avail of the 1978 legislation.  The Supreme Court took the view that the tenant paying ground rent is ineligible to acquire the freehold unless all the buildings have been built by him or her and not by the landlord.  That places a significant obstacle in the way of anyone who wishes to buy out the fee simple.  The second thing the court determined was that the definition of predecessors in title should be interpreted widely to include works by all previous owners, that is to say, not only the landlord receiving ground rent but also any earlier tenants of the property in cases in which the landlord had taken possession of the property between tenancies.<br\/><br\/>As the Minister has stated, the overall effect of this ruling of the Supreme Court, which had two consequences, is to narrow the scope of individuals such as those in Carrickmacross to purchase out the ground rent.  For that reason, efforts were made to put forward legislation.  I played a small part in drafting a Bill and in bringing it into effect, but the real credit goes to the people in Carrickmacross and, in particular, to my colleague, Senator Gallagher, who brought this through the Seanad.  Bringing it through the Seanad, with the support of many others, including Senators Ardagh and Swanick, was an important development.<br\/><br\/>I commend the Government on taking this legislation on board.  It is appropriate that the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, moved it.  The legislation has been catalysed by the experience of people in Carrickmacross but, as the Minister has rightly said, the issue goes beyond Carrickmacross.  It applies not only to the persons of Carrickmacross but to anyone in the country who wishes to avail of the provisions of the 1978 Act.<br\/><br\/>It was a good decision of the Government to avail of the outstanding ability and services of Professor John Wylie.  Anyone with even a fleeting understanding of Irish land law will know that he is a unique expert in this area.  We can all gather a lot of confidence from the contribution Professor Wylie has made and will make to the drafting of this legislation.  I note that the Minister has stated that it is the intention of Government to take on board the recommendations of the committee on which Professor Wylie sits and that it may be necessary to put forward amendments on Committee Stage.  I will co-operate fully in respect of those amendments.  We should try to get them through promptly and to get the Bill through Committee Stage and the D&aacute;il so that it can be enacted as soon as possible.<br\/><br\/>The legislation reveals the complexity of Irish history and how lands were owned and granted as a result of conquests that took place hundreds of years ago.  It also reveals how legislation was subsequently introduced for the public benefit to ensure that individuals who have long-term leasehold interests in property could buy out the freehold so that they could have the benefit and due desserts of being in that property for such a lengthy period of time.  I commend this sign of new politics, although the reasons for it date from the 16th century.  It is worthwhile to note that it has support from all sections of the House.  We should try to get it enacted as soon as possible.I also welcome the introduction of this legislation on behalf of my colleagues, Deputies Niamh Smyth and Brendan Smith.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100036#JJ00300","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558463400,"counter":418,"content":"<p>When I saw this item listed for business, my mind was cast back to doing a module on property law and land law.  My mind was cast back to some of the more obscure ends of that area, including turbary rights, resulting trusts and so on.  I was not expecting as interesting a contribution as Deputy O'Callaghan's brief history lecture.  It was quite fascinating in its way.  This issue is grounded in the colonial history of Ireland and the ownership of property by some of the large British lords.  As this legislation and various other pieces of legislation and court cases have shown, this still has very real consequences.  The purpose of this Bill is to ensure that those who have a leasehold have the opportunity to purchase the freehold, which has very practical implications.  It gives the people who enjoy the property and businesses certainty and full ownership rights over their properties.<\/p>  <p>  A few years back it was revealed that the State was paying ground rents to landlords such as the Earl of Pembroke for buildings on Merrion Square, and the Duke of Leinster, who owns land on which the National Library of Ireland is located.  These ground rents, which are a reminder of the legacy of our colonial past, are also known as leaseholds.  The State's ground rent bill for Iveagh House, over which the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade presides, is paid to an absentee landlord.<\/p><p>The same applies to Dublin Castle I believe.  The money involved here is relatively small: the ground rent for Iveagh House is a mere &euro;257, the ground rent for the Four Courts is &euro;200 and the bill for Dublin Castle is &euro;7 - some people might say there are outstanding historical debts in that regard.<\/p> <p> In 2015 Deputy Pearse Doherty submitted a parliamentary question requesting the ground rents payable by the State, by name of property, by name of landlord and by amount payable.  He received a list outlining a bill of approximately &euro;4,000 paid annually by the State to holders of land title through a form of rent that dates back for centuries.  While the amount paid by the State is nominal, the principle is important.  It also interferes with people's ability to enjoy their property and their certainty in their property.<\/p> <p> Approximately 250,000 ground rents exist in the State.  Some of these will have a negative impact on homeowners who wish to sell their homes but are restricted in doing so due to provisions that mean the leaseholder is entitled to recoup a proportion of price for which they believe their house would sell.  Many would fear that when their lease ends they will not be able to afford to buy out the lease or pay the substantial increase in ground rent which may be demanded.<\/p> <p> I hope the Bill succeeds in highlighting the vulnerable nature of tenancy in general.  Ground rent landlords essentially demand money for nothing.  I believe they have no place in a just society.  It is an archaic situation which has been allowed to persist for far too long.  The Government has been promising to address this for some time.  I know the Minister spoke about potential constitutional issues with what is being proposed, but I would like to see the detail of those.  It has long been our belief that ground rents should, where possible, be abolished.  Some of the arguments made about rent caps suggested there were constitutional issues there also, but ultimately rent-pressure zones were introduced.  We would like to see the constitutional issues explored.<\/p> <p> The delay in bringing this forward is another illustration of the attitude of successive Governments to landlords and the reluctance to tackle landlords in the private rented sector.  The demands of tenants in the private rented sector in recent years for a fair rent and security of tenure have not been met.  In the past few hours, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, was lauding the concept of co-living units - tenements in reality - which is another hat tip to those seeking profit from the housing of citizens of the State.  It is not simply, as we are often told, a question of balancing the rights of the tenants and landlords, as the home of the former is very often just the business interest of the latter and there is clearly a structural inequality regarding the landlord's strong position in the Irish market.<\/p> <p> I wish to highlight an example of how these issues interfere.  A constituent of mine was selling his property in south County Cork in order to move elsewhere for employment.  He had agreed to sell his house to Cork County Council to what he believed or was told was a family in need of social housing.  He was very pleased with that.  However, a number of weeks later a solicitor for Cork County Council was told that because there was a ground rent there was a lease to the house.  As the ground rent had belonged to Viscount Middlesbrough since 1755 and lasted for 350 years, the county council could not buy the house.  This constituent was amazed that something like this could exist: he owned the house but not the land upon which it was built.  A British landlord had owned this property for 350 years - 1755 is before famine and rebellion - far off in the mists of time and yet this was having an implication for this house being transferred to social housing tenants.  It is appalling and disgraceful.  This could have been used to house a family in need of social housing.  There are countless homes across Cork city and county.  That constituent was very frustrated and I share his frustration.<\/p> <p> This issue has been ongoing for some time.  I am glad to see some progress but we need a great deal more.  I look forward to seeing the Committee Stage amendments and we will engage with them.  We will support the legislation, but a great deal more is needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100037#KK00200","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558464000,"counter":420,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, I thank the Deputies for their constructive engagement and support for the Bill.

I was very pleased with the strong support for the Bill from all sides in the Seanad and I trust that this support will also be evident in this House during our discussion.<\/p>  <p>  Put simply, the principal objective of this Bill is to provide further protections for homeowners in mortgage arrears who are facing the risk of repossession proceedings in respect of their homes.  For this purpose, the Bill proposes to insert a new section in the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013.  The Bill broadens the range of matters that a court must take into account when deciding whether to grant a possession order to a lending institution in respect of the borrower&rsquo;s principal private residence.  This Bill, which has its genesis in a Private Members&rsquo; Bill that I introduced prior to my appointment as Minister of State, will I firmly believe prove to be an important addition to the suite of Government measures to protect those who find themselves in mortgage arrears and are facing the prospect of court proceedings for repossession of their homes.<\/p>  <p>  I am sure that everyone here will agree that repossession of a borrower&rsquo;s principal private residence should be a last resort when all other possible remedies have failed.

The court may also take this broader range of matters into account where, for whatever reason, efforts to secure a personal insolvency arrangement, PIA, have failed or where despite the borrower&rsquo;s participation in a scheme designed to enable borrowers with mortgage arrears to remain in their home, the court repossession proceedings have continued.<\/p><p>As required by Articles 127(4) and 282(5) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the European Central Bank has been consulted on the Bill's proposals.  The ECB has published its opinion of 18 February on its website.<br\/><br\/>Section 1 contains a definition of the Act of 2013, which is required for technical reasons, while section 2 makes a number of technical, consequential amendments to section 2 of that Act. <br\/><br\/>Section 3 is the key section of the Bill and it inserts a new section 2A, containing nine subsections, into the 2013 Act.  Subsection (1) defines the scope of this new section.  It means that the Bill's provisions will apply not only to those cases in which the court has previously adjourned proceedings under section 2 of the 2013 Act in respect of the borrower's principal private residence, but also in cases where, prior to or following commencement of the proceedings, the borrower has engaged the services of a personal insolvency practitioner, PIP, to assist in the resolution of his or her mortgage arrears, or the borrower has participated in good faith in a scheme designed to enable indebted borrowers to remain in their homes. <br\/><br\/>This means that section 2A will apply in the following cases: proceedings where the court had adjourned the proceedings of its own motion under section 2(2)(<i>a<\/i>) of the 2013 Act but, notwithstanding such adjournment, there is no resulting PIA; proceedings where the court refused to adjourn proceedings in response to a request of one of the parties under section 2(2)(<i>b<\/i>) of the 2013 Act, or adjourned them and notwithstanding such adjournment, there is no resulting PIA; proceedings that have not been adjourned under section 2 of the 2013 Act but where the borrower has, prior to the court hearing, participated in good faith in a scheme to assist borrowers in mortgage distress to remain in their homes, or engaged the services of a PIP to assist him or her to resolve his or her mortgage arrears difficulties and, despite such engagement, there is no resulting PIA. <br\/><br\/>Subsection (2) provides that when considering whether to make, or refuse to make, an order for possession in repossession proceedings in respect of a borrower's principal private residence, a court must take account of the matters referred to in subsection (3).  The court may also do so when considering whether to grant any other order it considers appropriate in the circumstances of the case, for example, an adjournment, or further adjournment, of the proceedings.<br\/><br\/>Subsection (3) specifies the matters that the court must take account of in considering whether to make or refuse to make a possession order.  Paragraph (<i>a<\/i>) provides that the court must consider whether the making of the possession order would be proportionate in all the circumstances of the case.  This is a significant development.  In providing for this matter, the Bill recognises the essential role of the court in balancing the interests of both the borrower and the lender when considering whether to make, or refuse to make, an order for possession.  Paragraph (<i>b<\/i>) provides that the court must always take into account the circumstances of the borrower and any dependants who are resident in the home.  Paragraph (<i>c<\/i>) provides that the court must take into account whether the lending institution has made a statement to the borrower of the terms on which it would be prepared to settle the arrears problem in such a way that the borrower and his or her dependants could remain in their home.  This means that there will be an onus on lenders to clarify their positions.  Paragraph (<i>d<\/i>) makes it clear that the court must also consider the details of any proposal put forward by or on behalf of the borrower, whether prior to or following commencement of the proceedings, which would enable him or her, and any dependants, to remain in their home or, alternatively, to secure other accommodation.  The Minister has asked me to stress that consideration of proposals which would allow the borrower to remain in their home will include examination of any proposal for participation by the borrower in a scheme to assist persons in mortgage distress to remain in their principal private residence.  Paragraph (<i>e<\/i>) provides that the court must take into account the response, if any, of the lender to the borrower's proposal to remain in their home.  This will place an additional onus on lenders to engage in a constructive manner with any proposals put forward by, or on behalf of, the borrower.  Paragraph (<i>f<\/i>) makes specific reference to the conduct of the parties in any attempt to find a resolution to the borrower's mortgage arrears difficulties.  The provision makes it clear that the court must take account of a lending institution's refusal or reluctance to engage in attempts to find a resolution of the mortgage arrears problem, and also of any borrower's refusal to engage in a meaningful manner with the lending institution. <br\/><br\/>Subsection (4) specifies certain additional information that the court may take into account when considering whether the making of an order for possession would be proportionate in all the circumstances of the case. These include the overall amount of debt outstanding on the mortgage concerned, the level of arrears due on foot of the mortgage concerned, and the advised market value of the principal private residence at the date on which the legal proceedings commenced.  The Minister has provided a definition of &quot;advised market value&quot;, AMV, in subsection (9).  This definition, based on the corresponding definition in section 2 of the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011, will ensure that the market value of the property is valued in a professional, objective manner.  This AMV must be provided by the holder of a current licence issued by the Property Services Regulatory Authority, PSRA, under that Act.<br\/><br\/>Subsection (5) has a technical purpose.  It clarifies that the fact that there is no PIA in a specific case may arise because a proposal for a PIA has not been made or, alternatively, such a proposal has been made but the procedure has ended without a successful outcome.<br\/><br\/>Subsection (6) identifies the circumstances in which, under the Insolvency Act 2012, the PIA procedure is considered to have ended.  This applies in the following cases: where a PIP has prepared a proposal for a PIA and the debtor has consented to that proposal and the calling of a creditors' meeting, but that meeting does not take place before the expiry of the protective certificate as set out in section 106(3) of the 2012 Act; where, under section 108(8)(<i>b<\/i>), at the taking of a vote at a creditors' meeting in regard to a PIA proposal, the proposal is not approved by a majority of creditors in accordance with section 110 or deemed to be approved, and the PIA procedure has terminated; where, in a case under section 111A, there is only one creditor and the creditor does not approve the proposal under section 111A(8), or the personal insolvency practitioner fails to give the creditor a written notice of the proposal before the expiry of the protective certificate under section 111A(9); where the court upholds an objection to the PIA under section 120 and the procedure is deemed to come to an end in accordance with section 114(3); where, under section 115A(9), the court refuses to make an order confirming the coming into effect of the proposed PIA following a court review under that subsection; where the debtor is in arrears with his or her payments for a period of six months of the PIA and it is deemed to have failed under section 123.<br\/><br\/>Subsection (7) permits the Minister for Justice and Equality to designate a scheme for the purpose of subsection (1 )(<i>c<\/i>)(i) and subsection (3)(<i>d<\/i>)(i).  Any such scheme would have to comply with the following conditions: the objective of the designated scheme must be to provide those borrowers with mortgage arrears difficulties in respect of their homes with assistance that is reasonably likely to enable them to address these difficulties and facilitate, as far as possible, their remaining in their homes, and it is reasonably likely that such assistance will in fact be provided under the scheme.<br\/><br\/>Subsection (8) provides that an advised market value must be set out in a statement provided by a licensee under the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011.<br\/><br\/>Subsection (9) is a standard provision containing a number of relevant definitions for the purposes of this new section.  <br\/><br\/>Section 4 contains standard provisions relating to the Short Title, collective citation and commencement provisions.<br\/><br\/>On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, I underline again the urgency attaching to this short Bill.  Its key objective is to provide further protections for homeowners in mortgage arrears who are facing the possibility of repossession of their homes.  When enacted, the Bill will provide a clear checklist of factors that a court must take into account when deciding whether to grant a possession order to a lending institution in respect of a borrower's principal private residence.  The measures provided for in this Bill are worthy of support and will prove to be an important addition to the suite of Government measures to protect those who find themselves in mortgage arrears and are facing the risk of court proceedings for repossession of their homes.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100038#LL00600","speaker":"1363","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558465200,"counter":426,"content":"<p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>The Minister of State was correct when he concluded by stating the provisions of the Bill are worthy of support.  For that reason, Fianna F&aacute;il will support this legislation.  As the Minister of State has indicated, the purpose of the Bill is to broaden the range of matters that a court must take into consideration before it grants a possession order on a person's dwelling.  However, I do not necessarily agree with him that this will have a significant impact on the way possession applications are dealt with at present.  It is the case that any time an application for repossession comes before the courts, the courts are very sympathetic to the house owner - the person who is living in the house and who has received a mortgage from a financial institution which is now seeking possession of the property.  In fact, I would say the courts will give the individual concerned as much leeway as possible.  Anyone with experience of how the courts deal with possession cases will know that if the borrower is making any reasonable effort to repay the loan on an ongoing basis, the court will take that into account and, in general, will not grant the order for repossession sought by the financial institution.  Obviously, it is difficult to be prescriptive in every case but, in general, the Judiciary is sympathetic to the position of persons who find themselves in mortgage arrears and who are brought before the courts by financial institutions.<\/p>  <p>  Everyone agrees with the Minister of State that possession orders should be the last resort.  Fortunately, those possession orders are not particularly high in percentage terms in Ireland.  However, that does not take away from the fact there are very many people who find themselves in mortgage arrears and, through a lack of advice or inability to deal with their financial problems, find themselves before the courts.  Therefore, any measure which puts further obligations on the court to take such matters into consideration at the time of a possession application is to be welcomed.<\/p>  <p>  Although we are supporting this legislation, that support should not disguise the fact we still have a significant problem with mortgage arrears in this country and it is a problem that, regrettably, the Government has failed to deal with.  This Bill will broaden the measures available to a court but, in reality, it is not really going to improve the difficult situation in which many Irish people find themselves in respect of mortgage arrears.  It is important to put on record the statistics in respect of mortgage arrears that exist in Ireland at present.  We know there are 19,300 mortgage accounts in arrears up to 90 days, amounting to some &euro;32 million; 5,000 mortgage accounts in arrears between 90 and 180 days, amounting to &euro;27.5 million; 5,300 mortgage accounts in arrears between 181 and 360 days, amounting to &euro;58.8 million; 6,700 mortgage accounts in arrears between 361 and 720 days, amounting to &euro;130 million; and 28,000 mortgage accounts in arrears over two years, amounting to &euro;2.4 billion.  There is a significant problem that persists in respect of significant mortgage arrears.<\/p>  <p>  At present, the options available to those people are very limited.  They may seek protection under the personal insolvency legislation but we know that legislation needs to be reformed.  It was novel legislation when it was introduced but there are many practical problems with it that need to be resolved by the Oireachtas to make it more effective, particularly for people in mortgage arrears.  Many years ago, Deputy Michael McGrath introduced legislation seeking to establish a mortgage resolution office.  It was commendable legislation that sought to take away the veto from the banks so an independent statutory body could determine applications in respect of people's mortgages.  That was rejected by the Government and, to this day, the banks and financial institutions retain a veto when it comes to the issues concerning people in mortgage arrears.  In fact, the only real protection those people have is the courts.  Sometimes this is not recognised.  Sometimes it is believed the courts are there simply to rubber-stamp the applications of the financial institutions but that is not correct.  The courts are the protector of the citizen and of the individual.  If there are rights available to those individuals, then the courts will vindicate them.  However, the Government needs to ensure that the protections available to those individuals are increased and improved.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to recognise, and I am sure the Minister of State will agree with me, that vulture funds went unregulated for too long.  However, as a result of legislation that Fianna F&aacute;il introduced, the loan owners, which were previously unregulated, have been regulated for the first time.  That was signed into law late last year and some 18,000 mortgage holders will have their loan owners regulated by the Central Bank, with that figure likely to rise.<\/p>  <p>  Obviously, there was a significant financial crisis in this country.  Very many people got into mortgage difficulties because they bought properties between 2005 and 2008 and they have mortgages which, for many, remain unsustainable.  Many of these people have made valiant efforts to continue to pay off their mortgages and they deserve to be commended for that.  We need to recognise there is a public interest in trying to ensure we do not have a significant number of people who are drowning in mortgages that they cannot meet and which are dominating their lives.  There is a public interest in trying to resolve that issue.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the Government, since it came to power in 2011, has done little to address the issue.  I know the Minister of State is bringing forward this legislation because he is trying to improve the position of those individuals.  As I said at the outset, I believe the provisions within it are worthy of support but it is not the answer to the ongoing problem of mortgage arrears in this country.  That is a problem that can only really be resolved through greater statutory intervention proposed by the Government and enacted by this House.  Unfortunately, it is something we are going to keep talking about until such time as there are proper measures in place to deal with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100040#NN00100","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1558465200,"counter":427,"content":"<p>Sinn F&eacute;in will not be opposing the passage of this Bill on Second Stage.  However, there are several points which I wish to put to the Minister of State and which it is important to put on the record of the House.  I note that no amendments were brought to the Bill in the Seanad and we hope to see it progress swiftly.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill provides for matters relating to mortgage repossession proceedings and related court matters.  My understanding is that it requires judges to have regard to the overall proportionality of repossession and the family circumstances of someone who may be facing repossession and the loss of a home.  I will focus on section 3, given it is the substantive section of the Bill.  Subsection (1) broadens protections for the borrower, if the borrower has previously engaged the services of a personal insolvency practitioner to assist in the resolution of his or her mortgage arrears problem, or the borrower has participated in good faith in a scheme designed to enable indebted borrowers to remain in their principal private residences.  This is welcome, given good faith is generally a ground on which banks contest.  I know anecdotally of cases where the banks have said they have engaged with the borrower but where they have outlined completely unrealistic deals to ensure payment and then stated that the borrower had failed to engage as he or she could not meet the demands of the institution.  That is somewhat disingenuous in the first instance and ignores the principle of what is really meant by good faith.<\/p>  <p>  Subsection (2) provides that when considering whether to make or refuse to make an order for possession in repossession proceedings, a court must take account of the matters referred to in subsection (3), some of which are of particular note, namely, whether the order is proportionate, if the borrower has children, and the conduct of the parties in any attempt to find a resolution to the borrower&rsquo;s mortgage arrears difficulties.  These are all welcome measures and it is also welcome that the State seems to be, albeit late in the day, giving weight to cases where minors, in particular, are involved.  I am sure all of us hope this will go some small way to preventing a further increase in the record number of 4,000 children who are homeless in the State.<\/p><p>We must bear in mind that while this Bill represents progress, the other policies of this Government are still causing misery and adding to the housing crisis and the mortgage arrears crisis.  The vulture funds, which the Government seems very happy to facilitate, are causing huge stress and concern.  I hope the No Consent, No Sale Bill 2019, which Fine Gael voted against and which would have empowered borrowers, comes to pass in some way, shape or form in the not too distant future.  We also express frustration at the Central Bank's decision to amend the code of conduct on mortgage arrears and the Government's acquiescence thereto.  This key commitment of the programme for Government has been broken.<br\/><br\/>In expressing some reservations about the Bill, I draw attention to section 2A(3)(<i>f<\/i>).  According to the explanatory memorandum, this provision means the court may take account of a lender&rsquo;s refusal or reluctance to engage in attempts to find a resolution of the arrears issue and of a borrower&rsquo;s refusal to engage meaningfully with the lender to find such a resolution.  There may be a danger here that we will introduce a double edge whereby, for the first time, the behaviour of a borrower can be held against him or her.  There may be many reasons a borrower will not engage, including pure fear or a lack of capacity to face a bank on an equal footing, which is seldom the case in any event.  This subsection needs scrutiny and possible amendment.  Who is to be the arbiter of &ldquo;meaningful engagement&rdquo;?<br\/><br\/>Section 2A(6) deals with personal insolvency agreements.  Section 2A(7) deals with the ability of the Minister to establish a scheme to assist borrowers who are at risk of losing their homes.  The objective of such a scheme, as stated in the explanatory memorandum, must be to provide those borrowers with arrears difficulties in respect of their principal private residences with assistance that is reasonably likely to enable them to address these difficulties and facilitate them in remaining in their principal private residences, that is, their homes.  This is potentially an interesting proposal which may be of benefit to the borrower.  I will reserve judgment on this until details are provided, but perhaps the Minister could address that in his concluding remarks.<br\/><br\/>More broadly, I echo some of the sentiments expressed previously by me and my party colleagues.  I am very concerned by the changes to the legal aid rules introduced at the end of January.  There is already plenty of inequality between the bank and the homeowner.  These changes create a further inequality in representation between the banks and vulture funds, on one hand, and persons applying for insolvency, on the other.  Until now, if someone was applying for personal insolvency or appealing the refusal of the banks to grant one, he or she could avail of the advice of a solicitor and barrister.  On 31 January, the Government removed the right to a barrister for the debtor in court other than in exceptional circumstances.  It also halved the fees for solicitors and personal insolvency practitioners, making it much less likely that people will take cases.  This will make it much easier for banks and vulture funds to repossess homes.  Members should bear in mind that borrowers are taking on banks which will have the very best legal representation available and will be dealing with very complex legislation.  To all intents and purposes, this is an attempt to disarm the debtor who may be fighting possession.  It is a serious inequality of arms. <br\/><br\/>A very significant proportion of appeals against a refusal by a bank to engage in the insolvency process are successful.  If the banks are facing strong legal opposition, they may be more likely to agree to engage in the first instance.  However, if a bank is facing much more limited resources, with the bank potentially having senior and junior counsel and the debtor not having any barrister, what is the incentive for the bank to engage?  The Government appears to be driven to undermine the protections which the mortgage holders have and to assist the banks and vulture funds, which is shameful.  The Bill is being framed as an attempt to rectify the very serious imbalance that exists.  While this legislation is welcome, it does not do enough when contrasted with the various policy decisions I have outlined.  The Government is essentially giving crumbs to the homeowner, on the one hand, and giving banks and vultures a feast, on the other.<br\/><br\/>I once again express my support for the Bill despite those criticisms of Government policy generally.  It is welcome although it is very modest.  We will support it and I hope it can progress through the remaining Stages relatively swiftly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100040#NN00200","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558465800,"counter":429,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their support.

Unfortunately, that is not the case today.  Familicide applies to circumstances where a member of a family kills other members of that family and, in many circumstances, then proceeds to commit suicide, although it is not always the case that familicide is accompanied by the suicide of the perpetrator.  <\/p>  <p>  Although it is a rare, tragic and complex crime, unfortunately, it has occurred all too frequently in Ireland in the past 12 years.  The Dunne family of Monageer were the victims of familicide in April 2007.  Kathleen Chada's sons, Eoghan and Ruair&iacute;, were killed by their father in July 2013 in an act of familicide.  There was also the tragic case of Ms Clodagh Hawe and her three sons, Liam, Niall and Ryan, who were murdered in August 2016 by their father and her husband who went on to commit suicide.<\/p>  <p>  This issue was catapulted into the public eye by the powerful interview given to RT&Eacute;'s Claire Byrne in February of this year by Clodagh Hawe's sister, Ms Jacqueline Connolly, and her mother, Ms Mary Coll.  That interview had a significant impact not only on the Irish public but on all of us as policy makers and Members of the Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  Familicide is not a crime that is unique to Ireland.  Unfortunately, it is a crime that is known about in the western world in particular.  Much research has been done in respect of it in the United States and Australia.  It is also the case that familicide has happened all too frequently in the United Kingdom and, as a result of the occurrence of that crime there, the UK law changed a number of years ago to provide for a domestic homicide review on a statutory basis.<\/p>  <p>  I had an opportunity to look at some of the research that has been conducted on familicide in the United States and there is a significant amount of it.  Unfortunately, it indicates that the most common type of killer who is involved in committing the crime of familicide is a possessively jealous type of man.  It is also noted that one of the best indicators of whether or not a man - it is predominantly men who commit this crime - is likely to commit this crime is previous engagement in domestic violence with his wife or partner.  <\/p>  <p>  We also know from the research that there are some social and demographic factors that are related to all forms of family violence except sexual abuse.  Those are issues such as poverty, unemployment and family stresses, which include disagreements over money, sex and children.<\/p>  <p>  In Ireland, we need to recognise that we have traditionally dealt with these tragic events by calling them a great tragedy for the family and suggesting there is nothing more we can do about it.  That was an understandable response which sought to protect the privacy of the remaining, surviving family members.  It also sought to avoid embarrassing any family member by giving too much detail and coverage of the crime.  We need to recognise that is not the correct approach to this serous crime.<\/p>  <p>  What usually happens in cases in which the perpetrator has killed himself is that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na take statements from those people who came upon the scene of the crime.  The only reason for the Garda statements is for the purpose of going to the Coroner's Court where the function of the coroner is to determine how, where and when the individuals died.  That does not give us much useful information and we, as a society and a State, need to recognise that we need to do more to ensure we can learn from these tragic murders and events.  If we do not, we will find ourselves going from one rare, tragic event to another without learning any lessons in the interim.<\/p>  <p>  We need to look at the situation in the United Kingdom because we can learn from how they have dealt with the situation.  Since 2004, the UK has dealt with domestic homicides through legislation that it has on its Statute Book.  Obviously if the person who perpetrates the acts of familicide is alive, as was the case in the circumstances of Kathleen Chada, the perpetrator will face the rigours of the law, will be prosecuted, brought to justice and punished.  However, if the perpetrator also took his own life, we are left in a vacuum at present with the exception of the work and inquiry conducted by the coroner.  The UK introduced legislation in 2004 to provide for the establishment and conduct of domestic homicide reviews.  This legislation, although enacted in 2004, only commenced in 2011.  In the aftermath of a tragic murder, such as those to which I have referred, the UK authorities take a multidisciplinary approach to identifying any lessons that can be learned.  The UK legislation specifically states that its objective is to identify any lessons that can be learned.  The police, social services and local authorities, the latter of which have much broader powers in the UK than they have in Ireland, get involved in trying to produce a report on how these events occurred.  It is important to point out that the function of these reports is not to attribute blame.  The place for the attribution of blame is before our criminal courts but, if the person who is responsible for these heinous crimes is not alive, the attribution of blame does not rest with the courts and it certainly does not rest with the persons carrying out the domestic homicide reviews.<\/p><p>In the aftermath of the interview conducted by Claire Byrne with the family of Clodagh Hawe, other members of Fianna F&aacute;il such as Deputy O'Loughlin and I decided it was necessary for us to try to put in place legislation mirroring that in the UK such that we could have domestic homicide reviews in Ireland.  We decided to bring forward a Bill to amend the very successful Domestic Violence Act 2018 which was enacted by the Government and the Oireachtas more than a year ago.  The purpose of the Bill is to empower the Minister for Justice and Equality, the Garda Commissioner or the High Court, in the case of it having determined a criminal prosecution for murder or manslaughter, in cases where they are of the opinion that the death of the person resulted from violence, abuse or neglect perpetrated by a person to whom the deceased was related, with whom the deceased was in an intimate personal relationship or who was a member of the same household, to appoint a person with appropriate qualifications to conduct a review that would assist in identifying and learning lessons from the death.<\/p> <p> I note the clock has stopped which is slightly confusing for me because I am sharing time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100042#TT00200","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558467000,"counter":440,"content":"<p>The Deputy has been speaking for ten minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100043#UU00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1558467000,"counter":441,"content":"<p>I did not realise I had been speaking for so long.  Deputy O'Loughlin will address other aspects of the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the announcement on 14 May by the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, that he would set up an independent specialist in-depth research study on homicides within families and domestic homicide reviews which will be chaired by Ms Norah Gibbons who is very well qualified in this area.  It is important that research is carried out in respect of this matter.  Obviously, the Bill was introduced on First Stage before the Minister made the announcement.  I recognise that it would be illogical for the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality to deal with legislation such as this at pre-legislative scrutiny stage in parallel with Ms Gibbons carrying out the study.  My concern is that the Minister indicated that the report must be produced within a year, although I am conscious that it may take longer.  I wish to ensure the Bill does not drift into the great morass of issues which are under review.  For that reason, I am concerned about the Minister's amendment which seeks to adjourn the Bill for 12 months.  I am not proprietorial about this issue - we need to ensure we get it right - but I would like greater urgency given to be given the legislation.  Perhaps the review could be completed by the end of the year.  It is important that we work in harmony on this.  It is above party politics.  We must ensure that we do what is right for the people and, in particular, the very brave families who have suffered from these terrible crimes.  I would like legislation to be considered and possibly recommended by Ms Gibbons' review group.<\/p>  <p>  I note there are concerns about the legislation in the UK, but it is very important that we do not just get reports but rather get legislation in place such that in future families will not have to go through the trauma suffered by Clodagh Hawe's family in being obliged to go to the national broadcaster and give a very powerful interview in order to catalyse Members of this House into action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100043#UU00300","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1558467000,"counter":442,"content":"<p>I have been pleased to have worked on the Bill with Deputy O'Callaghan.  We are here to discuss legislation that I wish we did not need.  I wish that names such as Clodagh Hawe and Celine Cawley, or the dreadfully violent circumstances of their deaths, were not known to us.  They are but two of the 225 women killed in Ireland by a partner, ex-partner or husband in recent years.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill originates from the tragic murders of Ms Clodagh Hawe and her three sons - Liam, Niall and Ryan - in August 2016, and the very powerful interview given by Clodagh&rsquo;s sister, Ms Jacqueline Connolly, and her mother, Mrs. Mary CoIl, to the RT&Eacute; broadcaster Claire Byrne on 25 February 2019.  The eloquence of Jacqueline and Mary in spite of their grief and anger is one of the reasons we know that we absolutely need this legislation.  One of the most shocking things for those watching the interview was the lack of information available to Clodagh's family.  Having so many questions about the murders is clearly one of the hardest parts for the family as it leaves them with no peace.  A legal request by Mary and Jacqueline for copies of the Garda files from the investigation into the murders was refused, which is profoundly unjust.<\/p>  <p>  Families living with the trauma of family murders have repeatedly called for reviews of domestic homicides.  These families need support, advice, counselling and, above all, answers.  It was with that in mind that Fianna F&aacute;il proposed the Bill to amend the Domestic Violence Act.  A systematic multi-agency review of domestic homicides will not bring a loved one back to his or her family, but it may give the family some answers and allow the State to learn lessons on how to better protect vulnerable women.  Domestic homicide reviews are a rich source of information on the nature of domestic homicide, the context in which it occurs and, most important, the lessons that can be learned from these tragic events.  Common themes and trends emerge which help in risk assessment for Government agencies and police forces.  They help in drawing up better training programmes for garda&iacute; and to encourage and facilitate inter-agency co-operation.  Every person has the right to live a life free of fear and violence.  For one in five women in Ireland, that human right is denied every day.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to mention Women's Aid and the incredible work it does.  I attended the launch of its annual report this year, at which its representatives spoke of 16,994 disclosures of violence against women and almost 200,000 visits to its website.  Behind these stark statistics are women we meet every day - our sisters, neighbours, friends and work colleagues who put on a brave face in front of their children, families and work colleagues.  When we have the opportunity to speak to them through an agency such as Teach Tearmainn in my county of Kildare, Women's Aid or, increasingly, in Members' advice and constituency clinics, we hear how they are trapped in abusive relationships.  We hear that they are in relationships they are unable to see a way out of and where they are at the mercy of controlling and abusive partners and isolated from families and friends.  The figures increase every year.  Increased safety and protection for these women and their children affected by domestic violence must be at the heart of any progress we want to see.  Of course, there are men who are impacted.  However, the figures show that 95% of those who come forward are women.<\/p>  <p>  There is much we need to do, such as improved access to refuges and longer term support, a new family law court in Dublin and increased services to refuges.  I thank, in particular, the women whom I met in the Dolphin House family law court for their bravery and courage in talking to me about their lives.  I am often full of fear that I will someday hear their names mentioned by the media and know they were victims of the worst possible crime, namely, murder.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the legislation is to introduce a new section providing for the establishment and conduct of what are referred to as domestic homicide reviews.  The Bill will allow the Minister to order a domestic homicide review following the death of a person which appears to have resulted from violence, abuse or neglect by a relative, a partner or a person with whom the deceased was in an intimate personal relationship.  As Deputy O'Callaghan stated, such reviews have been required in Britain since 2011.<\/p>  <p>  It is a sad reality that one in four violent crimes reported internationally involves a man assaulting his wife or partner.<\/p><p>All international research consistently shows that a woman is more likely to be assaulted, injured, raped or killed by a current or former partner than by any other person.  It also shows that where there is control, violence, even if it a low level of violence, and separation there is a 900% increase in the potential for homicide.  The red flags exist, but too often action is not taken on them.  With regard to the murder of women in Ireland, since 1996 almost two thirds of women who have died violently were killed in their homes.  We also know from the experience in the UK that the introduction of these reviews has been instrumental in identifying shortfalls and addressing them.<\/p> <p> Domestic homicide expert, Dr. Jane Monckton Smith, says we must change the way we talk about abuse and fatal violence.  The term \"crime of passion\" that is often used is totally inaccurate as none of these murders is about love or passion.  They are about control and a feeling of entitlement.  If we do not examine trends, patterns and histories we will remain in denial.  More importantly, we will be letting down both past victims and the future victims whose names we do not yet know.  The case for this legislation has been made.  We need to know, if we are to stand any chance of learning how to protect women from the most dreadful of fates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100043#UU00400","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558467600,"counter":444,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p><blockquote>To delete all words after &quot;That&quot; and substitute the following:&quot;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann resolves that the Bill be deemed to be read a second time this day twelve months, to allow for the report of the independent research study on familicide and domestic homicide reviews commissioned by the Department of Justice and Equality to be prepared, and to allow for that report to be then taken into account in the consideration of the Bill.&quot;<\/blockquote><p>I wish to accommodate Deputy O'Callaghan and the House insofar as I can.

I thank Deputy O'Callaghan for introducing this Bill and acknowledge the contribution of his colleague, Deputy O&rsquo;Loughlin, and the public utterances of Senator Clifford Lee, as well as those of many other Members of the Houses.<\/p>  <p>  On 8 March last, International Women&rsquo;s Day, Ireland ratified the Istanbul Convention on preventing and combatting violence against women and domestic violence.  That marked the culmination of a four-year action plan across the Government, but it did not mark an end to the work of eliminating the horror and scourge of domestic violence in our society.  The reality is that among women who are victims of homicide, three in five are killed by a current or former partner.  Domestic homicides are rarely isolated acts; they are the ultimate expression of a pattern of violence within the home.  It is hard to conceive of more shocking and distressing crimes than those we are discussing this evening.  I warmly welcome the commitment expressed across this House to make every effort to prevent them and to ensure those who have suffered these horrors are properly and compassionately supported.  It is a commitment I unequivocally share.<\/p>  <p>  Protecting and supporting victims is and has been a priority for the Government.  I have listened carefully to the views expressed both inside and outside these Houses on how best to achieve this.  I do not believe there are quick or easy answers, but there are things that the State can do, and can do better.  With that in mind I have commissioned the independent research study into familicide and domestic homicide reviews that I announced last Tuesday and which I wish to outline to the House.  This Bill will be an important feature of that study and at an early date I will forward a copy of the Bill together with Deputy O'Callaghan's opening contribution to the chairman of the study.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the role of non-governmental organisations, NGOs, in both the provision of supports to victims and advocating on their behalf.  I also acknowledge the powerful testimony of the families of those who experienced horrific loss when their loved ones were murdered by the person with whom they should feel safest.  The nature of the expert study I have commissioned was very much informed by consultation with bereaved victims, NGOs and people considered to be experts in this area.  In particular, I acknowledge the submissions made to me Mrs. Mary Coll and her daughter, Jacqueline, whom I have met twice in the past few months to discuss their concerns about a variety of issues in the aftermath of the killing of the late Clodagh Hawe and her three sons, Liam, Niall and Ryan, by Clodagh's husband, Alan Hawe, who subsequently look his own life.<\/p>  <p>  It was clear to me that familicide, a rare and appalling crime in this country, requires a special, tailored response.  For some time I had been contemplating the best approach to domestic homicide reviews in this jurisdiction.  I have combined these two related issues into a two pillar expert study that will involve wide consultations, including with NGOs and bereaved families, and recommendations for best practice.  I thank all those who helped to shape the terms of reference, including Mary and Jacqueline, Women&rsquo;s Aid, Safe Ireland, AdVic and Support after Homicide.  I also thank them for their support for this approach, which is a sincere attempt to ensure the State does not let people down in these horrendous cases.<\/p>  <p>  The expert study will be led by Norah Gibbons, with support from a specialist team.  Ms Gibbons will work with families of victims and other stakeholders, as well as the relevant State bodies.  The study will operate independently.  Ms Gibbons will be free to recommend any course of action which she considers appropriate.  I have asked her to provide a report within 12 months.  I took great care in choosing the right person to lead this study.  Ms Gibbons has vast experience of leading the examination of sensitive issues in both the voluntary and State sector, as well as of cross-agency work.  Of particular note, she was a member of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, chaired the Roscommon child abuse inquiry and was the first chairperson of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  As I said when I announced the study, she brings not only experience and expertise but also great humanity and compassion to this work.  I have every confidence she will engage sensitively with those affected by this unimaginable loss and will provide meaningful and constructive policy recommendations that will guide the Government and the Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  The study will examine two separate but related areas.  The first, dealing with familicide, will look at the supports provided to those affected by these crimes, identification of potential warning signs and provisions for information sharing.  While it is the case that the family victims receive a range of different supports across different agencies and services in trying to cope with the ordeal which is inflicted upon them in such circumstances, we must examine how these supports can be strengthened.  It is very important to examine how these supports can be provided across relevant State and other services in a more systematic and integrated way.  This study will seek to set out how we can better ensure that family victims of familicide are supported to the fullest extent and in as compassionate and timely a manner as possible by the State.  To ensure this, it is necessary to examine existing arrangements and establish appropriate protocols and guidelines to govern such cases.  I am asking the study team to have a particular focus on this area.  I am also asking the study to examine how local communities can be best supported in dealing with the impacts of familicide cases that take place in their area and to examine the role of both the traditional media and social media in reporting cases of this nature.<\/p>  <p>  The second area the study will examine is the operation of domestic homicide reviews.  As Deputy O'Callaghan mentioned, these have taken place for a number of years in England, Wales and elsewhere and have been important in determining the effectiveness of interventions.  I can understand the desire to adopt the English model in Ireland, but it is not as simple as it seems.  The approach we are taking is the correct one.  We are asking Ms Gibbons and her team, in consultation with stakeholders, to look at the experience of domestic homicide reviews in the UK and elsewhere and to define international best practice.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to refer briefly to a number of other legal measures, and I acknowledge the support of Deputies O'Callaghan, O'Loughlin, &Oacute; Laoghaire and others in ensuring the Government was in a position to ratify the Istanbul Convention earlier this year.  I refer specifically to the Domestic Violence Act 2018, the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017, which explicitly recognises for the first time in Irish law the rights of victims of crime, and the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017, which introduced a statutory definition of consent to a sexual act.<\/p><p>It also addressed a number of evidential issues to protect child and adult victims of sexual assault from any additional trauma or upset arising from the criminal process.<\/p> <p> Legislation is, of course, only part of the answer.  My Department is providing a sum of &euro;1.7 million this year to fund services for victims of crime.  Tusla, the primary State funding agency, is providing &euro;23.8 million to support services for victims of domestic and sexual violence.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to develop policies, procedures and practices to inform its approach to domestic homicides.  This includes a domestic homicide review team in the Garda National Protective Services Bureau examining a small number of domestic homicides for review.  The purpose of these reviews is to improve the response of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the handling of domestic violence and abuse and includes examining potential changes to relevant policing practices and procedures.<\/p> <p> Tackling domestic violence is central to my work as Minister.  It is an area that receives ongoing priority attention in my office and this will continue.  In this House we have worked together constructively legislating in this area in the past and I am hopeful we can continue to work together on shared priorities across the House.<\/p> <p> I am sure Ms Gibbons would be happy to meet the justice spokespersons and I appeal to colleagues to encourage anyone known to them who can make a contribution to the study to come forward once Ms Gibbons issues a call for submissions.  I expect such a call to be advertised in the national media within the next couple of weeks.  I believe it is sensible and reasonable to allow this expert study to take place before we embark on legislation and initiate a parallel process.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge the importance of this debate.  I again thank Deputies O'Callaghan and O'Loughlin for the work that went into the preparation of this legislation.  I acknowledge the contributions of all Members.  I assure the House that, as Minister, I will continue to engage on these issues, and tonight is a welcome opportunity to do so.  I am sure we will return to this matter at a later stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100044#VV00400","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558468200,"counter":448,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na Teachta&iacute; O'Callaghan agus O'Loughlin as an reachta&iacute;ocht seo a thabhairt os &aacute;r gcomhair.

In February this year my colleague, the Sinn F&eacute;in president, Deputy McDonald, asked the Minister if he would consider introducing legislation to provide for domestic homicide reviews similar to those in place in England and Wales under section 9 of the Domestic Violence, Crimes and Victims Act.  At that time, the Minister stated he had no plans to amend the law but that the matter would be kept under review.  Following a meeting with the family of Clodagh Hawe later that month, the Minister announced his intention to commission a study into the supports available to families affected by familial homicide and the experience of domestic homicide reviews in other jurisdictions.  That was clearly welcome.  Clodagh's sister, Jacqueline Connolly, and her mother, Mary Coll, should not have had to take to the national airwaves to make their voices heard but often that is the way things work.  It is a fundamental human rights principle that those affected by policies implemented by Government must be given a voice in the development of those policies.<\/p><p>The right of women and children to be protected against domestic violence and death is underpinned by various instruments of international law, including the Istanbul Convention.  If the Government is truly committed to the provisions of the convention, then it must create a space for victims and their families to inform and shape policies, legislation and adequate budgets.  Before we consider our own views of the appropriate framework for the introduction of multi-agency domestic homicide reviews, we should first listen to the families affected by this horrific crime.<\/p><p>I had the opportunity recently to meet Kathleen Chada and some other people who have been bereaved in the most appalling way.  It is so difficult for a person who has never been affected by this to even begin to imagine the horror that must be involved and how it must follow those affected every day.  Lives are changed forever.<\/p><p>One of the groups I met was Sentencing And Victims Equality, SAVE, an advocacy group established by families affected by domestic homicide.<\/p><p>We are particularly focused on the 27 cases of familial homicide in recent times.  While they are closely or inextricably linked, there is a wider context of domestic homicide generally.  There have been 225 such cases since 1996.  Nine in ten murdered women are murdered by someone who knows them.  Half are killed by a current or former partner.  Some 61% are killed in their own homes.  We have a serious problem in this regard, although the problem is not only in Ireland.  It is something that we must attempt to understand to properly deal with in a policy way.  That is clearly what this policy proposal is about.<\/p><p>SAVE has been calling for the introduction of domestic homicide reviews similar to those in place in Britain.  The following is their demand of us:<\/p><blockquote>We all have many questions around the circumstances of the murder of our loved ones.  Many of these questions may never be answered but knowing that someone may have some of these answers but chose not to tell us just adds to what is already an incredibly difficult time.  To think that there is information relevant to our loved ones being kept from us is difficult to comprehend.  It adds to our pain.  We believe the introduction of domestic homicide reviews would show that at a government level the needs of victims and their families are on a par with the needs of the perpetrators.  Such reviews must be under the guise of a completely independent body that can work on a multiagency basis, independent of present state bodies.<br \/><br \/>As the families of victims of domestic violence, we are often not looking to blame.  We trust the judicial process will take care of that.  But we will often be left with questions that cannot be answered by the Garda or the coroner.  The answers we seek may not seem relevant to a potential court case or inquest, but would bring a level of comfort to us.  Domestic homicide reviews place the victim at the centre of the process, at a time when it can often feel that they have been shunted to the side lines.  Trust in the judicial system can often be shaken for us, so knowing there is a state body whose sole agenda is to simply get answers would be welcomed by us.<\/blockquote><p>Like SAVE, Safe Ireland, Women's Aid, the National Observatory on Violence Against Women, the National Women's Council of Ireland and other front-line service providers have all called for the introduction of multi-agency reviews.  This statutory model of review has been operational in England and Wales since 2011 and is due to be introduced in the North shortly.  The family violence death review committee was established in New Zealand in 2008.  Again, this body is underpinned in legislation.  A number of Canadian provinces also have statutory and non-statutory systems of domestic review in place.<\/p><p>Earlier this month Deputy McDonald and I produced a policy paper committing Sinn F&eacute;in to the introduction of an independent multi-agency domestic homicide review model.  I believe I sent a copy of that document to the Department.  If I did not, I will do so shortly.  As with the British model, reviews would be automatically established on a regional basis following a domestic or familial homicide.  Currently, reviews must be initiated by the Garda Commissioner and are limited to the examination of the adequacy of Garda policies, their interactions with other external agencies and with the individuals and family concerned.  Our model of review includes all relevant State agencies, for example Tusla and the HSE, domestic violence service providers, families of the victims and their friends and work colleagues.<\/p><p>There is another element and I hope the Minister's process takes this into account.  Often in these processes, data sharing can be used as a form of obstruction or a reason not to proceed with sharing of information and experience and knowledge.  Obviously there is legislation governing all of this.  We believe there is a need for a specific element of the review to examine whether there is need for change in legislation or policy to ensure that domestic homicide reviews can be as effective as possible and that all the information that it is possible to share can be shared.  This could allow families to benefit from the information being shared by the review.<\/p><p>The system of review we are advocating, and that this Bill advocates, is not a replacement for a criminal investigation or an inquest and would not seek to apportion blame.  Independent multiagency domestic or familial homicide reviews provide invaluable data and information on the circumstances leading up to the crime and how agencies can improve responses to better protect women from future attacks.  The Office of the Chief Coroner in Ontario, Canada, has had a multidisciplinary death review committee in place since 2003.<\/p><p>The motto of the office is \"we speak for the dead to protect the living\".  This process advances policy development, operational practice and inter-agency co-operation.  It also provides a neutral independent process for victims&rsquo; families to participate in which can provide them with the answers they need.  This will require legislation and a budget line to shape the review process, provide for inter-agency data sharing, and deliver the regional framework and accompanying staff.  This legislation must first be informed by the families impacted by domestic homicide, victims of domestic abuse and violence and the organisations that advocate on their behalf.  We will support this legislation and we welcome its introduction.  As the Deputy has acknowledged, he will ultimately need the Government's imprimatur if the legislation is to fully come to life and to reflect the British domestic homicide review model.  If the purpose of this legislation is, as the Deputy has stated, to replicate what is permissible in Britain, there will need to be an organisational framework and staffing required to deliver properly on this commitment.  In effect, this will mean the legislation would be a money Bill.  I hope the Minister will row in behind this Bill to ensure it is everything it can be.<\/p> <p> Under the British legislation reviews are commissioned by community safety partnerships following the domestic homicide of a person aged 16 years or over.  These multi-agency structures are established in each local government area.  A fundamental pillar of the British model is that it is independent.  Local review panels include an independent chair and representatives from statutory and voluntary agencies.  Family, friends and work colleagues are also encouraged to participate in the review.  Reviews are not automatically established after a domestic homicide in the Fianna F&aacute;il Bill, as we would like them to be.  The legislation keeps the process of review tightly within the gift of the Garda Commissioner or the Minister for Justice and Equality.  It provides that the Minister may direct the Garda Commissioner and other agencies, such as the HSE or Probation Service, to co-operate with or participate in the review.  Under this proposal the Minister is again directing the review process.  Families can make a submission or provide information to the review but cannot engage in the review process itself.  A reviewer appointed by the Minister or the Garda Commissioner may seek information or documentation from a person or legal entity.  Non-statutory organisations such as Women&rsquo;s Aid or Safe Ireland can only contribute to the process if the reviewer seeks information from them.  As Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan stated in the D&aacute;il last month, his legislation will require the resources and involvement of the Department of Justice and Equality if it is to progress.  As there is an arrangement between Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, I hope the Deputy has secured some form of agreement with the Minister and that we will see some progress.  I appreciate the amendment.  I would personally rather proceed to Committee Stage as soon as possible, but that is within the gift of the sponsor of the Bill.<\/p> <p> The Minister&rsquo;s establishment of independent study on familicide and domestic homicide reviews in respect of supports for families and to examine practices in other jurisdictions is welcome, although its completion date of June 2020 is a while off.  I appreciate the need to get it right, but there is an appetite and an interest in this area, so I would rather that was progressed quicker.  Families of domestic homicide victims want the issue of additional funding supports to be placed front and centre.  Support services are woefully inadequate and the lack of multi-annual funding streams negatively impacts on non-statutory services' ability to develop appropriate supports for them.<\/p> <p> I take the opportunity to pay tribute to those families I have met who have lived with the pain of losing their loved ones, whether it be a daughter, a sister, a son, a husband or a wife, including Jacqueline Connolly, Mary Coll, Kathleen Chada and so many others.  We owe them a debt because despite their enormous grief, deep hurt and pain, they are active in this area, seeking legislative change and lobbying both Opposition politicians and the Government to force the political system to step up to its responsibilities and to legislate.  There is an epidemic of domestic violence in Ireland and many other countries, yet the Government has not adequately prioritised the protection of women and children in that regard.  Women and children are being murdered in their homes by men known to them.  Thousands more are living with abuse, sexual assault and violence every day.  Our actions in this House can and must reflect this grim reality.  There has been progress such as the Domestic Violence Act 2018, but in some respects we are still catching up with what has been in place in other jurisdictions for a decade or more.  There is a broad consensus on the need for and value of independent multi-agency domestic homicide reviews.  I hope can progress to becoming policy and that that consensus will give comfort to the families affected and be of value to women living with a violent partner today.  If we can advance this model of review with ambition and determination, it can be used to apply lessons, change policies and ensure this violence and murders are minimised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100045#WW00200","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558468800,"counter":450,"content":"<p>I thank Fianna F&aacute;il and Deputy O'Callaghan, in particular, for bringing this Bill before the House.

I am not going to list out women's names because Women's Aid has done that for us and if we pick one woman, we ignore somebody else.  I am going to deal with some of the figures instead.  Domestic violence kills and Women's Aid has set out for us what that means completely.  Domestic violence kills both women and children and the people who work for and volunteer with Women's Aid hear from women about the types of abuse and behaviour that precede it every day.  When women call Women's Aid and tell us they are afraid for their lives, we believe them.  Women's Aid, among other organisations on the ground, has been telling us and successive Governments for a very long time that domestic violence is prevalent, very serious violence that leads to murders year after year.  Every step of progress was forced by pressure and, unfortunately, another death.<\/p>  <p>  It is difficult as a woman to read out the total figures to date.  We have learned from the femicide watch project, something I cannot believe we need in 2019, that seven women died violently in 2018 and that was only by November.  It goes on to tell us that ten women on average die violently every single year in Ireland, which is almost one a month.  I will not exaggerate.  Some 225 women have died violently between 1996 and 2008, with 16 children, leaving 125 children without mothers, although I do not have the up-to-date figure.<\/p>  <p>  I said I would not read out the names, but it is worth reading out the ages.  We are discussing this against the backdrop of an ongoing case that I am not going to comment on except in relation to the age of the victim, who was 14 years old.  The women who have been murdered in the last while range in age from 13 up to women in their 60s.  The women who died in 2018 were a 43 year old, a 49 year old, a 22 year old, an 18 year old, a 31 year old, a 39 year old and a 29 year old.  They were all victims.<\/p>  <p>  I am uncomfortable with using the word \"welcome\", but I am welcoming this legislation against the backdrop of inadequate funding for domestic and gender-based violence, in the context of inadequate provision of refuges for women where they can go for safety and a narrative that focuses on the woman as someone anonymous in all of this.  The reporting talks about what an unusual act it was for the perpetrator at a given time.<\/p><p>It spoke of what an unusual act it had been and said he was a pillar of society, among other things.  There were details of the murder of the woman and nothing about her life or how she lived but a complete apology for the man who did it.  They are my views but also those of Women's Aid which, in its Femicide Watch 2018, made specific recommendations for the Government.  The first was exactly what Deputy O'Callaghan has asked for, namely, a domestic homicide review to be set up on a statutory basis with the appropriate specialists.  Domestic homicide reviews are in place in the UK, New Zealand and many other jurisdictions, including Canada, Australia and the United States; therefore, there was nothing to stop this or previous Governments from introducing this mechanism and doing the research before this Bill if they had taken domestic violence and murder seriously.  Clearly, that has never been the case but I welcome the fact that the research has taken place at last.  I have always had a difficulty with the reporting of \"domestic incidents\".  They are not domestic incidents, but the most serious assaults, some of them culminating in murder.  It is time we changed the narrative because if we do not, we will never learn, even if we set up homicide review mechanisms.<\/p> <p> Women's Aid has also made 13 recommendations on media reporting and I ask journalists and the Government to look at them and consider the narrative of these cases.  Women's Aid asked for positive and responsible reporting on domestic abuse and homicide to improve the public's understanding and support those affected.  If we do not do that we will simply not learn or make homes safer places for women and children.  There has been talk about the press council working in partnership and I recommend that the Minister and his speech writers read what they have to say and learn.  We cannot be political in any way about this and we cannot have any more murders without learning from them.  I pay tribute to Women's Aid on this point.<\/p> <p> There is a lack of funding, a lack of refuges and a lack of evidence-based figures, because we cannot rely on the Garda figures.  The Central Statistics Office was before the Committee of Public Accounts recently and its representatives said the statistics were published under reservation so we need accurate statistics.  It has taken us three years for this D&aacute;il to force the Government to review the SAVI report, which was conducted in 2002.  It worries me that we set up a scoping report first to delay the process.  That was produced on 18 April 2018 and it will be a long time until the review is completed as it will not begin before summer 2021 and will take a few years to complete.  If we were seriously interested in dealing with domestic violence, abuse and murder we would have started this much sooner and done it more quickly.  I understand the Central Statistics Office has 75 vacancies and the impact that might have on carrying out this very important research concerns me.<\/p> <p> I do not like to talk about the costs to the economy of domestic violence, abuse and murder, but it is &euro;2.2 billion per year.  The Minister told us that &euro;23.8 million was given for victims of domestic and sexual violence and the Government might be congratulating itself on this but Safe Ireland and NUI Galway research estimate that the cost is much higher.  The research is ongoing and looks at the economic and social costs of domestic violence across three phases of a survivor's journey.  I am not here to lecture but because I know intimately the effects of domestic violence on children, women and on the wider society.  We need to look at this and to allocate sufficient funding because &euro;23.8 million is not a figure about which the Government can boast when the cost to the economy is in billions of euro.  As the programme manager with Safe Ireland said, if we allocate adequate and targeted resources to prevention and support for survivors of domestic violence, we save lives, we restore futures and we save billions.  I ask the Minister to read that piece.<\/p> <p> I support the Bill.  I am not sure why it has to be delayed, but I understand that it is in agreement with Fianna F&aacute;il.  I welcome the initiative from Deputy O'Callaghan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100046#XX00200","speaker":"1316","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558469400,"counter":452,"content":"<p>I join the Minister in thanking Deputies O'Callaghan and O'Loughlin for their work and other Members for their contributions.  I express sincere condolences to those who have suffered the unimaginable tragedies about which we have spoken this evening and I commend the extraordinary courage and selflessness which people have shown in seeking to ensure their experiences are not endured by others.  Domestic homicides must be taken in the broader context of our response to domestic violence, which must take into account concrete State actions and deep-rooted social and cultural change.  The State's ratification of the Istanbul Convention was a milestone but significant reforms are continuing.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has gone through some of the legislation that has been enacted recently, such as the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 and the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017 and the Domestic Violence Act 2018, in which the new criminal offence of coercive control was introduced.  I was very much involved in that legislation in the Seanad and in my role as Chair of the committee in the last Oireachtas, when we produced a major report on the whole area.  We are the third country in the world to introduce the new criminal offence of coercive control, which is very important.  Another significant piece of that Act was the fact that the relationship between the defendant and victim can be taken into account as an aggravating factor in sentencing for certain offences.  That was new, was called for and is very important.<\/p>  <p>  Legislation is only one element and implementing the second national strategy on domestic and gender-based violence is ongoing.  The Department of Justice and Equality is providing &euro;1.712 million in funding for services for victims of crime and Tusla will provide a further &euro;25.3 million in 2019 for support services for victims of domestic and sexual violence.  The budget increased by &euro;200,000 in 2016, with a further increase in 2017 to &euro;22.1 million, rising to &euro;23.8 million in 2018.  There has been an increase of &euro;3.4 million, or 17%, in funding since 2015.<\/p>  <p>  Housing is vital for victims of domestic violence and according to a report of the Council of Europe Ireland is one of only nine member states where the ratio of shelter beds relative to population is higher that 1:10,000, which is the recommended rate.  Ireland has 1.29 shelter beds per 10,000 of population.  While refuge places are very important, however, we should also question if they are the best answer.  The Domestic Violence Bill will increase access to court protection for victims of domestic violence.  Making orders easier to obtain should increase the number of women who can stay in their own home.  Why should the woman have to be the person to leave the home?  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government has issued guidance to local authorities on how to assess victims of domestic violence in need of housing.<\/p><p><i>9 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>This guidance has been brought to the attention of local authorities in order that they are familiar with it.  It draws attention to improvements in housing legislation to assist the victims of domestic violence.  Ultimately, the funding of places in refuges is a matter for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla.<\/p> <p> As the Minister for Justice and Equality outlined, the Department has commissioned a research study, led by Ms Norah Gibbons, to examine the provision of supports for families that are victims of familicide and the introduction of domestic homicide reviews.  We need to have a stronger collective State response in supporting families that experience such traumatic ordeals.  This study will examine in an in-depth and independent way how such supports can be provided across relevant State and other services in a more systematic and integrated way.<\/p> <p> I note the views expressed by Deputies regarding the introduction of domestic homicide reviews in the UK.  I have no disagreement in principle, but as the Minister outlined, a direct transposition of the UK model would not be workable without appropriate tailoring to the structures that are in place in Ireland.  This is also the view of the NGOs and officials on the ground.  It is necessary to define best practice in an Irish context in order that reviews here can be effective.  The study will examine in a comprehensive and independent way the experience of reviews operating elsewhere.  Based on its findings, it will be able to make recommendations on how we can effectively introduce such measures in Ireland.<\/p> <p> Prior to the Minister's announcement of an expert study, he and his officials had been laying the groundwork for several months.  This underlines the seriousness and care with which the Government is approaching this sensitive issue.  It is just a week since the Minister announced the appointment of Ms Gibbons and published the terms of reference, and already offices have been secured on St. Stephen's Green and the fitting out with ICT and so on is almost complete.  Arrangements to appoint a small expert support team to assist Ms Gibbons in her work are at an advanced stage.  The Minister and I look forward to the support and engagement of Oireachtas Members.  At the launch, the Minister and Ms Gibbons expressed the hope that affected families would engage with the study.  We see their experiences and views as being central.  I echo that call.<\/p> <p> I draw attention to the fact that the first pillar of the study seeks recommendations on arranging enhanced information and supports for those affected by these crimes and the identification of potential warning signs and possible responses and actions, including the development of protocols to allow relevant information to be shared.  I hope the study will also focus on the important issue of prevention.  Is there information on warning signs that could be shared earlier?  I know of a few instances where, if that had happened, a tragic event might have been avoided.  Another consideration is the development of clear protocols by State agencies and other agencies and individuals for the sharing of information with immediate family members.  These are sensitive but very important issues.  The development of an emergency team protocol would bring together key officials as soon as possible after an incident to review information known at the time, identify agencies that might hold relevant files and, crucially, identify what supports were needed by families and communities and who was best placed to provide same.<\/p> <p> It is important to ensure the perpetrators of homicide cannot benefit financially.  This is an area where there is ongoing discussion between the Department and the Office of the Attorney General in the context of Deputy O'Callaghan's Civil Liability (Amendment) (Prevention of Benefits from Homicide) Bill 2017.  The pre-legislative scrutiny process in March highlighted just how complex the relevant issues were and how easily unintended consequences could be introduced.<\/p> <p> The fundamental goal of the Bill before us which is to improve our responses to domestic homicide is one that the Government supports and the amendment is proposed to facilitate the completion of the study.  When it has been completed, we will inform the Government and the Oireachtas on our future approach to the Bill.  I understand colleagues have already agreed to it.<\/p> <p> This is an important and a sensitive area, one on which the Government has been working and for which it has been legislating, but much more needs to be done.  Tonight's debate has been important, effective and timely, but the study is ongoing and we have agreed to postpone further work on the Bill for nine months until the study has been completed.  The study team will take into account this legislation and give a view on it.  The Minister and I are anxious for this legislation to proceed after getting the advice of the study group following its work.<\/p> <p> I congratulate Deputy O'Callaghan on the Bill and look forward to the rest of the legislative process in time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100047#YY00200","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558470000,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I thank those Deputies who have contributed.  Their contributions have been useful and informative.  It is worth pointing out that there appears to be universal agreement in the House that this country needs operations such as domestic homicide reviews.  We do not have them at present and every Deputy who has contributed recognises that we should.  Sinn F&eacute;in produced a paper on this matter recently.  That is indicative that there is support throughout the House for the establishment of domestic homicide reviews.  They need to be put on a statutory basis.  If they are not, then they will just be <i>ad hoc<\/i>and lack the necessary legal power to be conducted in the way we want them to be.<\/p><p>I will start by addressing two legitimate points raised by Deputies &Oacute; Laoghaire and Connolly, who stated that they would prefer if this legislation was pushed through.  They were concerned about why I was agreeing to adjourn it for nine months.  I will let them know my thinking.  Obviously, if I pushed the legislation this evening, we would have a vote next week and I believe I would get the legislation through.  It would then go to Committee Stage.  As Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire knows, the Select Committee on Justice and Equality is busy at present and we would not be able to undertake pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill until October.  At that stage, the committee would have to decide what witnesses to call for the purpose of apprising ourselves of what type of statutory scheme we should have in place.  Necessarily, we would want to include people such as Ms Gibbons and others working on the review, which would have been up and running by that stage for five months.  It would be confusing to have these two processes running in parallel.  It may have been more politically astute of me to push the Bill on and say that Fianna F&aacute;il had got it to Committee Stage, but it would not be tenable to have pre-legislative hearings in the justice committee in October where we would call witnesses who had presumably also contributed to Ms Gibbons's review.  It would not be conducive to achieving an harmonious outcome to this important issue.<\/p><p>There is another worthwhile reason to delay this Bill.  The reality is that, unless there is Government and, in particular, Department of Justice and Equality support, this will not get on the Statute Book.  My hope is that, once we get the report from Ms Gibbons, we will be able to proceed with legislation and that the legislation I have drafted will be of assistance in trying to identify a pathway forward.  I am sure the same applies to every Deputy, but I am not proprietorial about being identified as the drafter of the new legislative mechanism.  It is about us getting this right.<\/p><p>Everyone recognises that this is a complicated area.  As identified by other Deputies, this country has serious problems which can be summed up as &quot;violence against women&quot;.  People have highlighted the relevant statistics, including the ages of the victims.  On many levels, we need to ensure that steps are put in place to reduce this violence as much as we can.  I am concerned by the extent to which young men, not just in Ireland but also around the world, are developing their initial views on women and sexuality from pornography to which they are exposed on the Internet.  No previous generation has ever been exposed to pornography to this extent thanks to its prevalence on the Internet.  The Internet has had a major impact on commerce, education and knowledge.  Similarly, I regret to say it must be having a major impact on the development of young people's sexuality.  I do not know whether that will have a significant impact in terms of increasing violence against women, but it appears to be the case that pornography that proliferates on the Internet presents women in a submissive and malleable way.<\/p><p>It seems to highlight the control that some men seek to exert over women.  Deputy O'Loughlin put it very well when she said control was at the heart of violence against women.  She was correct when she said this was something that needed to be tackled.<\/p> <p> The research that has been conducted as part of domestic homicide reviews in other countries seems to indicate that many of these vicious murders are prompted by events in a man's life which he finds humiliating.  In the past, a man's financial or personal humiliation, or some identification of wrongdoing being carried out by him, has been an explanation - not a justification - for why someone who never previously got involved in violence got involved in violence.  We need to be conscious that we live in a world where people can be exposed to humiliation.  We need to transmit the message that regardless of how difficult or negative the news about a man is, he should be able to cope with it.  It is probable that in the vast majority of cases, the perpetrators of these crimes are violent bullies who wish to exert control over women.  We need to find out the information in such cases in order to have knowledge available to us that can act as a deterrent, teach us how to ensure we protect women in this country as much as possible and enable us to learn about the indicators of these types of crimes.<\/p> <p> I thank everyone who has contributed to this debate.  I am prepared to agree to the amendment for the reasons I have outlined.  Ultimately, this House should aim to have legislation in place within a short period of time.  I know that it is complicated and that it has to be distinct from the English legislation.  The draft I am proposing today is distinct.  Obviously, there are domestic homicide reviews in the UK.  This legislation is not based exclusively on the English legislation.  It is designed for the Irish legal system.  It is important that Ms Norah Gibbons and the Members of this House be aware of the need to drive forward to get legislation enacted as soon as possible to ensure these types of heinous crime are deterred in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100048#ZZ00200","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558470600,"counter":456,"content":"<p>The House has already agreed to an amendment to amendment No. 1.
