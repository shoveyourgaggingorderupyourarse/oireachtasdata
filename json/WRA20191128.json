High speed broadband will allow citizens and businesses in rural communities to enjoy broadband speeds comparable to and in many cases better than speeds available to those living in towns and cities. This will enable rural communities to avail of the opportunities presented by the digital economy including healthcare, education, farming, rural development and tourism.<\/p>  <p>  High speed broadband services will allow farmers and farming communities to avail of new and emerging technologies that rely on a fast and reliable broadband service. Farmers can benefit through smart farming which allows increased production quality, remote monitoring of livestock, lower operational costs, reduced impact on the environment, better security technology and easier interaction with State bodies online.<\/p>  <p>  The benefits of high speed broadband to people&rsquo;s healthcare include enabling remote monitoring of older and vulnerable people in their homes, improving home-based care as an alternative to hospitalisation and the increased use of video medical appointments.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the provision of high speed broadband in rural Ireland is of critical importance in areas such as flexible and remote working. Remote or home-working is becoming an increasingly prevalent employment model, including amongst overseas firms that continue to invest in Ireland. This area of the economy is projected to double over the next 5 years. It will also afford national and international employers better access to a wider catchment of skilled workers, even where offices and businesses are located within more rural areas.<\/p>  <p>  An initial enabler to rural communities will be the early roll out of community based Broadband Connection Points. It is expected that 298 Broadband Connection Points will be established and providing a high speed broadband service by the end of 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112800033#WRA04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electricity Grid","counter":44,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112800033#WRA04300"},{"type":"question","counter":45,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[49439\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112800033#WRA04400","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if the proposal to change the electricity market rules in order to enable micro-generated electricity to be sold to the grid will proceed in 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1284","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":46,"content":"<p>Action 30 of the Climate Action Plan commits to the delivery of a framework for micro-generation with a view to commencement of an enduring support scheme by 2021, at the latest, to ensure that people can sell excess electricity they produce back to the grid.

By 2030, we will upgrade a third of all homes to at least a B2 energy standard, installing approximately 400,000 heat pumps. Currently over 99% of our vehicle fleet is powered by fossil fuels. By 2030, nearly a million electric vehicles (35%-40%) will be on our roads. These measures will significantly improve air quality by reducing emissions of harmful pollutants. <\/p>  <p>  Extending the ban on the use of smoky coal would also have a positive impact on air quality, particularly in built up areas. <\/p>  <p>  The ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal, or &lsquo;the smoky coal ban&rsquo; as it is commonly known, was first introduced in Dublin in 1990, and subsequently extended to our major cities. <\/p>  <p>  Following a public consultation process, it was further extended in 2012, and now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide. The ban has proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels in the air and has had the effect of significantly improving public health. Research indicates, for example, that the ban has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths in Dublin alone. <\/p>  <p>  Regarding the proposed national extension of the smoky coal ban, a number of coal firms have indicated that they would challenge the proposal of two former Ministers to expand the smoky coal ban. <\/p>  <p>  This is particularly disappointing, given the impact poor air quality can have on human health and the environment and the emphasis the Government is putting on transitioning to a low carbon society. <\/p>  <p>  The basis of their challenge is that a nationwide smoky coal ban cannot be introduced without a nationwide ban on the burning of peat, turf and wet wood because these products produce similar levels of pollution.

To achieve 70% renewable electricity will require the grid to be able to recieve almost 100% electricity from renewables when the wind is blowing and the sun is shining. The 70% is an average figure, reflecting that there will be times when wind and solar final are not available. <\/p>  <p>  The Scheme is being designed to achieve its targets within a competitive framework which will put downward pressure on the costs to end consumers.

These targets cover emissions from sectors such as transport, agriculture, buildings and waste.

The year-on-year percentage growth rates for GDP in constant (i.e. inflation adjusted) and current prices are presented in the table.  <table>    <tr>       <th><\/th>       <th>2008 <\/th>       <th>2017 <\/th>       <th>2018 <\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>GDP (constant prices) <\/td>       <td>-4.5 <\/td>       <td>8.1 <\/td>       <td>8.2 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>GDP (current prices) <\/td>       <td>-4.8 <\/td>       <td>9.4 <\/td>       <td>9.1 <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>The contraction in GDP in 2008 represents the onset of both the domestic and global recession. In particular, the negative growth in GDP is attributed to the negative growth in gross fixed capital formation (i.e. investment) and exports along with moderating private consumer spending in 2008 relative to 2007. <\/p><p>More recently, GDP has become increasingly distorted by the globalised activities of a small number of large multinational firms which have limited impact on actual activity in the Irish economy.<\/p><p>The GDP numbers in 2017 and 2018 are affected by these activities which include:<\/p><p>- Activity in the aircraft leasing sector which involves substantial investment in portfolios of aircraft for international leasing and which generate substantial fee income (i.e. services exports) without significant employment effects.<\/p><p>- The relocation of intellectual property (IP) related assets or patents to Ireland. <\/p><p>- The effect of 'contract manufacturing' whereby multinationals located in Ireland contract a party located abroad to produce and supply goods on their behalf to another party. Throughout this process the Irish firm retains economic ownership of the goods, such that sales of these products are recorded as exports in Ireland's national accounts.<\/p><p>While the high GDP growth rates recorded in 2017 and 2018 are impacted by a relatively small number of very large multinational firms who engage in these activities, the GDP figures are compiled in accordance with best international practice and statistical standards.\u00a0 However, as Ireland is a small, open and highly globalised economy, the relevance of GDP as a metric by which underlying economic trends and changes in living standards can be assessed is considerably less than elsewhere.<\/p><p>To address this, the CSO publishes additional series, including modified gross national income (GNI*) and modified domestic demand, which are more closely related to the domestic economy. In particular, modified domestic demand - that is domestic demand excluding investment in foreign owned IP and leased aircraft - increased by 2.8 and 4.8 per cent in 2017 and 2018 respectively, pointing to robust growth in the domestic economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112800035#WRC05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":201,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112800035#WRC05400"},{"type":"question","counter":202,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[49540\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112800035#WRC05500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount spent by his Department and each agency under the aegis of his Department on the National Ploughing Championships in each of the years 2016 to 2018 and to date in 2019, by online advertising, offline advertising, promotional material, wages, photography, stand rental and other costs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1217","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":203,"content":"<p>With respect to the 2019, we estimate my Department incurred costs of &euro;71.70 related to the printing of materials on behalf of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform which were to be distributed at the National Ploughing Championships.\u00a0 No costs were incurred in the\u00a0years 2016 to 2018.<\/p><p>There are 17 bodies under the aegis of my Department, 12 of which have not incurred any costs at National Ploughing Championships in the years 2016 to 2018 and to date in 2019.

A key recommendation arising from\u00a0the CIWG&rsquo;s reports was the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission (PIC) and the publication of its two reports.\u00a0 The PIC conducted a benchmarking of award levels exercise between Ireland and other jurisdictions for the first time and this has been very helpful in identifying the scale of the problem that is faced. This research showed that award levels for soft tissue injuries in Ireland are 4.4 times higher than in England and Wales. The PIC recommended that a Judicial Council be established and that it should compile guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury.\u00a0 In carrying out this exercise, the PIC believes that the Judiciary will take account of the jurisprudence of the Court of Appeal, the results of its benchmarking exercise, etc.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The relevant legislation to establish the Judicial Council was a matter for the Minister for Justice and Equality, and as the Deputy will be aware, the Government with the support of all parties in the Oireachtas prioritised the passing of the Judicial Council Act 2019. \u00a0This Act provides for the establishment of a Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee upon the formal establishment of the Judicial Council. \u00a0This Committee is tasked with introducing new guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum. It is important to note that the Government cannot interfere in their deliberations.<\/p>  <p>  A key step to moving this matter forward is for the Chief Justice to make the necessary appointments to the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee.\u00a0 I therefore welcome the recent announcement by Chief Justice Clarke that he has designated the seven judges that will sit on the Committee. I understand that the designate committee will commence its activities on an informal basis shortly.\u00a0 This is an important development as it demonstrates that the Judiciary are giving this matter the priority I believe it deserves. \u00a0While I appreciate that the development of a new set of personal injury award guidelines is the prerogative of the Judiciary, I believe that much work has already been done, in particular the PIC benchmarking exercise, which should assist the Judiciary in completing this work as soon as possible.\u00a0 The Government is willing to provide the Judiciary with any background assistance, such as input from the Cost of Insurance Working Group,\u00a0should they think that necessary.\u00a0 In that context, I am happy for my Department to play its role.\u00a0 I also understand that PIAB has written to the Judiciary to offer its expertise and assistance for the purpose of this recalibration exercise.<\/p>  <p>  I might also add that in addition to the work of the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee, the Law Reform Commission (LRC) is carrying out a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries.\u00a0 This is another important recommendation of the CIWG, which I believe should not be overlooked. \u00a0I believe that if there was a significant move in this area, it could also have an impact on insurance pricing and could also help attract new entrants into the insurance market.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, as I have stated before, I believe that if the issue of the level of awards in this country is addressed, that the problems facing particular businesses and community groups as a result of particular insurers either withdrawing from the market or increasing the price of insurance should recede.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112800035#WRC06500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Credits","counter":213,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112800035#WRC06600"},{"type":"question","counter":214,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[49665\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112800035#WRC06700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the tax free allowance in the case of a person (details supplied).","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":215,"content":"<p>Every person resident in Ireland is entitled to a personal tax credit.

Goal 3 of the Plan is to &ldquo;gather accurate data and evidence on access and participation and to base policy on what that data tells us&rdquo;. The HEA&rsquo;s recently published Spatial and Socio-Economic Profile of Higher Education Institutions in Ireland arises from the implementation of this goal and the publication of a data access plan in 2018. The report enhances understanding of how socio-economic background and levels of disadvantage have impacted on rates of participation in higher education.<\/p>  <p>  The findings in the report show the extent of diversity of the student population in our higher education institutions as well as the diversity of the institutions. This is the first year this type of data is available so it is only possible to establish trends when more years of data become available.<\/p>  <p>  This report is not the only source of data in relation to the socio-economic background of our higher education student population. The socio-economic data where we have an established trend shows that there are improvements being made in access to higher education from target socio-economic groups. Specifically, the Progress Review of the National Access Plan published in December 2018 showed an increase in participation by people disadvantaged by socio-economic backgrounds in the following groups:<\/p>  <p>  Non-manual worker group: 23% in 2012\/13, 27% in 2016\/17<\/p>  <p>  Semi\/unskilled manual worker group: 26% in 2012\/13, 36% in 2016\/17<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to recognise and acknowledge that higher education is not the only option for school leavers. Further education, apprenticeships and progression to the labour market are all equally important, valid and worthwhile alternative options.<\/p>  <p>  A number of initiatives are in place to support increased participation in higher education by under-represented groups including those from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds and communities e.g. Student Assistance Fund, HEAR, and the more recent PATH Fund.<\/p>  <p>  The report provides a key evidence base that will help policymakers in the HEA and Department of Education and Skills as well access services in higher education institutions to develop a better understanding of the levels of socio-economic disadvantage in our communities and regions. In particular, the data in the report will support institutions to develop more targeted approaches to widening access in their regions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112800036#WRD05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport Eligibility","counter":278,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112800036#WRD05900"},{"type":"question","counter":279,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[49621\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112800036#WRD06000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will address a matter regarding the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1328","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":280,"content":"<p>School Transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department.  <\/p><p>In the 2018\/2019 school year over 117,500 children, including over 13,000 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres at a cost of over &euro;200m in 2018. <\/p><p>The purpose of the Department's School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children with special educational needs arising from a diagnosed disability. <\/p><p>In general, children with special educational needs are eligible for school transport if they are attending the nearest school that is resourced to meet their special educational needs.

These new ways of working seek to embed public service reform into operational and delivery systems through citizen-focused design.<\/p>  <p>  This approach to the cross-Government presence brought an increased level of coordination, cohesion and alignment between Government Departments, agencies and State-supported bodies at the NPC.  It also focused on maximising the value and quality of supports and services provided to NPC visitors.  For the first time, over 150 exhibitors were located in the one area, &ldquo;The Government of Ireland Village&rdquo;, and Government stands across Departments, agencies and bodies were grouped in marquees and tents on the basis of the supports, services and policy areas they are responsible for.<\/p>  <p>  While there was no dedicated Departmental stand during the period in question, a number of agencies under the remit of my Department had their own stands or were present at other stands, reflecting the broad range of work carried out in the Justice sector.  I have referred your request to the relevant agencies for their direct response to provide further detail.<\/p>  <p>  All of the Department&rsquo;s online and offline advertising was developed internally and, as such, no additional external costs were incurred.<\/p>  <p>  The NPC provides an important opportunity to provide advice and guidance to citizens about many issues under the remit of my Department including safety. This year, for example, at the NPC I formally launched the National Rural Safety Forum - a collaborative partnership between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, my own Department and a wide range of partners including the IFA and Muintir an T&iacute;re. Its objectives include information sharing and community engagement on crime prevention. <\/p>  <p>  I attend the National Ploughing Championships every year including since I became Minister for Justice and Equality. The then T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Frances Fitzgerald T.D. attended in 2016. Generally, the Minister is accompanied by their Private Secretary at the event.  A member of staff from the Department's Press and Communications Office would also be present as part of their normal duties in connection with publicising the work of the Department and the agencies under its remit.<\/p>  <p>  All staff in question are entitled to travel and subsistence payments in connection with their attendance in line with civil service guidelines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112800037#WRE00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":300,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112800037#WRE00500"},{"type":"question","counter":301,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[49562\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112800037#WRE00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 99 of 25 September 2019, the number of members in the roads policing unit by division as of 22 November 2019; the target number for each division by the end of December 2019; if there were divisions in which no competition was completed for members to join the unit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":302,"content":"<p>In accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 as\u00a0amended,\u00a0the Garda Commissioner is responsible for\u00a0managing and controlling the administration and business of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including the allocation and efficient use\u00a0of Garda resources.<\/p><p>I have requested the\u00a0relevant information from\u00a0the Commissioner\u00a0and I will write to the Deputy directly when I receive it.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112800037#WRE00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residency Permits","counter":303,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112800037#WRE00800"},{"type":"question","counter":304,"qnumday":113,"qnumall":"[49593\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112800037#WRE00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will take steps to expedite an application for residency by persons (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":305,"content":"<p>The persons referred to by the Deputy applied for a right of residency, accompanied by a right to work, based on their parentage of an Irish citizen child on 27 September 2019.

Responding to the needs of victims has seen the rollout of Divisional Protective Services Units (DPSUs) with specially trained officers responsible for investigations, including engagement with victims. These Units will support the delivery of a consistent and professional approach to the investigation of sexual and domestic crime.\u00a013 DPSUs have now been rolled out and I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that they will be in place nationwide by the end of Quarter 1, 2020. <\/p>  <p>  The introduction of these measures supported Ireland&rsquo;s ratification this year of the Istanbul Convention (the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence), which I announced on International Women's Day last March.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In May the Government supported my proposal to commission\u00a0a study into familicide and domestic homicide reviews.

This team brings vast experience and a wide specialist expertise and included a period for consultation with a wide range of stakeholders including State agencies, family members of victims and NGOs.<\/p>  <p>  While familicide is relatively rare in Ireland, these events have a devastating impact on those left behind, both family members and the wider community. The study will examine how such supports can be provided in a more systemic and integrated way. The study will attempt to ensure that victims of familicide are supported in as compassionate and timely a way as possible; as well as how local communities who experience the horror of familicide cases in their local areas can be best supported.<\/p>  <p>  In parallel to that study, in the context of the categorisation and recording of homicides An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently conducting a review of the investigation of certain homicides which includes a number of domestic homicides.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Separately to this, An Garda Sioch&aacute;na is developing policies and procedures to inform the overall policing approach to domestic homicides.\u00a0 This includes a Domestic Homicide Review Team in the Garda National Protective Services Bureau examining a small number of domestic homicides of relevance for review. The purpose of such reviews is to examine what lessons, if any, should be learned and what potential changes to relevant policing policy and procedures should be introduced. It is intended that such a course of action will result in an improved response by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the handling of domestic violence and\/or abuse into the future and ultimately reduce the number of domestic related homicides in our society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112800037#WRE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Family Reunification Applications","counter":309,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112800037#WRE01400"},{"type":"question","counter":310,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[49631\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112800037#WRE01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if in the event of proof of available accommodation in the case of a person (details supplied) he will be prepared to review the refusal of IHAP family reunification; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":311,"content":"<p>My Department does not accept further documentation in support of IHAP proposals once a decision has issued.

Legal aid is available to persons who satisfy the financial eligibility criteria laid down in that Act and in the Civil Legal Aid Regulations 1996 to 2017. Principally, the person must have disposable income of less than &euro;18,000 per annum and disposable capital assets of less than &euro;100,000 (excluding the home in which they live). The person&rsquo;s case must also satisfy the merits criteria laid down under that Act. These criteria include if the applicant is reasonably likely to be successful in the proceedings and if having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the cost to the Board as against the benefit to the applicant, it is reasonable to grant legal aid.<\/p>  <p>  The Legal Aid Board is bound to apply the financial eligibility and merits criteria to all cases.  While I as Minister for Justice, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, can disapply the financial eligibility criteria by means of an amendment to the Civil Legal Aid Regulations 1996, I cannot disapply the merits criteria in such a manner under the Act.  <\/p>  <p>  The Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015 provides particular provisions in relation to legal aid for what are termed &ldquo;relevant persons&rdquo; (RPs) under the Act. The provisions would effectively remove the means criteria for RPs and apply what is known as the &ldquo;reduced merits&rdquo; criteria (the same criteria applicable in cases involving the welfare of a child, i.e. that the prospects of success and reasonableness tests are removed). It also provides for a mechanism for recovering costs in cases where legal aid is granted to an RP who would have been financially ineligible for legal services. These provisions are contingent on the commencement of Part 5 of the 2015 Act and are not worded in such a way that they could be applied to the provisions of the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act1871.<\/p>  <p>  When the court considers it appropriate it can appoint a Guardian ad Litem to represent the voice of the Ward in Court. If funds are not available to cover the Ward's costs associated with this appointment, they are borne by the Courts Service, Health Service Executive or the Child and Family Agency. If the Health Service Executive or the Child and Family Agency seeks the appointment of a Guardian ad Litem, they bear the costs of the appointment.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to fully commencing the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, as the Deputy will be aware, the Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015. The Act provides for the establishment of new administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service (DSS) within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health). <\/p>  <p>  A high-level Steering Group comprising senior officials from my Department, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission and the Courts Service, together with the Director of the DSS, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service and this work is ongoing.<\/p>  <p>  A number of provisions of the 2015 Act were commenced in October 2016 in order to progress the setting up of the DSS. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 515 of 2016) commenced provisions of the Act to enable the recruitment of the Director of the DSS.  Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn was appointed Director of the DSS on 2 October 2017.  <\/p>  <p>  The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.  The Minister for Health, under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) (No. 2) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 517 of 2016), brought some provisions of Part 8 of the Act into operation on 17 October 2016. The commenced provisions provide for the establishment by the Minister for Health of a multi-disciplinary group to make recommendations to the Director of the DSS in relation to codes of practice on advance healthcare directives. In anticipation of the completion of that process, the Minister for Health commenced the remainder of section 91 on 17 December 2018 (S.I. No. 527 of 2018). <\/p>  <p>  The key preparations are being put in place under the oversight of the Steering Group to allow for further commencement orders for the provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the DSS is ready to roll out the new decision-making support options. <\/p>  <p>  Work has been ongoing in my Department on the drafting of necessary amendments to the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, taking account of issues raised by the Mental Health Commission, the codes of practice working groups and submissions received from other bodies.  The intention was to bring forward these amendments by way of the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016. However, when D&aacute;il Committee Stage took place on the Bill on 30 January 2019, a number of amendments were agreed which had previously been ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle, thus giving rise to a procedural matter.

People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  People who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of GP consultations. General medical services are provided by GPs. If the patients clinical condition warrants a referral to a Consultant then their GP will organise that course of action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112800039#WRG04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disease Incidence","counter":484,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112800039#WRG04100"},{"type":"question","counter":485,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[49589\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112800039#WRG04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to establish a registry of persons suffering from fibromyalgia in order that it is possible to ascertain the number of persons suffering from the condition; his view on whether it would be prudent to establish the registry alongside that of arthritis in view of the fact that more persons retire early as a result of fibromyalgia than arthritis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1234","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":486,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112800039#WRG04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Orthodontic Services Waiting Lists","counter":487,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112800039#WRG04400"},{"type":"question","counter":488,"qnumday":175,"qnumall":"[49596\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112800039#WRG04500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of children and adolescents in Cork city and county on a waiting list for orthodontic assessment and treatment, respectively; the length of time they have been waiting; the number of consultants providing such services in the location; the vacancies in this regard; the steps being taken to reduce the waiting lists; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":489,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112800039#WRG04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists Data","counter":490,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112800039#WRG04700"},{"type":"question","counter":491,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[49597\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112800039#WRG04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if information regarding public hospital waiting lists for surgery (details supplied) will be provided.","asker":"1223","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":492,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[49599\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112800039#WRG04900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if information regarding public hospital waiting list (details supplied) will be provided.","asker":"1223","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":493,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 176 and 177 together.<\/p><p>Reducing waiting time for patients for hospital operations and procedures is a key priority for Government.

The related actions include enhancing the effectiveness of climate-related communications, network building, and developing deliberative capacity, including through the National Dialogue on Climate Change (NDCA). <\/p>  <p>  Communications and engagement will be closely intertwined with policy changes to be delivered. It will rest on three key elements:<\/p>  <p>  - persuasive, consistent and effective external-facing communications on climate change and the need for action, including specific details on what the state is doing and what individuals can do to contribute;<\/p>  <p>  - engagement designed to empower communities, that builds on the Climate Action Regional Roadshows, and quickly leads to mobilisation, capacity building and local action, and<\/p>  <p>  - efficient exchange of information within the civil and public service, including all relevant commercial semi-state companies, directly related to supporting the Government&rsquo;s climate action objectives.<\/p>  <p>  The overall objective of this approach is create a long- term process to communicate with citizens on the national objective of transitioning to a low carbon, climate resilient society and economy by 2050 in which every citizen has a role to play. <\/p>  <p>  Engagements, on a regional and local basis have already taken place, with stakeholders in Athlone, Tralee and Kildare. I have also held a series of regional town hall meetings since the publication of the Climate Action Plan to gather views in relation to its implementation. In consultation with the EPA, I am currently developing a model for implementation of the next phase of the NDCA which will focus on local activation. <\/p>  <p>  Engaging youth is key to the driving and encouraging future behavioural changes and I am communicating with that generation through a number of strands, including supports for climate related activity for Green Schools, and ECO-UNESCO.

The average population loss in the original CL&Aacute;R regions over the period 1926 to 1996 was 50%.<\/p>  <p>  In 2006, an analysis of the 2002 Census data was carried out by the NIRSA Institute (National Institute for Regional and Spatial Analysis) at Maynooth University and the programme was extended to include areas with an average population loss of 35% between 1926 and 2002. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the CL&Aacute;R programme was closed for new applications in 2010.  However, I re-launched the programme in the second half of 2016, using as a base-line the areas identified in the work carried out by NIRSA. <\/p>  <p>  I have initiated a review of the CL&Aacute;R programme which will examine CL&Aacute;R areas by reference to the 2016 Census of Population data.  It will also consider whether there are any other factors that should be taken into account in designating areas for eligibility under CL&Aacute;R in the future.<\/p>  <p>  My officials have been in contact with NIRSA with regard to carrying out a detailed analysis of the most recent Census data to further inform the review process, and that engagement is ongoing.  I envisage that a wider stakeholder consultation will also take place before the review is fully complete.  Once completed, the review will help to inform the design of future CL&Aacute;R programmes and any additional measures which may be included.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112800042#WRK04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1334"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","counter":699,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112800042#WRK04800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Strategies","counter":698,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112800042#WRK04700"},{"type":"question","counter":699,"qnumday":252,"qnumall":"[49460\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112800042#WRK04800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if the new road map for social inclusion 2019 to 2025 will be further delayed in view of the fact that new SILC data is due for release on 28 November 2019 which may impact on the targets set in the road map and so on; if the road map for social inclusion will have to be revised in view of the new data; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":700,"content":"<p>The new Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2020-2025 will include data from the 2018 EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC), to be released by the CSO on 28 November, with any necessary adjustments made to the targets.\u00a0 It is not expected that the inclusion of this data will have any impact on the timeframe for publication of the new Roadmap.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112800042#WRK04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Code","counter":701,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112800042#WRK05000"},{"type":"question","counter":702,"qnumday":253,"qnumall":"[49462\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112800042#WRK05100","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the documents required to be submitted to her Department by a person applying for a means tested payment to prove that the person is separated and not in receipt of maintenance payments in view of informal separation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1234","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":703,"content":"<p>Social welfare legislation provides that all income and assets belonging to the claimant and his or her spouse, partner or cohabitant are assessable for social welfare means testing purposes. <\/p><p>Where a person is informally separated, and living apart from their spouse or civil partner,\u00a0social welfare inspectors have a key role in investigating and advising the Department&rsquo;s deciding officers on whether a couple are separated for means testing purposes.
