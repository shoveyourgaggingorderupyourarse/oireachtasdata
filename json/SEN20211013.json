She went through a traumatic trial and, to her horror, realised afterwards that all victim supports had dried up.  She was effectively left to fend for herself and cope with the implications of the trial with no offer of counselling.  Another woman, Shaneda Daly, who went public with her similar experience, stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tYou come out of the court and you&rsquo;ve had your day in court, and he&rsquo;s gone to prison, and you&rsquo;re kind of high at the sentencing ... You&rsquo;re living your life a little bit and then [that] bubble just bursts.  There&rsquo;s no one around you any more ... No one ever contacts you again ... any support [that was there is gone].  <\/blockquote> <p>In some ways, these issues are just the tip of the iceberg.  I have no doubt the Minister saw the report published last week by the Rape Crisis Network Ireland, which stated there was an &quot;exponential increase&quot; in demand for its services and it does not use that term lightly.  It described how, over a period of time, there has been a doubling in the number of calls to its helpline, in addition to a 63% increase in appointments and, crucially, there is now a waiting list time in excess of a year for survivors or victims being assigned a counsellor.  We know these issues existed pre-Covid and, therefore, have not sprung up during the last year.  The annual report of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, published at the beginning of September, told a similar story.  What is the Government doing to properly support and resource these rape crisis centres, which provide a crucial service, to ensure no survivor is left waiting for an unacceptable length of time?<\/p><p>I looked at the detail in the budget to see if the Government responded to the calls made by the various rape crisis centres throughout the country and I note the budget's expenditure report states the Government will maintain supports for domestic, sexual and gender based violence services.  To be frank, that is not good enough.  We need to see an increase in funding, not a maintenance of existing funds.  There are two primary issues involved.  There is a recruitment and retention crisis in regard to psychotherapists, who provide sexual assault and rape counselling services in rape crisis centres.  The present situation is that such section 56 organisations have not been recognised as organisation that need to pay decent wages to retain their staff.  Many of these services had to reduce salaries in line with public service wage agreements ten years ago.  While there has been pay restoration and pay progress for many public sector workers, including section 39 organisations, the same cannot be said of section 56 organisations.  Therefore, they have difficulty retaining staff.  The second issue is the dramatic increase in demand for services, which is a good thing because people who suffered trauma in the past are, only now, willing to come forward.  We need to respond to them in a timely manner.<\/p><p>In my remaining time, I will relay the story of Siobhan in Limerick.  I am grateful to her for allowing me to share her story here today.  She is a survivor of multiple sexual assaults and abuse in her younger years.  Two and a half years ago, she decided to seek help.  It took her a whole year to establish that she could access help from the Rape Crisis Centre, One in Four or HSE adult counselling services.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Marie Sherlock:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is telling that it took a whole year to even establish that for her.

Of course, this is a story that is told by many others.<\/p><p>We are looking to hear from the Minister what supports the Government is putting in place for services within the rape crisis centres.

I am aware that this has received significant media attention recently, and that the statistics are very sobering.  There has been a 100% increase in calls to helplines, a 63% increase in appointments and a 30% increase in the number of survivors attending centres.  The Senator has outlined, beyond the statistics, the real-life impact of those waits on victims.<\/p> <p>The response to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, DSGBV, is across government and is a multiagency issue, and policy is co-ordinated by the Department of Justice.  I will outline what my Department is doing and then speak a little on what the Department of Justice is doing also.<\/p> <p>Tusla has statutory responsibility under the Child and Family Agency Act for the care and protection of victims of DSGBV.  Tusla funding is available for DSGBV services such as refuges, other domestic violence services and the rape crisis centres.  This is &euro;30 million for 2021, which includes &euro;28 million of core spending and &euro;2 million on Covid spending.  In the budget yesterday I announced an additional &euro;40 million for Tusla, which is very significant funding.  There will be additional funding for DSGBV services within that.  The breakdown of Tusla's funding for next year will not come out for a number of weeks.  This is how it always happens.  We do not tell Tusla exactly how to allocate its departmental allocation.  That will be decided in the next weeks.<\/p> <p>Tusla has advised that funding specific to sexual violence and rape crisis services has increased by 32% since 2016.  It supports the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre to operate the national 24-7 free phone sexual violence helpline which is a round-the-clock accessible point of contact for anyone seeking support.  Tusla provided an additional &euro;275,000 to the two national 24-7 DSGBV helplines.  This was an additional 50% on their annual core funding.  That extra money came in 2021 to add capacity in the context of the Covid crisis.<\/p> <p>The rape crisis centres have assured Tusla that their waiting lists are actively managed.  People who are in acute crisis are prioritised.  The contact remains open for anyone on a waiting list, and especially if there are concerns around safety.  Tusla also supports general counselling in local communities via the family resource centres.  There is an absolute acknowledgement that there is great demand for mental health professionals, and there are challenges in recruiting and retaining staff.  Costs for support, supervision and professional development are included when the funding for sexual violence and rape crisis services is received from Tusla. <\/p> <p>On the actions being taken by the Department of Justice, it has created an implementation plan entitled Supporting a Victim's Journey, for the review of protections for vulnerable witnesses in the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences.  The Senator has outlined the struggles that survivors have had following a prosecution.  A subgroup on the work of this plan commissioned an expert consultant to analyse and categorise the supports provided with grant funding made by the Department of Justice in 2021 under the victims of crime grant scheme.  The consultant identified geographical areas and categories of victims, which represent gaps or unmet need in the current provision of these supports services within the criminal justice system.  The Department of Justice is now in the process of contacting identified NGOs to arrange to distribute funding to provide additional services and extend geographical scope.<\/p> <p>Another subgroup is focused on developing specialist training for legal professionals, counsellors and psychotherapists working in front-line services.  Building on the mapping exercise, the subgroup will design a framework for the provision of a range of training and awareness-raising measures for those engaged with victims of sexual crime and vulnerable witnesses.  Tusla is contributing to those actions also.<\/p> <p>I do not know exactly the full package announced by the Department of Justice from yesterday, I believe it is holding a more detailed press conference today.  I am aware the Department is putting in place a specific funding package for the victim's journey in implementing the Department's response to that. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#B00200","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1634117400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  I welcome a lot of the detail that the Minister has provided.  It is certainly positive that the gaps are being identified and that the subgroup focusing on developing specialist training is being put in place, and that there will be funding announced over the coming weeks under the DSGBV heading.  What worries me slightly is the sentence \"The rape crisis centres have assured Tusla that their waiting lists are actively managed\".  Of course they are actively managing their lists but the lists are too long.  We need to see that detail now, notwithstanding everything the Minister has said that we will see the detail.  We need to see it as soon as possible.  We are coming into the winter period now and into what is considered a more normalisation of society.  People are no longer willing to put up with excuses of Covid or anything else.

In my engagement with Tusla on the funding of existing domestic violence services, the funding of new services was also identified as a priority.  The Senator will be aware that the accommodation review of refuges will be published shortly and we will be looking to support that in conjunction with my Department, the Department of Justice and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in the context of the capital acquisitions scheme which is the capital funding.  It is about bringing those elements together.  That is what we are doing with the overall audit of the provision of DSGBV services.

I was pleased to note in yesterday's budget an increase in the funding to be made available to the Child and Family Agency.  I look forward to hearing more from the Minister's Department as to where these additional resources will be specifically allocated.<\/p> <p>Last week I spoke in the Seanad on the challenges faced by Irish care leavers in the transition into further education.  It is very important that we speak about children in care and the issues faced by our care-experienced young people on a regular basis.  We often hear that this vulnerable group does not feel seen or heard.<\/p> <p>The issue I will speak about today is one that, if acted on, will ensure that care-experienced young people are seen, heard and adequately supported.  In the 2009 Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, widely known as the Ryan report, a wide range of recommendations were made to ensure that the tragedies inflicted on young people in the care of the State were never repeated.  Most of these recommendations have, thankfully, been acted on in the intervening 11 years, but a number remain on hold for one reason or another.  One such recommendation relates to the commencement of a longitudinal study of children in care and aftercare, to measure and evaluate their outcomes versus the majority of young people that are cared for in home.  This was a very important recommendation from the Ryan report and it is a great shame that it has not yet been advanced given the insights we stand to take from the study and the impact this learning could have on the future service provision for children and families.<\/p> <p>As the Minister will be aware, care-experienced young people and young adults face challenges in their lives that many of us struggle to even comprehend.  These challenges affect the young person throughout the course of his or her life, and do not simply disappear when the young person first comes into care and later transitions to after-care or returns to the family of origin.  These challenges affect many young people's ability to develop in line with expectation, and to learn to sustain healthy relationships in childhood and adulthood.  We know this because of anecdotal accounts provided by care-experienced young people, social workers, and social care professionals, and by advocacy groups like Empowering People in Care, EPIC, and the Irish Foster Care Association.  We should not have to rely on evidence like this from people.  Instead, we should undertake a comprehensive longitudinal study of children in care and aftercare, and explore how the data gathered over the course of the study can improve the future provision of services to children and families in the State.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Ruane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Previous Governments committed to this study being undertaken, but, unfortunately, it remains on the back-burner.  To date, we have had recommendations from the Ryan report and agreed to their implementation and undertaken scoping exercises and feasibility studies, but the proposed study has still not commenced.  There are barriers to undertaking a study of this nature but, as demonstrated by the feasibility study undertaken in 2018, they are not insurmountable.  As I know the Minister of State will agree, our care-experienced young people are deserving of that effort.<\/p><p>Similar studies have been undertaken in other jurisdictions.  We even have a precedent for longitudinal study of young people in this country in the form of Growing up in Ireland.  Given the specificities the experiences of young people in care, however, we require a study which focuses on the specific experiences of many challenges faced by young people in care and aftercare and on the unique needs of a vulnerable group in Irish society.  Without it, care-experienced young people will continue to feel unseen and unheard in comparison with their majority peers.  Young people who cannot be cared for at home deserve better.  By committing to the commencement of the longitudinal study, which was first proposed in the Ryan report, we can demonstrate to young people with care experience that we see them, hear them and are working hard to ensure that they achieve the best outcomes and the brightest futures that they so deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#B00500","speaker":"1681","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634117400,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Ruane for raising this important matter.  I am aware of the vulnerability of people leaving care.  I met with representatives from the Irish Aftercare Network on Monday, and we had a good discussion.  It is not the first time I met with them.  I have met groups such as Empowering People in Care, EPIC, so I am engaged with people, both dealing with children in care, and those supporting children in aftercare.  I listen carefully to what they have to say.<\/p> <p>As the Senator is aware, the Ryan report implementation plan recommended that a longitudinal survey will be carried out to follow young people for ten years after they left care, with the agreement of the young people involved.  At various times over subsequent years, consideration has been given by my Department to how to best implement this recommendation.  Tusla and my Department commissioned a feasibility report, of which the Senator spoke, which was authored by Dr. Carmel Devaney and Dr. Cl&iacute;ona Rooney of the UNESCO child and family research centre at the National University of Ireland Galway and which was published in 2019.  The report provided evidence and learning from longitudinal studies in other countries and, importantly, it also recommended extending any consideration of longitudinal research to include children in care, as well as those who are leaving care.  The report highlighted the need for more information regarding the experiences of and outcomes for children in care and leaving care in Ireland, which could then be used to inform policy and service development.<\/p> <p>There is an agreement between my Department and Tusla that greater knowledge of the lives of children in care, as well as those leaving care, is needed.  It is accepted that the Ryan report recommendations should be extended to include both cohorts.  However, the scale and cost of longitudinal research is substantial.  As a result, careful consideration needs to be given to whether and in what format a longitudinal study on children in care and leaving care should be carried out.  There have been significant developments the collection and analysis of administrative data on children in care since the publication of the Ryan report.  These also need to be considered and incorporated in any decision that is made on how to proceed.<\/p> <p>We established a working group between my Department of Tusla in November 2020.  The purpose of the working group is to inform me of the ways in which the Ryan report recommendation for longitudinal research into the lives and experiences of children in care and those living care can best be met.  This will include consideration of the feasibility of conducting longitudinal research with these children and young people.  The working group has met six times to date.  There are two more meetings planned for October and November.  It is my expectation that the working group will produce a high-level report in which it will outline the findings and conclusions of its work.  I will consider this when making a decision on how best to proceed.<\/p> <p>The working group was originally meant to report in quarter 3 of this year.  As has been the case with so many aspects of Tusla's operations, the cyberattack has delayed that.  I am now expecting the report by the end of 2021.  That will allow me, hopefully in early 2022, to make a decision on how we provide the best available research for children in care at the moment and those leaving who are leaving care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#C00200","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1634117400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his encouraging response about the working group and the report he expects it to provide by the end of the year.

It is always good to keep in our frame of thinking about what would the cost be of not taking a particular action.

I know this is a busy week for him in the context of the budget and his other ministerial commitments.<\/p> <p>I will preface my remarks by saying that this matter relates to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  I engaged in the council's county development public consultation process as a citizen.  While I am here today as a politician talking about legislation and potential anomalies in the legislation, I want to share my experience as a citizen who engaged with a public consultation relating to the city and county development plan process.  The latter is an important process for which the Minister of State has ultimate responsibility.  I put on record my admiration for the professional way in which D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council&rsquo;s chief executive and elected members conduct their business.  They take it seriously.  One of the most important functions of elected city or county councils is the reserved function relating to mapping out the proper planning and sustainable development of their administrative areas for a period of five years.  We know that work is ongoing on development plans across the country.  We are talking about development plans that will come into operation in 2022.<\/p> <p>The background to this is that I have been in touch with the Minster of State&rsquo;s Department in respect of this matter before.  I am somewhat surprised that it has become an issue at this stage and I am somewhat disappointed that it has not been resolved.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has stated that there is a conflict between two interrelated sections of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  The sections are section 12(3), which sets out statutory timeframes for the addition of and-or deletion from the record of protected structures, and section 12(7), which sets out statutory timeframes associated with the material alteration stage of the county development plan-making process.  That is the advice being given by the professionals to the elected members of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council in respect of the current stage of the development plan process, namely, the stage to which I am referring.<\/p> <p>I served as a member of the council for many years.  As a citizen and as a someone who has a particular interest in architectural conservation and protected structures, I chose one building to focus on.  The council described it as a Gothic, red-bricked, granite chapel in Tivoli Terrace in south County Dublin to be added to the record of protected structures.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It fitted all the criteria, as the Minister of State will be aware, of which there are five or six including heritage, architectural, scientific significance, and the chief executive, in her report to the elected members, suggested that it might very well cover some of the criteria.  That is not in dispute.  <\/p><p>I am only one person and I am doing this on behalf of many other citizens.  Yesterday I received a print off of all people who made submissions to this county development plan process.  This is about what members of the public, who engaged in a public consultation process, are being told by the manager.  She says that there is a conflict in the legislation and she will not be in a position to allow the elected members of this local authority to consider them further.

With regard to the safeguarding of protected structures, Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, gives primary responsibility to local authorities to identify and protect architectural heritage by including particular structures on their respective record of protected structures, RPS.<\/p><p>The making of a statutory development plan of a planning authority is set out in the Act and provides for the identification and protection of structures of heritage through their inclusion in the RPS.  Inclusion on the RPS places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures.  Section 11 of the Act sets out the procedures and processes for the preparation of the draft development plan, including any buildings or structures to be included in the RPS.  <\/p><p>Section 12 of the Act then stipulates the public consultation exercise to be undertaken for the draft development plan including a public display period, of minimum 10-week duration, within which period members of the public and others may make submissions to the planning authority.  There is then a further 12-week period in which the chief executive of the planning authority must prepare a report, and a further 12 weeks during which time the members of the authority must consider the report on the draft plan &ndash; a maximum of 34 weeks in total.  Following the planning authority&rsquo;s consideration of the report on the draft development plan, the elected members may then propose that material alterations be made under section 12(6) of the Act.There is a corresponding four week period of public consultation be held for the receipt of submissions on same; a further four week period in which the chief executive of the Planning Authority must prepare a report; and, a further six weeks during which time the members of the authority must consider the report &ndash; a maximum of 14 weeks in total.<\/p><p>The legislation governing this stage, that is the material alterations stage, of the development plan preparation process is not explicit in specifying that a planning authority may, or may not, add to or delete from the RPS.  However, it is clear that any material alteration may be made to the draft plan, which enables scope to make material alteration changes to the RPS.  In this regard it is noteworthy that after public display of the proposed material alterations, when they are being considered by the elected members of the planning authority, the possibility for any further modifications to the RPS to be introduced is specifically excluded as per section 12 (10)(<i>c<\/i>)(ii) of the Planning and Development Act.  There is no such specific exclusion on changes to the RPS at the material alterations stage.<\/p><p>Finally, it is noted that it is also possible for the planning authority to propose additions or amendments to the RPS at any time, that is, outside of the development plan making process.  Section 55 of the Act sets out the procedure for doing so.  In such cases there is a six week period for public consultation, with a decision to be made within 12 weeks.  This is therefore the shortest of the three possible procedures, at 12 weeks in total.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#D00200","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1634117400,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I am aware of all of that.

When considering the draft development plan, there are multiple matters to be considered, reported on and determined.  This requires 34 weeks.  The timeframe narrows considerably at the material alterations stage, which requires 14 weeks.  Clearly a separate listing process is a single focus exercise, and requires just 12 weeks.

I ask that he would send me on the advice.  He might have done so already but I did not see it yet.  We will definitely take a look at it.  Having been a local authority member myself, I know there has been frustrations where some buildings were included in the protected structure list, and sometimes getting an assurance etc. has been difficult.

This morning I am asking for an update from the Minister of Education on timelines associated with the employment of a design team and the preparation of plans for the proposed new build for Summercove NS in Kinsale.  The last decade or more has seen significant development of how we fund our education infrastructure.  The days of prefabs in every school has moved on.  Many schools in my part of the country have seen really significant development and that should be acknowledged.  In Kinsale, in particular, there have been extensions to the community school, and the Gaelscoil, after a long debacle, has got a site.  However, there is one anomaly in Kinsale, namely Summercover NS.  It is a busy, thriving national school and a significant part of our community.  In recent decades it has been striving to secure redevelopment.  There was a range of issues including one with a site and with planning.  I am pleased to see a site has been purchased and the trustees of the diocese have moved into the space and completed the transfer of the site.  Now we need the Department of Education to step up and allocate the resources to provide a design team that can lodge planning permission.  That design team needs to look at the new site being proposed and lodge planning permission as soon as we can for the pupils, teachers, the board of management and principal who is leaving on 22 October.  They have done so much to make sure this site was available.  Now we need to progress with the Department to make sure we build this new school in Summercove.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Tim Lombard:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2466\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Kinsale is a thriving town and the population figures from the census of 2016 are totally out of date because the development we have seen there in the past five to six years has been amazing.

Summercove National School is a Catholic co-educational primary school under the patronage of the Bishop of Cork and Ross.  In September 2020, the school had an enrolment of 223 pupils with a staffing of a principal, eight mainstream class teachers and three special education teaching posts.  It is the Department&rsquo;s intention to progress the construction of a new school building for the school as part of the school building programme and to underwrite the community of Kinsale, which the Senator mentioned.<\/p> <p>The Department has a large-scale and ambitious roll-out of school building projects under the national development plan, NDP, and as part of Project Ireland 2040.  The continuation of construction work on school building projects during the lockdown period in early 2021 was an important enabler to facilitate the delivery of our school building programme.  During the NDP period of 2018 to 2020, there were 526 projects completed under the large-scale capital programme and the additional school accommodation scheme.  These projects delivered in excess of 48,000 school places, including permanent accommodation for 229 special classes and additional capacity for 67 classrooms in 14 special schools throughout the country.  There are also some 250 school building projects on-site, many of which will be completed in 2022.<\/p> <p>The patron of Summercove National School has recently acquired a 1 ha greenfield site for the construction of the school, subject to planning permission being obtained.  It is intended that the school building will provide capacity for eight classrooms, ancillary accommodation and a two-classroom special education needs base.  The Department is finalising the accommodation brief for the project, which is part of the preparatory work associated with the architectural planning process.  This includes the procurement of a design team.  The Department will be in further contact with the school authorities as the project progresses to the next stage.  Once the design team has been appointed, there are standard procedures to be followed in the progression of the project through preliminary design, detailed design, planning permission and then ultimately proceeding to tender and construction.<\/p> <p>The Senator has alluded to the work he is doing with the community and I know he has been raising this within the Department of Education.  I will also raise that community aspect because it is an exciting project to get on the road from the point of view of the principal, board of management, students and wider community.  There is a strong commitment from the Department, as the Senator can see, but there are processes that have to be embarked on, right through to the planning permission stage and hopefully we will get on-site in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#E00200","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1634117400,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his acknowledgement in the debate.

Today, as we gather here, for the second day a dig is taking place on the Kildare-Wicklow border.  All our thoughts and prayers are with the Jacob family in the hope that they will find some type of resolution to what happened.  Their beautiful daughter Deirdre disappeared when she was 18.  If she was alive, she would be 42 on Thursday.  That puts into context the awful years of torture that the family have suffered.  The Jacob family are much-loved members of the community from Rathangan and Newbridge.  From my perspective, our families have had an intergenerational friendship.  My grandfather and Deirdre's grandfather founded one of the first Fianna F&aacute;il cumanns in the country, in Barnaran, just outside Rathangan.  I felt it was important to show solidarity with Deirdre's parents.  Let us all hope that there is some closure and that they will be able to find their beloved daughter, bring her home and allow her to rest in peace.<\/p> <p>I also want to raise the issue of the Gibbet Rath in the Curragh.  I have called before for a national heritage site for the Curragh, which is a unique landscape which is important geographically and historically.  The Gibbet Rath is a place of particular importance.  In 1798, 350 Irish rebels were slaughtered there by British soldiers.  Unfortunately, at the weekend, there was a lot of vandalism there.  It is not preserved or protected appropriately.  I call for national heritage status for the site.<\/p> <p>I raise the Yellow Flag programme.  We are all aware of the Green Flag programme.  It is a wonderful programme in schools.  As the Leader will know, I introduced legislation here relating to hate crime.  It is important that we do everything that we can to support policies that support inclusion in a proactive, positive way.  Yellow Flag does that.  I met with it last week.  It does excellent work.  It has worked with more than 100 schools but, unfortunately, with the resources that it has, it can only take on ten schools a year.  Some 150 are waiting for the programme.  The Seanad needs to call for support for the Yellow Flag programme.<\/p> <p>The last item that I would like to raise is the extension of visas for people who do not have residency in Ireland.  They have been extended until 15 January, which is good.  If people need to leave the country because of a family emergency or bereavement, for example, they cannot.  That should be amended to ensure that they can do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#G00200","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1634117400,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I welcome the budget allocation for the Department of Health.  As announced yesterday, there is some &euro;22 billion, including &euro;4 billion provided as pandemic supports, which was exceptional funding which has been maintained for next year's budget too.  There are 900,000 people on waiting lists.  Some are there because of delays caused by Covid and by the cyberattack.  Prior to that, there was an excessive waiting list.  We need to treat that waiting list with the same energy and enthusiasm as we have treated the Covid pandemic, with funding and utilising the investment that we have made in facilities, equipment and the expertise of our consultants, theatre staff and nurses.  There is a lot of talk about a four-day week.  We need to go the opposite direction to tackle this waiting list, by going to a six or seven-day week.  Nobody can work 24-7 but we need to harness the expertise and ability of consultants, theatre staff and nurses to tackle this list.  I hope and believe that the allocation in yesterday's budget will go some way to doing that, including using the National Treatment Purchase Fund as necessary.  During the initial stages of the pandemic and again in January of this year, we had agreements with private hospitals to ensure that capacity was being used, if necessary, for Covid surges.  We need to harness that energy again.<\/p> <p>I also call for a debate on Sl&aacute;intecare.  Sl&aacute;intecare has been a cross-party initiative.  We have seen some high-profile resignations recently.  It is important to debate these issues with the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, to address the future of Sl&aacute;intecare and ensure that it continues to progress.  There are some outstanding issues.  There have been many achievements but there is also much confusion.  There was to be a memorandum for Cabinet about elective hospitals last week, which was deferred, which related to the debate around day beds versus inpatient beds.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is important that we have a fuller debate on this very important issue.  There is huge demand in Galway for additional inpatient beds.  We built a 75-bed ward, which was officially opened back in 2017 or 2018.  It came into its own during the Covid period because it had so many en-suite, single occupancy rooms, which were excellent in terms of prevention of cross-infection and all of that.  However, there is a need for inpatient beds.  The Saolta Hospital Group has demanded this in response to the plan put forward by the Sl&aacute;intecare team, which talks about day-only facilities.  We have been led to believe that, for example, these elective facilities would allow for hip and knee operations.  Hip and knee operations cannot be done in facilities where there are only day-care beds.  We do not want American-style healthcare.  We want to ensure that people are treated and have their recovery time over a period of three or four days, or however long it takes.  We need to have this fuller debate in regard to Sl&aacute;intecare, in particular on the issue of inpatient versus day beds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#G00300","speaker":"1665","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634117400,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I welcome the Deputy Leader to the House.

I myself travelled to Belfast, as did other Oireachtas Members.  I look forward to sharing a different perspective on some of those issues later on.<\/p> <p>Senator Kyne is right about the validation of waiting lists.  More than 900,000 people are waiting on the lists.  I undertook with the Leader last week that I would bring this up on a monthly basis.  She prompted me and suggested to me on the floor of the House that I would do it more often, so I did.  I welcome that the Minister for Health will be making a statement later today on the funding and how he wishes to address these ongoing lists, which are shocking.  They are an indictment of the health service.  It is an outrage that people are waiting with tumours, looking for diagnostics, anxious and concerned.<\/p> <p>I made contact with the National Treatment Purchase Fund again, as I undertook to do, and I want to share with the House a few issues.  It just so happens that Senator Kyne spoke first and I did not realise he was going to speak on this issue.  I will circulate a breakdown of the lists later on.  The latest list for Galway University Hospital has 54,757 people, there are 31,325 on the list in Cork University Hospital and St. Vincent's University Hospital has 25,000 people on the waiting list, and these are outpatients only.  Letterkenny Hospital has 18,772 waiting on the list and Beaumont Hospital has 24,095 outpatients on the list.  It is shocking, it is appalling and it is a disgrace that this has gone on for so long.  I was particularly concerned about the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital, with which I made contact only to be told there are 14,355 people looking for ophthalmic interventions.  That is more than regional.  That is a national speciality, so they are coming from all the regions and they cannot be broken down.<\/p> <p>The list goes on and on.  I decided I would share those figures with the House today.  We have a serious concern and we need a debate on the waiting lists.  To be fair to the Minister, who I support, I think he has a very hard and difficult job to do, but we need to see how we are going to address these lists.  In this debate with the Minister, I want to hear who is going to validate the lists.  There is a lot of confusion about double listing, double counting and people not turning up.  This has to be addressed.  They are genuine concerns.  We need a debate urgently on how the Minister is specifically going to tackle these waiting lists and what is the role and function of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, separate from the Department, to administer and validate these lists.  That is important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#H00200","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1634117400,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I would like to raise two issues.  First, on behalf of the Sinn F&eacute;in team, I wish our best to the families of the Stardust fire, who have another pre-inquest hearing today.  Yet again, they are not going to be sure whether their lawyers are going to get paid, despite the fact the legal team have been working on this inquest for three years without receiving a single penny for their work.  All of the other legal teams who represent the other families, the Garda, Dublin Fire Brigade and the coroner have got paid but, for the families at the heart of this inquest, their legal team has yet to get paid.  It is an absolute disgrace.  I wish them the best today.  I hope that can be resolved and that the inquest can go ahead as planned.<\/p><p>The second issue I want to raise is the story in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>today about Ryanair and how it is treating a number of passengers regarding chargebacks during the Covid pandemic.  These are people who could not fly, for one reason or another, and who were either waiting in frustration for refunds from Ryanair - and we have heard of numerous cases concerning how long people had to wait for their refunds - or where they decided to go down the chargeback route.  Ryanair has decided not to take up that dispute with the banks or the credit card companies but, instead, has allowed people to book flights with Ryanair, which takes their money, and then, when those people go to check in, they are refused check-in unless they repay the money they got back in refunds for flights they did not take during the pandemic restrictions.<\/p><p>This raises a number of issues.  In one case, a woman was on a return flight so we are talking about an airline that is potentially leaving people stranded in other countries until they repay the money they got back on their cards, rather than going down the road of pursuing others.  If it feels the money was refunded wrongfully, then Ryanair has plenty of deep pockets to go and pursue that through the proper manner and not leave people stranded when trying to get home from wherever they have had to travel to.  There are also big concerns around GDPR in regard to the manner in which it is doing this.  What information is Ryanair holding on people in terms of credit checks?  It is not a financial institution so if somebody has got a refund from it, what markings is it putting on those people&rsquo;s accounts to ensure it is able to identify them, take their money and then, when they go to check in, demand more money from them?  This requires a statement from the Minister for Transport as to what he is going to do to look into this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#H00300","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speech","time":1634117400,"counter":41,"content":"<p>We all have our own views on budget 2022.

Time will tell who is going to be proved right on that analysis of the budget.<\/p> <p>There is an issue in the budget that I want to draw attention to and that this House needs to discuss, but it is one that was glossed over yesterday, and that relates to youth unemployment.  We heard yesterday that 275,000 jobs will be created next year, and that is wonderful and great.  However, let us put that in perspective.  As of September, we have an unemployment rate of 10% in this country and the Department of Finance expects that rate to fall to an average of just over 7% next year.  That rate covers the labour force as a whole, yet there was no mention of youth unemployment, which is currently running at 17%, four times the rate for older workers in this country.<\/p> <p>If we have learned anything from the previous recession, and as we know from all of the international research on the probable impact of this pandemic, one of the major legacies from the pandemic will be youth unemployment and the scarring impact on young workers or those coming out of college or school in terms of being able to access jobs, in particular decently paid jobs.

The response may be that an increase in the SUSI grant and new apprenticeships were announced yesterday and that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy McGrath, also referenced the work experience placement programme in his speech.  He did, but what he failed to mention was that the funding allocation for the work experience placement programme was slashed by more than 50% for 2022.<\/p><p>With regard to the costs of going to college, many students rely on part-time work, which is now not available to them, to sustain themselves through college.  An increase of &euro;200 in respect of the SUSI grant was announced yesterday.  For students coming to Dublin, as I did 20 years ago, in Dublin 1 and Dublin 7, where I am based, that  &euro;200 will not even buy them an additional week of student accommodation.  The number of apprenticeships announced yesterday is a lot less than that announced for 2021.  <\/p><p>Despite the sunny disposition of budget 2022, the impact of the pandemic is far from over.

We know also that organ donation saves lives.  When someone makes a decision to have his or her organs donated, he or she gives the most important gift, that is, the gift of life.  The donation greatly enhances and, in many ways, saves the life of the person receiving the donation.  It can also give a sense of healing, meaning and consolation to a family of a bereaved person in that they will know that despite their great loss, their loved has the potential to give the gift of life or to enhance the life of another human being.  With that in mind, I was disappointed to learn from the Irish Donor Network that in 2020 there was a 32% decline in solid organ transplantation in Ireland compared to the same period in 2019 and a 27% decrease in deceased organ donation for the same period.  This can all be put down to Covid-19.  That is understandable.  We need to get a grip on the blockages at that time so that we can move forward.<\/p> <p>I ask Members of the House to support me in proposing that the Leader would write to the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, on the matter of expedition of the promised legislation in regard to a soft opt-out for organ donation.  The simpler the process, the better.  In a recent survey, more than 80% of the Irish population were in favour of organ donation.  There is an onus on us in this House to ensure that for citizens of this country there is an opt-in option.  I ask the Leader to write to the Minister in that regard not only on my behalf but, I am sure, on behalf of all colleagues in this House. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#J00200","speaker":"1658"},{"type":"speech","time":1634117400,"counter":44,"content":"<p>Without breaching the etiquette of the Chair, I would like to be on the floor to support that.

We saw in the media the worrying projection that 90% of people in this country will be overweight or obese by 2030.  The World Health Organization predicted that Ireland is on course to become the country with the highest obesity rate in Europe, and that was pre-pandemic.  During my time as a stay-at-home mum I trained as a nutrition and lifestyle coach, which training has gone completely out the window since I got involved in politics.  If you want a good lifestyle politics is very challenging.  On a serious note, we need a debate on lifestyle and supportive interventions to help people make better decisions.  Earlier this week, Professor Donal O'Shea, HSE clinical lead for obesity, expressed the view in the newspapers that it is not as simple as eating less and exercising more and that obesity is a complex, chronic disease and especially affects people with a genetic disposition towards it.  <\/p> <p>The budget is welcome in terms of the extension of the hot school meals to 81 DEIS schools, or a further 16,000 children, bringing the total number of children now benefitting from hot school meals to 55,650.  I have seen this in practice.  It is fantastic.  Nutritious meals such as meatballs and pasta are being delivered to children at their desks.  The budget also provides a &euro;10 increase in the weekly threshold for the working family payment.  There are many pressures on families.  It would be good to have a discussion around issues such as food labelling and what we can do sooner rather than later.  If we cannot move because of EU legislation, there might be things that we can do here, such as putting teaspoons of sugar in certain foods on the price points such that you do not have to pick up the pack.  We need to talk about cooking and how we are losing that skill.  It is time we had a debate on our obesity policy and action plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#J00400","speaker":"1648"},{"type":"speech","time":1634117400,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I was not in the House yesterday so I do not know if this has been already done, but I want to express my admiration and great love of the late Paddy Moloney, who, because of my background in radio and as a voluntary director of a number of festivals, I was privileged to have met.  I met him only twice but he left a lasting impression on me.  It is amazing to hear the BBC, Sky News, the French media and media across the world referencing the death of the late Paddy Moloney, a brilliant player of the uilleann pipes, the thin whistle, the button accordion and the bodhr&aacute;n.  Significantly, he was worth millions to Ireland in tourism revenue.  Some of the festivals in my neck of the woods, in which I was involved, were attended by people from Japan, parts of America, Russia and Germany, which always made us proud.  When asked how they came to know Irish music, they said it was through Paddy Moloney and The Chieftains.<\/p> <p>Paddy performed with Pink Floyd, Ry Cooder, Marianne Faithfull, Mick Jagger, Elvis Costello, Sin&eacute;ad O'Connor, Paul McCartney and so many more.  I could go on.  He had a brilliant influence on people.  He has left a massive legacy.  It is only in the years ahead we will come to realise the significant legacy of one of the most important human beings I have ever known and who people loved to hear play instruments.  One of his most fantastic tunes, \"Tabhair Dom Do L&aacute;mh\", a beautiful melodic piece of music, is being played on media across the world today.<\/p> <p>We should not underestimate the benefits of the budget in terms of education, particularly in regard to DEIS schools, as referenced by Senator Currie in her contribution.  I have been contacted by many schools, as I am sure have other Senators, seeking DEIS status.  There are some towns in my county of Roscommon where the primary school qualifies for DEIS status, but the secondary school does not.  The budget announced yesterday makes significant provision for an increase in the number of special needs assistants, SNAs, and special needs teachers.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#J00500","speaker":"1674"},{"type":"speech","time":1634117400,"counter":47,"content":"<p>Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam, Paddy Moloney.

I pay tribute to Ms Shamim Malekmian of the <i>Dublin Inquirer<\/i>and Ms Fiona Finn of Nasc, the migrant and refugee rights organisation, for highlighting that there is a difficulty.  When an child who was an unaccompanied minor goes missing while in care, there is a child rescue Ireland alert, the case is posted to the global database of missing children and the Tusla social workers who were responsible for the child are then responsible for making follow-up inquiries.  However, there is a significant disparity between the numbers on the database and the numbers with Tusla.  What is happening to these children?  Since 2017, 54 such children have gone missing and only 18 have been accounted for.  We do not know whether their cases have been resolved or who is following up on them.  We do not know who is speaking up for these children.  By the very nature of their status in this country, they do not have family in Ireland, so they do not have people to advocate for them except the Tusla social workers.  These children, whom the State has a responsibility for and to, are going unaccounted for.  We need to have a debate on their care and oversight.  Since it involves the Garda and Tusla, this matter crosses two Departments.

The issue has been raised at the Council of Europe a number of times because it is a problem across Europe.  I support the Senator's call for a debate.<\/p> <p>I wish to speak about Paddy Moloney.  Unlike Senator Murphy, I did not know him but I suspect that, like a number of people, I felt as if I did.  He was such a warm and engaging man whenever he was interviewed on radio or television.  What an ambassador he was for our country.  I will set out a couple of my memories.  In the early 1970s when I was only five or six years of age, my family brought me to the Albert Hall to see The Chieftains.  I did not understand at the time why they were bringing me, but hindsight is very clear.  I cannot say whether it was a wonderful performance.  I just remember seeing the Albert Hall full of Irish, typically working-class, men and women, who took it over that evening.  In the early 1970s, that was quite a thing, given everything that was happening.  My family felt pride in going to see The Chieftains at that time.<\/p> <p>I take Senator Murphy's point about the revenue but consider what The Chieftains did for our diaspora in London, the rest of England, Australia and America.  They toured everywhere and gave us an amazing legacy of music.  I wonder whether the likes of Planxty, Moving Hearts, Stockton's Wing and all the other great groups that we have had would have been possible without the legacy of The Chieftains.  The Chieftains broke ground and put Irish music on the international stage in a way that had never been done before.<\/p> <p>Paddy Moloney was an amazing man, he lived an incredible life and he meant so much to so many people.

In the Bundestag in Germany, there is a full debate on the budget for a certain period and all parties and none, including finance committees and so on, get to put their proposals on the table, stress testing and debate take place, and the finance minister, having listened to and engaged, will ultimately give a summation.  Essentially, Germany's budget process is an open one.  Given the leaking that takes place in Ireland, I suggest that we rethink our process.  As opposed to having post-budget debates, the process would involve the Government listening to and taking good ideas from everyone, including its own, talking to officials and economists and doing what was necessary to make the figures work.  The Budget Statement would essentially be a summation of the process that had occurred in the months beforehand.<\/p> <p>It is important that we note the key points and achievements in this budget.  There is a significant recognition of the need to modernise and support childcare.  There is a recognition that waiting lists in the health service are at an all-time high, primarily because of the pandemic.  Some &euro;200 million is being allocated to address that issue.

Every couple of months, it is one town here, one town there.  Before one knows it, a whole region of a county or an area has no bank.  The bank in Killenaule closed approximately eight or nine years ago.  All the customers in Killenaule were told to move their services to Fethard, which is only 14 or 15 miles away - no problem.  They all moved their services to Fethard, until this week, when they are told to move to Clonmel, now Fethard is closing.  It is a drive of approximately 35 miles to get to Clonmel from Killenaule.  It is not feasible.  We have other AIB services in Cahir.  The Bank of Ireland is closed in Cahir and we only have AIB.  The fear now is over what will happen to Cahir and Cashel.<\/p> <p>These are tourist towns in which services are needed.  We all know when we go abroad, we use the ATMs and bank services more regularly than we would when we are at home.  These are tourist towns that need those services.  We need to have a plan for how we can support rural communities and towns, especially in Tipperary and throughout the country, in the services they are provided.  I recognise Bank of Ireland services have now gone to the post offices and I encourage people to use the post office, as much as possible, but there is a problem.  People are being asked to travel a long distance.  Sometimes, businesses are bringing large sums of money with them to banks.  People are very upset.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#L00600","speaker":"1629"},{"type":"speech","time":1634117400,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I am not focusing this on any individual, but I remind the House it is not protocol to mention the presence or absence of colleagues, if we can avoid that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#L00700","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1634117400,"counter":75,"content":"<p>It was extraordinary no members of the Opposition were in the House for the budget speech last night.

She referenced the Jacob family.  I pay my respects to the family and hope they get Deirdre back.  It is right and proper we show solidarity in this House for their long suffering.  The Senator also mentioned the national heritage site proposal at the Curragh.  I agree it is a unique site and deserves to be protected.  With regard to the Yellow Flag programme on inclusion in schools, if there is that level of demand from schools, we should certainly facilitate it.  It is fantastic for our young people to be involved in those types of projects.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lisa Chambers:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The issue of visas for non-residents was raised.  I refer to those that have been extended but where people cannot leave the country.  It might be a good topic for a Commencement matter with the Department of Foreign Affairs.  <\/p><p>Senator Kyne raised the issue of the health service and the unprecedented investment in health in yesterday's budget.  He then specifically referred to the issue of waiting lists, which have plagued this country for more than a decade.  These excessive waiting lists are hurting people.   As I said to Senator Sherlock, a specific announcement was made in this regard in the budget.  I do not have a specific figure to hand, but it is more than &euro;200 million specifically allocated to tackle waiting lists.  This issue, therefore, is to the fore of the mind of the Minister for Health in respect of targeting these waiting lists now that we are emerging from the pandemic.  Everybody will agree that this must be a priority.  Senator Kyne also raised the issue of Sl&aacute;intecare and requested a debate on that matter.  I am informed by the Leader&rsquo;s office that this debate is scheduled for 19 November.<\/p><p>Senator Boyhan referred to the Private Members' Bill on legacy issues this evening.  I commend the Senator on his work and on travelling to the North with colleagues from both Houses in regard to this issue.  I commend Senator Currie in this respect as well.  She has been to the fore on this issue.  Deputy Lawless and other Members were also involved.  <\/p><p>Senator Kyne in raising his matter has helpfully put on the record the colossal waiting lists affecting all the hospitals.  I am not surprised to hear that University Hospital Galway, UHG, tops that list.  It caters for patients from Mayo, Roscommon, Leitrim, Sligo and Donegal as well, which is a massive region.  As I said, however, a specific announcement was made in the budget regarding funding to address these waiting lists.  I am unsure if that will happen through the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF.  It has been Fianna F&aacute;il policy for many years to use that vehicle to reduce the waiting lists.  It would be a good avenue to take as a one-time measure to clear these waiting lists and start afresh.  We must try to do this.<\/p><p>Senator Boylan raised the issue of the Stardust inquiry, as she has several times before.  It is a major priority for her.  I am not sure why the members of that legal team are the only ones not being paid for their work.  Something must happen in that regard.  It is unfair that every other legal team would be reimbursed but not that of the victims.  Surely the reasonable legal costs could be looked at, and I hope that will be addressed.<\/p><p>I was not up to speed with the Ryanair issue until the Senator raised it.  I got an update, but I was not previously aware that this was happening.  This matter should be looked at, however.  It might be an issue to address in a Commencement matter with the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar or the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  They may be able to shed some light on this issue.  From what the Senator has said, however, it sounds quite incredible that a company would do something like this.  I am a big fan of Ryanair and its having opened up travel to many people, but customers must also be treated well.  This issue requires more investigation.<\/p><p>Senator Sherlock raised yesterday's budget.  She said certain things were not mentioned in the speech.  It is probably difficult to cover everything in one speech.  We must acknowledge that it is incredible that we are in a position to be able to spend the amount of money that we are spending, and to do so in many different sectors, when we are still dealing with the pandemic.  Looking at other jurisdictions, including the one closest to us, we see a different story.  Spending cuts are being mentioned in those countries, but we are spending more money.  It would be difficult to find things in the budget to be annoyed about or to give out about.  I appreciate that Opposition Members must find things to highlight that they feel could have been addressed better or further.  I think it was a good budget, however.  It contained a major package for childcare services.  More than &euro;700 million was allocated and we have never seen that level of investment in childcare.  In addition, more than &euro;30 million was allocated to women&rsquo;s health initiatives.  Similarly, I have never seen that level of spending before in a budget.  The social welfare package was also remarkable, with increases right across the board.  <\/p><p>There were also specific youth policies.  The Senator mentioned youth unemployment.  There will be half-priced travel for young people aged from 17 to 23.  The Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grant was also increased.  Again, I have never seen a budget with so many specific measures addressing young people.  Therefore, I, for one, thought it was a good budget.  I appreciate, however, that the Senator has a job to do in highlighting certain things that were perhaps not addressed at the level she wanted them to be.  I took on board what she said about the level of youth unemployment.  Having a level of unemployment of 10% in the country now is not bad, considering what we have just been through.  We should be relatively optimistic about that figure and that it is going to reduce.  <\/p><p>I take on board as well what the Senator said about youth unemployment being higher.  However, it is always higher than the national unemployment rate and that is normal.  I accept, though, that we must reduce the level of 17%.  Those impacted were generally working in the hospitality and retail areas and those are the sectors still trying to get back on their feet.  The Senator will accept and appreciate, however, that the Government supports provided to businesses have been phenomenal.  It is not just me saying that but also the representatives of the business community.  They have felt very supported.  I refer to the wage subsidy scheme and the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  Those supports ensured that people were okay in the last year and a half, that they could pay their bills and stay in touch with their employers.  That did not happen in every country and we can be proud of the supports we provided to businesses.  Those supports are going to continue as well.  Therefore, there are positives in the budget, and not everything can be done in one budget.  <\/p><p>Senator Gallagher raised the issue of organ donation.  It is important, and I was not aware that there was a 27% reduction in deceased organ donation in 2020.  This is an issue that we must address and we must speed up the promised legislation.<\/p><p>Senator Currie raised the issue of obesity.  Only a few days ago, I heard the same figure in respect of it being projected that by 2030 some 90% of our citizens will be either obese or overweight.  That is a phenomenal figure and an issue we must tackle.  It is a public health issue and one that the country will end up paying for and dealing with through the health service.  We must tackle it and that must happen at the earliest possible opportunity.  We ensure that we are providing healthy meals and exercise opportunities to younger children through the school programme, and in other ways.<\/p><p>Senator Murphy respectfully commented on the passing of Paddy Moloney.  Other Senators concurred with his remarks.  I pay my respects and send my condolences to his family, his friends and all those who will miss him.  The Senator also rightly pointed out that the budget was welcome in respect of its allocation to the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, programme to enable the expansion of that programme to other schools.  The increased allocation of special needs assistants, SNAs, will also make a major difference to many communities.<\/p><p>Senator Seery Kearney raised the issue of migrant children and unaccompanied minors.  The timing is apt and important.  We have had this debate in recent years.  Some unaccompanied minors are arriving from Moria camp, and this will be a recurring issue that the country must deal with.  It is going to become more of an issue for us and we will be taking in more unaccompanied minors.  We should do that, and we are not even going far enough in that regard.  We should be taking in more unaccompanied minors than we are now.  It is embarrassing that we are not doing an awful lot more.  It is shocking to realise as well that of the 54 unaccompanied minors who have been missing since 2018, only 18 have ever been found.  This aspect must be followed up.  This is not a legacy issue but an immediate concern.  This issue has happened in recent years.  A debate with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, would be welcome in this regard.<\/p><p>Senator Gavan concurred with the previous comments and also paid a strong tribute to Paddy Moloney.  He referred to his own experience in that regard.  The whole House will agree with those comments in respect of the mark that Mr. Moloney made and the legacy he left, not just in Ireland but across the globe.  He was a phenomenal musician and a superb ambassador for this country.<\/p><p>Senator Conway spoke about the budget.  When he said we all slept on the budget, I had a picture in my mind of him sleeping on the budget book.  He was right when he said that there was a bit in the budget for everybody.  That has been mentioned as a criticism.  I cannot understand why it is a bad thing for everybody to feel that they got something in yesterday&rsquo;s budget.  It should be a good thing that resources were as evenly spread as we can manage.  There will always be limited resources, so the issue here concerns trying to target and to tailor spending to protect the most vulnerable.  The Senator also discussed the leaking of the budget.  I was listening in the car yesterday on the way to work to the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, discussing that subject with Pat Kenny on the radio.  Mr. Kenny recalled what happened many years ago when the then Minister of State, Phil Hogan, mistakenly faxed the budget in advance of it being announced.  At that point it was a sackable offence, whereas the details of the budget are now discussed well in advance of budget day.  <\/p><p>The former Taoiseach, Mr Ahern, also said that it felt as though yesterday was the day after the budget, not the day of the budget.  Many people love the budget season and the run up to it.  Maybe the big bang of budget day has gone but perhaps the run up to it and the discussions beforehand is where the excitement is now.  The Committee on Budgetary Oversight, which I sat on in the last session, and which was referred to by Senator Buttimer, gives us a chance to feed into this process.  The committee produces a report with cross-party recommendations for the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance to make them aware of the views of all parties in advance of the budget.  I take on board, however, what the Senator said about having that debate prior to the budget itself.<\/p><p>Senator Fitzpatrick referred to the issue of disinformation about the budget.  She mentioned in particular the money that is being allocated and which will be spent to address the rental crisis and to help renters.  It was an important point.  Even if misinformation is done for political purposes, and that might be the accusation, it harms citizens because it scares people into thinking that things are not happening when they are.  That is unfortunate.<\/p><p>Senator Lombard raised the issue of farming families and farming communities, as he often does.  He referred to the climate action Bill and the need to protect rural communities and to ensure that they are vibrant.  The budget contained good measures in respect of agriculture and farming.  All the supports are being maintained and there is also an increase in the budget for agriculture.  Senator Lombard has long been an advocate for the farming community and he will continue to undertake the role.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, is keenly aware of the stresses and strains on farmers in dealing with the climate challenge.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lisa Chambers:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->They are very much stepping up to the mark in that regard.<\/p><p>Senator Buttimer raised the issue of the butcher process which I have dealt with, but also the need for a debate on the future of work which would be an interesting debate to have.  There are very different views and perspective on it but there is no doubt that work has changed since the pandemic.  <\/p><p>Senator Ahearn raised the issue of banking, an issue which he raised previously, in particular the Fethard branch which is of particular concern to constituents of the Senator, and the three Bank of Ireland branches that closed in County Tipperary.  Three of them are closing in Mayo also.  I understand the concern.  It makes things difficult.  Very often people think of retail banking as being for individuals but it really impacts on businesses in the town which need that cash facility to be able to lodge at the end of the day.  That is of particular concern.  A debate around banking services in rural areas is a good idea, including on how we will ensure that businesses have access to banking services in some form.  That might be through post offices or credit unions, but the writing is on the wall in regard to retail banking.  They are private companies.  We have very little control as to where they move their operations and how they work in some regards, but we can assist the post offices and credit unions to step in and provide that service.  That could be the way forward.  That is a debate that needs to be had, because businesses are very worried as to how they are going to operate.  Take Clonmel for example.  As a tourist town it needs banking services, and having to travel long distances makes it very difficult for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#L01400","speaker":"1642","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1634117400,"counter":84,"content":"<p>Order of Business agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"EU Regulations: Motion","time":1634117400,"counter":85,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#N00162"},{"type":"speech","time":1634117400,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat Seanad &Eacute;ireann approves the exercise by the State of the option or discretion under Protocol No. 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, to accept the following measure:   \tRegulation (EU) 2021\/693 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 April 2021 establishing the Justice Programme and repealing Regulation (EU) No. 1382\/2013,  a copy of which was laid before Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 17th June, 2021.&rdquo;  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#N00175","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1634117400,"counter":87,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1634117400,"counter":88,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 12.32 p.m. and resumed at 1 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Budget 2022: Statements (Resumed)","time":1634117400,"counter":89,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#Q00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1634117400,"counter":90,"content":"<p>Budget 2022, with an overall expenditure allocation of &euro;87.6 billion, reflects the Government's commitment to return the public finances to a more sustainable position, address challenges in the key areas of housing and climate action, enhance public services and social supports and ensure a balanced recovery from the pandemic.<\/p> <p>To respond to the pandemic, the Government made available over &euro;30 billion in funding for direct expenditure supports.  This funding was targeted at supporting our health service to respond to the crisis, to provide income supports to people who lost their jobs and to ensure the survival of enterprises beyond Covid.  Next year it is appropriate that these support measures be withdrawn in a phased manner.  Therefore, &euro;7 billion is being made available to continue our fight against the pandemic.  In reflecting on this year's experience, where the &euro;5.5 billion that was set aside in contingency funds in budget 2021 was ultimately all required following the resurgence of the virus, the Government is holding &euro;4 billion in reserve to allow us to respond if there is an unexpected deterioration in the situation with the virus.  <\/p> <p>Turning to core expenditure, the summer economic statement sets out a strategy for incremental increases in public expenditure over the period to 2025 and by setting a growth rate for expenditure in line with growth in the economy, the Government is seeking to ensure that these increases are sustainable.  In aggregate, core expenditure is being increased by &euro;4.2 billion to &euro;80.1 billion in 2022.  This represents an increase of 5.5% on this year, with current expenditure growing by 4.6% and core capital expenditure up by 11.5%.  <\/p> <p>An allocation of over &euro;22 billion will support our health service to protect lives, including an amount held in contingency.  Up to &euro;1 billion of this will be used for Covid-related expenditure, including for testing and tracing, the vaccination programme and PPE.  Included in this amount is &euro;250 million to tackle hospital waiting lists.  The additional &euro;1 billion in core current funding for health underscores the Government's commitment to the delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare, the progressive reform of the health system to implement universal healthcare.  This funding will also enable the hiring of up to 8,000 additional health service staff next year.  <\/p> <p>In order to protect the most vulnerable in society, the Government will provide more than &euro;22.2 billion in core current expenditure for the Department of Social Protection next year.  Additional funding of &euro;558 million is being provided for a package of welfare measures, including a general &euro;5 rate increase for working age and pension age recipients, increases to rates for qualified children and those living alone and for measures to improve the quality of life for carers and people with disabilities.  The Government is very aware of the impact of increasing energy costs on households and the need to protect the most vulnerable.  In response to this, the weekly rate of fuel allowance will increase by &euro;5.<\/p> <p>Providing educational opportunities to all children is essential to supporting equality in our society.  In this context, there is an increase of &euro;440 million in core current expenditure to the Department of Education.  This education funding will allow for the recruitment of 1,165 additional SNAs, bringing the total number of SNAs to almost 19,200 and the recruitment of an additional 350 teachers to reduce the primary school staffing schedules by one point.  It will also allow for the recruitment of an additional 980 special education teachers and an increase in the number of schools and children benefiting from supports within the DEIS programme.<\/p> <p>An increase of &euro;149 million in core current expenditure for the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and funding under the National Resilience and Recovery Plan, NRRP, will allow for the provision of new apprenticeships, new Springboard places, student supports and a range of upskilling and reskilling opportunities among other measures.  This will include training to support jobseekers and to address climate and low-carbon economy issues, including 8,900 places on skills to compete programmes, 35,000 learners on green skills modules and additional retrofit and Nearly Zero Energy Building, nZEB, expansion places.  <\/p> <p>Additional funding is being provided for childcare, targeted at delivering sustainability for providers, parents and children.  This will support improvements in the quality of services by enabling providers to attract and retain staff, including degree-qualified staff.  Reforms to the national childcare scheme will extend the universal subsidy to children under 15 from September 2022, benefiting up to 40,000 children and will remove the practice of deducting hours spent in preschool or school from the entitlement to subsidised hours under the scheme. <\/p> <p>Increased core current funding of over &euro;140 million for the justice Vote group will provide for recruitment of an additional 800 trainee garda&iacute; and 400 civilian staff in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The increased allocation will also support Courts Service modernisation, enhanced prisoner services and additional staffing for the Data Protection Commission, DPC. <\/p> <p>Addressing key infrastructure requirements in areas including housing and climate action is a key priority of Government.  The revised National Development Plan, NDP, provides an historic package of-&euro;165 billion over the period 2021 to 2030 to transform our country.  The plan will support economic, social and environmental development across all parts of the country and will play an essential role in shaping our responses to the challenges of the present while preparing us for the challenges of the future.  In support of the ambition in the NDP, capital spending for 2022 will rise to over &euro;11 billion.  This represents a very substantial commitment and supports the process of increasing voted capital expenditure to 5% of GNI* by 2025.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Ossian Smyth:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OssianSmyth&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The increased funding will support housing delivery, as set out in the recently published Housing for All strategy, with an overall capital allocation to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage of &euro;3.4 billion in 2022.  <\/p><p>Record funding to the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications will help support Ireland in meeting its climate targets through the new climate action plan and will also support the continued roll-out of the national broadband plan.

There is no magic money tree.  We live in a globalised economy and our membership of the European Union provides massive opportunity with a massive Internal Market and a very strong currency but, crucially, we also have a shared responsibility to ensure the credibility of our economic policies.  The endless spending promises by the main Opposition party come with severe consequences for the Irish people.  They would crash the credibility of the Irish economic model, which for the past 50 years has steered our people out of poverty and into one of the most advanced diverse, dynamic and successful economies in the world.

Analysis published alongside the budget shows that the poorest 30% of families will see the biggest gain from yesterday&rsquo;s budget, namely, a 1.3% increase in the disposable income on average.<\/p> <p>Education has been historically one of Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s most important political priorities.  Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments have always invested in education because we believed that to educate all our people was to liberate all our people.  The budget provides an allocation &euro;9.2 billion to the Department of Education in 2022, including a capital budget of &euro;792 million.  This allocation will support the Department&rsquo;s school building programme, which involves in excess of 200 projects.  On completion this will deliver more than 30,000 school places, with many of them being in Wicklow.  This Government's commitment to children with special educational needs will allow for the hiring of 980 additional teachers and 1,165 additional special needs assistants, supporting those with special educational needs in special classes in special schools and mainstream settings.  With more than 19,000 special needs assistants, this will bring investment in special education to the highest level in the history of the State.<\/p> <p>Crime, in particular the rampant supply of illegal drugs and the resultant antisocial behaviour and criminal activities that this terrible scourge brings, must be met with additional resources for our front-line garda&iacute;.  The recruitment of more than 800 new garda&iacute; is supplemented with an additional 400 civilian staff, which will free up our highly trained police to do the job that is needed to protect the people.  As we merge back to normal life after the pandemic, it is vital we do not allow criminals and those who terrorise their neighbourhoods to thrive.  This Government will provide our garda&iacute; with the tools to do their job.<\/p> <p>It is in the area of housing and the provision of the largest intervention by an Irish Government in the increase of housing supply that I can finally see some delivery to tackle the most serious social crisis all our people face.  This is the single largest investment in housing in the history of the State.  A multi-annual budget has been agreed of &euro;4 billion per year for the next five years.  That will deliver 4,000 affordable houses a year, 2,000 cost-rental units a year and 9,500 new-build social housing. What does that mean?  More than 50% of all the houses built between now and 2025 will be controlled by the State, not by the market.  This State will hand the keys to people who qualify for these houses, be they affordable, social or cost rental.  This is the largest intervention ever by the State in the housing market.  Legislation has been brought through these Houses by the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien.  When I sat on the housing committee with Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin, we a shared a view on the Land Development Agency.  The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, has delivered on that.  One hundred percent of public land will be for public housing in the cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  That is what we must do and are doing.  Everybody agrees that the problem in the rental market is supply.  We were criticised yesterday for providing an incentive to attract landlords into the market to provide additional homes for people to rent.  We know landlords are leaving the rental market.  Following discussion on the removal of the 4% cap on annual rent increases for the past four years, the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, removed that cap and replaced it with a link to the consumer price index, CPI.  He will be returning to the House to amend that legislation.  Legislation on short-term lettings will be introduced, which will have a major impact.  We saw that in the way that helped to deal with the homeless crisis at the start of Covid-19.  The new legislation will be more easily dealt with.  It will bring additional properties into the rental market and allow us to further deal with the homeless crisis.  On top of that, the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, will provide additional funding of &euro;50 million to return vacant properties in all of our towns and villages.  That is another area we failed to deliver on in the past four years.<\/p> <p>The budget will provide for a &euro;1.6 billion investment in water services and water infrastructure.  We cannot build houses with the current infrastructure but the Government has committed &euro;1.6 billion to investment in water infrastructure.  This is a serious investment by Irish taxpayers ensuring the greatest home building programme in our history.  I am pleased Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s commitment to the common good of Housing for All will see results.<\/p> <p>The fiscal space was mentioned yesterday.  We have had an opportunity to operate outside of the fiscal space and a review of that will happen.  The Government has placed strong emphasis on the social impact of housing and, with respect to Europe, it has made the case that the delivery of social housing should be excluded form the fiscal space as we move forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#R00200","speaker":"1640"},{"type":"speech","time":1634117400,"counter":93,"content":"<p>I warmly welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, and acknowledge that he is one of the Deputies who represents the constituency in which I live.  I do not doubt his enormous commitment and that of the Government.  I recognise the difficulties faced by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and support them.  In these early days in government it is their prerogative to set out the national development plan.  It is also their prerogative to set out a plan for housing, agriculture, healthcare and all of the other areas but where they are failing they must be called out.  As I have said two or three times here in recent days, there is an issue with healthcare.  We have not heard the full amount allocated today but I understand the Minister for Health will later set out the finances and resources that he needs and has secured to address the enormous waiting lists.  There are more than 900,000 people on waiting lists and I read out a list of them today.  I intend tomorrow and every day that I am in the Seanad to pick ten hospitals and read the waiting lists into the record of this House until we see a reduction because healthcare is important.<\/p> <p>I recognise and pay tribute to the Ministers, Deputies McGrath and Donohoe for doing an exceptionally hard job.  It is too easy to come in here and criticise people but I will not do so as it is early days in government.  Both Ministers have set out the budget and financial parameters and now they must deliver on them, which I respect.<\/p> <p>Earlier during the Order of Business there was a suggestion by a particular Government Senator, whom I shall not name, that the Independent Senators were not represented last night when we discussed finances.  That is not correct.  Senator David Norris, who is an Independent Senator and a member of my group, arrived here and made a very successful contribution.  Another one of my Senators has asked to let it be known that she took sick and is currently in hospital.  Nobody knows people's personal circumstances.  It is unfair, inappropriate and wrong to single out Members who are not in the House when a debate is going on but I hope the matter will be addressed tomorrow by the Senator who raised the issue.  As a member of the Seanad and leader of the Seanad Independent group in the House, I want the record to show that we were represented or endeavoured to be here.  If a Member or a Government Senator has an issue with attendance in this House then call it out for what it is, have a debate and, if necessary, have a daily roll-call to show attendance.  I am happy to support such a proposal but I will not be challenged or contradicted about membership.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#S00100","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1634117400,"counter":94,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1634117400,"counter":95,"content":"<p>As Members will be aware, the practice in the House is that people's absence is not referred to by anybody in the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#S00300","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1634117400,"counter":96,"content":"<p>I am glad that the Cathaoirleach has clarified the matter.<\/p> <p>The Government faces huge challenges in healthcare and housing in Ireland.

In fairness, arrangements have been mentioned in the budget.  <\/p> <p>We must demystify financial figures and I commend the Government on producing an excellent publication called The Budget in Brief - A Citizen's Guide to Budget 2022.  I call for more of such publications.  We must engage with citizens about what the budget means to them and the publication sets out the key measures.  I am not going to comment on the measures as we all know them but it is important to deliver on them.  The publication should be circulated widely, at least online.  A lot of money has been spent on advertising in the national press about a Government of Ireland initiative.  The budget is such an initiative and should be explained using simple infographics as used in this publication.  I ask the Minister of State to convey my suggestion to the Departments.  The social welfare changes in the budget have been listed point by point, which I commend.  I and other Members have received ten copies of this important document. <\/p> <p>Finally, I genuinely wish the Government well with its national development plan, the plans for agriculture and plans regarding the Housing for All policy.  I accept that these are early days in the life of this Government, that we must address the financial situation, that we have just come out of Covid, that we have had to deal with Brexit and will continue to face the many challenges brought about by Brexit.

Additional details will be given in briefings conducted in sectoral Departments.  There is a lot of information that has not yet been released but it will be over the next number of days.<\/p> <p>It is important to acknowledge that  we have experienced two of the largest challenges ever to face this country - Covid and Brexit.  When we dealt with Brexit issues in 2018 and 2019 we were not fully aware of what the consequences might be so provisions had to be made for a worst-case scenario, which had an impact on budget 2020.  Then the pandemic beset us in early 2020.  It is important to acknowledge that the ability of the State to respond to the challenges was due to the stewardship given to public finances over the past decade.  Difficult decisions were made that resulted in the books being balanced in 2020 and a reserve of funding being built up.  The good name of the country was also restored so we could borrow on the international market to fund all that was required under Brexit.<\/p> <p>The parameters of the budget were outlined in the summer economic statement.  I welcome the substantial increases in each Department and, in particular, I acknowledge the work that has been done by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Health Humphreys.  If Covid has taught us anything it is that the people who never dreamed that they would have to rely on direct financial support from the State found themselves needing that.  It is important to recognise that social protection is a safety net for anyone in this country who needs support.  The State exists for a number of reasons but the main one is to help people who need support and I welcome the general increases in weekly social welfare rates such as pensions and the living alone allowance.  The fuel allowance has also been increased.  From July, the duration of parents' benefits will increase from two weeks to seven weeks.  The income threshold for the working family payment has been increased.  The school meals programmes has now been extended to all DEIS schools.  Yes, there are still anomalies; there are certain schools that should be DEIS schools but are not due to parameters but I do not know why they are not and it is hard to explain.  There are schools in my area I consider should be on the top of the DEIS schools list but are not so there are serious anomalies.  <\/p> <p>I welcome the changes that have been made to the carer's scheme.  One just never knows in what circumstances one might have to step up and provide care to a family member or loved one.  Carers do tremendous work and are often very stressed.  As I have said before, every family is different.  Some families may have a lot of siblings who can help while other people are left to provide care on their own or with just one other person.  I welcome the increase in income and capital disregards for carers as well as the increase in the earnings limit from &euro;350 to &euro;375.  I also welcome the increase in the general weekly means disregard for the disability allowance and the provisions for certain treatment benefits.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The tax changes I discussed yesterday are important in giving a break for the general public.<\/p><p>I spoke this morning on the health matters and issues relating to the waiting lists.  I urged that we need to put the same focus into tackling the waiting lists that we did with Covid and that we must treat this situation as the priority that it is.  It requires the same energy and enthusiasm.  Our consultants and theatre nurses have so much expertise and there is so much equipment in our operating theatres.  We need to maximise their use in order to clear the backlogs.  That is important.  I welcome the &euro;4 billion in exceptional funding provided in the budget for health.  I also welcome the funding for the initiative to tackle waiting lists.<\/p><p>The education budget is certainly welcome with the additional teachers and special needs assistants.  There are changes to further and higher education.  The changes to the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grant are particularly welcome, including the increase in the maintenance grant and the reduction in the distance required for the non-adjacent grant from 45 km to 30 km.  This will be an important change for families.  The problem with thresholds is that very often people are just above the threshold and it is difficult because they are trying to rummage around to see if they can get under it.  It is a particular difficulty for families.  Any support that helps to increase the possibility of getting that grant is extremely important for families.<\/p><p>On the Department of Justice allocation, provision is made for some 300 additional garda&iacute; - after we account for those who are retiring - and an additional 400 civilian staff members to allow for more garda&iacute; on the beat.  People in every part of the country like to be able to see garda&iacute; on patrol, particularly in urban areas where visibility is important.  I certainly hope there can be increased visibility in our capital city, in provincial cities and our large towns.  It is of course important to have Garda patrol cars on the rounds in rural areas also.  I welcome that.<\/p><p>I welcome the changes in respect of public transport which the Minister of State's party has been involved with in the reduction of the cost for public transport.<\/p><p>There is one matter about which I am disappointed.  I had called for the establishment of a community centre fund.  While it has been done for upgrades of community centres, there is no fund of scale for new community centres or new centres in towns or in areas of growing population.  It is a particular gripe in my area in Moycullen where the population is growing, land is zoned, and there is an expectation that the number of houses will increase, but there is nowhere the community can go to get up to &euro;4 million or &euro;5 million for an infrastructure of that size.  I raised this issue previously.  Perhaps the community centre fund is a start, but it is for upgrades.  This is something of which we need to be conscious.  If we want people to support new development, there has to be something for communities and for their children.  Community centres and other amenities are hugely important.<\/p><p>I also support the changes in respect of the childcare sector and the increased funding.  This is a hugely important area for providing the additional support.  There are challenges for providers regarding costs and in the context of staff retention and pay.  I am aware that work is going on in that regard between the Minister for Children,  Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman and the Minister of State at the Department of Social Protection, Deputy English.  I compliment and commend the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, on the work he and his colleagues have done in this budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#S00500","speaker":"1665","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634117400,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  There are many different tests that can be applied when assessing and measuring the impact, be it positive or adverse, of budgets.  For the commentariat, an initial preliminary test is whether there is a banana skin in the budget.  Perhaps this dates back to the budget introduced by the then Minister for Finance, John Bruton, in 1982 - which members may recall - whereby an 18% VAT increase was imposed in respect of footwear and clothing.  An inadvertent and unintended consequence of that was the collapse of the Government of the day.  It is still not clear from history whether it was collapsed by the now deceased Jim Kemmy or Se&aacute;n Dublin Bay Rockall Loftus.  Ever since, there has almost been a preoccupation with banana skins.  There are many expert groups that will parse the budget forensically in order to give their views, and they have given their views. Many of the people of Ireland, however, would consider the test to be, first of all, if the budget has some credibility.  Is the budget prudent?  Then there is the vexed question of whether it is fair.  The latter is so difficult to measure because a balancing act must be struck, with countervailing rights between how far one can go - and the Government loves to do as much as possible - and still retain and maintain credibility, stability, and financial prudence.<\/p> <p>I have detected in this budget a clear step change, which is the buzzword of the week.  In the EU Parliament 30 years ago, the buzzword would have been \"subsidiarity\".  The term \"step change\" has definitely come up quite a lot this week.  There is a continuance of the step change for significant investment in key public services.  This should be music to the ears of some members of the Opposition.  As has been stated previously, there has been investment in housing, healthcare and childcare.  In reality, according to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, &euro;9 out of every &euro;10 being made available in this budget is going towards improving public services.  The context provided by the Ministers, Deputies Donohoe and McGrath, was also important.  It is very difficult to escape the context, which is that last year Ireland had an &euro;18 billion deficit - it is expected to be bigger this year - but the T&aacute;naiste was correct when he said that the economy was taking off like a rocket, because it the deficit is down to &euro;13 billion.  I remember the late Brian Lenihan, as the Minister for Finance of the day, coming in for sharp criticism when he said that the building industry was about to come to a shuddering halt.  He was right, however.  The T&aacute;naiste is also right when he says that the economy is taking off like a rocket.  The deficit has decreased from &euro;18 billion to &euro;13 billion.  The biggest and most glaring figure of all is that which indicates that the national debt will stand at &euro;240 billion by the end of the year.  There could never be giveaway budget if we are going to be kind, thoughtful and forward-looking to the next generation, whereby we do not want to labour them with the debt of this generation.  Of course we would love to do more but that has not been possible.<\/p> <p>The biggest investment, which has been well flagged, is the &euro;4 billion for public housing.  This level of investment is unprecedented in the history of the State, with more than &euro;3 billion to be spent over the course of the next year.  That includes funding for 9,000 social houses.  Notwithstanding the obstacles that have held us back, namely, Covid and last year's shutdown, according to the Government these houses will be built next year, along with 4,000 cost-rental and affordable homes.<\/p> <p>The Green Party is particularly happy with the youth travel card and the 50% discount.  Members are here, as parliamentarians, on this day and at this time when this departure for the better happened.  I hope we will revisit the matter next year and that these provisions will be incremental.  Just as there was a willingness in bringing the doctors with us for the free GP surgery services for under fives and the medical card, this budget makes provision for children aged six and seven.  If the Green Party has anything to do with it and if the finances allow, next year we will be opening that out further.  We would love to have covered a greater age cohort in the context of the reduced travel costs, but, in a sense, it is revolutionary, especially when one considers the amount that students spend on public transport as a result of the impact of the housing crisis.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Vincent P.

The free contraception for women aged 17 to 25 is to be welcomed.  I have heard people say the Government could have done so much more and they are right.  It could have but, again, it is a change.  The Green Party does not claim sole credit for any of these measures but it is a step in the right direction that we can build on that for future years.<\/p><p>The Green Party is particularly pleased about the &euro;350 million, or &euro;1 million per day, for active travel such as walking and cycling.  I would like to see a translation of that, see it measured and see the actual roll-out of those projects.  The retrofitting of homes is particularly pleasing for the Green Party.  Some &euro;202 million will be spent on retrofitting, which is 22,000 houses to be done in 2022.  That is part of the just transition.  It cannot just be meaningless words.  We have to translate words into actions and while that is not a complete action, it is a step in the right direction because under the programme for Government 500,000 homes have to be retrofitted by 2030.  The &euro;50 million for the shared island unit will please many people but again we can do more.  We have to get more links between North and South, including a railway line connecting the north west, Donegal and the Ulster canals.  Much more can be done there.<\/p><p>The electric car grant is included in the budget but it has been flagged that it will not be there forever.  The &euro;5,000 grant has just been extended to 2023.  That is good but even if everyone had an electric car in the morning we still have congestion and that will not help quality of life.  It is a step in the right direction but there is an affordability issue with buying new cars for many and that will have to be addressed in the coming years if we are to realise our goal of changing the fleet from fossil fuel to electric power.  The 165 new electric buses is to be welcomed, as are the 24 hybrid buses, 81 new regional buses and 41 more carriages.  The MetroLink, BusConnects and DART+ are all set to proceed next year with planning.<\/p><p>I commend the Government on compiling a budget.  There are many other issues I could mention but I do not have time.  It is not perfectly fair but it is a step in the right direction which keeps at its heart prudence, financial stability and making sure we get Ireland up and running and restore its reputation as a place that is financially prudent.  It is very hard to do that and be as fair as you would love to be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#T00200","speaker":"1667","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634117400,"counter":101,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is very welcome.  It is nice to see him.  I will start with housing.  It is a shame that our good Senator Casey is not here because I was struck by something he said in his speech.  Speaking about housing he said that he could finally see some delivery.  Those were his words.  That is some statement to make.  This is the sixth Fianna F&aacute;il-Fine Gael budget and it raises the question, what have they been doing for the last five years?  He can finally see some delivery.  I do not agree by the way, about the delivery, but I will get to that point.<\/p> <p>There is nothing in this budget for renters.  I heard the response from the Government side on the Order of Business this morning.  The Government said it is going to improve supply and that that is the only way to deal with this.  That is not factually true.  What the Government could have done is heeded Sinn F&eacute;in's suggestions and put a freeze on rents.  Not only that, it could then have reduced rents via a tax credit that would save people one month's rent each per year.  That would actually make a huge contribution to the challenge that working families face as regards the cost of living.  That was an option the Government had but it is one that has consistently been rejected by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael and now, I am afraid to say, by the Green Party in government as well.<\/p> <p>As I explained yesterday, I met people in my village of Castleconnell on Monday.  They came out to speak to us because they are suffering horrendous rents of &euro;1,300 or &euro;1,400 a month in a small village and they cannot afford it.  The truth of the matter is there is nothing in this budget to help them.  They cannot afford to save to buy their own house because all their money is going on outrageous rents.  I remind my colleagues in Fine Gael in particular that over the last ten years rents have increased by two thirds.  That was not on the Minister of State's watch as he has only been in government for the last 18 months but it is a hell of a record and that is why I am often stunned when people in Fine Gael stand up here to give lectures on housing.  They have failed on housing, not for one year or two but for a full decade.  Housing crises do not arise as some kind of natural phenomenon.  They arise as a result of consistent failures of Government policy and in Fine Gael's case its consistent failure to build public housing.  Even now, it is still attached to tax breaks for vulture funds.  Again I would like the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth's opinion on that as a Green Party Minister of State.  Why is he supporting tax breaks for vulture funds?  Rather than public authorities buying housing, they lease it.  According to this budget, 2,600 houses are going to be leased next year.  What an incredible waste of money.  Fine Gael, the party of fiscal responsibility, is insisting that councils, rather than building and buying their own housing, lease it so there is nothing left after paying money for 25 years.  Is that good economics?  I do not think so.  There is so much more I could say about housing but I will move on to the other issues.<\/p> <p>I am particularly appreciative of having a Green Party Minister of State here because I want to talk to him about the social welfare increase.  The Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, came into the social protection committee earlier this year.  He made a good contribution and acknowledged that we needed a significant increase in social welfare rates.  As I pointed out before, in 2009 the rate was &euro;197.  Here we are 13 years later and it has gone up now by just over &euro;10.  That is a huge indictment of Fine Gael and the fact that it is not that bothered about people who are poor.  Social Justice Ireland's commentary on the budget is absolutely condemnatory.  It states, \"Budget 2022 is the second budget produced by this Government and demonstrates a disappointing and worrying trajectory ... Those on the lowest incomes ... are being let fall further behind.\"<\/p> <p>The Government had options.  It could have raised money in other ways.  I want to ask the Minister of State about the special assignee tax relief programme in particular.  That is the tax relief for millionaires, which I have raised here before.  Top executives can write off two thirds of their tax up to the value of &euro;1 million for each of their own earnings.  It has been in place since Michael Noonan introduced it in 2013.  It is a scandalous waste of taxpayers' money, directly subsidising some of the richest people in this State.  Some 55 millionaires helped themselves to &euro;110,000 each of taxpayers' money through this scam.  That is what this is.  When the Government decided not to heed the Minister of State, Deputy O'Brien's, call for a significant rise in welfare, why did it not address that issue and say maybe we should not be subsidising the very richest people in this State and could use that money to increase welfare rates?  That tax relief was worth &euro;42 million.  We do not know what it is worth now because the Department is very reluctant to give figures since 2018 but I would imagine it is upwards of &euro;60 million at this point in time.  Equally, the Government could have chosen to put an end to gold-plated pensions and the tax reliefs there.  The figures calculated by the Department of Finance tell us that &euro;183 million could have been saved by doing that.  That would have been a way to raise funds and build in progressive measures because let us face it, those social welfare rates are appalling.  The Minister of State's own colleague acknowledged that.  We are talking about a fiver.<\/p> <p>Let me talk about tax.  As has been pointed out by no less than Patricia King of ICTU yesterday, the decision to implement a package of tax cuts that favours only two out of every ten taxpayers, who are the top end of the scale, is entirely regressive.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paul Gavan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->How can the Government stand over regressive tax measures?  Patricia King said it was a retrograde step the Government had allocated one third of the &euro;1.5 billion discretionary package to tax cuts, much of which will go towards increasing the standard rate band.  She said that it was a measure that will do nothing for the many low paid essential workers who we have relied upon over the last 18 months.  The Government's examples provided in yesterday's budget document confirmed that someone on &euro;30,000 will benefit by &euro;2 per week, whereas someone on &euro;60,000 will benefit by more than &euro;400 per year.  Indeed, Ministers will benefit from these measures.  Why is the Green Party supporting regressive taxation?  I gave my second preference vote to the Greens at the last election because I assumed the party shared certain common values with us.  This is a regressive budget and these are regressive measures.<\/p><p>I refer to the cost of living because it is a significant issue for working families.  The Government has only made things worse with the carbon taxes which are regressive.  They do not improve the situation of, or give other options to, people.  Most working families have no choice but to heat their homes using the systems currently installed.  They cannot afford the significant retrofits envisaged.  I know some money has been allocated for retrofitting but it is not half enough.  The Sinn F&eacute;in budget signalled a more significant package in that regard.<\/p><p>What will the Government do in regard to the northern distributor road in Limerick and the M20 motorway?  I was concerned with comments the Minister of State made last week on that.  We need the M20 motorway in order to complete the Atlantic corridor and we need the delivery of the northern distributor road, which was not even mentioned in the national development plan.  Will Limerick be left behind again by this Government?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#U00200","speaker":"1660","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634117400,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House today.  There is no doubt we were all looking forward to a post-Covid Ireland.  Many people who have spoken to me do not want to return to what they experienced before.  They want a new Ireland where their loved ones can get a hospital appointment within a reasonable time, where they do not have to pay the equivalent of a second mortgage for caring for their children, and where there is the prospect of houses built in their towns and villages that they can afford to rent or even buy as a family home.  This budget could have paved the way to this new Ireland, but in many ways, it has failed to deliver for those who need it most.<\/p> <p>In County Kildare, where I live, the cost of childcare equates to a second mortgage for many families.  Time and again, I receive representations from families who take their young children from their beds in the early morning to avail of the available places in their nearest local childcare facility.  This may have stopped to some extent due to Covid as parents had the chance to work from home.  However, if one travels on the M9 or M7, as I did this morning, one will realise that parents have returned to travelling by car once again.  The M9 and M7 have returned to being akin to car parks.  Of course we welcome the efforts to increase the wages of those working in the sector, which is long overdue, but the provisions in the budget announced yesterday will not mean any reduction of the cost equivalent to a second mortgage for many families in south Kildare, who will be put to the pin of their collar in order to afford childcare.<\/p> <p>On the issue of commuting, to which my Green Party colleague from Kildare referred earlier, there does not seem to be any attempt to increase the short-hop zones to cover the train stations of south Kildare.  My Green Party colleague lives in north Kildare where one can board a train in Sallins and avail of short-hop prices.  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of south Kildare, hence the motorways leading into the capital have once again become akin to car parks.  We see commuters driving from the likes of Newbridge to avail of short-hop zones, and who can blame them when they can save &euro;200 per month notwithstanding the increase cost of car fuel.<\/p> <p>In recent weeks, I highlighted the cost on students to travel to Dublin colleges by train and I welcome the Green Party initiative of the youth travel card.  I have seen copies of train tickets that have cost more than &euro;20 per day for students because they cannot use their Leap card in stations such as Monasterevin, Newbridge, Athy, Portarlington and Kildare town.  The Leap card system is already set up and could be rolled out without delay.  I note the Minister of State said that a combination of both will be used.  We should see this new system put into action straightaway with the use of the Leap system.  I am told all it requires is a Leap card machine at each station to accommodate that.  Students typically have Leap cards already.  I hope the Green Party initiative will include that, thereby saving badly needed money for students and their hard-pressed parents.  I received many queries this morning as to why this initiative is to begin at the age of 19 years.  I note the child fares extend to the age of 18 years but there is much concern from students who are in college, particularly those in their first year, who are 18 years of age and are asking whether they can avail of this new youth travel card.  Perhaps the Minister of State will come back to us on that important point.<\/p> <p>I wish to raise the issue of the Defence Forces.  Yesterday, in a lengthy speech, the Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, stated that he acknowledged \"the work of the Defence Forces in supporting the public health strategy over the last 18 months, through contact tracing, logistics and medical support, to name a few examples\".  He went on to say that he noted \"the work of the Commission on the Defence Forces is ongoing and that the commission is due to report by the end of this year.\"  He said that, \"[T]he Government will carefully consider any recommendations it makes\" and that he is very much looking \"forward to engaging positively in this process\".  These few lines from the Minister will mean nothing to the Defence Forces' families who continue to seek proper pay and conditions.  The indication that the Minister will address these issues after the publication of the Commission on the Defence Forces report at the end of the year is just another can-kicking exercise down another road.  I have been informed that we may not see that report until at least early next year, which is three months from now.  Defence Forces' families should not be forced to rely on social welfare payments, as many are at present, in order to make ends meet.  Core pay, as we all know, is a primary cause of the recruitment and retention crisis in the Defence Forces.  While we welcome the additional &euro;35 million allocation in the budget, the defence budget is not seeing the investment it needs to bring about the 9,500 serving personnel referred to in the White Paper.  There is no specific reference to the post-1994 contracts that could result in hundreds of experienced personnel leave the Defence Forces by the end of next year.  There is no specific reference in the Minister&rsquo;s speech about the investment programme, apart from the proposed development of a cadet school in the Curragh.  In a recent Seanad debate, the Minister informed me that he would invest in the Curragh, which he described as the flagship of the Defence Forces.  The budget failed completely to address the issue of core pay, which is at the heart of the crisis that is threatening the viability of the forces.  The Defence Forces' budget continues to be underfunded.<\/p> <p>Many Members here today have referred to the housing crisis.  There is no doubt that this issue continues to dominate every representation I receive almost daily.  There was a chance to assist renters and address the matter of vacant sites.  Unfortunately, the Government has missed the opportunity to do this.  It is unbelievable that the budget does not assist renters.  The reply we hear time and again is that renters want more houses built to increase supply.  For the many renters I deal with, they simply cannot wait for more houses to be built.  They are already put to the pin of their collar and need assistance now, not in a surplus-supply dominated market that may, with the greatest respect to my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues, be a few years away.<\/p> <p>I continue to highlight the issues surrounding the housing assistance payment, HAP, that I deal with daily.  There was no increase in HAP limits yesterday and no help for single people who have been unable to afford rising rents and are now borrowing to pay top-ups to keep a roof over their heads.  There was no standardisation of bands that would allow hard-pressed renters to rent available properties in neighbouring counties.  I have raised this issue here on countless occasions.  It is a problem that continues for many people in south Kildare.<\/p> <p>I raise the case of carers, which has been highlighted by colleagues across the House today.  It is welcome that the carers income disregard has increased to &euro;750 a week.  However, I received a number of phone calls from carer's families who provide 24-7 care for loved ones who still will not qualify for the allowance.  They are asking us why it is a means tested payment and why the care they provide 24-7 is not recognised by this Government?  This is an area the Government needs to look at again, notwithstanding that it is welcome more families will be included in that schedule of social welfare payment.<\/p> <p>The reality of this budget is to give a little in the hope that it will help a lot.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mark Wall:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarkWall&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Unfortunately for many of those who contacted me last night and this morning, the giving will not reach their pockets or it will be taken from them by the rising fuel costs and the day-to-day increase in living expenses.

I always find this time of year particularly difficult to comment on and I usually sit down, read the budget and try to make sense of it and understand it.  I then try to break down the figures and comment on this million euro or that percentage.  To be honest, every time I do that I give up and I have to go back to people's lives and to what is behind them.<\/p> <p>Since I started paying attention to the budget as a young mother, it has become a big event every year.  I used to wonder how it would impact on me and then when I went into the addiction sector I looked at how it would impact on the work I did and the people I worked for.  This year, there was zero increase in funding for drugs initiatives and drugs task forces.  Over the past two years, there has been a huge amount of commentary on mental health, dual diagnosis and the increase in drug use but there is no increase in funding for treating people who are the most vulnerable.  When I look at the budget I visualise in my head a line of people, some of whom will be positively affected or impacted by the budget.  The people I work and volunteer with in my community are not even at the back of that line because they do not know where it is.<\/p> <p>Working from home in the past two years, I have reintegrated in the community through voluntary work.  I spent a lot of time working in addiction and homeless services again to give some time when I could so as I did not have to be in this Chamber.  I was struck yesterday, while reading through the budget, by many of the experiences that have had an impact on me.  I saw how little it benefits addiction services and the community and youth sectors and how it will leave poverty untouched.<\/p> <p>Driving along the Tallaght bypass in the past few months, I had to pull my car over underneath a bridge because I saw a man tie a noose around his neck and drop.  What he did in that moment was so symbolic.  I watched the light go out his eyes as he stood there having made a decision to do that.  He ended up in Beaumont Hospital and they managed to save him.  He landed head first at my feet under the bridge over the bypass.  He made the decision to go onto that bridge.  There are thousands of others like him who sit at home every day contemplating who they are, what their lives are about or for and if they can build lives that are worth living.<\/p> <p>I also pulled up outside a Centra shop a few months ago and watched pre-teenage kids in my estate encourage a woman who sits outside the shop begging to go into treatment.  Imagine being 11 years old and having the vocabulary to do that.  It was lovely to see that the kids cared about her and wanted to encourage her into treatment but that is not what they should be thinking about at their age, nor is it the kind of conversation they should be having outside their local shop.<\/p> <p>This budget, like every other budget, does nothing to get to the heart of the problem or to what poverty does to people's lives.  Nothing in this budget gives me any hope that we are even close to getting there.  That is not because I think my colleagues in other parties do not care; I believe they care.  I do not speak in this House on some budgets because I do not want to be seen as being in here to engage in some sort of political point-scoring.  That does not benefit the people I am talking about who are dying in my community.  I want to come in here and know that something positive will happen.<\/p> <p>I do not know if other Senators have seen someone who wears poverty.  When I walk around my community and meet people, I see women my age on the one parent family payment who have been impacted by trauma and cannot access services or supports for their kids with additional needs.  Some of them look 30 years older than me.  That is because poverty and trauma have seeped into their bodies to the point that they are hunched and walk in a shuffle.  These women do not know how they will pay their rents.  Other one parent families in my community, both friends and people who just come to me for support, have to change where they live every year.  The moment their children make a few friends on the road, the landlord wants back in.  The housing assistance payment has to go.  It interrupts children's lives every year when these families have to move house again.  They have to pack up their things again and move on to the next landlord who might give them a house at a rent they can afford.<\/p> <p>I listen to the narrative or story in the budget in which we tell ourselves that it will reach the most vulnerable, protect a particular group or make transformative change in a particular area.  I have been hearing those phrases every year and everyone I worked with ten years ago is still in the same hole they were in then.  We cannot keep telling ourselves this story, attaching ourselves to that narrative and convincing ourselves that the political decisions we make have an impact because they do not.  When we sit down to decide where we spend money we have to match it with how we spend that money and the aggressive action we have to take to make sure it does what those with good intentions around the table say they want it to.  The problem is that people are so far at the back of the line that &euro;5 cannot and will not reach them.<\/p> <p>The Minister for Finance made a comment yesterday that has been in my head since I heard it.  He said: \"Our country now reaches for a better, brighter future.\"  I felt sad when I heard that phrase because that is the aspiration of people who can see a future.  Better and brighter applies if you are already in an okay position where your future could be brighter.  I am working with people who just want to feel they have a future, never mind a better and brighter one.  Just a future would do them but that is not happening.  I ask the Minister of State, and all colleagues, to watch the narrative and story we tell ourselves when we talk about how a budget will impact the lives of people whose lives we do not have a decent analysis and grasp of because they are at so much of a distance from the lives we live.  They are so far away we can never understand the impact the budget will have.<\/p> <p>For me, budgets need a strategy because without that, we will not get anywhere.  We need to have two-year and three-year budgets for addiction services, drugs initiatives and the youth sector so that communities can even begin to build their capacity to advocate for and care for themselves and feel like they are part of that service so that they may have a better and brighter future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#W00300","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1634117400,"counter":107,"content":"<p>As chair of a drugs task force and as part of that network, I know the Senator gave a commitment to speak strongly on that issue.

Similarly, the recruitment of additional special needs education teachers and assistants will surely be welcomed by all, as will the recruitment of a significant number of additional garda&iacute;, who are especially needed in inner city Galway, where I come from, and throughout the county.

In that context, the &euro;250 million being targeted at reducing those lists is very welcome.<br\/><br\/>The ambitious Housing for All plan has been backed by financial commitments in budget 2022, with &euro;2.5 billion aimed at increasing social housing next year, as outlined by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O'Brien, in recent months.  The record investment in childcare reflects a turning point in the State's approach to the early years education and childcare sector.  In west Galway, childcare is one of the most challenging aspects of life for families with young children.  While the commitment to ensuring that there is no fee increase for parents will come as a great relief to those families, we must do more on childcare. <br\/><br\/>Budget 2022 provides the first increase in the SUSI grant for more than a decade, as well as a broadening of the eligibility criteria for same.  The budget also provides half-price public transport for those aged between 19 and 23.  These are measures which will greatly assist students.  They are hugely progressive and will have a very positive impact.<br\/><br\/>I also welcome the increase in the carer's allowance as outlined by previous speakers and the broader eligibility for that allowance.  Carers provide enormous support for their loved ones and deserve the support of the State in turn.  I am delighted to see that move and also believe that carers should be included in any gratitude shown to front-line workers.<br\/><br\/>From a business standpoint, there is lots of very welcome news in this budget, particularly the aviation sector support scheme and the recovery package aimed at festivals and the night life economy.  Obviously, Galway is well known for the various brilliant festivals that are held there in normal years and in that context, I am especially pleased that the Government has recognised the need for assistance going forward.  The extension of the employment wage subsidy scheme is a welcome move which will greatly enhance the ability of businesses to rebound from Covid-19 and survive a crisis that was not of their own making.  Likewise, the waiver of commercial rates up to the end of 2021 is a significant boost for SMEs in particular.<br\/><br\/>Senator Casey has already referred to the VAT rate for the tourism and hospitality sector.  As Members will be aware, the rate was reduced to 9% in autumn 2020 and will remain at that level until September 2022.  I am sure there will be many discussions on that VAT rate in the meantime.  I am sure the Minister of State appreciates that both sectors have been hit incredibly hard by the pandemic and are facing a challenging period ahead.  Most European countries apply a VAT rate of 9% on tourism and hospitality.  There are strong concerns across both sectors that if our VAT rate increases to 13.5% in August it will be a significant blow to their recovery and will have a negative impact on their competitiveness <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>other European countries which apply a 9% rate.  The rate is projected to increase by 50% next year.  I ask the Minister of State to offer his view on this matter and to advise whether there is a possibility that the reduction in the VAT rate for hospitality and tourism will be extended.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#W00500","speaker":"1646","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634117400,"counter":110,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is very welcome.  I will start by acknowledging the contribution of my good friend and colleague, Senator Ruane.  The points she made are very pertinent and the Government must listen.  A knee-jerk response is not what is needed; we need a multi-annual and intensive programme to deal with the communities that Senator Ruane spoke about.  The issues she referred to will only be resolved with resources and money and a willingness to do it over a protracted period of time, starting immediately.  This also needs all-party agreement.<\/p> <p>Overall, the budget has done a small amount for a lot of people.  It is a post-pandemic budget and a certain amount of realism about what we can achieve is required.  During the pandemic we learned that our health services are not really fit for purpose and need significant investment.  In that context, I welcome the fact that we are looking at an investment of &euro;22.5 billion in our health services, including &euro;250 million in a targeted response to waiting lists.  I do not know how far that &euro;250 million will go because I presume it will be used to buy capacity in the private hospitals to get procedures done as quickly as possible in some form of catch-up programme.  We need a little more information on that.<\/p> <p>The health service will employ 144,000 people - up from 103,000 -  within the next couple of years.  This includes administrators, nurses, doctors, consultants and so on.  It is a huge investment in human resources and we really need to see a benefit from that for the people of this country.  If we want any legacy from the pandemic that is positive, it should be that we have a health service that we can stand over.  At this moment, we do not have a service we can stand over.  In spite of the fact that &euro;23 million was spent building a 60-bed modular unit as part of the accident and emergency department at Limerick University Hospital, there were still 83 people on trolleys there last week.  There is something wrong somewhere when a 60-bed unit is built to alleviate overcrowding in an accident and emergency department and still there are 83 people on trolleys.  We have been told that there will be a 90-bed unit and that is very welcome but when we build that unit, will we still have 83 people on trolleys?  There is a problem somewhere and I do not know the solution.  I am not the Minister for Health but it must be addressed.  We need to do more than just throw money at the problem.  That is just one issue.  I very much welcome the provision of free contraception for girls up to their mid-20s but would like more detail on the roll out of that service.  Overall, I want to be positive and an investment of &euro;22.5 billion in health is significant by any standards.  I look forward to teasing through the details with the Minister at the Joint Committee on Health and in this House in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>I also welcome the travel card initiative for young people, through which they will get discounts on public transport.  However, I want to see an equalisation of travel costs.  For example, a person working in Galway who travels by train from Ennis pays &euro;7.50 whereas a similar journey from Maynooth to Dublin costs &euro;4.90.  Why is there a difference in price when the distance is the same?  The journey from Ennis to Limerick is a little cheaper and works out at &euro;6.19.  While the travel card is very welcome, an equalisation of the cost of public transport funded by the State throughout the country is necessary.  Why should somebody living in Ennis, Ennistymon or Kilrush pay more to travel to work than somebody in Maynooth or Leixlip?  That said, the travel card is a good initiative.<\/p> <p>Overall, the budget was framed by people who want to do their best, who are committed to public service and doing their best.  On the whole, it is very welcome.  Did any of us think we would be in a situation where we are only borrowing &euro;20 billion as opposed to the projected &euro;30 billion?  That is significant and there are a lot of positives in it.  That said, a note of caution is important and I would like some more details on the travel card scheme and the roll out of contraception for young girls.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#X00200","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speech","time":1634117400,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House.  We know that no budget is a panacea.  Each budget has to be ambitious and try to change people's lives.  Our representative in the Department, the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, and his counterpart, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, have come up with a progressive budget that lays the foundations to ensure that people have better lives, especially when it comes to childcare, and in some other aspects.  It is not perfect but it goes some way to giving a little back.  We have to remember that we are still in extraordinary times.  Covid figures are still at nearly 2,000 daily.  There was significant caution when I was coming in that our vaccination rates, coupled with our reopening, leave us on a tightrope.  We are not out of the woods yet.  We have to remember that this budget has Covid as a backdrop.  We still have Covid.  We are not out of it.<\/p> <p>We have to remember the significant impact Covid has had on society, our communities, services, many people's jobs and on the Exchequer.  Covid masked significant faults in our public services.  Many operations were cancelled.  We saw a beautiful young boy who is waiting for a scoliosis operation.  His family were given an excuse of Covid for months and months.  It is not right or fair.  Hopefully he will get the operation he needs.  Many people's operations were cancelled and treatments were delayed.  People were cut off from seeing their loved ones at the end of life.  This will simmer up.  We will see the devastating consequences of Covid.  Budgets like this have to go some way in looking at alleviating the devastation left by Covid and trying to repair society.<\/p> <p>I am not the Minister for Finance and everyone can relay the statistics but it has been a progressive budget.  There is &euro;520 million in income tax reductions.  It is not a huge amount but it goes some way towards giving people extra disposable income.  As some of my colleagues have noted, the hospitality sector has been given a commitment that the VAT rate will remain at 9% until the end of August, which is welcome.  It would like to see the VAT rate remain in the longer term.  We have seen an increase in the second band of USC.  We saw a minimal increase in the minimum wage.  As a House, we need to do more to ensure that there is a living wage for people on low incomes.  We have seen allowances made for people working from home, who can offset 30% of their utility bill against their income tax.  There is a &euro;600 million fund for the Department of Social Protection.  There has been an increase of &euro;5 for the old age pension and jobseekers' payments and in the fuel allowance.  Many people who we come across do not qualify for the fuel allowance, so I have advocated for an increase in the threshold to qualify for the fuel allowance.  We did not see that in this budget but I hope it will be looked at again.<\/p> <p>My colleague, Senator Conway, outlined the substantial investment in women's health.  There is a &euro;31 million investment in women's health initiatives, with free contraception for 17 to 25-year-olds.  We have seen a significant increase in funding for the national maternity strategy, which includes funding for the recruitment of obstetricians, doctors and midwives.  We have seen endometriosis clinics open.  Many of my colleagues in the Seanad have done tremendous work in advocating for those with endometriosis, including Senators Chambers, McGreehan and Clifford-Lee.  I also have advocated for those with endometriosis.  We have seen perinatal genetics clinics open.  There is significant investment in the sexual assault treatment unit, SATU, in the Rotunda, which does amazing work to support those who have been sexually assaulted.  We also have seen menopause clinics opening and have started to address period poverty.<\/p> <p>I was hoping to see more investment in therapies for children with additional needs.  I was disappointed that we did not see that.  Like many of us have said today, we will see a health budget in December and hopefully we will see a large portion of money put towards additional services for those with additional needs.  The waiting lists for assessment for occupational therapy, speech and language and psychology are outrageous.  Even once people are assessed and approved for treatment, they may only get two or three treatments in a year.  It is shocking.  Hopefully the health budget will address some of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#Y00100","speaker":"1630"},{"type":"speech","time":1634117400,"counter":112,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council described this budget as a prudent path.  That is probably what we need to see today.  We acknowledge the many challenges that we face as a society.  This morning on the Order of Business, I commented that our budgetary process should be amended.  I said that in three contexts.  Almost everything that was in yesterday's budget has been well promulgated.  Budgetary oversight and our role as Members of the Oireachtas must be amended for future budgets in order that we can look at the issues that should be addressed in the budget, whether gender-proofing or climate change and so on.  The list is endless.  We as Members of the Oireachtas deserve and should have a better role in that.  As referred to by Senator Ruane, there is a need to look at how our budget can help to empower and enhance people's lives.  The fundamental point missed by some in this House is that what the Government does is for people, an gn&aacute;thduine, as I say, the citizen.  That is why the contributions of Senator Ruane and others are to be commended, because they are sincere.  Some members of the Opposition fail to account for their own budgetary provision of &euro;3.25 billion and I ask Sinn F&eacute;in, in particular, why it has not accounted for that in its budget.  Why was it underestimated?  The reality is, whether we like it or not, that Sinn F&eacute;in is about high taxes and high spending.  It is an anti-jobs and anti-worker party, despite all its rhetoric.<\/p> <p>In his contribution in the D&aacute;il this morning, the Taoiseach observed that one budget does not solve everything.  While this budget is the largest income support measure ever given, there needs to be a fundamental debate for us as a society about people.  We have become obsessed with everybody being funnelled through third level education.  I would like to have a debate in the House in future about the apprenticeship model, how we can value work and what work means in the future.<\/p> <p>I will comment on air connectivity.  I welcome the regional airports programme and that Cork Airport is included in it.  This budget recognises the importance of our aviation sector.  This is recalibration of our spending as a Government as we emerge from Covid-19.  I was going to say post Covid-19 but we will be living with Covid for a while.  We are moving towards a carbon-neutral world.  That requires the national development plan to be debated in the House and the Our Rural Future policy document, which is in the portfolio of the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, should be discussed too.  Any recalibration of our spending or a reconfiguration of the national development plan towards a more sustainable model of delivery of a low-carbon, climate-resilient society requires a debate, education, empowerment and information.  We are emerging from Covid-19 and, looking at our roads, the traffic is back.  What does it mean for the person living in Tirelton or Kilmichael who does not have direct access to a bus route to get to Cork city?  How do we create that sustainable, friendly model for everybody?<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The important point for me is that this budget is about people and about promoting an alternative.

Beidh m&eacute; cr&iacute;ochnaithe i gceann c&uacute;ig n&oacute;im&eacute;ad.<\/p> <p>I will not going to stand here and say that &euro;2 was given here, &euro;5 was given there and &euro;30 was given somewhere else.  However, in my view, considering that we are not yet out of Covid-19, this is an extraordinary budget.  This view does not just come from me.  I rang a number of people in my part of the country last night and this morning to get an independent analysis.  The general consensus was that this was a good budget.  We still have to deal with Covid-19, which makes the situation more difficult for the Government.  The level of spending in the budget and the way the money has been distributed are extraordinary given the times we live in.  It is only right that people who need assistance and help get support. <\/p> <p>I will deal with a couple of myths or arguments that have been put forward.  Everybody is entitled to make an argument.  If I were in opposition, I would probably make some of the comments Opposition Senators have made.  I respect everybody's comments, and I listen to them.  While I might necessarily agree with people, I listen to them.  There is a myth that nothing is being done about housing.  More than &euro;4 billion in capital funding for housing has been committed in Housing for All.  Of this, &euro;2.6 billion will come from the Exchequer and &euro;1.5 billion from the Land Development Agency, LDA, and Housing Finance Agency, HFA.  Current funding for housing stands at &euro;1.4 billion.  Regardless of where they stand in politics, all fair-minded people will agree that this is a joint step forward in trying to solve what is probably the biggest problem in society at moment.  <\/p> <p>I am sure everybody, from the top of the Government down to the councillor at local level and members of the public, wants to see housing solved.  Nobody in this Chamber, no matter which party he or she represents or in the D&aacute;il, for that matter, is going to fix housing overnight.  That is simply not going to happen.  More schemes are up and running and within months, we will see small improvements occurring to stabilise the situation of people in rental accommodation and allow people to get their own homes.  I firmly and honestly believe that will become a reality for quite a number of people in the coming years because the Government is committed to the area of housing.<\/p> <p>On health, the budget for health is more than &euro;22 billion, which is a lot of money.  Free GP care will be extended to six and seven year-olds.  The drug payment scheme threshold will be lowered to &euro;100.  An additional &euro;105 million will be allocated to disability services.  An additional &euro;37 million will be provided to fund the expansion of mental health services.  I received a note from Ms Fiona Coyle, the CEO of Mental Health Reform, in which she states that the Government commitment to &euro;37 million in budget 2022 recognises the need to address the ongoing mental health pandemic.  People in the mental health sector are speaking up and telling us this is what is needed and that it is good.<\/p> <p>As Senator Ardagh said, a package of &euro;31 million will be allocated to women&rsquo;s health.  Budget 2022 allocates &euro;8.6 million to the national maternity strategy and an additional &euro;8 million for the National Ambulance Service.  These measures will all help people.  Like everyone else, I recognise that there are issues with waiting lists.  It is in everybody's interest to tackle them.  <\/p> <p>My time is limited so in the short time left I will refer to agriculture.  It is a myth - misinformation - that the budget for agriculture was cut.  It was not cut.  A sum of &euro;250 million has been secured for the areas of natural constraints, ANC, scheme and &euro;40 million has been secured for the low carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, which will benefit 43,000 farmers.  An amount of &euro;40 million has been provided for the beef data genomics programme, BDGP, and a further &euro;40 million for the beef environmental efficiency programme, BEEP.  The sheep welfare scheme has been allocated &euro;19 million, an increase of &euro;2 million on last year.  An additional &euro;60 million has been provided for organic farming and &euro;80 million is available for the target agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS.  It is important to make those points in order that people clearly understand that the budget for agriculture was not cut.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#Z00300","speaker":"1674"},{"type":"speech","time":1634117400,"counter":116,"content":"<p>If Senators speak longer than their time, some Senators will not get to speak.

People have used the phrase \"missed opportunity\" a lot to describe this budget.  It seems like a clich&eacute;, but it is true.  This was an unusual budget and we had an unusual opportunity.  This was the budget in which the fiscal rules and constraints that have often blocked us from long-term thinking and investment were suspended.  As Senator Ardagh said, this was done in recognition that the pandemic exposed that our public services, national infrastructure and social fabric had been strained by years of austerity and the need for states to invest in order to become more resilient.  That is why the fiscal rules on limiting expenditure were suspended.  It is why we have recovery and resilience funding.  However, it is clear that this Government has chosen to act as if the fiscal rules are still in place.  We know that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, is a strong advocate of bringing them back as quickly as possible at EU level.<\/p> <p>We had a window of opportunity.  The effort seems to have been put into closing it, rather than seizing it.  One example of why that is bad economics and bad spending is the fact that we still have 2,600 houses being provided for by leasing and leasing schemes.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage stated it only uses these leasing schemes because it is forced to do so by the fiscal rules on the government balance sheet.  Those rules do not apply at the moment, yet in this budget &euro;1.37 billion is going towards 2,600 houses in leasing schemes.  This ties us to a bad deal for the State in the long run.  That is not prudent.  Applying licks of paint when we need to deal with dry rot or create structural transformation is also not prudent.<\/p> <p>On the recovery and resilience funding, which is linked to this, &euro;120 million on retrofitting is a pittance.  To be clear, we need massive changes on this.  We know energy costs will go up because they must go up.  They have been subsidised globally and the costs of oil and gas are being felt across the world in climate change.  However, retrofitting needs to be funded.  The Government had resilience money from Europe for public investment and it was not alone in that regard.  However, it chose to direct that money into the banks to encourage them to give loans for retrofitting, rather than delivering direct retrofitting.  The Government is using the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications as an example of its retrofitting of public buildings.<\/p> <p>The Government should not have produced this budget.  It should have piloted measures that we know work.  This was a budget to be used not for incremental schemes but for transformation.  Measures that cost us money for no reason are still in the budget, including the schemes for special assignee employees which offer massive tax breaks.  We randomly decided that we do not need Ulster Bank to pay the bank levy next year because it is leaving Ireland.  Are we rewarding Ulster Bank for leaving the State and closing branches?  Those expenditure choices are not being questioned, yet the Government has taken a nickel-and-dime approach to things we actually need.  <\/p> <p>I hate to correct Senator Eugene Murphy, but Mental Health Reform has made clear that we need &euro;85 million in investment.

It will do an awful lot across the three major areas we need to look at, namely, health, housing and climate action.  These are the three principal issues on which the Government has worked hard towards getting solutions.<\/p> <p>For the agricultural community, the real budget they are looking for is probably in regard to what the carbon budget is going to be in the next few months.  We should take into consideration that over 5,000 people were at a march in Cork last Friday night, with families and everyone from three-year-olds up to grandmothers.  The farming community are very concerned about where that carbon budget is going.  It is a real issue for the community.<\/p> <p>On the agricultural front, &euro;1 million was budgeted last year for the food ombudsman and &euro;4 million has been provided this year but we have no legislation and it is not even on the legislative programme for this D&aacute;il term.

Will the Minister of State clarify how that will work where significant services have not been put in place, for example, Irish Water services for water and sewerage?  Will the tax be applicable in that scenario or when a county development plan is drafted and there is a development boundary, not zoned land, but where it is still land for development?

It is a budget that has to be viewed in the round and we cannot look at any one individual measure and say that, in and of itself, it is significant.  However, when we look at all of the measures together, it does add up to a very significant package.  We are making modest tax and welfare changes to support those who are working, those who cannot work and those who have finished their working life.  We have an additional 800 garda&iacute; and 400 civilian staff to make our streets safer, additional support for remote working and support for carers, who provide a vital service.  There are more supports for businesses, especially the retention and extension of the employment wage subsidy scheme, as well as more supports for primary, secondary and further education, including the extension of maintenance grants and the clothing and footwear allowance.  There is more support for families in terms of childcare and it is an area in which other speakers have said we need to do more.  We are also supporting young people in terms of contraceptives and half-price travel, which is a very welcome move.  We have increased investment in health.  It is a very significant package of supports across the board.<\/p> <p>I have to give a wry smile when I hear representatives from Sinn F&eacute;in in particular talking about their fully costed alternative.  If we look at the housing section, they promise in their alternative budget to deliver 20,000 public homes at a cost of &euro;3 billion.  That is &euro;150,000 per house, despite their housing spokesperson having received a response to a parliamentary question from the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage stating that the average cost of providing a social home in Ireland is &euro;240,000.  A primary school child could tell us that if we multiply that, it is &euro;4.8 billion.  Where is the black hole of &euro;1.8 billion in the Sinn F&eacute;in alternative budget, which they claim is fully costed?  A primary school child could tell us it does not add up.  It does not even contain support in terms of help-to-buy for first-time buyers to get their foot on the ladder, which is critical and has rightly been extended by this Government.

I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Senator Ruane raised a very important issue and a very important aspect of the budget.  I share Senator Ruane's view and I support her on this point.  This needs resources and I hope it is an area that will be looked at in the future as it is very important.<\/p> <p>I want to raise two aspects.  I cannot let the opportunity go without raising the issue of the closure of bank branches by Bank of Ireland, three of which were in County Mayo, at Swinford, Charlestown and Ballyhaunis.  Ballyhaunis is a town of more than 2,000 population and it now has no bank.  In that town, there is the second largest chicken processor in the country, a large meat plant, several medium-size engineering companies, sand and gravel quarries and some of the biggest plant operators in the country, in addition to pubs, restaurants and other small businesses.  This is a town that has opened its doors to immigrants yet the town has no bank.  I ask the Minister of State to look at this.  We are now asking the post office service to take up the slack but it does not have the capacity to provide a service to those types of business.  It is an area that should be looked at.<\/p> <p>I also ask the Minister of State to look at the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, which is money borrowed by the Government at cheap rates to build the economy, build houses and fund small builders, developers and small businesses at low interest rates.  I am being told that the people availing of those loans are being fleeced by legal charges, not by the developers&rsquo; or the builders&rsquo; own legal people, but by legal people representing the banks.  In some cases, it is costing up to 10%.  Therefore, where a person is borrowing &euro;1 million, which is not a lot in regard to developing housing or a small business, 10% of it goes in legal charges to the legal people representing the banks.  It is criminal.  If we look at this situation, the builder or developer only has one person looking after the legal aspect but, at the banks&rsquo; end, there is a whole raft of legal people looking after it, mostly from the big four.  This is putting off people from borrowing and developing, particularly if 10% of the money they are trying to draw down is going on legal fees.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paddy Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1866\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1866&amp;amp;pid=PaddyBurke&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I thank the Acting Chairperson, Senator Seery Kearney, for the latitude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#AA00800","speaker":"1636","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634117400,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I thank all the Members who made contributions.  I found them interesting and informative and I will try and address some of them for a start.<\/p> <p>Starting with Senator Casey.  I agree it is important to have a credible economic policy.  One of the reasons for that is that if we do not have it we cannot borrow on international markets and we cannot get the money that we need at the price that we need to supply the services that we need when we are in a difficult situation, as we have been for the past two years.  It is also true that a lot of work was done during the preparation of the budget to see where the redistribution of the money would go, who would be better off as a result of the budget, to divide the population into ten sections or deciles, and to see for each tenth of the population, from the poorest to the richest, who would do best.  It is true, and the ESRI will verify this, that the bottom three deciles, the poorest 30% of society, are the ones who have seen the largest increase in their net income as a result of the changes to tax and social protection.<\/p> <p>The social protection budget has been increased by &euro;550 million.  It is, I believe, the largest social protection package in the history of the State.  It is three times the amount of the carbon tax increase.  It is not only on fuel allowance.  It is also on the living alone allowance, carer's allowance, disability allowance and right across the spectrum.  It will be felt by many people.<\/p> <p>Senator Boyhan praised the budget.  The Senator said a lot of work had gone into it and he acknowledged that there was progress in that regard.<\/p> <p>Similar to Senator Casey, Senator Kyne pointed out that the national reputation has been sustained and that this puts us in a situation where we are able to maintain our borrowing.<\/p> <p>In response to Senator Gavan on the point of the carbon tax, I did look at the Sinn F&eacute;in alternative budget and I was pleased to see that Sinn F&eacute;in is not proposing to abolish carbon tax.  I am also pleased that Sinn F&eacute;in supported the climate Act, made constructive contributions at Oireachtas committee level and ultimately supported the goal of reaching a 50% reduction in emissions.  For all the details of political insults, slagging, etc., at the core there is a consensus across all parties, including the major Opposition party, that climate change is real, that it is caused by humans and that we need to take massive actions all across society to deal with it.  I welcome that constructive opposition.<\/p> <p>Senator Martin pointed out that &euro;9 out of every &euro;10 being spent in this budget is going on improving public services.  I suppose it is another way of saying that only one tenth of this is going on income tax relief.  Income tax reductions would not have been my first choice for how to spend money in a budget.  It is only a tenth of it.  We did agree to it in the programme for Government and it is true that we have inflation at present.  Inflation means that if we do not do anything on income tax, working people will get poorer.  It was important to provide an enormous package of social welfare increases but there was also a very large package for income tax reductions.<\/p> <p>I hear some people saying that it was spread too thinly - that seems to be an emerging narrative - but it was targeted.  Young people did well out of this budget and women's health did well out of this budget.  Older people suffering from energy poverty also did well out of this budget.  There was targeting.<\/p> <p>A number of Senators welcomed the youth travel card and asked if it could be extended and if it applied to somebody who is 17.  I understand there are child fares as well.  In general, the whole fare structure of public transport needs to be simplified.  It is being reviewed.  It needs to be straightforward, simple and rational.  Absolutely, there is room for reform across the board.  It will attract more people on to public transport.<\/p> <p>As Senators have said, the number of people who are driving has come back to where it was previously and yet public transport has not.  People have a residual fear of being inside a bus or they have changed their habit over the period of time.  We need to take some actions to get people to change back and to come back.<\/p> <p>Senator Ruane made a heartfelt contribution and talked about the effect on drug treatment and in deprived areas or areas where people lost hope for years.  Senator Ruane is absolutely right.  A budget is about allocating money.  It is about slicing up a pie.  It is about cash but one also has to think of the effect from previous budgets.  That is what performance budgeting is about.  If somebody comes to you and asks if he or she can have an extra &euro;50 million for whatever, you have to ask what that person has been doing last year.  Performance budgeting is a part of the budgeting process.  One needs to go back and see what is the effect, are we missing certain areas and are there places that are not getting this.  I can say there is &euro;550 million extra for social protection or there is a &euro;22 billion budget for health but if it is not reaching the people who need it, that is a problem.<\/p> <p>One also needs equality budgeting.  One needs to make sure that everybody is being reached and not just certain groups that are favoured in society.  There is a whole process around equality budgeting.  There are reports that will be published in the spring, etc., on that.  It is an annual process.  It is to make sure that people are not left out.  I am happy to talk to Senator Ruane outside of the Chamber on any of those issues, to engage with her or to invite her to take part in the budgeting process if she thinks that things could be done better or that there are things that are wrong in it or that are being missed.  The Senator knows that is not by intention.  For example, the mental health budget has been increased a lot, this year and last year, but what is the root cause of long-term addiction problems?<\/p> <p>Senator Crowe asked about the VAT rate on hospitality.  It has been extended and can it extended further.  There will be a lot of lobbying from the Restaurant Association of Ireland and from the hotel sector, etc., on that issue.  That sector has been greatly damaged during the pandemic.  No decision has been made on that.<\/p> <p>Senator Conway asked what we can do for additional capacity on waiting lists.  Waiting lists, after the pandemic, are emerging as the primary concern in healthcare after Covid.  A lot of it is caused by Covid.  We already had a problem but it was made worse because many people could not attend their appointments for whatever reason and the HSE was distracted by the pandemic.  I welcome the significant increase in funding to tackle waiting lists.  We will see progress on that issue.<\/p> <p>There was a question about the fairness or equality of public transport fares across the country.  Why does it cost a different amount to travel between Ennis and Limerick than between Maynooth and Dublin when they are similar distances?  This comes back to rationalising the fare structure and making sure that it is fair, simple and straightforward.<\/p> <p>The details of the contraception roll-out were requested.  I can get those for Senator Conway.  I would say to any Member that if he or she contacts my office, I will help him or her.  If a Senator wants to meet me in person I will, of course, always meet anybody.<\/p> <p>Senator Ardagh is somebody who I met before the election last year when I was meeting with a group of parents with special needs children to advocate for their education.  The Senator can see in this budget that there is a huge allocation towards new special needs assistants, SNAs, towards special needs teachers and towards the capital for special classes.  What really came to the fore at the start of last year was that, particularly in certain areas of the country, we are under provided for when it comes to special needs education.  At the start of the year, after the Covid wave around Christmas time, special needs education came into focus again.  There is a huge body of work being done to tackle it.  I trust in the efforts of the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, in that regard.<\/p> <p>Can I keep going?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#BB00200","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1634117400,"counter":128,"content":"<p>You have half one minute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#BB00300","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1634117400,"counter":129,"content":"<p>Senator Cummins asked about the closure of banks.

I will have to come back to him on that one.  He also wished to know the definition of zoned land that is serviced.  That is actually something I also want to find out because it is absolutely key.  The existing vacant site levy has not worked.  It does not raise money.  People say it was at a 7% rate but it was 7% of nothing.  I am reading it collected &euro;21,000.  We need a proper, effective vacant land tax that applies at any rate and brings in money and has the effect of behavioural change.<\/p><p>The core expenditure funding set aside is &euro;80.2 billion.  That provides resources to deliver public services and infrastructure that can provide opportunities for children and a better quality of life.  In committing to this scale of expenditure there is an ongoing requirement to ensure value for money in the delivery of services and infrastructure projects and to ensure expenditure is having a positive impact on the lives of our people.  Achieving this aim will require a focus on disciplined, accountable budget execution and delivery and ongoing reform to our public expenditure budgetary process.  To maximise the impact of every euro invested as part of the new NDP, enhanced project and programme governance is being implemented and particular focus will continue to be placed on improving the delivery of investment.  This will mean increasing the efficiency with which investment is delivered, while achieving greater value for money within the budget that is available.  Increasing construction sector capacity, innovation and productivity will all be key to ensuring the successful delivery of the NDP.  Work is ongoing in these areas to communicate with industry partners to secure the skills needed, particularly in relation to apprenticeships, and through forums such as the construction sector group and its innovation and digital adoption team.  These will drive productivity improvements across the sector.<\/p><p>Challenges remain as we deal with recovery from the pandemic and manage the impact of Brexit.  Funding set aside for Covid-19 measures and available from the Brexit adjustment reserve provide the resources to address these challenges.  The steady growth in expenditure planned over the medium term provides funding to improve our public services infrastructure while ensuring we do so in a fiscally sustainable manner.  Just from talking to people I feel this is a good budget.  It is broad, it is prudent, it reaches a number of groups that really needed attention and it provides for people who are working and those on welfare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#BB00400","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1634117400,"counter":131,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 3.02 p.m. and resumed at 3.39 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":" Peat Harvesting: Statements","time":1634117400,"counter":132,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#FF00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1634117400,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for this opportunity to speak to the House today on peat harvesting.<\/p> <p>As someone from a large rural constituency, I absolutely understand the critical importance of the horticultural industry and its value to the wider economy.  I have and will continue to work side by side with the industry to facilitate peat extraction.  I have done this as a back bench Deputy and now as Minister of State.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Peter Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2457\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2457&amp;amp;pid=PeterBurke&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->However, I want to put firmly on the record that most of the required decisions are beyond my powers and remit as Minister of State.  I also want to be crystal clear; the Government has not placed a prohibition on peat harvesting.  At the outset, it is important that I clarify exactly what my role, and that of my Department, is in relation to peat harvesting.  As Minister of State with responsibility for local government and planning, I do not set policy for peat harvesting.  My specific role, as Minister of State, is to provide the right policy and legislative framework for Ireland's planning system to function properly and in the interests of the wider good.  This system includes the independent assessment of planning applications by planning authorities or An Bord Plean&aacute;la in respect of peat harvesting.  I am prohibited by statute from getting involved in any individual cases.  In my broader Department, my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for heritage, has responsibility for peatlands in special areas of conservation, SACs, Deputy Noonan.  He has published a report on the review of the use of peat moss in the horticulture industry and has established a working group on foot of its recommendations to examine issues identified in the review.  I will provide a brief update on this work, which is not yet complete, later.<\/p><p>In terms of the planning system, all development, unless specifically exempted under the Planning and Development Act 2000 or its associated regulations, requires planning permission.  Exempted developments, or developments that do not require planning permission, as regards peat extraction are set out in the Planning and Development Regulations 2001.  Peat extraction involving a new or extended area of 30 ha or more requires an environmental impact assessment, EIA, and therefore requires planning permission.  Peat extraction below that threshold may require an EIA if it is considered that it would be likely to have significant effects on the environment.  Any peat extraction that would be likely to have significant effects on a European site, that is, an SAC, a special protected area, SPA, or a candidate area designated under the habitats directive, requires an appropriate assessment and, therefore, planning permission.  However, Senators should be aware that permission can be sought by those in peat extraction and the system does continues to operate.  For example, in 2018 Galway County Council granted permission for two bogs to be used for domestic peat fuel supply, namely, Kilcolumb and Annaghmore East bogs.  It is important to note that I, as Minister of State with responsibility for the planning system, have no responsibility for policy on peat extraction.  The planning system, by its nature, is a policy-neutral process.  The EIA directive is a European Union law which requires that development consents for certain public-private projects likely to have significant environmental effects should be granted only after an assessment of those effects has been carried out by a competent authority.  The first iteration of the EIA directive was adopted in 1985.<\/p><p>The planning system includes the availability of the substitute consent process set out in Part X of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, under which regularisation of any unauthorised development requiring retrospective environmental impact assessment or appropriate assessment under the planning side of the dual consent regime may be sought in exceptional circumstances.  I want to be clear on one very important and critical point.  I have no issue with supporting the exemption of peat extraction from the planning process.  However, clear policy is needed to provide an alternative regime to be put forward to ensure that EU environmental standards are met.<\/p><p>Separate to this, I am pleased to inform the Seanad that my Department is working on bringing forward new streamlining amendments to the substitute consent regime in the planning Act by way of the general scheme of the planning and development (amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2021.  The purpose of the amendments is to streamline substitute consent procedures by providing for a single-stage substitute consent application process for the planning system; to allow for simultaneous planning applications for any future development to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for all types of development, alongside an application for substitute consent, which is currently only available to certain types of quarry development; and other related amendments.<\/p><p>It is important to note that the proposals to streamline the substitute consent process in the planning system will, unfortunately, not have an immediate impact on the peat horticulture question in the short to medium term or on the work of the working group on horticultural peat use established by the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan.  This will not be a silver bullet for those involved in the industry.  Even if it is streamlined and peat extraction substitute consents are obtained following proposed amendments to the planning system, there would still be the further obligation to obtain an integrated pollution control, IPC, licence from the EPA for large scale peat extraction of 50 ha or more, that being the other half of the dual regime of planning and EPA licensing.  All the time that it would take for a peat producer to apply for an IPC licence and for the EPA to assess the application would also need to be taken into account as part of the process to seek permissions and licensing for peat extraction.<\/p><p>As Senators may be aware, as part of the broader work of my Department in relation to peat harvesting my colleague the Minister of State with responsibility for heritage and electoral reform, Malcolm Noonan published a special report on a review of the use of peat moss in the horticulture industry on 7 September 2020.  The report concluded that there are significant positives and negatives arising from ending the use of peat moss in the horticulture industry.  There are complexities in terms of the environmental benefits of ending horticultural peat extraction set against the economic consequences for the industry, food security, the lack of an effective alternative to peat and the economic and cultural impact on the local communities that would be affected.  On foot of a recommendation of the review, the Minister of State has established a working group of key stakeholders to examine key issues identified during the review.  The working group was established by the Minister of State under the chairmanship of Dr. Munoo Prasad and is composed of industry groups, environmental organisations and relevant Departments, including representatives of the heritage division from my Department, as well as from the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Environment, Climate and Communications.  A draft interim report has been prepared and sent to the Minister of State.  The final report of the group was due to be presented to the Minister by the end of September 2021.  The chair has in recent days requested a brief extension to 20 October, to allow the final report to be finalised.  The Minister has agreed to this request.<\/p><p>I note the importance of the horticulture industry to our rural and regional economies.  It was worth &euro;477 million farm gate value in 2019.  This is the fourth highest sector in terms of gross agricultural commodity output value.  It has a higher output value than sheep or cereals and is an important part of our agriculture industry.  I also note the carbon footprint being incurred to date due to the current situation whereby we are importing peat to keep our industries afloat.  I understand that importation routes can mean up to 200 truckloads travelling 100 km carrying peat from Latvian bogs to Riga, then being shipped to Drogheda and finally driven to the midlands, where it can then be dropped off mere metres away from a bog that could have provided the same quantity without the associated carbon footprint.  These facts must be considered by the Government and must form part of the debate on this issue.  On this basis, I look forward to the publication of the work of the independent working group on horticultural peat and the recommendations that will seek to address the current crisis in the horticulture industry.  I remind Senators of my earlier comments outlining that, in principle, I have no issue with exempting peat extraction from the planning process.  I am playing my part to facilitate vulnerable sectors of our economy but it is also up to other Ministers to play their part and offer an alternative regime to planning.  I look forward to assisting in whatever way I can to resolve this significant problem, including considering any proposals for new legislation from the working group, together with colleagues from other relevant Departments.  That legislation would need to be in compliance with both Irish and EU legislation.<\/p><p>I thank Senators for their time and for allowing me to make this presentation on a very important matter.  I took a long time to discuss it with the representatives of the horticulture sector in front of the D&aacute;il this afternoon and to hear their valid concerns.  I am working closely with them, as I have done from the very first day I was elected to the Thirty-second D&aacute;il.  I have had a series of meetings with them and I will continue to support them in whatever way the powers of my office allow me to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#FF00200","speaker":"1595","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634117400,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#GG00200","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1634117400,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his very extensive contribution.

It supports 6,600 direct jobs and 11,000 indirect ones.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator John Cummins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnCummins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->According to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine it is worth &euro;477 million to the economy, that is, &euro;410 million for horticulture and food and &euro;67 million for amenity horticulture.  This critical sector is on its knees due to the unintended consequences of the restrictions on peat harvesting.  It is all well and good to say that there is a need to look at alternatives, but there simply is no viable alternative at present for the majority of operators in the commercial horticulture sector.  Teagasc's submission to the review on the use of peat in the horticultural industry highlights the specialised nature of the growing media required for different crops and the level of risk and research required before alternatives can be used.  <\/p><p>As a result of the restrictions on peat harvesting, we are seeing what can be only described as \"an Irish solution to an Irish problem\".  We are hiving off to another country, that is, Latvia, responsibility for the essential peat supplies to keep our horticulture sector ticking.  One has to question the environmental impact of importing peat into this country.  It is, after all, the same planet we are collectively trying to protect.  I would go as far as to describe this as \"eco-vandalism\".  We are all the time striving to be self-sustaining.  It seems the particular policy and principle of self-sustainment applies only in certain circumstances, not in regard to peat harvesting.  There is simply no justification in my book for preventing the harvesting of one tenth of 1% of Ireland's total area of peatlands, which is a fraction of the peatlands previously harvested, all in the name of climate action, while at the same time gas guzzling trucks are transporting harvested peat to ports in the Baltic's, where it is then loaded on to tankers fuelled by fossil fuels, transported cross the North Sea into the Irish Sea, and then collected by more trucks to be transported next-door to a bog that could have provided the same product.  Where is the logic in terms of the economics and environmental impact in doing this?<\/p><p>I am aware the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, has been active in this space and that he has put his shoulder to the wheel in addressing this matter.  It is a matter of particular concern to him in regard to his own constituency.  I know he wants to see common sense prevail on this matter.  The Minister of State's statement that he has no issue exempting peat extraction from the planning process is a strong signal.  I hope his counterparts across other Departments will be as forthcoming in addressing this matter.  <\/p><p>There is a planning element to this, but as rightly stated by the Minister of State, there is a policy and licensing element for which the EPA is responsible.  If we were to bring forth emergency planning legislation in the morning to allow for peat extraction, it is likely, first, that it would be challenged in the courts and, second, that licensing would be a further hurdle to be overcome.  We need to have a further debate on this matter with the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Ryan.  This is a matter which all of us in this House, cross-party, are committed to rectifying.  The horticulture sector across Ireland is important to the lives and livelihood's of so many people.  It is critical to our rural and regional economies.  I commend the Minister of State on his robust introductory contribution to the debate this afternoon.  If everybody puts their shoulders to the wheel in the same manner, which I know the Minister of State is committed to doing, we can find a solution to this important matter.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#GG00500","speaker":"1647","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634117400,"counter":140,"content":"<p>This will not do.

On its front page, the <i>Westmeath Examiner<\/i>had one of the most bizarre stories any of us will have read for some time.  It summed up the very strange contradictions that exist in our energy and climate change policies.  To be clear, the report was about 4,000 tonnes of horticultural peat which had been imported to Ireland, having been transported 3,000 miles from Latvia, on 200 trucks.  That peat is now being stored in Rathowen, next to where an extraction had been abandoned in 2019.

Does it not want to make you scream?  This is a bizarre, crazy and irrational situation.  We need to hear the Minister of State say that.  The old phrases about selling ice to Eskimos, sand to Arabs or bringing coal to Newcastle spring to mind.  Importing peat to store it next to a bog would be laughable were it not so serious an issue.  One might say it is &quot;No Latvian matter&quot;.  As we know, harvesting in Rathowen and elsewhere all but ceased as a result of the High Court judgment which has led to onerous licensing and planning applications for bogs which were larger than 30 ha.  Peat is, of course, important to the horticultural sector, particularly in mushroom farming.  Apparently, we will need one shipment like this every two weeks for the foreseeable future to cope with demand.<\/p><p>We hear a lot in this House about the carbon footprint.  How can you even begin to quantify the carbon footprint of shipping that much peat from abroad?  Apparently, peat extraction contributed just 0.15% of our total CO<sub>2 <\/sub>missions in years past.  The carbon cost of importation surely exceeds that by a considerable margin.  This is a good illustration of some of the farcical and, frankly, self-defeating outcomes that can flow from climate change and planning policies if not well organised.  I have said here time and again that we all support balanced changes to Irish life, habits, industry and agriculture as long as those changes are sensible and they do not attack traditional ways of life or punish people for living their lives in ordinary and responsible ways.  Sadly, our policies are increasingly tending towards punishing ordinary people, damaging agriculture, crippling small businesses in certain sectors and destroying jobs, while doing little or nothing to reduce our carbon footprint overall.  We end peat extraction in Ireland and start shipping in peat from the other side of Europe.  What gives?  We shut down two power generation stations, pat ourselves on the back for being good environmentalists and then import energy from abroad which was generated by burning fossil fuels or by nuclear power.  We also need a debate on nuclear power.  Ecological virtue-signalling often seems to be the aim here.  That might be another example of the so-called &quot;Irish solution to an Irish problem&quot;. <\/p><p>An opinion poll in last week's <i>The Irish Times<\/i>showed a deep level of opposition to the Government&rsquo;s climate change policy among the general public.  It found that 82% oppose new carbon taxes, 60% oppose reducing the national herd and 72% oppose higher prices for petrol and diesel.  You will never get any argument from me if you say that the majority can sometimes be wrong; they frequently are in this House.  The solitary measure that has widespread public support is the increased use of land for harnessing wind energy.  My point is that if these are the numbers nationwide, can you imagine what they are when Dublin voters are excluded?  Can you imagine what the figures would be specifically among voters in the midlands and west, the places most affected by these measures?  All this suggests that successive Governments have failed to bring the public with them in relation to the measures necessary to tackle the impact of climate change.  Yet, according to some of our leaders, we are only getting warmed up about it.<\/p><p>What do we think the farcical stories, such as that which I cited was on the front of the <i>Westmeath Examiner<\/i>last week, are doing for public support for climate policy?  Surely, they can only generate additional hostility and resentment.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It can be argued that the Government is adding to this by the day.  In yesterday's budget, the carbon tax was hiked up by 22% or &euro;7.50 per tonne, to &euro;41 per tonne.  To ordinary people, that means &euro;1.28 on a fill of petrol, &euro;1.48 on a fill of diesel and &euro;20 on a tank of home heating and all of this will bring in &euro;412 million in taxes per annum. <i><\/i>My point is that what the Government is giving on one hand, through modest increases in social welfare and reductions in the income tax bands, it is taking away on the other through these taxes.  We hear many lectures about progressive taxation and yet it is indisputable that carbon taxes are regressive measures because they are levelled on everyone equally and therefore, hit the poorest in society the most.  This can only cause a reduction of support from the public for climate change policy in the years to come.<br\/><br\/>I will conclude with the issue of peat harvesting.  Domestic supplies of peat inevitably will be exhausted and the horticultural sector will have to rely, increasingly, on imports, which is a farcical situation.  To prevent this, we should allow some kind of simplified licensing system whereby peat harvesting can be resumed, if only for a number of years, until a proper phased solution can be found.  By doing so, we would likely be reducing, rather than increasing, our carbon output.  The Irish Farmers Association, IFA, and the horticultural sector have called for legislation in this area.  On the basis of the facts, as I am aware of them, I would support any legislation which deals with this problem in a sensible way.  I brought four bags of turf to a friend in Dublin last night.  I wondered, as I was delivering them, how much longer I would be able to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#HH00400","speaker":"1673","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634117400,"counter":144,"content":"<p>With the permission of the House and the Chair, I will share time with Senator Gallagher.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#JJ00200","speaker":"1656"},{"type":"speech","time":1634117400,"counter":145,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

It employs more than 17,000 people.  There is no ban on peat extraction but, clearly, a dysfunctional system is in place and it is threatening the horticultural industry.  At a time when we are all keen to do all we can not just to promote but to progress climate action, it is a low point for us to be talking about the State undermining one of the more sustainable parts of our agricultural sector.  The Minister of State and other speakers have alluded to the farcical situation of us importing peat from eastern Europe, which travels thousands of miles in hundreds of trucks using fossil fuels, to a bog.

This is a case in which there is a requirement for an emergency intervention, that is, some form of emergency short-term licensing that will allow the horticultural sector to survive and our producers to continue to produce for us at home and for wider consumption.  We need someone to take this by the scruff of the neck and add a bit of common sense into what is not working and is a dysfunctional system and to ensure there is a just transition that serves the horticultural sector and all of our economic and environmental objectives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#JJ00400","speaker":"1656"},{"type":"speech","time":1634117400,"counter":147,"content":"<p>I was going to interrupt Senator Fitzpatrick had she not stopped, because I would be in trouble in County Monaghan if I did not allow Senator Gallagher in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#JJ00600","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1634117400,"counter":148,"content":"<p>If the Leas-Chathaoirleach keeps talking and does not allow me in, he will be in more trouble afterwards.   I am only messing, as I know the Leas-Chathaoirleach will give me my ten minutes.  I have no doubt about that.<\/p> <p>On a more serious note, I was heartened by one of the Minister of State's sentences, when he said he had no issue with peat extraction being taken from the planning process, which I welcome.  I could feel the frustration in his voice during his presentation on this issue.  If the Minister of State feels frustrated, he can imagine how the people standing outside the gates of Leinster house feel this afternoon and how frustrated they must be.  Not just frustrated, but fearful of what the future holds.  We have this farcical situation outlined by a number of Senators, of peat being imported from Baltic states and transported here by sea and then transported on our roads to the midlands to rest beside bogs that have already closed.  Senator Mullen said we were dancing around the issue without calling it what it is.  I have no issue calling it what it is - complete and utter madness.  It needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.<\/p> <p>I come from a county in which the agricultural sector is vitally important.  The Minister of State and I had a conversation, not so long ago, about the importance of the agrifood industry to Monaghan, with particular emphasis on the mushroom industry.  We are very proud in County Monaghan that Monaghan Mushrooms is the largest exporter of mushrooms in Europe and the second largest in the world.  The mushroom industry is worth approximately &euro;119 million.  Approximately 85% of what it produces is exported.  The mushroom industry and all involved in it in County Monaghan of whom I am aware are in a state of panic about this issue because they are fearful.  I am fearful of the consequences for Monaghan's local economy, if anything were to happen to the mushroom industry.  This is how serious this is.<\/p> <p>The people concerned are not closing their eyes or ears to alternatives.  All we are looking for is a common-sense approach, whereby a window of time would be given in order that alternatives to peat can be sourced.  At present, they simply do not exist and the best brains in the country are doing their best to come up with an alternative but as we speak, it does not exist.  All we are looking for is common sense.  I acknowledge the Minister of State's presence this afternoon but perhaps it would have been a good idea, were all three relevant Ministers who have a say in this subject to be sitting alongside him this afternoon.  This parcel seems to be passed from Billy to Jack and nobody is taking control of it.  It has got to the stage at which someone has to take responsibility for it.  If that person is not taking responsibility, he or she needs to be called out as to who and where the blockages exist.  It is a critical issue that needs to be addressed.  It is vitally important to the mushroom industry in County Monaghan and I sincerely hope that common sense prevails and we find a solution to this problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021101300002#JJ00900","speaker":"1658"},{"type":"speech","time":1634117400,"counter":149,"content":"<p>It is a tricky issue.
