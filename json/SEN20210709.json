Only one Opposition amendment has been supported.  I hope today will be a new approach from the Government and the Minister in charge.  I also hope that presenting amendments from the Opposition in a unified way will help with that.  I thank colleagues and their staff for their co-operation and also my colleague, Senator Boylan, who cannot be here now, but who may be in later.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 1 is simple.  It relates to the Title to the Bill.  The basis behind it is that we need to limit the power of corporations to scupper serious climate action.  Fossil fuel companies have an ace in the hole in the form of investor-state dispute mechanisms such as those in the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA.  The amendment seeks to limit that threat.  The Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party Government tried to rush through a motion before Christmas to ratify the investor court system chapters of CETA.  This would have massive ramifications for every aspect of life in Ireland, not least that relating to climate action.  It is only right, therefore, that we are debating these ramifications in the context of the climate Bill.<\/p><p>These investor court mechanisms play an outsized role in any state's ability to tackle climate change.  They allow companies to sue states for actions taken to address climate change.  Such cases result in massive compensation claims in the billions being made by companies against states for taking bold climate action.  I mentioned some of these examples and Senator Higgins spoke on this matter at length on Committee Stage.  I outlined actions taken by fossil fuel companies in Italy, France and the Netherlands on foot of bold climate action taken by those countries.  Russia was ordered to pay &euro;50 billion to a fossil fuel company.  Not only does that remove resources that a state could use for progressive climate action, it also has a massive and chilling effect on other states who see what happens to the countries that take bold action.  We will not stand a chance of fighting climate change if we do not curb the grotesque excess of corporate power.  We saw already this week how ideologically wedded Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party are to ensuring profits for cuckoo fund investors over housing for average citizens.  Applying the same corporate-first ideology to climate action amounts to a death wish.  We need serious climate action and that means taking on corporate power, not paying out billions in compensation to fossil fuel investors for taking climate action and blocking investor courts in CETA.<\/p><p>Amendment Nos. 13 and 14 seek to address the hypocrisy at the heart of section 4, which precludes individuals from seeking compensation in the State for failure to comply with the legislation and take sufficient action in respect of climate change.  The same limitations that are not imposed on investors, however.  Under the investor-state dispute settlement mechanisms of the trade and corporate rights agreements, investors can seek compensation from states for damages and compensation on foot of progressive ambitious climate action by banning drilling for fossil fuels.  Not only can investors sue for compensation for investment loss, they can also sue for profits that they would have made.  This sort of extravagant compensation claim would be laughed out of our courts but this is exactly what happens under investor-state dispute mechanisms.  If the State decided to cease the extraction of gas in Irish waters, the company involved might, somewhat justifiably, bring it to court for the value of the investments in infrastructure it had made.  Under trade agreements such as CETA, the company could sue for the value of the oil that hey were not able to extract and the profits that they would have made on it.  I urge the Minister to accept either amendment No. 13 or 14.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070900002#B02000","speaker":"1686","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625819400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>These amendments will be key to the success of this legislation.  There was a narrative early in year that it was investor court systems versus the climate Bill, and that there is a trade-off.

Those of us who are passionate about climate action want to make sure that we do not create a giant hostage to fortune that will have an impact beyond the area of climate action.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It will affect lots of policy areas that many people care about, from public health through to housing.  <\/p><p>In the context of the Bill, I will speak specifically to the liabilities to investors.  It relates to section 4 of the Bill, which provides for the limitation to liability that I discussed with the Minister on Committee Stage.  It is a most concerning provision.

We see how quickly entire towns can be lost.  It is a concerning issue.  Of course, people will still have access to the courts, but it is concerning that access to compensation and damages in the courts will be limited for the citizens of Ireland and their communities.  That is happening in parallel with a push to open Ireland up to compensation claims in a brand new form of arbitration.  I know it is not led by the Minister, but it is led by the Government.  I hope that it will be reconsidered over the summer.  It must be reconsidered.  It is an issue that a number of committees will consider.  There is a push to open Ireland up to compensation claims in a brand new form of arbitration.  As Senator Warfield said, while a claim by a fossil fuel company to slow down our action on renewable energy may not succeed in a national court because that court will balance the claim against all of the other imperatives and laws that we make, an investor arbitration court will only consider the question of fair and equitable treatment, legitimate expectations, the disappointment of those expectations of profit, and all of those factors.  That is what the investor arbitration court is considering when it is deciding a case.<\/p><p>In the context of the Bill, I will speak specifically to the liabilities to investors.

There is a push to open Ireland up to compensation claims in a brand new from of arbitration.  As Senator Warfield said, while a claim by a fossil fuel company to slow down our action on renewable energy - while a claim indeed may not succeed in a national court - because that national court is balancing it against all of those other imperatives and laws that we make, an investor arbitration court is only looking to the question of fair and equitable treatment, legitimate expectations and the disappointment of those expectations of profit and all of those factors.  That is what they are considering when they are granting a case.<\/p><p>CETA states that the mere fact of regulation does not entitle a company to compensation.  However, it is the mere fact plus the expectations the company had and the inducement.  It must be noted that even the giving of planning permission or the holding of a meeting with the Minister could be regarded as an inducement.  The term \"inducement\" is widely interpreted.  We hear many terrible horror stories from around the world of compensation cases costing billions.  Those are the exact same grounds on which companies have taken cases and won billions.  The fair and equitable treatment ground and all of those factors I mentioned are the exact same grounds that are contained in this new agreement and in the new proposed investor court system, ICS.  That is why it is a matter for concern.  My hope is that the Government will not ratify it.  If it does ratify it, it should at least put in some protective measures to try to strengthen its hand when it does go to negotiate or fight an investment claim for compensation.<\/p><p>When I spoke to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on this issue, I was disappointed to learn that he had not completed a risk analysis on the ICS under CETA.  He did not think it was necessary because he did not expect that Ireland would ever treat a company unfairly.  It must be borne in mind that what we see as unfair and what a company sees as unfair are very different.  It may well be that a company that is impacted by what we understand to be a necessary climate measure taken under this Bill, will look for compensation and it may well get it.  The very fact of it taking that case will cost us hundreds of millions of euro in legal costs.<\/p><p>What Senators Warfield, Boylan and others are asking the Minister to do is to try to future-proof this legislation against those dangers and include in it measures that will protect or at least give a basis for protection to the State in relation to those kinds of claims.  Cases taken under the ICS of CETA would be extremely wide, but we are already vulnerable, as the Minister is aware, to claims for compensation, specifically by fossil fuel companies, under the energy charter treaty.  The European Commission is talking about why we would leave the energy charter treaty if it were not for the 20-year exit clause.  It is the same 20-year exit clause, by the way, that is going to be attached to CETA.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Energy Charter Treaty allows companies to take cases and they are doing so.<\/p><p>As has been described, companies succeeded in having climate law and climate policy diluted in France in this way.  In Germany, companies are suing for millions and billions.  Right across Europe, companies are actively litigating for compensation and putting price tags on climate action which are slowing it down and delaying the change we need.  I have my own amendments on this topic, to which we will come later, with specific regard to petroleum, gas and oil licences.  The Minister will be aware that we will also be discussing liquefied natural gas, LNG.  It would be useful if the Minister could either confirm or deny that the energy charter treaty is being considered in the drafting of policy because it seems that we are greatly exposed.  If these amendments were to be accepted, it would represent some small degree of future-proofing against the CETA investor court system's impact on climate action.  It might also provide us with some protection in respect of claims under the energy charter treaty because we would be sending a clear signal that there should not be an expectation.  These clauses in respect of liability are very important.<\/p><p>I spoke about a disconnect in terms of limiting our liability to citizens while opening our liability to companies, by which I mean international corporations.  It is predominantly such corporations that use these tribunals.  It is important to note that small and medium enterprises in Ireland would not be able to use these courts if they were impacted by either climate action or the failure to take climate action.  As persons under this provision, they would also be excluded from gaining any compensation from the State.  They would also not be able to get compensation in these investor courts, which are only open to international investors.  That is just the legal and financial context of this Bill.  These amendments propose very sensible protective measures to strengthen our hand so that we can steer these climate goals through and steer the State towards the actions it needs to take without unnecessary dangers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070900002#C00200","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625819400,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators very much.

It is not going to resolve the range of different issues involved, including this issue of free trade agreements, the issue of the relative roles or powers involved in the investor court dispute resolution mechanisms and a range of other issues.  We will not resolve those issues in our debate here.  I understand that our courts will be examining the matter in the coming weeks.  To my mind, it is not relevant to the structures we are setting up and putting in place.  There are mechanisms within various trade agreements whereby environmental treaties, including the Paris Agreement, must be taken into account.  Rather than trying to resolve that whole issue within this Bill, which would not be possible or effective in any way, it is better to focus on what the Bill actually does.  It organises how we, as a State, are to manage meeting our climate objectives under the Paris Agreement.  It is increasingly recognised in international law, including in the area of trade agreements and investor-state agreements, that such agreements cannot be in breach of an international agreement signed by 198 countries.

I welcome the opportunity to debate the ban on importing fracked gas.  Sinn F&eacute;in tabled the same amendment in the D&aacute;il but it was ruled out of order.  We seem to be able to debate it in the Seanad.  It is regrettable that the Minister did not accept this amendment.  On Committee Stage in the Seanad, the debate was guillotined before we had a chance to debate the issue of fracked gas, so I welcome the chance to do so today.  We have missed an important opportunity to debate the issue.<\/p> <p>If the Minister were serious about banning fracked gas, he would legislate for it.  Instead, we have a policy statement that stops short of banning it.  It is not clear why the Minister will not do it.  We have been met with a wall of excuses that just do not stand up to scrutiny.  The liquefied natural gas, LNG, policy statement presented the usual approach.  The Attorney General says we cannot do it because of what is stated in EU treaties and so on.  We do not agree with this response.  We have it on good authority from the EU library and research service that nothing in the treaties prevents a member state from banning fracked gas.  On the contrary, there are explicit rights for member states to introduce a ban.  Article 194 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union makes clear that it is fully in the gift of a member state to bring in a ban.  It indicates that member states choose the conditions for exploiting their energy resources and which energy resources they allow.  This does not affect a member state's right to determine the conditions for exploiting its energy resources, its choice between different energy sources and the general structure of its energy supply without prejudice to Article 192(2)(c).  There are no legal barriers in EU law, so it begs the question, what is the real reason we cannot, and will not, legislate for a ban?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070900002#F00600","speaker":"1686"},{"type":"speech","time":1625819400,"counter":39,"content":"<p>These are very important amendments because energy policy will be at the heart of this issue.  We have talked a lot about agriculture, but perhaps this is now the moment to talk about energy.  Energy and a change in how we approach it will be central to the making of this transition.  There has been a reluctance to face the hard issues relating to energy.  For example, there has been a reluctance to bring in a moratorium on data centres, which it is estimated will be using one third of all our national energy by 2031.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is the demand push.  Again, the Government is not yet acting on that, although I hope it will.  The issue has been discussed at length at the climate committee and elsewhere.<\/p><p>We are not taking the necessary actions to reduce demand or to be clear about what kind of supply is or is not acceptable in this country.  Senator Warfield is correct about the Energy Charter Treaty.  It clearly allows the State to make its own policies and decisions on energy.  Nothing in the charter prevents Ireland from banning the importation of fracked gas but, as we have discussed, there are provisions whereby companies might seek financial compensation if they are impacted by a change in policy.  Will the Minister clearly state whether that is why there is not yet a ban on fracked gas?  If it is about waiting for the energy security review, why not introduce a ban now and remove it if the energy security review were somehow to indicate that we should?  I doubt it will, however, because I imagine that the bigger issue in the context of the energy security review is the fact that 33% of our energy is used by one type of business.<\/p><p>The Minister will be familiar with the precautionary principle, which applied in the previous amendments.  Surely we should take the opportunity in the Bill to send a clear signal and ensure there is a ban on the importation of fracked gas.  Thereby, if it turns out that our caution is somehow not needed, we can undo it.  If we are not doing that, we need to be clear.<\/p><p>On the actions the Minister mentioned in regard to the communication of policy, that has been sent under the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill.  It did not seem to be regarded by An Bord Plean&aacute;la when it made clear that planning permission had not yet been sought but that it could be sought again in respect of the Shannon LNG terminal and that there could be a case whereby it was brought through because of its strategic importance, given that it is still benefitting in its engagement with the planning process from the fact that it was once recognised as an area of potential strategic importance.<\/p><p>The Minister will be aware that there have been many calls for a section 30 measure, which is much firmer.  Section 30 limits the powers of the Minister to engage in an individual case.  That is clear, although it has been diluted with the powers of the Minister, which are meant to be checks and balances, being subsumed and granted to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage who, originally, was explicitly prohibited from intervening in policies on heritage matters.  Now, according to the changes made, on heritage matters the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage may, under section 30, engage specifically and explicitly with the planning process through an application, a request or an appeal.  I suspect that, moreover, that there are heritage matters in terms of the environment that are impacted by the LNG terminal.  I urge the Minister to look carefully to those provisions within the planning process in that period when an application has not yet been made for the LNG terminal but there have been signals of an intent to make that application.  If we were to introduce a ban at this point, it would be in place prior to any application, whether in Cork or any other part of the country.  It would send a signal related not to a specific matter but to the policy of the State, whereby we will not import fracked gas.<\/p><p>This is important.  All these energy questions are not tangents.  There is a reason the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, the National Oil Reserves Agency and everything else are listed at the back of this Bill.  It is because energy policy is the key.  We should send a good signal and strong message on energy policy by explicitly banning the importation of fracked gas, as proposed by my colleagues Senators Warfield and Boylan, who have done much work on this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070900002#F00700","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625819400,"counter":41,"content":"<p>Can I speak to my amendment No. 37?

I was concerned about the lack of clarity as to how the process of removals would be approached and what models and measures will be adopted.  I made that clear at the time.<\/p> <p>It is important for me to speak now because amendment No. 9 in my name, to which we will come later, relates to removals and to the importance of international best practice as to how we approach those.  In that regard, I welcome that the Minister referred to having regard to the rules of the European Union on the regulations or removals.  I would prefer if the phrase \"be consistent with\" applied.  I would also prefer if there was a direct reference to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, because the best international measurements and calculations of removals may well come from the scientific experts within the UN and the IPCC.  In that context, I would have liked the legislation to include a reference to the UN.  The European Union is fine, it is referred to and we engage through it.  However, it is also vital that we signal the importance we attach to this matter.  I am aware that the European Union will seek to comply with the UN measures but I would have liked if those were referred to directly.  I reiterate that I also like if it was a matter of being consistent with the rules of the European Union rather than having regard to them.<\/p> <p>Under the proposed subsection (5B) in amendment No. 23, the Government may make regulations to specify a new base year in respect of the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions for budget periods after 31 December 2030.  I would like to know what is meant by that because I am a little concerned.  It could be that we are moving back to the 1992 measures or those of the other years.  If we were consistent with the rest of Europe in terms of our base year, that would be good, especially as new European laws evolve.  We know that there will be very strict rules coming through from Europe.  For clarity and to facilitate better engagement with our European partners, it would be good if we could have a similar base year.  There are problems with that because at a certain point Ireland was a very low emitter but then became and stayed a very high emitter.  The crucial point is that if there is a change in the base year, that change should not be such that the actual tonnage of emission reductions required would be reduced.  We do not want to arrive at our 51% reduction by 2030 - I hope we can do that, and I believe we will, although we have created a number of obstacles to navigate, unfortunately, to get there - when the base year then changes and suddenly we start seeing that Ireland has 60% and 70% reductions and we are giving ourselves wonderful news about what we are doing but we are not actually referring to the same thing.<\/p> <p>The Minister will be very aware of the principle in the Paris Agreement of highest possible ambition and progression.  I would like assurances from him that we will not either pick a year that might be more appropriate for our EU colleagues but which that is not appropriate for us or pick any other year.  We could, of course, pick the year of our lowest emissions and have that as the baseline.  That is provided for here.  I want the Minister to make clear the provisions that are there to ensure that any change in the base year will not in any way contribute to a lessening of either progression or our level of ambition and that will only represent our moving to a higher level of ambition.  I am just concerned because what is proposed does not make provide that.<\/p> <p>The Minister will be aware that the Scottish legislation contains a ratchet clause.  Such a clause is very useful.  The ratchet clause in the CETA Bill is unfortunate because it stops us re-nationalising private services but the ratchet clause in the context of the Scottish legislation is really useful because it means that you are only increasing your level of ambition.  When we start talking about percentages and tonnage, it is in the context that we want to see a reduction in tonnage of emissions year on year.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In the end, that is where we need to go.

It has been explained to me in detail that it gives the power to the Minister to work with the legislation to establish that appropriate mechanisms are put in place to ensure we do removals.  A key element of the debate was that the ability of the farming and agricultural community to account for removals was not considered.  A week later, we have that enshrined in legislation, which is an important step forward.  We must build on that.<\/p> <p>Very few in the agricultural community are making big money.  They are working to bring their families through life, put their children through college and just to survive in society.  The agricultural community is getting older and it needs help and resources.  In many ways, the CAP reform involves the same budget but it will be distributed differently.  Some 25% of CAP money will go on environmental issues, but the other 75% will go on maintaining their standard of living, good or bad as may be.  Much work remains to be done and that will be the challenge.  I am willing to work with the Minister to ensure we get the message out.  The terminology has driven farmers mad in the last week.  It was stated that the farming community is the key to this.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Tim Lombard:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2466\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->If it is key and it is left outside the door, it will achieve nothing to meet the genuine challenge to ensure society reaches its targets for 2030.

The 2030 targets will be challenging for the agriculture community, industry and transportation.  We have solutions, expertise and people with the ability to help to get the message out.  I am willing to work with everyone to ensure we get that message out.  The amendments the Minister has proposed have been helpful.  I am willing to work with him in that regard.

I support the amendment.  I acknowledge the work of Senator Paul Daly, in particular.  He is a member of the agriculture committee, as is Senator Lombard.  Senator Murphy is on the panel.<\/p><p>The amendment goes some way towards addressing the issues but we have a hell of a lot of work to do.  To endorse what other Senators have said on engagement, the agriculture community, including farmers, did engage with the committee.  The difference is that it was not necessarily listened to.  I thank Deputy Leddin and the other members of the committee.  They did an awful lot of work.  It is only when we start teasing it out that this is evident.  I am sure all of our desks are covered in papers related to this legislation.  The committee members did very comprehensive work.  Clearly, not everything they wanted to achieve got done.  I acknowledge the civil servants, including the Minister's team in his Department.<\/p><p>This is political, not personal.  It can never be personal.  People bought into this whole thing about the environment and climate.  I referred to its importance the other day.  Ultimately, it is not about us in this House; it is about the public, the electorate in this country who gave us a very strong mandate to protect the environment and planet.  Ultimately, it delivered democratically the people who were to govern.  This is clearly reflected in their programme for Government.  One does not get everything in one's programme.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the amendment, which is important, but we have a long way to go in regard to agriculture.  We would be fooling ourselves to believe otherwise.  I am not in the business of greenwashing or environment-washing.  There are challenges and these will arise later in respect of just transition.  This is important.<\/p><p>I quoted from the Green Party website the other day.  A press release from 2018 on that website states the Green Party launched its , and this is followed by wonderful quotations from the Minister and the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, who at the time was the party&rsquo;s spokesperson on agriculture.  Also quoted is Ms Grace O&rsquo;Sullivan, MEP.  The website refers to transition, fairness and leaving no farmer or anybody else behind.  In this regard, I want to refer specifically to the amendment and agriculture.  I acknowledge former Senator Grace O&rsquo;Sullivan, who did considerable work in this area.  The website refers to bringing together &quot;workers, communities, employers, experts, and government agencies to formulate and facilitate the plans, policies, and investments&quot;.  It states there needs to be a &quot;fair and just transition to a low-carbon economy&quot;.  <\/p><p>We have a lot of work to do.  We have a lot of communication to engage in with the farming community.  Ultimately, that is where it is at.  The farmers are the custodians of our land and want to play their part.  Ultimately, however, they have to bring home the goods, put the food on the table and pay for their families and farms.  Therefore, a lot of work has to be done.  I am not saying the Minister or Green Party is against that but I am saying the challenge concerns how to bring rural communities and the people who produce our food along.  The Minister, on the website, states the future of the labour movement is green.  It is environmental.  It could be emerald or any other colour.  We can call it whatever we want but it has to be about justice and fairness and support the people who work our land, our greatest resource, and the families who derive their household incomes from farms and the land, that wonderful resource that we have in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070900002#P00200","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1625819400,"counter":63,"content":"<p>Is deas an rud an tAire a fheice&aacute;il i gcomhair an lae fhada seo, l&aacute; stairi&uacute;il freisin, le c&uacute;namh D&eacute;.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RoisinGarvey&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I thank Senator Lombard for his work on the amendment.  It is really important that we are very clear about the process.  There was a Citizens' Assembly and a climate committee that went on for ages.  I found it interesting that the people who were shouting the most about the poor farmers were the ones who turned up least at the negotiations and at the climate committees.  We have to be very careful how we spin this one out.  To me, the environmentalists and the farmers are all the same.  I say that as someone who lives on a farm.  We get the climate the most.  We are on the same side.  There is a kind of polarisation that has been happening.  Maybe the big farming lobby groups or certain journalists are responsible for that.  I meet the local IFA regularly and the Minister meets the senior IFA regularly.  It is not as if the farmers I know have been left out.<\/p><p>It is a struggle to see how we are going to deal with climate change, which is not of our creation.  We have been aware of it for many years.  That is why I feel that today is historic.  This climate Bill had to happen.  It is important that we stop with the polarisation and all work together for the greater good.  No one cares as much about the farmers as custodians of the land as the Green Party, which is why we recognise the need to look at this and do it properly.  There must be a just transition where we see money and employment in rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070900002#P00300","speaker":"1659","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625819400,"counter":65,"content":"<p>Senator Higgins asked a valid question on amendment No. 23, which proposes the insertion of a new subsection (5B):<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe Government may make regulations to specify the base year in relation to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions for budget periods after 31 December 2030. <\/blockquote> <p>This amendment has been introduced to recognise that the current Bill embodies the programme for Government commitment to halve emissions from 2018, which was the first year to which the commitment in question could refer, in the decade to 31 December 2030.  This amendment will facilitate any future Government that may seek to provide for a similar timeline target and will ensure it does not have to amend the legislation to do so.<\/p><p>This is incredibly complex in terms of the various base years.  The ultimate base year, from a UN climate perspective, is 1990.  All of our anthropogenic emissions are measured from that date.  The Paris Climate Accord is central, based from 2005.  Within the Paris Agreement, Ireland works through the EU so our nationally declared contribution is part of the whole European approach.  That is where the European regulations kick in.<\/p><p>This is a huge opportunity but we should not underestimate the challenge in terms of land use emissions.  There is real potential income for farming as we rewet certain land, as we do agriforestry and forestry and as we restore peatlands, but there are also real challenges.  Our net land use emissions in 2018 came to approximately 4 million tonnes, so the emissions are greater than the sinks from the whole land use sector.  We can radically change that, and get an income for farming as we do so, but there are also changing factors.  The land use change and forestry mechanisms, the reduction in forestation we have seen in recent years and the clear-felling of certain forests have meant that we have a whole range of moving parts.  This presents a real and significant challenge for us in meeting our targets.<\/p><p>We have to focus on 2050.  The key target is a net zero economy then.  The work we start now in land use and nature-based solutions will really start kicking in over subsequent decades.  It takes time for forestation to deliver carbon sinks.  The curve of emission reductions from bog rehabilitation shoots up in the second decade, but not necessarily in the first.  These amendments are being proposed to facilitate regulations to provide for that.  It does provide opportunities but no one should underestimate the challenges in land use as well in as other sectors.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Eamon Ryan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2028\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2028&amp;amp;pid=EamonRyanGP&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I appreciate the support, as I have heard it, from the Senators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070900002#Q00200","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625819400,"counter":67,"content":"<p>The concerns that were raised were valid ones.  Farmers were concerned that sequestration was not going to be taken into account.  As I said on Friday, anything that we can do to allay farmers' concerns is very important.  We are all on the same side.  As Senator Garvey stated, and I said last week, we recognise that farmers are the custodians of the land.  The work they do must be taken into account when we are coming up with that calculation.<\/p> <p>It is important to remember that the carbon budget means the total amount of greenhouse gases, which would take into account both the reductions and the increases.  However, we must be very clear that sequestration is only a small part of what has to be done.  Farmers need to be paid for their work, whether that is in sequestration or the reduction of emissions.  It is only right that we look at the science when we are deciding how it is measured.

As the Minister said last week, the Bill goes well beyond the obligations under the Aarhus Convention on public participation.  Therefore, people need not fear that they will be left out of this conversation.  They will not be left out when it comes to the actions the Government and Minister are taking.

We discussed the issue on Committee Stage.  With respect to my colleagues, who spoke of a situation that is not of our creation, it is of our creation.  Anthropogenic climate change is driven by human activity, predominately in developed and wealthier countries, including Ireland.  We have a huge responsibility in that regard.  When we talk about that situation, climate justice is about acknowledging the responsibility that we hold.  There is a common but differentiated responsibility.  Everybody has a responsibility to respond.  There are those who have done the most to drive it and have built their wealth on it.  Companies have built their wealth on the causes of climate change.  Countries have also built wealth by driving emissions, and through emissions, the costs of which have been felt in other parts of the world.<\/p> <p>That is the context of where we are now.  We are at a point of incredible international vulnerability.  We know that 140,000 people are already dying each year due to climate change.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Entire cities and towns are vanishing from the face of the earth.  Floods are making some uninhabitable while, in others, temperatures are being reached at which the human body can no longer survive.  We have seen the impacts of drought in Central America and in the African Sahel.  Drought is forcing millions of people to move as they seek to survive.  That is the situation now.  We bear a disproportionate responsibility because we have been, and still are, responsible for a disproportionate amount of the emissions.  In our debate on Second Stage, I mentioned that Ireland produces over 8 tonnes of carbon emissions per person as opposed to Malawi's 0.11 tonnes per person.  The people in Malawi are farmers as well, albeit very small farmers.  When I met them, I saw that they were doing everything they could to try to burn slightly less charcoal and to reduce their emissions.  They were working to do that.  That is the context of climate justice.<\/p><p>I am glad the Minister removed that language which was problematic and about which there was real concern.  This language, previously in the Bill, would have been an embarrassment to Ireland.  I am also glad that he has acknowledged that the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the idea of common but differentiated responsibilities inform part of his understanding of climate justice.  However, I believe we should cement that understanding in the Bill because, as has been pointed out, climate justice is not referenced directly in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, although the principle of climate justice is reflected in the narrative regarding common but differentiated responsibilities.  We want to ensure that, where provisions state the advisory council or Government must have regard to or be consistent with climate justice, it is really clear what is meant.  We want to copper-fasten the relationship between climate justice, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change commitments on equality and the requirement that decisions and actions taken to reduce climate greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to the effects support the people who are most affected by climate change but who have done the least to cause it and are the least equipped to adapt to its effects and safeguard the rights of the most vulnerable persons.<\/p><p>The Minister mentioned that it is complicated and difficult to come up with definitions.  It is not that complicated.  The entire Opposition has come up with this proposal collectively.  All groups in the Opposition were involved.  We all had multiple definitions, because we all care about climate justice, and we have now come up with one.  Even the Labour Party, which put forward its own proposal, has agreed to support this one.  All non-Government groups in the Seanad are putting forward this definition of climate justice.  We have taken out some of the things we would have liked to include, such as provisions in respect of equality and recognising indigenous communities who led on the concept of climate justice.  We have narrowed the definition to the absolute bones of what must be thought about, which are the issues of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, support for the people who are most affected by climate change and who have done the least to cause it and are least equipped to deal with its catastrophic consequences, and the safeguarding of human rights for vulnerable people.  That is what we think should be considered part of climate justice within this Bill.  <\/p><p>The Minister should accept this definition.  It will strengthen the Bill.  While the commitment to the overall reduction to 2050 is part of our goal in trying to do our piece in achieving net zero by 2050, including the definition will mean that, in all of those actions in between, when we are thinking about our plans, specific budgets and all of the various other instruments and periods of action that flow from the Bill, climate justice and those really important principles will be to the fore.  It is a really useful check in deciding on how to achieve these emissions reductions.  It would be good to accept the amendment.  There is nothing in it which was not in the Joint Committee on Climate Action's recommendations.  We have taken out a number of the elements of those recommendations but the core elements remain.  It would send a really good signal in respect of climate justice.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> As the Minister is aware, a number of NGOs have also indicated their support for this definition, including Tr&oacute;caire, Oxfam, Christian Aid and others.

He has known about the issue of climate justice and has campaigned on it since 2008 or 2009.  There is no excuse for not having a good definition in this Bill.  The Minister did not start thinking about this in January.  I have been thinking about climate justice, and talking and engaging with him, Stop Climate Chaos and others, about it.  We have been talking about climate justice for two decades.  There is no excuse, therefore, for not including in this Bill a definition of climate justice that is strong, good and shows leadership by Ireland.  It is good that there is not a bad definition.  I am glad it is not a backwards step, but let us try to take a step forward.<\/p><p>I urge the Minister to accept this amendment, which is put forward by every Opposition group in the Seanad.  It is consistent with the principles put forward by the joint Oireachtas committee and has been called for by many of the international NGOs currently trying to work with local communities across the world to alleviate the devastating impacts of climate change.  They know this is an issue of justice and how important a signal on climate justice can be.

In the debate in the House last Friday, the Government side argued that, after much deliberation at the climate committee, there was no good definition of climate justice.  The Labour Party has come together, in a united front, with members of the Opposition, NGOs and outside interests to have one definition, cutting it down, as Senator Higgins said, to the bare bones and understanding that the targets set in this Bill will be the bread and butter issue.<\/p> <p>It is important to have an overarching principle within what is groundbreaking legislation.  Senator Higgins spoke very eloquently about how climate justice is fundamental to how a developed country, like Ireland, tackles the issue of climate change, by recognising that others who have not contributed as much towards the increasing heating up of the planet will be most affected by it.  They will be most affected by displacement and the impact of climate change.  It is important that we, as a country, and particularly the Minister, as somebody who has been active in this area for three, if not four, decades and knows and deeply understands the issues around this, have an overarching principle in terms of climate justice.

The Labour Party will not press its amendment.  We will be behind the wider Opposition amendment, which proposes a workable definition of climate justice.

It will allow us to do more in respect of climate justice and to take on board the latest research in that regard.  I say this from a genuine place because I firmly believe that, fundamentally, we have to protect the poorest people on the planet, who have done the least to cause the problems.  That has to be fundamental to everything we do, and we need to ensure we do not put the needs of our workers above those of people who can do little about the climate crisis.  It is really important, across the board in the context of the Bill, to ensure we do not try to throw things into the pot that then tie our hands when it comes to doing what we need to do for the poorest on the planet.

The Opposition, which is a very disparate one, has come together in saying that we can reach an agreement.  We have made sure that the wording of that agreement is acceptable.  Senator Pauline O'Reilly said earlier that we must be careful not to tie our hands.  The wording of amendment No. 4 does not tie our hands.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>\tthe decisions and actions taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to the effects of climate change should ... support the people who are most affected by climate change but who have done the least to cause it and are the least equipped to adapt to its effects,... and safeguard the human rights of the most vulnerable persons. <\/blockquote><p>I must be clear on this.  There is not a one word in that amendment that anyone in this Chamber could argue with in this regard.  However, if there is, and I acknowledge what Senator Higgins said in terms of the Minister's record and commitment on this issue, perhaps he could talk to us about which word or sentence somehow is objectionable.<br\/><br\/>Senator Garvey said something very important this morning when she said we should all work together on this Bill.  That is exactly what we are doing with these amendments.  The Opposition parties came together and took on board the objections that were made last week.  We came together and agreed a wording that has been endorsed by the most important organisations working on the coalface in this country.  I see no reason why the Government will not accept these amendments.  Let us be clear on this.  Accepting this amendment will not further delay the Bill, because we know some amendments have been accepted already.  It is, therefore, not a question of delay.  It is certainly not a question of tying our hands because there is nothing in these amendments that ties our hands.  Unless, of course, there is an objection to tying our hands in defending the most vulnerable and weak people who have suffered the most with climate change.<br\/><br\/>The final point is not directly related to these amendments but I will raise it now because I may not get the opportunity again to raise it with the Minister.  When we talk about the most vulnerable people in the world right now, we must also talk about vaccine justice.  I appeal to him, the next time he sits with his colleagues in government, on behalf of humanity - I say this not on a party basis-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070900002#U00300","speaker":"1660","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625819400,"counter":80,"content":"<p>The Senator must be brief.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070900002#V00200","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1625819400,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I will be very brief.

This is not so different to that.

The same should apply in regard to other fuel costs if people have them.  We must take that in good faith.<\/p> <p>I do not dismiss what Senator Pauline O'Reilly said about tying our hands.  I believe the Government is in a tricky situation here.  There is world engagement on climate change.

I accept it has come together on that.  The argument is not that there are so many different definitions and so on.  I will continue with the process we agreed on Committee Stage, which is to revert back to what we did in the 2015 Bill and not to provide this more specific definition.<\/p><p>I come back to the argument I have made repeatedly.  The strength and core of this legislation is in the adherence to Article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, from 1992 and Article 2 from the Paris Agreement of 2015.Article 2 of the UNFCCC laid out the objective of stabilising concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  Article 3 of that convention has to be read as well and it outlines the principles behind all this.  It states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn [our] actions to achieve the objective of the Convention and to implement its provisions, the Parties shall be guided ... by the following:<br \/><br \/>...[That they must] protect the climate system for the benefit of present and future generations of humankind, on the basis of equity and in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.  Accordingly, the developed country Parties should take the lead in combating climate change and the adverse effects thereof.  <\/blockquote> <p>It continues with further principles which, in effect, provide many of the similar definitions of climate justice we have to adhere to.  Our Bill specifically directs us to that objective in the underlying UN treaties and agreements.  It is appropriate for us to adhere to those.  This is, more than anything, our playing a role in international agreements.<\/p><p>Senator Higgins mentioned the farmers in Malawi, who are on the front line and are being affected worst.  We have to address climate mitigation, climate adaptation and resilience.  As a State, we can rightly criticise ourselves much of the time but we have done good work in our development aid in supporting climate finance for adaptation and resilience for those farmers in developing countries who are finding the greatest difficulties as climate changes.<\/p><p>Going back to our earlier discussions around Irish agriculture, we have an opportunity to adapt and reward our farming system, which is small compared to other countries.  In setting international rules, supporting climate adaptation and resilience in Africa and Ireland, we recognise that we have a common goal but a differentiated responsibility.  We have greater responsibility.  People ask why Ireland should do something.  Tr&oacute;caire did good work some years ago saying our emissions are equivalent to those of some 400 million people from the poorest countries in the world.  That drives us to take real responsibility for our actions and recognise we have a common opportunity to support our small family farming system, as well as those in Africa, other developing countries and small island states.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Eamon Ryan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2028\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2028&amp;amp;pid=EamonRyanGP&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We are doing that within our UN system.

I know there are other things that will be done and I will come back to them later, but I want to first return to the question of injustice in the context of this amending legislation on climate action.  Recognition of the injustice is core in terms of the action that we need to take.  We need to understand, recognise and make as visible as possible our recognition of the injustice.  It is sometimes hard to put together the terrible stories we see every week from different parts of the world on the impact of climate change and to place all of those alongside each other and see them as not just a series of individual tragedies but a manifestation of injustice.<\/p> <p>In thinking about this issue earlier this morning I came up with the following two metaphors to explain it.  We are in a building and we are up on the top floor running all of the water taps.  The bottom two floors are already under water, but we are busily discussing which taps we may or may not turn off, our long-term plan for tap turn-off and whether or not the taps we have not turned on should be counted against the taps we might need to turn off.  Are we happy to let the water keep rising and people keep dying, not in the future, but this year and next year while we move our figures around in terms of accountancy?  It is important that as we do that work of figuring out how we turn off, turn down or escalate the tap on emissions we always remain mindful of those people who are drowning in the lower floors.  It is important to also remember that we cannot leave the building.  There is only one planet.  That is just one metaphor.<\/p> <p>Another metaphor for the injustice would be if there was a global pandemic and we had a vaccine recipe that could save the world and 100 countries, including nine of our partner countries which are the least developed countries that Ireland is meant to be supporting, asked for the recipe to be shared in order that they could make more vaccines and save more people sooner.  However, we said \"No\" because the profit of a few companies based near to us is more important than escalating saving everybody from the pandemic.  Of course, that is not a metaphor; it is what we are doing now.  It is what Ireland will be doing on climate action unless we change our position and support a TRIPS waiver before 27 July.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070900002#X00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1625819400,"counter":88,"content":"<p>Well said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070900002#X00300","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1625819400,"counter":89,"content":"<p>That is the level of injustice.  I mentioned <i>The Lancet<\/i>.  We know that in rich countries, unless they refocus and frame themselves within justice, the forces of injustice are strong.  We wanted this amendment accepted to strengthen the Minister's hand.  The Minister mentioned the UNFCCC.  I am glad it exists and that the Minister acknowledges its connection.  Let us be clear, the Minister quoted extensively from Article 3 of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.  In the new section 3(3) on the climate objective being introduced in this Bill, the Minister and the Government are only specifically required to carry out their respective functions in a way that is consistent with the ultimate objective specified in Article 2.  I have pointed out that we should be referencing the Paris Agreement in its totality and that we should also be referencing the UNFCCC, which I know we have signed up to and are bound by.  The reason this is important is because that is the bit about the functions.  We may well aim for that ultimate objective.  I am glad that climate justice is mentioned in the Long Title of the Bill.  I acknowledge that the Minister sees the goal of reaching net zero by 2050 as part of how we fulfil that ultimate objective.  The bit that matters in amendment No. 4 is that in each of our decisions and actions between now and 2050 we would be consistent with and have regard to climate justice.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Those are the reasons we would like to see it in the Bill and strengthened.

I will be watching the climate plan, as I know others will, to see whether climate justice decisions and actions are reflected fully.  The NGOs who wrote to us, namely, Tr&oacute;caire, Christian Aid, Oxfam, Concern and many others who are concerned, have many ideas and programmes they have put forward.  Is Ireland going to step up on that?  In the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action report we made a number of very practical recommendations on climate justice.  Let us be clear that this is not about development aid, because this is stuff that we owe.  It is also about loss and damage funding.  It is not just about green financing but is about green adaptation funding.  We should be giving this money to countries that are most affected.<\/p><p>Can the Minister at least guarantee us in this regard, and I am aware that he may not be able to come back to us on this?  I am stating to the Minister, that if we have not put this definition of climate justice in the Bill now we will be watching extra carefully to ensure that climate justice is reflected in the actions of his Department and of the Government in how we engage in the UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties later this year and in the position that Ireland is taking.  Will Ireland take the positions that support climate justice and take actions and decisions that reflect that?  It would have been a very useful opportunity for the Minister to send that signal today.  I will be looking and watching for those signals as I am sure will all of the NGOs who support and care about climate justice.  Of course, everybody cares about climate justice.  All of the Government Members said that they support and care about climate justice. <\/p><p>Let us talk about the evidence.

Unfortunately, judging the Minister on his actions, it is clear that he is not serious about a just transition.  First, the initial version of the Bill did not even mention just transition.  The redraft mentioned it once but without defining it and with the proviso, \"in so far as practicable\", rendering the provisions relating to the just transition meaningless.  Then, when Sinn F&eacute;in and others offered constructive, practical suggestions based on the working Scottish example, the Minister rejected them.  That includes the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment to define a just transition, which copied wording verbatim from the Green Party's 2018 climate justice Bill.  If that was not satisfactory for him, it is hard to know what would be.<\/p> <p>To top it all off, on Committee Stage the Minister opted for the one amendment by the Green Party Senators to change the Title in yet another inconsequential, tokenistic gesture towards a just transition.

The Opposition has come together.  There was no difficulty coming together to seek to have greater clarity and a definition of \"just transition\".  I referred at the very outset to the importance of fairness, climate justice, just transition and bringing everyone with us, particularly those in the agriculture, horticulture and forestry sectors.  I acknowledge the work of SIPTU.  It has done considerable work in this area and has engaged with all Members of the Houses regarding its view.  Losing a job is terrible for anyone but I am thinking, in particular, of the workers in the midlands.  I am thinking, in particular, of workers in the peat sector who have been hit particularly hard by Bord na M&oacute;na job losses, especially in counties Laois and Offaly.  They have to put a crust on their table.  Hundreds of workers in these communities recognise that there is a need for alternative work.  The Minister also recognises that but we have to engage with these people and retrain them.  While he talks about green labour and new opportunities, we have to support the workers.  We have to support their communities and employers and engage with experts and Government agencies to formulate new policies that will offer them genuine alternatives as family incomes, and so they can understand and somehow have confidence that they are going to fit into a new green labour work plan.  Ultimately, we can have all the principles we want but just transition needs to bring all the people with us.<\/p> <p>The other day, we were talking about the sustainable development goals.  The Minister was not present.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, was his substitute on the day.  I was stating how the Minister had given me a gift of a little crest with the sustainable development goals.  Subsequently, someone asked me about it and I told them he had given it to me.  It was after one of our engagements here.  I thank him again for it.  I received a letter the other day in this House, not my own, containing another crest from a mother and her daughter.  I am delighted to say that, with pride, I have it today.  There is very little emphasis on sustainable development goals within this Bill, which is exceptionally disappointing given the Minister is a great advocate of them and that he carries with pride his sustainable goals most of the time.  This relates to the amendment because it refers to just transition and addressing the issues in terms of finding alternatives and bringing people with us.  I have a concern.<\/p> <p>I have said previously and will continue to say I am particularly mindful of the people in the mushroom sector, the impact on that sector and the associated issue of peat.  I understand the challenges.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I have evidence and supporting documentation from Teagasc stating there was no real practical, viable alternative.  This ties in with the idea of just transition.  I would appreciate it if the Minister could address this.  I am not suggesting, in the context, that he will accept the amendment on the basis of this but I ask him to address it.  We have to find an alternative.  It is not sustainable, practical, proper or right that we should be bringing perlite or other substitutes from Sri Lanka or halfway around the world in heavy crude-diesel boats, ships and other forms of transport, with all that goes with that.  It is about sustainability and just transition.  I want the Minister and House to give comfort to the households that strictly rely on, and need, the support of the Government.  They need the comfort of knowing that, on account of this legislation, there will be genuine alternatives in the form of jobs to replace jobs in dirty or non-sustainable industry or industry that is somehow negative or in conflict with the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070900002#GG00200","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1625819400,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I do not fully agree with the definition.

It leaves out intergenerational justice, for instance.  The Bill, when looking at just transition, refers to maximising employment opportunities and supporting persons and communities that may be negatively affected by the transition.  It is not just about current workers, their trade unions and public participation with people who are now living on this planet; it is about the generations to come as well.  I believe that what has been stopping much of climate action is that we are solely focused on the jobs and workers that currently are in place and are feeling afraid to move into the unknown.  This Bill states that we have to move into that because there is a climate crisis and we have to move.  We must also find a just transition for workers.  It is not limiting it and if I am honest, this amendment does limit it.  The climate action committee did have sessions on a just transition and no one came to us, that I can recall, with a perfect definition.  The whole point is that our understanding of this changes over time - it has changed in relation to farmers - but we have to keep the Bill and just transition open enough to ensure that we can adjust as we go on.  I do not believe one will find any political party here does not want workers' rights, farmers and the midlands protected.  That is top of the agenda for any politician but what we are saying is that climate action must also be top of the agenda.  We cannot put one above the other.  Core to the Green Party is a just transition because we are a social and an environmental party and that will remain.  The amendment that was accepted was quite significant.  What was in the Bill originally was to promote climate justice.  Our amendment was to promote climate justice and just transition so it is not just about just transition but also its promotion.  The Sinn F&eacute;in Senator has called it tokenistic, but Sinn F&eacute;in had tabled an amendment to the Long Title to insert one word.  If that is not tokenistic, I do not know what that is.  I believe there is something quite substantial about not only putting in a just transition but in its promotion.  <\/p><p>As I have said before, throughout the Bill there is something that goes far beyond the Aarhus Convention.  It is the true meaning of public participation, it is stakeholder engagement, the just transition and climate justice.  It refers back to the Paris Agreement and to the UNFCCC, all the time.  I believe it is an incredibly strong Bill as is and I do not think that this captures exactly what my interpretation of a just transition would be, which would take into consideration future jobs, future workers and my children and our children's children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070900002#GG00300","speaker":"1693","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625819400,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I must unfortunately disagree with the idea that no party in this Oireachtas does not want workers' rights centre stage.  The fact is Ireland is one of very few countries that are seeking to dilute or oppose new directives on workers' rights at European level.  Specifically, Ireland is one of the countries that are effectively blocking the introduction of collective bargaining rights and seeking to do so.  It is important to be clear: the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, is opposing the strengthening of workers' rights in the European Union on our behalf right now.  That is important to remember and that is why we want to create a counter-pressure on just transition.  I am glad that the reference to employment is in the Bill attached to just transition and that the reference to supporting persons and communities is there.  However, what our amendment does by bringing it into a definition is that it changes it quite a bit and strengthens it.  We did get a lot of recommendations on just transition to the joint committee but one of the strongest recommendations we had again and again was for the Scottish approach, which is that there would be principles of just transition that would be reflected in how things were done under the legislation.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Again, that was very strongly and widely recommended.  It was one of the proposals that was rejected last week.  <\/p><p>This new amendment is a compromise.  I recognise that people feel very strongly on the issue.  Senators Boyhan and Mullen tabled strong amendments on just transition on Committee Stage.  The Sinn F&eacute;in and Labour Party Senators have put forward proposals.  We have consolidated and put together a new amendment.  It is important to state that it is not about just transition as a delay.  I do not think that any of us regard just transition as being about not completing the transition or slowing down on it.  In fact, the amendment explicitly uses the phrase \"needed for a fast and fair transition to a low carbon economy\".  It is about putting the measures in place that allow us to do this well and early.  <\/p><p>There are specific elements of the amendment that are important.  They place workers and their trade unions centre stage.  They mention communities, employers and public representatives, including local public representatives, who will have a role in terms of an input and insight into what it means for particular places in this country that are going to be hit hardest by the necessary transition and potentially, at the same time, by the impacts of climate change.  Of course, some of the places what will be affected by the necessary transition will also be the same places that are being affected by climate change, for example, places like north Kerry and the flooding projections in that area.  <\/p><p>This amendment does not just mention employment, but sustainable employment.  I believe the Minister has said that he wants better jobs to be created.  We have reflected that in the amendment.  It advocates for the creation of sustainable employment and replacement jobs of equal quality.  That is the minimum.  It mentions new sustainable employment.  It also mentions social supports, as well as training.  There is going to be a need for direct social support for families where one of the family members may be a worker who is impacted by the issue.  Crucially, the amendment recognises, but does not bind Ireland to, the International Labour Organization, ILO, guidelines on just transition.  The language is carefully chosen.  It states: \"The just transition process in Ireland may reflect and draw on aspects of the International Labour Organisation Guidelines on Just Transition\".  It does not bind us to the ILO guidelines, but it offers them as a very useful resource in order that we can look to best practice on just transition around the world.  In that regard, I must mention the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, which has done excellent work on best practice in just transition around the world.  We must reflect on the learnings from places that have started the process earlier, such as Scotland and Spain, which are doing it quite well, and other places where it has been poorly handled.  We need to learn from the best.  Looking to the ILO guidelines will help us to do that.<\/p><p>I also want to mention that one of the important things about the approach of the amendment to just transition is that it works from the ground up.  It is not just about supporting communities or employing workers.  It is about listening to them and social dialogue.  It is about ensuring that there are ground-up initiatives that come from communities and workers, which empower them.  It is most important, because we do not want to see a just transition that simply works through companies.  For example, we do not want to see funding going to companies in the hope that it will trickle down into new employment or new forms of action.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, we have seen some of that.  I do not usually like to give individual examples but I will on this occasion, because it is appropriate.  We have seen it in relation to funding for the cycling project in Lough Boora.  It is an example of an unfortunate situation whereby communities led the transition, started a new engagement with peatlands and promoted cycling back when nobody wanted to cycle in these areas.  The public procurement policies were designed in such a way that 50% of the weighting for the project depended on whether national contracts had already been awarded.  It effectively and intrinsically meant that being awarded a local contract and having experience in the locality that was rooted in that place did not count, while being awarded national contracts in other parts of the country counted towards the 50% experience threshold.  That is an example of the detail.  It is one example of how we need to do it better.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is why we believe we should include a definition so that all the various public bodies and others who are engaging in processes relevant to a just transition, including those from every sector from horticulture right through to aviation, will have guidance from the Government with regard to what they need to consider when thinking about just transition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070900002#HH00200","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625819400,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I agree very much with Senator Higgins that it is in the detail that a just transition must be delivered with regard to jobs.  I still say that these must be better jobs.  However, it is not just about jobs.  It is also about communities and whole sectors.  It is about planning and looking to see where we will have difficulties so that we can start preparing in advance.  It is also about social dialogue and addressing regional imbalances.  It is about preparing our country for the future and changing the economy as well as protecting our environment.  We all agree on this.  It is not a matter of one political party or perspective against others.  We have a job to do and we must deliver on it.  The appropriate place to do so is in the climate action plan and the strategies.  They are the centre of what the Government must do to deliver and of what we are doing.<\/p> <p>I had a meeting yesterday with our just transition commissioner, Kieran Mulvey, who gave me an update on what is happening in the midlands.  Progress has been slow because we are disbursing public money.  If we were to disburse it without care, we would be similarly lambasted.  There is now &euro;108 million in funding for the restoration of bogs.  Some 200 jobs, between part-time and full-time, are already in place.  This number will grow.  More than 60 community projects have been funded with total funding to the tune of &euro;27 million.  Getting state aid approval has been slow, as has getting through all of the administrative procedures that must be completed, but a start has been made.  There is a great diversity of new community initiatives being developed.  The retrofitting of houses has been somewhat delayed by Covid but retrofitting has begun on some 850 local authority houses occupied by those in fuel poverty.  We are actually doing it in reality and learning lessons that we will be able to apply as we look for just transition solutions in other areas.  It is in the doing that this matters.  <\/p> <p>I was very happy to accept the amendment of my Green Party colleagues on Committee Stage because it very much reflected the debate in the D&aacute;il on Report Stage, during which the emphasis was on a similar amendment to the Long Title of the Bill.  I was glad to be able to accept that.  The key point relates to the climate action plan and the strategy.  The proposed new section 4(8)(k) of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 correctly focuses on employment opportunities and support for individuals and communities that may be negatively affected.  This is the appropriate steer and guide.  We will use that to deliver a just transition.  I cannot accept the amendments.

That is what we are witnessing here today.<\/p> <p>I will respond to a couple of the points that were made.  We proposed a change to the Title of the Bill but we backed it up with substantial changes, such as this definition, so it was in no way tokenistic.  Changing words without backing them up in this way is, frankly, just tokenism.  I was very struck by what Senator Pauline O'Reilly said on Committee Stage.  She said that nobody had come forward with a perfect definition.  Does that sound to the Minister like someone who actually wants a definition to be achieved?  I remind the Senator of the words of the great philosopher, Neil Young.  I believe they were heard at Live Aid in 1985, which only the Minister and I are likely to remember.

Yet, for the second time today, we see the Minister and the Government rejecting the best efforts we have made to strengthen this Bill further.  To be clear, we are supporting this Bill.  We believe in this Bill and want to make it stronger and better.<\/p><p>As a trade unionist, it is particularly disappointing because, and I referenced this last week, the Minister does not seem willing to listen to what trade unions are saying.  They want a definition of \"just transition\" in the Bill.  I have to regretfully disagree with Senator Pauline O'Reilly's statement that we are all here to protect workers' rights because the fact of the matter is - and Senator Higgins is quite correct in this regard - that the Government has written to the EU Commission to ask that the EU minimum wage directive is not made binding.  That directive is specifically about strengthening the right to collective bargaining.  As many Senators know, we do not have a right to collective bargaining in this country.  Please, let us hear no more nonsense from Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael or the Green Party about how they are protecting workers' rights when the T&aacute;naiste has written to the EU Commission to lobby against collective bargaining rights in this country.  That is a fact.  We have a copy of the letter.  There is no argument about this matter because that is where the Government stands on it.<\/p><p>As already stated, I am a trade unionist.  I must point out that - unfortunately, this has been a constant failing - the Minister is not listening.  I am delighted to hear the update on the midlands.  There is some encouraging news in that regard, which is great.  We are talking about the Bill, however, and, unfortunately, the reality is that the Minister is rejecting a definition of \"just transition\" that ties in very well, and aligns us without restricting us, to the International Labour Organization.  Why can the Minister not accept that?  Again, I note that he is not giving a reason why.  We have had a lack of reasons.  It is, basically, that the Minister is not prepared to work with us.

Imagine getting every country in the UN to sign up to detailed proposals about work, cities, water and how we treat it, life on land and in water, and health and its basics - not in vague language but with specific targets and goals - yet we cannot agree to refer in our climate legislation to that groundbreaking global agreement.

It is a reason we need to speed up on delivering them because they are the blueprint for how we do things better, and how we make society more resilient and prepare it to ensure we have strong integrated approaches on equality and the environment.

Our definition states that it \"includes, but is not limited to, the United Nations sustainable development goals\".  It, therefore, allows space for what comes after the sustainable development goals when we reach the 2030 deadline and the decade of action, which we are one year into already, ends.  It leaves space for what the world will collectively come up with that follows that.  This amendment only requires that regard is given to this.  It does not bind or tie down.

This arises in the context of the elevated focus on removals signalled by the Government's acceptance of amendments on Committee Stage and the Report Stage amendments brought forward by the Government which place a stronger emphasis on removals.  How that is done will be important, as will be how much that is done.  <\/p> <p>My concern, which the Minister might address, is whether there will be a cap on the level of removals.  For example, might it be 5%, 10%, 20%?  What we do not want to see happen is that, rather than reducing emissions, we are disappearing or calculating out so that they do not count on paper.  I previously mentioned the idea of getting credit for the taps that you do not turn on that allows you to keep other taps running.  There is sometimes a little bit of that in removals.  This is about looking for credit for the things that you do not do as well as for the active measures that you might take to increase removals.  I do not see that specifically named in the Government amendments. <\/p> <p>The Minister mentioned EU guidelines and the land-use, land-use change and forestry approach.  Currently, Ireland is a net emitter.  Forestry is a net emitter.  We hear a lot about trees.  The approach we have taken to forestry is such that currently forestry emits more emissions than it sequesters.  It is important that that is reflected.  My amendment, if inserted, copper-fastens it.  In my amendment, I state \"current international carbon reporting practice\", which is the language from the Scottish legislation and how they approached the issue of removals.  The Minister specifies the EU.  In referencing \"international\" I am hoping to encompass the EU and UN evolving science in these measures.  The other part of the amendment, that is, \"in a manner that is consistent\" is about making sure that we set some limits on how removals are used.  I am concerned.  I opposed a blunt insertion of the idea of removals without any caveats, as happened on Committee Stage.  There is a real danger that in the end we will still be producing a lot of emissions and we will not reach the goal of highest possible ambition of progression.  <\/p> <p>If we have two hands that we can act with, that is, removals and emissions reduction, we should be working with both hands.  I believe that farmers should be paid and supported.  They are custodians of the land, but they are not the only custodians of the land.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Every person in Ireland is a custodian of the land of the country.  It is important to remember that it is a shared responsibility of farmers and everyone else.  All of us play a role in this.  We need to look at how we can sequester and remove better but it must not be done in any way that compromises our ultimate goal of as much reduction in emissions as we can possibly achieve.  I suggest that as the Minister develops those guidelines, it might be worthwhile for him to refer back to some of the committee proceedings where we heard about double-counting scenarios in which trees are reported as doing two or three different pieces of work.<\/p><p>I am concerned that the Minister has mentioned a potential trading scheme in this area because that opens us up to further potential manoeuvres.  We know how trading systems and company structures, etc., have been used to move tax around the world so it never really gets counted anywhere.  I hope we will be very careful not to introduce measures like that.  The Minister hinted that such an approach might be taken in the case of emissions.<\/p><p>The Minister did not answer my question about the regulations he intends to insert under the proposed new subsection (5B), which corresponds with my amendment No. 9.  I asked the Minister to assure us that a change in the baseline year will not lead to any diminution, reduction or backward slide.  Such a change should not lead to a different way of measuring progress which effectively reduces the amount of tonnage that might need to be sought.  It should not lead to any scenario that involves a potential for backsliding.  In fact, it should operate on the principle of highest possible ambition and progression.  In effect, there should be a ratchet approach.  <\/p><p>The Minister has just told me that the baseline year was politically negotiated and that something else would be politically negotiated.  If we allow for a change of baseline year in this legislation, I want to be assured that we are not allowing whatever is politically negotiated to be less ambitious.  Our prerogative now, as the legislators in this Oireachtas, is to ensure this Bill is a strong as possible.  I do not want us to be inserting loopholes to allow for the programme for government negotiations of a future Government.  That is not my affair as a legislator.  I do not like to see that being brought into this Bill.  The Minister did not answer my question on that point.  He simply indicated that it is a political matter for the future.  Can the Minister give me an assurance that the baseline year movement will not be effectively regressive?  Can he also say whether there is potential within the regulations he has set out for the degree to which removals might be used to be limited?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070900002#SS00500","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625819400,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I can give the Senator a complete reassurance that her issue with the baseline relates only to how it is worded.

This measure will give future governments the ability, should they want to do so, to set further baseline targets in addressing those third, fourth, fifth and sixth five-year periods.  That is the intention of the amendment.<\/p> <p>I am afraid I cannot accept amendment No. 9.  To answer directly the question on whether there should be a cap on removals, I do not believe there should not be.  The reality is that for the 2050 period we will need significant removals to get to net zero while being able to cover the agricultural activities which will still be ongoing.  Many of the benefits and realities of removals will come from nature-based solutions which have ancillary benefits and are going to help us to develop and protect ourselves from the biodiversity crisis we also face.

We can focus on the removals but there are also climate risks.  Our climate is changing.  We have large areas of exposed bog in particular where we have seen and could see very large fires developing in drought conditions and that would lead to further massive releases of carbon into the atmosphere.  There is nothing certain in forestry.  Those involved in the development of forestry have seen it with ash dieback and major forest fires.  In Europe, the biggest issue in terms of land use, land-use change and forestry is that our carbon sinks are shrinking.  The ability of the natural world to absorb and retain carbon is in crisis because of climate change.  The real issue and risk is how we stop the further release of emissions.  There are benefits from forestry when we pursue a closer-to-nature model that is much more climate resilient.  When we rewet soils and restore bogland, it helps in the context of climate adaptation as well as resilience.  This is opening up solutions that deliver for us in a whole variety of different ways.  Far from a cap, my real concern is that the natural world is increasingly unable to store carbon because of the climate change that we are already seeing.

The OECD has done some work on this, but it varies as to what exactly the definition involves.<\/p> <p>I favour us exploring an emissions trading scheme.  I say this because it is important, in the context of this legislation, that we bring people with us.  I accept the Minister's point that it is not just farmers who are custodians of the land, but it is farmers who will be our front-line workers in the battle against climate change.  What farmers want now is sustainability - not just from an environmental perspective but also from a financial point of view.  We must shift to a situation whereby farm families believe that by doing things which are environmentally friendly they will be able to sustain their families financially.  That is why I favour an emissions trading scheme.  At present, if somebody looks at planting a forest or pasture land that could be used as a carbon sink, any of the carbon credits that they may generate are owned by the State.  It is almost a communist system.  Whereas, if we move to a situation whereby we can reward and recognise farmers by investing and that they will be able to trade the credits they produce or create, they can either offset them against other farm activities or offset them more generally.  Then we can see a sustainable model that is both financially and environmentally sustainable.<\/p> <p>The New Zealand emissions trading scheme has flaws.  I do not say that it is directly applicable here, but it is one whereby participants have to pay an emission unit for every 2 tonnes of carbon dioxide they produce.  It is pretty clear.  There is a fixed price of NZ$35 that they have to pay, but farmers are then also incentivised to generate income for themselves if they use land as a carbon sink.  I would like to see that kind of model being explored.  Just transition is not only about telling people this is what they cannot do, it also involves providing them with real opportunities to be able to generate income so that they can sustain their families and communities.

I appreciate that the Minister is working at this for a long number of years so I will not say the easy part is the passing of the legislation.  The bigger challenge will be putting it into effect with the carbon budgets.  That means bringing people along with us.  If that means we should consider ways whereby we can incentivise and reward, we should definitely approach it in that way.  I would certainly like to hear the Minister's views on the possibility of considering an emissions trading scheme and on how we can reward landowners so they can ensure that, for them and their families, their livelihoods will be sustainable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070900002#UU00200","speaker":"1638","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625819400,"counter":135,"content":"<p>We are going to stick to the amendments today because we have a lot to get through.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070900002#VV00200","speaker":"1659"},{"type":"speech","time":1625819400,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I am concerned by the unwillingness to set a ceiling or limits in terms of the removals.  I am concerned about the loss of emissions from our soil, forestry and peatlands.  Urgent action is required in that regard.  There is a need to ensure payment.  I recognise that farmers are on the front line.  They have key work that needs to be rewarded.  The Minister said the benefit comes to the State in terms of the reduction of emissions.  That should be recognised by the State because it is the sequestering and reductions in emissions that will allow the State to meet its targets and, if we are talking financially, avoid very large fines, which we have been facing for not reaching our targets.  However, it is also important that we set limits.  We must not have any danger - and I am worried about the danger - of an idea whereby we keep business going as usual while doing other things to make up for it.  It needs to be a case of emissions reduction and removal, and we need to have hard measures on emissions reduction as well as removal and sequestration.   When the Government is making the regulations mandated under the section, the Minister should engage with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action on them.  He should engage widely to ensure there is potential to put a limit on the use of removals within the regulations.  That would be appropriate.<\/p> <p>Regarding the idea of the trading schemes, we know the position from housing.  Trying to let the market solve our housing problems has not worked out very well.  If we try to fit climate action into the stock market model, we will fail and the world will burn.  That is just clear as day.  Therefore, we need to be careful.  Ireland uses offsets at the moment.  Our use of offsets has allowed us to keep doing things we should not really be doing.  I do not want us to facilitate other countries to use offsets to avoid making the changes they need to make.  Therefore, we need to be really clear.  Every country needs to be doing everything it can do.  We should not use offsetting to either limit our own ambition and responsibility or limit the responsibilities and actions of others.  There are roles within the State for recognising carbon credits; I want to be clear on that.  It is important to recognise the role of ecological care because it is sometimes a matter of ecological care, not just the measurement of carbon units solely when we talk about sequestration.<\/p> <p>The Minister mentioned the integrated approach.  I hope it will be reflected.

That company did not invent trees.  As part of the regulations on removals and how we measure carbon sequestration, it is extremely important that we integrate those biodiversity benefits and that we do not just look at them as extra benefits which may happen to occur but, rather, that we include them.  Many of the environmental champions of biodiversity have sometimes been villianised as if they are delaying climate action when they are pushing for an integrated approach.

I have removed around ten to 15 amendments that I would have tabled individually because of this very elegant amendment that has been put by Senators Bacik and Moynihan.  It deals with the same issue.  The Minister will be aware that his Department was involved in a case in the High Court this year.  It was not a past iteration of his Department or the Government.  This Government and the Minister's Department successfully argued in the High Court this year, in respect of the provisions of the 2015 Act, which is still the relevant Act because this Bill amends the 2015 Act, that because the Government was not specifically named, it was not required or obliged to basically account for and deliver on provisions.  Due to the fact that a Minister was named but the Government was not named, it was argued that the Government could not be held to account in relation to provisions of the 2015 Act.  That is a huge concern.  We know that one of the key recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly was justiciability.  The committee also recommended that there should be greater justiciability and accountability.  Of course, there is some justiciability here.  We want there to be justiciability that is successful and justiciability for the Government.<\/p> <p>The Government is referred to in some of the sections of the Bill.  However, it is important to note that in many of the places where it is referenced, reference is made to the Minister and the Government's respective functions.  For example the new section 3(3) states: \"The Minister and the Government shall carry out their respective functions\" in ways that are consistent with the UNFCCC and the European Union.  However, and this is where I come to my amendments Nos. 35 and 36, in respect of one of the key sections of the Bill cited by the Government, when claiming that it did not have to deliver on, or be bound by, the commitments contained in the 2015 Act, the argument was that the Government was not listed as a relevant body.  The solution that I have put forward is a simple one.  I do not list the Government as a relevant body, but I list it alongside the relevant bodies.  My amendment states that a relevant body \"and the Government of Ireland\" will be required to act in a way consistent with the UNFCCC and the EU.  That is important in respect of section 15.  <\/p> <p>Section 15, and specifically the new section 15, as inserted, is where the climate plan, sectoral targets and all of the building blocks of achieving our national objective are listed.  All of those building blocks - the plans, the mitigation, the strategies, the budgets and all of that - are listed in section 15.  Relevant bodies have to consider them, but the Government is not bound by that.  The Government is referred to in section 3(3), which specifies \"The Minister and the Government shall carry out their respective functions\" in a manner consistent with the higher ultimate goal.  However, the Government is not referenced in section 15, which states that a relevant body must perform its functions in a manner consistent with all of those tools that we are effectively going to create.  There may be room for interpretation, but it is not specified as clearly as it should be in that section.  I understand that there are a few sections in the Bill where reference is made to the Government.  However, my concern is that through section 15, we could be allowing a loophole to continue.  It is not a theoretical loophole.

I have been called worse.  I wish to put on record Sinn F&eacute;in's perspective on this matter, which is that we support our Labour Party colleagues.  This amendment relates to the recent High Court finding with regard to the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, which the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021 seeks to amend.  The section 15 loophole was discussed on 2 July in connection with Committee Stage amendment No. 20 and others.  The judge upheld arguments from the Government that there was a massive loophole in the legislation which the Government could use to evade having to adhere to the Act's provisions.  The Government argued that it was not a relevant body and that the provisions of the Bill applied only to Ministers and magically ceased to apply to those Ministers when they crossed the threshold of the Cabinet room.  That really is Monty Pythonesque, is it not?  However, that is what this Government successfully argued in court.  It is a glaring loophole of which the Government is undoubtedly aware because the Department made the argument in court.  Frankly, it is appalling that this loophole has not been closed.  I hope the Minister will reconsider.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070900002#YY00500","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1625819400,"counter":149,"content":"<p>I cannot accept the amendment.  I read the judgment, which was very interesting.  As I recall, the issue regarding the role of the Government was not presented as one of the main arguments in the appellant's original presentation.  The judge drew it out in his judgment.  The judgment relates to the 2015 Act, which is being fundamentally changed and altered by this Bill.  As Senator Higgins has referred to, the proposed new section 3(3) says that \"The Minister and the Government shall carry out their respective functions [...] in a manner [...] that is consistent with the [...] United Nations Framework\".  That is a fundamentally stronger and more powerful requirement on the Government and Ministers than had existed in the 2015 Act.  If one goes down through the Bill to see how this applies to those respective functions, the critical one relates to the devising, evolution and updating of a climate action plan and the setting of the climate strategy.  The proposed new section 4(8) specifies that both the Minister and the Government must have regard to all of those other requirements we mentioned earlier with regard to just transition and so on.  Both of them must take the requirements into account.  Critically, the Government, as the approving body, is cited at centre stage with regard to the approval of the carbon budgets and a whole range of other respective functions.  It is a fundamentally different Bill which will amend the existing Act in a way which addresses any questions that could arise from that judgment.

I had a very lengthy discussion on this issue with the Minister, which I do not think was satisfactory, but we probably do not need to go over it all again.  This clause was added to the Bill after scrutiny and pre-legislative scrutiny.  If our last discussion was about closing a loophole in the previous Bill, this opens a new loophole in the new Bill.  It is a provision that would remove the potential to access remedy or redress by way of damages or compensation for not just individual citizens but, as was mentioned, SMEs, and others who might be affected, by a failure \"of whatever kind, to comply with [the] provision of this Act or any obligation or duty created thereunder.\"  It is very widely framed.<\/p> <p>There are very serious concerns about this when one looks at Article 13 of the European Convention of Human Rights, which specifically mentions individuals' rights to effective remedy.  This is especially since remedy is mentioned in the way limitation of liability is phrased in this clause.  There are also concerns in respect of the Aarhus Convention regarding climate action and the environment.  As was pointed out in other amendments we discussed, this creates a situation whereby we are, potentially, weakening the strength of judicial action.  Part of the strength of judicial action is that the Government might be required to take new measures and instigate new policies, but another is the potential financial cost of non-compliance.  We are removing the element of financial penalty in terms of redress, remediation, relief, compensation or damages.  We are removing one of the strong levers that might be used to force the Government to follow through and not fail to comply with the obligations and duties created under this Act.  <\/p> <p>At the same time, as has been mentioned, we are looking at proposals to bring in new liabilities for investment companies and international investors, where they would still be able to seek compensation and have the threat of legal action with, potentially, devastating costs.  We are creating an environment where one hand is being strengthened, which is those who may wish to take action against climate action, while the other hand, those who want to take action to seek and press the Government to follow through and deliver, is being weakened.  We may have a scenario where inaction might become less expensive than action.  The concern is, of course, that it might have a chilling effect on Government and its policies.  We know that cost forms part of the advice received from the Attorney General.  We know the potential for cases to be taken because we have heard it 1 million times on property rights and all the rest. <\/p> <p>I am concerned in this regard and I support, along with Senators Bacik, Moynihan, Sherlock and others, the removal of this clause from the Bill.  The Minister should think about, and reflect, on it.  If measures are needed in future, they should be brought in as separate or amending legislation but, right now, this is an incredibly wide provision that creates hostages to fortune, loopholes and, potentially, perverse disincentives to action.<\/p> <p>On my other amendment in this set, I note the language: \"arising out of any failure, of whatever kind, to comply with any provision of this Act or any obligation or duty...thereunder\".  Again, this is not saying that if, despite our best reasonable efforts we fail to achieve measures, or, if due to circumstances beyond our control we fail to achieve it, or anything else.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This language is not subtle, it is wide open.

I am sure that in including it and seeking to limit the liability, the Government probably had certain scenarios in mind, some of them perhaps very reasonable, in which compensation or damages might not be appropriate.  In phrasing the provision this broadly, however, it could mean anything.  Will the Minister tell us what the words \"of whatever kind\" mean in this instance?  What is the range of scenarios envisaged?  We can then determine whether the scenarios are those that unfold when people seek compensation for, say, the avoidable flooding of their communities or other subsidiary actions, or for the failure to follow through on anything that might be in a sectoral plan, a climate plan or budget or a departmental plan that emerges from the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070900002#CCC00400","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625819400,"counter":157,"content":"<p>The amendment was introduced, as it states, for \"the avoidance of doubt\" because it was never intended or expected that we would, in a sense, set up a justiciability whereby in the case of an individual action, such as an investment decision having been made for a power plan or transport project, the remedy would be financial liability in respect of that act.  The provision is fully justiciable.  It has strength and the Supreme Court judgment of last summer copper-fastens it.  There is compellability on the Government such that if it does not follow the processes put in place by the Bill to deliver the objectives, it can be brought to court and held to account in regard to whether it is pursuing the requirements set out in the legislation.  That is appropriate, and the Supreme Court judgment showed that the remedy in that case was the annulling of the plan.  The Government cannot ignore a Supreme Court judgment where it is clearly in breach of the import of the law.<\/p> <p>The import in question relates to setting out the processes by which we must meet the 2050 goal.  It is not to hold to account each decision of whatever kind, particularly those that relate to investment or other decisions, and to have the remedy such that a financial penalty will be applied by the courts.  The Bill has never been constructed in that way.  It would have to be changed in its entirety in order to set up that sort of construct.

Does it cascade to the sectoral mitigation measures and failure to comply with them or with the national mitigation plan?  Does it cascade to local authorities or to each of the relevant bodies?  Is everybody off the hook with regard to potential damages, redress or compensation if they decide not to comply?  It is not clear.  The provision does not add the clarity the Minister suggested.

While the Government is obligated by the national climate objectives, this is not in fact language that clearly states this 51% will be approved by the Government and that carbon budgets that reach this particular target will be approved.  It simply states in the Bill that they will be proposed.  It would be appropriate and strong and a better reflection of the political commitment to put such a commitment onto the political actors involved, namely, the Government, in order that it is politically and legally obliged to follow through.  That is why it should say: \"and approved by the Government\" when we talk about the 51% of emission reductions in 2030.<\/p> <p>The other amendment, amendment No. 22, inserting the phrase, \"at least\", is the idea that 51% should be the floor of our ambition and not its ceiling.  The inclusion of \"at least\" is a signal in respect of that 51% figure.  This may well be what emerges from the carbon budgets and is certainly likely what will be approved by the Government because that is what the political agreement is there for.  There would be scope, however, for the Climate Change Advisory Council to actually follow through on what it is being told to do in all of the other parts of the Bill, which is to make proposals that are consistent with the science, to look to the UN and all of those things that we are telling the advisory council that it needs to consider.  We already have told the council the exact and specific outcome it needs to come up with, however.  We are not setting a minimum but in fact we are being very specific about that 51% in just that year, 2030.  It is a pity that we do not put in \"at least\", which would then indicate that 51% was a minimum target.  The Climate Change Advisory Council would be able to demonstrate its independence by making a recommendation which could go above that, if drawn on to do so by the science and others, and the Government could then politically follow through and deliver on the 51% if that is all it could be politically agreed and achieved.  <\/p> <p>It would be a much clearer line between the independent functions of the Climate Change Advisory Council, which we want to play a key role in the architecture of dealing with climate change in the State, rather than tying it to what is essentially a politically negotiated commitment point.  The political negotiation should be coming after the independent advice, rather than the independent advice being required to deliver the politically negotiated outcome.  <\/p> <p>That is why it should be a minimum target which would allow both the assurance of the delivery but also the approval by the Government.

As one expires, another one will be put in place.  We will have a better idea of where we are in the process.  I do not see any Government looking to hold back, as that would not make any sense because we will only be halfway there at the 51% reduction.  I do not believe it needs the words \"at least\".  The commitment is hugely ambitious because we are starting from almost zero in effect.  Halving emissions in a decade is ambitious beyond compare but we can deliver it.  We will do so because it is better for the country and better for the economic development opportunities it will bring, as well as a fairer economy as we deliver it with a just transition.<\/p> <p>I believe the wording is appropriate in terms of reflecting the programme for Government commitment.  While we are working on the legislation here, behind the scenes we are working flat out on the climate action plan.

Every Department is now being asked to play its part in meeting this target.  This is something we will be able to demonstrate in the autumn when we enact the Bill and start proceeding.

Unfortunately, it was only halfway through the Bill.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth was responding.  There were serious concerns that relate to the original 2015 Act but which are still in this Act whereby some of the safeguards have been put in place did not apply to everybody.  The 2015 Act allowed that the advisory council could set up subcommittees and could delegate functions to subcommittees.  Amendment no. 32 seeks to be clear that one function that should never be delegated to a subcommittee is the proposal or setting of carbon budgets, because that is almost the core work of the advisory council.<\/p> <p>Another concern is that those subcommittees were only obliged to contain one member of the advisory council.  All the positive things that were put in around the balance of skills and expertise in the advisory council and the provisions that were there around declarations of interests to ensure that we have clarity around the interests of members of the advisory council only applied to the advisory council members on a subcommittee, whereas there may be many other members who do not have to meet the same qualification criteria discussed in other parts of the Bill and who do not have to declare interests.  There is a concern that while we have this high level of scrutiny in appointment and a high level of obligation and declaration of interests and transparency placed on the advisory council, the actual work of the advisory council could be delegated to subcommittees which will contain other persons who do not have to declare their interests.  That is not a measure that is being introduced by this Bill but a flaw in the original 2015 legislation.  However, given the very serious responsibilities being placed on the advisory council in this Bill it is very important that we address that gap.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070900002#RRR00300","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1625819400,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I recognise the concern and the case made by Senator Higgins.

I urge that attention is paid.  It may be a matter to be tracked and carefully monitored and reflected in the report of the advisory council in order that there is clarity that the key decision-making functions are not delegated to subcommittees but are voted at council level and that the powers are centred on that balance of expertise and gender the Minister has tried to set up within the advisory council in other parts of the Bill.  There should be assurance that it is the aforementioned carefully constructed advisory council that will make the really important key functions and decisions in respect of this.  If the Minister will not accept my amendment, I urge that this issue be very carefully traced an monitored because we do not want to see a subcommittee that effectively takes control or leadership, which may include representations of industries and others.<\/p> <p>I strongly welcome the Minister's acceptance of amendment no. 34.  That will at least give some transparency and clarity around the membership of the subcommittees working with the advisory council, the declaration of interests and, I imagine, appropriate steps and measures that would flow from that around recusing oneself from key and important decisions where there may be financial interest, for example.  Those will help to build confidence in the advisory council structure and its subcommittee structure and will help and add to transparency.

I will pull up the relevant pages because this is a matter on which it is useful to have the facts.  Unfortunately, the withdrawal is not as clean as it should be.  This is because, in saying that new licences will not be issued, a number of exemptions are provided for, including in situations where, prior to commencement of the section, the Minister has entered an undertaking.  I will point out the sections I propose to amend.  Section 20(6) says that, where an exploration licence, a petroleum prospecting licence, an undertaking or a petroleum lease is in place, they might not be removed.  That can be understood, although we might need to move towards radical decisions in that area.  The sections about which I am concerned are sections 20(2), 20(3), 20(4) and 20(5) which provide for the granting of new exploration licences, petroleum prospecting licences, petroleum leases and undertakings where there has been previous engagement from the State.  Where the Minister has entered into an undertaking, he or she may then add to that by granting an exploration licence or prospecting licence.<\/p> <p>The section on which I am specifically focused, and which I am really concerned about, states that, where the Minister has granted an exploration licence, he or she may go on to grant a petroleum prospecting licence, a petroleum lease or an undertaking.  In such situations, a company may have only had a licence to explore and to look at an area.  When we try to object to planning applications relating to exploration we are told that it is only exploration rather than extraction and that climate issues will be considered if a licence for extraction is sought.  However, this section seems to suggest that the mere granting of an exploration licence means that the Minister may still grant licences for prospecting and extraction.  That is extremely concerning.  What the Minister is telling us with this section is that he is happy to start brand-new fossil fuel extraction in this State wherever there has been exploration.  That is not sustaining what we have and certainly does not represent the stopping of the granting of new licences, which we were told was happening.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is not stopping new licences or leases, it is providing for them.  It seems to be providing them in a scenario based on some kind of concern about the Energy Charter Treaty.  The Minister did not answer my earlier question on that treaty.  I ask him to clarify if these measures have been put in the Bill due to concerns and expectations about the Energy Charter Treaty.  Is the State unwilling to take actions that might be necessary and are ambitious in ensuring that we do not issue new licences or leases for petroleum extraction here?  Why are we not taking those actions?  Is it because we are concerned about the Energy Charter Treaty and being sued for compensation?  That is a real concern.<br\/><br\/>This is a serious matter if we look at it globally.  The International Energy Agency has been very clear that to achieve our goal of 1.5&deg;C, which is the ultimate objective outlined at the start of the Bill, no new oil or gas exploration licences or developments should be approved after 2021.  Academics have outlined that the extraction of fossil fuels must stop.  The concern is that if we renew licences that already exist and grant licences to those who have explored and if a few other countries take the same approach, we will not stop climate change.  We are looking towards a point where we will have to come back, possibly under section 6, and where activities under some of the existing licences might need to stop.  If we say we are in a bind and have to allow those activities to continue, what does that say to places like Uganda, where Irish companies will be pressing the Government of that country to continue with oil and gas extraction in the Queen Elizabeth National Park?  There is a real danger that if we start limiting our ambition to what we think we can do without annoying companies, that ambition will not be enough to keep the temperature below the threshold needed for safety on this planet.  If Canada and all these other countries do the same, and everybody says that they will just keep going with the things they have started or, in the case of exploration, the things they thought about starting, then we will not have done enough.  I ask the Minister to remove those exemptions, so that when we talk about having stopped petroleum licences it will actually be true.  That would be good.<br\/><br\/>On fracking, which was discussed earlier, I will point out that the fracking amendment originally came from the Fine Gael back benches.  The divestment from fossil fuels trumpeted by the Government around the world and on the back of which it sold many green bonds came about on foot of a Bill put forward by Deputy Pringle.  This is a reminder that the ideas and ambition we need are not necessarily emanating from the Department in those cases.  They have come from concerned public representatives from the back benches, Government and Opposition.  It is a good reminder of where we have had progress so far on oil and gas.  I worry that we do not see the same level of vision or ambition we saw from those backbenchers and individual Members in this set of measures from the Department.  I see equivocation, dilution of ambition and an emphasis on economic concerns.<br\/><br\/>I suggest the removal of these exemptions.  I have a number of related amendments because this is quite a large set.  They again mirror some of that limitation of liability language at the very start of the Bill and one of which states:<\/p><blockquote>\tFor the avoidance of doubt, no remedy or relief by way of damages or compensation is available where a Minister declines to grant a lease or licence or enter into an undertaking under this section or approve the renewal, extension or progression of any licence, lease or undertaking ... where, in the opinion of the Minister, such actions would be inconsistent with any provision of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act ... and any obligation or duty created thereunder. <\/blockquote><p><!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is the flip side of that provision for limitation of liability at the beginning of the Bill.  This is where it is stated that if it is an obligation that we have because it is set out in the Bill, we will not pay compensation for doing what we have to do to fulfil our duties under the Bill.  It does not matter whether there was an expectation or a profit planned, or whether we were looking forward to selling some oil or gas in the future, or whatever, because we will not grant that licence and we will owe nothing if we do it because we are doing it for the right reasons, that is, our obligations and duties under the Bill.<\/p><p>This is the safety net for the Government, again, in respect of investment court systems.  I do not know whether it is a strong enough safety net but it is an attempt at one in respect of both the investment court system under CETA - given that, crucially, many Canadian companies are heavy investors in Ireland's oil and gas fields - and the current provisions of the Energy Charter Treaty.  Will the Minister please be clear in regard to the Energy Charter Treaty, how it impacts in this regard and what it means in respect of these provisions?  Is that why exploration is still mentioned?  Cases may, of course, be taken in national courts, but the compensation bills that come from national courts are not the same and a national court would be obliged to consider domestic law and other priorities, whereas an investor tribunal, according to the text of CETA, may only consider domestic law but does not have to.  Will the Minister address what I have outlined?  I would like him to consider taking on board this safety net.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 46 refers to \"[n]othing in this section\".  I am concerned that by not including it, we might be digging ourselves a deeper hole and creating expectations.  Companies might say that the legislation signals that wherever there is an exploration licence, one can expect prospecting to be permitted.  Will that apply to other areas for which exploration licences have been granted or to other extractive industries?  That is the concern and I tried to address it by being clear.  If the Minister cannot accept the other amendments relating to safety nets, he might accept this short one, amendment No. 46, which clarifies: \"Nothing in this section shall be construed as constituting an inducement to investment or giving rise to any expectations for any persons for the granting of any licence or lease.\"  It will allow the granting of licences and so on to continue, but will protect the Government and the State against what might be perceived as inducements, encouragements or the creation of expectations.  Amendments Nos. 44 and 45 are similar in that they specifically provide that licences and leases may be granted under the sections, but not where doing so would be contrary to the goals in the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070900002#TTT00700","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625819400,"counter":257,"content":"<p>I am afraid I cannot accept the amendments.  To respond to the questions and concerns, this did not come from any provision of the Energy Charter Treaty.  It has not impacted in any way on the Government's decision making regarding the ending of new oil or gas exploration licences.  The Senator is correct that many of these developments come from the political sphere, such as the ban on fracking or the restriction on State investment in fossil fuels.  I recall my party publishing a Bill, on the same day that Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith happened to publish one, in which we set out that we would seek in government to deliver what we are delivering with the Bill, that is, an end to oil and gas exploration and new licences.  We said at the time - it must have been four or five years ago - that we recognised that when the State enters into licence arrangements or agreements with companies or individuals, we honour our commitments.  In other words, we do not reverse engines; ours is a country where the rule of law applies and where the Government is good to its word insofar as it can be.  In those circumstances, I do not believe it is appropriate for us to take a different approach in this area.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Eamon Ryan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2028\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2028&amp;amp;pid=EamonRyanGP&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The reality is that our waters have not been hugely successful for oil and gas exploration.  There have been three or four commercial developments over 40 or 50 years of exploration.  Prior to the removal of allowing any new licences to be issued at the end of 2019, there were approximately 55 authorisations.  By the end of last year, that figure was down to 30.  I expect the decrease to continue because those licences were not likely to be commercial and were speculative in the first place.  It is unlikely that there will be further commercial developments.  I could be proved wrong under an existing licence, no one knows, but there will be no new licences and that is the radical shift and change.<\/p><p>This approach is similar to other countries.  Denmark has entered into a similar proposal.  It has a much larger oil and gas exploration industry and allows a longer wind-down lead time, but it is a similar approach.  Prospecting licences are part of the overall exploration licence, as are ability-to-lease arrangements or other undertakings, but they are not new exploration licences.  We are, effectively, divesting and this is highly significant.  We were one of the first countries to do this.  It is a huge win from an environmental perspective.  It is one of the ways in which Ireland is starting to show leadership.<\/p><p>Nothing should distract from what is, from an environmental perspective, a very good day and story.  Those of us in the political system are now delivering on our commitments and promises.  As for the approach proposed by us when we were in opposition, I tend to follow through in government, which is what we are doing today.  Consequently, I cannot accept the amendments. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070900002#VVV00200","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625819400,"counter":259,"content":"<p>I hate to detract from a very good story but the Bill allows for the granting of petroleum prospecting licences under sections 20(2), 20(3) and 20(4) and for the granting of petroleum leases under sections 20(3) and 20(4).  These provisions do not exist in the principal Act and are not existing commitments.  They provide for situations where the State can grant new things if there has been previous engagement.  Section 20(6) refers to existing commitments but sections 20(2), 20(3) and 20(4) are about granting new things.  Let us be clear, there is provisions for the granting of new licences, and this is very unfortunate.  It is also unfortunate that the Minister has not taken on board any of my safety nets or caveats.  The simple thing to say would be that we will not allow something that works against the climate Bill.  Why not say that?  That is regrettable and it is not acceptable.<\/p> <p>When we talk about political responsibility, it is not acceptable to hope that the market, through companies not receiving funding or getting investors, will sort out the problem.  That is not adequate.  We are here to create legislation and find legislative solutions, to do everything we can to create the parameters within which the market works, instead of hoping that the worst does not happen.  Down the line, if investment comes to one of these potential licensing areas and if oil and gas is discovered, will we then say there is nothing we can do because it is under way?  We can do better and we should do better.<\/p> <p>I am conscious the debate is about to end.  The last part of this Bill refers to the Electricity Supply Board.  We are authorising them to borrow &euro;12 billion from the market.  There is no safety net to ensure that there are no expectations construed or potential liabilities for the State.  We do not know what story the Electricity Supply Board will tell those investors and what expectations they, in turn, will have.<\/p> <p>Of course, today is a good day in that we will pass this climate Bill.

This Bill is a key priority for Government and establishes the Land Development Agency, LDA, on a statutory basis.  It sets out the core goals of the LDA to undertake strategic land assembly and to effectively utilise public lands to build affordable homes and sustainable communities.<\/p> <p>A number of amendments were made to the Bill by the D&aacute;il and I take this opportunity to highlight some of them.  Part 9 of the Bill deals with the delivery of affordable housing on relevant public lands by a developer, including the LDA.  It requires the developer of the lands to enter into an agreement with the planning authority to deliver an agreed percentage of affordable housing units for cost-rental or affordable sale, known as a Part 9 agreement.  Significant amendments have been made to Part 9 to align it more closely with the Affordable Housing Bill 2021 as this Bill was drafted prior to the Affordable Housing Bill 2021 being published.  A provision has now been included to ensure that affordable housing delivered on relevant public lands by the LDA or another developer for purchase or cost rental will be provided fully in accordance with the provisions of the Affordable Housing Bill 2021.   <\/p> <p>In summary, there are three options for a developer to deliver affordable housing on public land under this Bill: the housing can be designated and leased as cost rental under Part 3 of the Affordable Housing Bill 2021; the housing can be transferred on completion to a planning authority under Part 2 of the Affordable Housing Bill 2021; and the housing can be transferred on completion to the ownership of relevant applicants as nominated by the local authority under an affordable purchase direct sales agreement under Part 2 of the Affordable Housing Bill 2021.  I consider this to be a more transparent way of delivering affordable housing on relevant public lands. <\/p> <p>The rent for the cost-rental units will be designated in accordance with Part 3 of the Affordable Housing Bill 2021.  Where the units are to be sold as affordable purchase to a local authority, the basis for calculating the cost of the unit, if bought from the LDA by a local authority, is clearly specified in Part 9 of the Land Development Agency Bill 2021.  This approach will also ensure that if any provisions in the Affordable Housing Bill 2021, including its regulations, change in the future they will automatically apply to any developer of relevant public lands, including the LDA, under a Part 9 affordable housing delivery agreement.  <\/p> <p>Part 9 has been also amended to provide for 80% affordable housing on relevant public lands in urban areas with a population greater than 150,000, that is, the cities of Dublin and Cork.  Section 75(4) of the LDA Bill states that there shall be a specified percentage and section 75(11)(a) specifies that this is 80% for population centres over 150,000.  This provision, alongside a further 20% social and affordable housing to be provided under the revised Part V arrangements being introduced in the Affordable Housing Bill 2021, will ensure that there will be 100% affordable and social housing on such lands in our largest cities.  It is a minimum of 50% on public lands in other locations in addition to the 20% Part V.  The Bill, when published, provided that where a local authority is disposing of land to the LDA, the provisions of section 183 of the Local Government Act 2001 would not apply.  This provision in section 58 of the LDA Bill has been amended so that section 183 will not apply where the land has been zoned for housing.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Peter Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2457\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2457&amp;amp;pid=PeterBurke&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is appropriate that section 183 will not apply where the land has been zoned for housing as the local authority has, in effect, designated it as appropriate for housing.  In the case of local authority lands, it remains the position that it is up to the local authority how best to determine how best to deliver housing on their own lands.  Where a local authority wants to dispose of land to the LDA that has not been zoned for housing, the section will continue to apply and the consent of the elected members will be required.  I also want to make it clear that the section remains in place for all other local authority land disposals. <br\/><br\/>The primary role of local authorities as housing authorities will not be altered in any way by this legislation.  The LDA will complement that work by providing services to local authorities, at their request, under section 15 to develop large scale complex sites for housing, including social housing.  In such projects, the land will predominantly remain in local authority ownership.<br\/><br\/>I will now outline the main provisions of the Bill in which there are ten Parts. <br\/><br\/>Part 1 deals and sets out the purposes of the Bill. <br\/><br\/>Section 2 outlines the purposes of the Bill which, in summary, are to increase the supply of housing in the State.<br\/><br\/>Section 4 provides the definition of relevant public lands and relevant public bodies which are key definitions for this legislation.  Relevant public land is all land in a town with a population greater than 10,000 that is owned by a relevant public body.  A relevant public body is a body listed in either Schedule 1 or 2.  This Part also provides that the Minister can issue directions to the LDA regarding the performance of its functions.<br\/><br\/>Part 2 deals with the establishment of the LDA as a designated activity company, DAC, under the Companies Act.  It will also facilitate &euro;1.25 billion in equity investment in the LDA from the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA&rsquo;s, Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF.  This Part also deals with the establishment of the board, appointment of the CEO and staff. <br\/><br\/>Section 14 sets out the functions of the LDA. <br\/><br\/>Section 15 provides that the LDA will provide services to local authorities, when requested by a local authority to assist them in the development of large-scale, multi-tenure sites for housing and urban development in population centres in excess of 30,000.  This will assist with the construction of increased affordable and social housing on local authority-owned sites, including Traveller-specific accommodation and underpins the strong collaborative working which we have seen between the LDA and local authorities to date. <br\/><br\/>Section 16 provides for the appointment of the board of the LDA.  The Public Appointments Service, PAS, <i>Stateboards.ie<\/i>process for the recruitment of the LDA&rsquo;s chair is currently under way. <br\/><br\/>Sections 18 and 19 provide that the LDA will be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts and other committees of the Oireachtas.  <br\/><br\/>Section 21 deals with the staffing of the agency and also provides for the making of a superannuation scheme by the LDA.  <br\/><br\/>Part 3 deals with the funding of the LDA.  The National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014 will be amended to provide for the capitalisation of the agency through an equity investment from the ISIF of up to &euro;1.25 billion.  The LDA will also be able to engage in borrowing up to a limit of &euro;1.25 billion and ministerial consent will be required for LDA borrowing.  The initial shareholding in the LDA will be &euro;100 million, with the Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform holding shares with a value of &euro;99 million and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage holding shares with a value of &euro;1 million.  Part 3 also provides that the LDA will not be able to enter into capital commitments above a certain level without ministerial consent.<br\/><br\/>Part 4 provides that the LDA will be able to form subsidiary DACs for the purposes of carrying out its functions.  These subsidiaries will be subject to the same level of governance and accountability as the LDA parent company and their published accounts will also be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The formation and winding up of such subsidiaries will require the consent of both the Minister and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.<br\/><br\/>Part 5 deals with the dissolution of the existing LDA and the transfer of its functions to the new entity.  <br\/><br\/>Part 6 deals with financial reporting and public accountability of the LDA.  The accounts of the LDA and its subsidiaries will be prepared in accordance with the Companies Act and will be submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  <br\/><br\/>Part 7 deals with the establishment of a public lands register and arrangements for the acquisition of land by bodies to the LDA.<br\/><br\/>Sections 50 and 51 provide that the LDA will establish a register of relevant public lands to identify land in urban population centres in excess of 10,000 that may be suitable for housing.  This register will be publicly available on the agency&rsquo;s website.<br\/><br\/>Section 52 provides that the agency will report periodically to Government on land on the register and will include information on such lands assessed by it to be fit for use for the purposes of this Act.  Under section 54, the Government having considered such a report can direct that land of a Schedule 1 public body can be acquired by the agency.<br\/><br\/>Section 53 provides that where a relevant public body is seeking to dispose of land it must offer it for sale to the LDA in the first instance.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Peter Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2457\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2457&amp;amp;pid=PeterBurke&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Section 55 provides that where the LDA is acquiring land from relevant public bodies under this Part 7, it will be acquired at market value, taking into account the fundamental requirement in respect of the development of houses on public lands under Part 9.  An amendment was made on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il to include a definition of \"market value\", which is an accepted technical definition that is used by persons valuing land including the Valuation Office, which will undertake most valuations of land under this part.  In order for any valuation of land or property to take place there must be an accepted understanding of what market value means.  This definition of \"market value\" already appears in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's Circulars 11\/2015 and 17\/2016.  In effect, this is an affordable land value which in reality will be a minimal price.  I reiterate that when land is being valued under Part 7 it will take into account the proposed use of the land, which will be to deliver significant levels of affordable housing as well as Part V housing.  As stated, this will be 100% social and affordable in Dublin and Cork.<\/p><p>Section 57 provides that where the LDA is acquiring land from a local authority under Part &amp;, the provisions of section 183 of the Local Government Act 2001 will not apply.  As already mentioned, this provision was amended on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il to provide that where a local authority is disposing of land to the LDA that section 183 will not apply only where the land has been zoned for housing.<\/p><p>Part 8 deals with compulsory purchase order, CPO, powers for the LDA.  It is intended that the LDA will primarily purchase private lands for site assembly purposes through agreement with landowners.  Part 8 provides that the LDA will have appropriate CPO powers to purchase ransom strips of land, where required, for the purposes of its public functions.<\/p><p>Part 9 deals with the provision of affordable housing.  Section 75 provides that where a developer, either the LDA or another developer, is developing relevant public lands that there will be a requirement to enter into an agreement with the planning authority to provide a certain percentage of affordable housing on the lands in line with provisions of the Affordable Housing Bill.  Section 77 provides that the Minister may vary the percentage of housing and may also set different percentages for different geographical or administrative areas.<\/p><p>Part 10 deals with amendments to other Acts, including adding the LDA to the list of State bodies empowered to act as development agencies under the Planning Acts.  Part 10 also provides that freedom of information, FOI, will fully apply to the LDA from establishment day and also provides that records held by the dissolved LDA body will continue to be subject to freedom of information requirements.<\/p><p>I look forward to our debate on the Bill's provisions.

The latter has the potential to be a very useful tool in the delivery of large-scale residential projects across the State, particularly in the main urban centres.  Any individual or party that is serious about tackling the supply issues in housing should warmly welcome the establishment of this agency, which will bring significant additionality to the work of local authorities that have been empowered to deliver vast quantities of affordable housing, be it affordable-purchase homes or cost-rental homes through the Affordable Housing Bill.  I use the word \"additionality\" very carefully because it is not a case of replacing the role of local authorities, as some have suggested in the lead-up to this debate.  In fact, the resources the LDA will be able to bring to the table will assist local authorities in master planning and the technical preparation of sites.  In addition, what the Government is doing in terms of the provisions included in the Affordable Housing Bill is empowering local authorities to deliver affordable-purchase homes and cost-rental homes in association with approved housing bodies.  We are going to see those ambitious targets being set out by the Minister in the coming weeks under the new Housing for All plan.<\/p> <p>The LDA must identify a number of additional sites in early course.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator John Cummins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnCummins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We know that the LDA has been working on master planning and developing nine sites in recent years.  What I would like to see the LDA doing in early course is identifying the next 19 sites in urban centres across the country, including in my county of Waterford and especially in the city.  That would signal an intent by the agency to step up the delivery of large-scale units across the country.<\/p><p>I will address some of the main points and provisions in the Bill.  We must examine whether the allocation of &euro;1.25 million and the lending capacity for an additional &euro;1.25 million is sufficient capitalisation for the agency.  The Minister of State might comment on that.<\/p><p>I saw the beta version of the register of relevant public lands on the LDA's website, which is provided for in the Bill.  There is a mapping tool for local authority areas.  The city of Waterford was included.  It will be a very useful tool for all urban populations of more than 10,000 to see where the public land assets lie, with whom and how they can be progressed in early course.  There has been some comment on the CPO powers not going far enough.  I believe negotiation is always the best way of resolving issues but it is appropriate that the LDA has the ability to acquire ransom strips.<\/p><p>I am conscious that I must hand over to my colleague, Senator Kyne, but I wish to briefly refer to market value.  As the Minister of State identified, it is a technical definition as a result of state-aid rules.  What we are looking at here is an affordable land value in terms of transfer which will result in minimal to no cost on a transfer.  People keep referring to market value, but when one considers that 100% of a site in Dublin or Cork will be utilised for social and affordable housing, that will result in minimal to no value.<\/p><p>My final point before I hand over relates to sections 56 and 183.  I welcome the fact that the Bill provides that where a local authority identifies land for recreational purpose, for example, in a development plan that the executive cannot go over and above the councillors to transfer the land.  It only applies in the case of residential land.  That should not be a factor because if councils have land in their armoury that is zoned residential, local authorities will have the resources to be able to develop that.  I will hand over to my colleague.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070900002#GGGG00500","speaker":"1647","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625819400,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I acknowledge the work of all colleagues on the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill in the committee.  I also acknowledge the work done previously by the then Minister, Eoghan Murphy, to establish the LDA as an entity and to put it on a statutory footing.  It is hugely important legislation that effectively acts as a game-changer for strategic lands across the country.<\/p> <p>I can point to my area of Galway and the strategic lands at Sandy Road and the Dyke Road at Galway Port.  The city council is engaging with the LDA on the development of affordable housing in those areas.  They are hugely important, strategic lands at the heart of Galway city within easy commuting distance by walking and cycling.  It is a right and proper use of these strategic lands.  I acknowledge the importance of the LDA to try to move the situation forward, develop master plans and bring the projects through the planning process, which we expect to see next year for both the Dyke Road and Sandy Road, and the appointment of multidisciplinary design teams to prepare these master plans and go for planning permissions.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I certainly hope the planning process through An Bord Plean&aacute;la will not unduly delay these vital projects and people will have the ability to submit their views.

For those outside of the House, it is worth saying that the Land Development Agency is a commercial, State-sponsored body and has been created to co-ordinate land within the State's control for more optimal uses with an appropriate focus on the provision of housing.<\/p> <p>I am particularly delighted that again, even today, I read in the national press that the Land Development Agency is currently seeking procurement and bidders to develop 600 affordable and social homes at Shanganagh Castle.  This is a large tract of land that was sold with the involvement of the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Senator McDowell.  It has lain idle for a long time.  It is an amazing site, on a public transport route beside wonderful amenities, and is one of the sites that are ready to go.  I thank the Minister of State and all those involved for that.<\/p> <p>The Shanganagh Castle site shows, as many of my colleagues on the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage who are present will agree, the good and constructive work that has been done by the executive and members of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and the Land Development Agency, who pulled everything together.  This case shows what can be achieved through dialogue.  Dialogue has not always taken place, however.  We have chief executives in local authorities who do not have the same commitment to engaging.  We all know that.<\/p> <p>I have tabled a number of amendments, which I will deal with next week.  I acknowledge the work of the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, representatives of which appeared before the joint committee and sought our support.  I have committed to supporting the AILG and I will table all of the amendments it has proposed.  Hopefully, we can tease them out next week.<\/p> <p>One of the big issues for the AILG is section 183 of the Local Government Act.  The Minister of State and Senators might ask why the association is so hung up about this section but it is an important one.  What does section 183 do?  It requires the chief executive to prepare a report for the elected members showing if there are any restrictive covenants and historical or other issues concerning sites, and to provide maps and certainty about ownership.  What is important is that this is put to the elected members who can then decide to dispose of a site.  If they fail to dispose of a site or make a decision within a certain time, the chief executive can automatically dispose of it.  The most important point about section 183, however, is that it provides conditionality for the elected members.  I have been involved in many section 183 disposals.  I cannot recall members every opposing one.  We teased them out and had many arguments before attaching certain conditions to them.  That is very important.  There was some debate about conditionality with regard to Shanganagh Castle and interesting legal advice was provided for the members in that regard.  For this reason, I can understand why elected members do not want to see this particular section.<\/p> <p>I wish to speak to the Minister of State about the land aggregation scheme, with which he may be familiar.  Under this scheme, local authority chief executives acquired land at great expense, having decided it would be suitable as a land bank at some time in the future.  We must be very careful when we use the words \"local authority\".  I am talking about the executive of a local authority, not sitting county councillors.  In my local authority, the land acquired did not have water services, electricity or other infrastructure.  Some of it was halfway up a mountain.  Millions of pounds were paid for it.  Members can speculate all they like about the reasons or who owned the land, why it was bought and why public money was used.  It should not have happened.  All local authorities under previous administrations were asked if they would consider sending these lands back into the land aggregation scheme.  The Department rejected most applications to the scheme - why would it want these lands? - and they were, therefore, sent back to the local authorities.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->These local authorities are now paying only interest on these sites.  Many of the problems associated with these sites were because of executives and not elected members.  None of these executives got fired and no one got sacked.  That is common.  A person would be fired in the private sector.  We are now suggesting that we will empower the non-elected executive of these councils to dispose of lands, albeit I take the Minister of State's point that they are zoned residential, without any reference to or veto for the elected representatives.  I do not necessarily believe that is the right way to go.  I would have liked all these disposals to go to a section 183 and where one fails for the Land Development Agency, there would be a third-party arbitration scheme.  We should have insisted that all disposals still go through the section 183 regardless of the LDA and if there is a dispute, it goes to a third-party arbitration appeals process.  That would have been fairer.<br\/><br\/>The Minister of State is committed to empowering local authorities.  He spoke very eloquently recently about the elected mayors.  We will, therefore, take Limerick as an example.  If we have an elected mayor in Limerick next year, that elected mayor will not have any function.  The executive - the men and women in the room next door - will be making decisions unknown or perhaps known to the elected member.  The elected mayor we are empowering in Limerick, however - hopefully, there will be elected mayors all over the country in time - will have no veto on behalf of the people.  If, therefore, we are really empowering local city and county councillors, we must give them that power and function.  Through their representative body, the AILG, they have asked us to put a case forward.  I note that one of the Government Senators has tabled an amendment.  I believe that is really important.<br\/><br\/>Generally, I am supportive of the Land Development Agency.  I believe it is a good agency.  I want to be positive.  Its database and systems, to which Senator Cummins referred, are amazing.  They are wonderful tools, which have shone a light on places we never knew.  We know we have health authority, railway and harbour company lands.  We have lands all over the place.  We have Defence Forces lands in very sensitive locations, which will be challenging but must be looked at.  We have Thornton Hall and lands all over this country and we need to do something about them.  We need to use them constructively with regard to housing.  I would go as far as to say that in time, we will have to look at using the Land Development Agency to secure lands for enterprise and schools.  I see the Land Development Agency being the old - dare I say it - land agent.  It will be the central hub and knowledge of all our lands in this State and at least they will be accounted for.  It will tidy up title and mapping.  We will know who owns the lands and they will feed into our local development plans and country, regional and national plans.  I believe, therefore, that is good.<br\/><br\/>There is an issue with regard to valuation, which I believe we must look at.  We can no longer have Dublin city valuers valuing land for D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  I do not believe the Land Development Agency is about a land grab.  It should focus on the delivery of housing.  The reality is that we need to go back and focus on the delivery of houses.

It reflects the result of the general election in 2020 when people voted for change, and particularly for change in the Government's and State's role in the provision of housing.  The electorate then quite legitimately asked why we have such a housing crisis of supply and affordability when we have so much land; why the State is not providing affordable homes; why local authorities are not empowered to deliver affordable homes; and why they are not providing affordable homes both to purchase and rent.<\/p> <p>I am delighted to say the Affordable Housing Bill 2021 passed in the D&aacute;il yesterday with cross-party support, albeit that the Social Democrats and a small minority of others for some reason did not support the provision of affordable housing by the State.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mary Fitzpatrick:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MaryFitzpatrick&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I commend all the other parties and Independents who supported the Affordable Housing Bill, which is the most comprehensive affordable housing Bill in the history of the State.  The Land Development Agency will be put on a statutory footing once this Bill is passed and it will be charged with assembling and managing productively all State-owned lands.  As others have said, the database it has been compiling is impressive.  It exposes the extent of available lands to the State that are not in productive use for the provision of affordable housing.  We are determined to reverse that situation.  We will reverse it through the Affordable Housing Bill and the Land Development Agency Bill.  I very much welcome the commitment to 100% public housing on the public lands that are being identified as being suitable for housing in Dublin and Cork and a minimum of 70% social and affordable housing in every other location.  That is important.  It was not good enough for us to give the local authorities the power to deliver affordable homes to purchase and rent alone.  We need to support them by ensuring any of the available lands have a designation for affordability and for public housing.  <\/p><p>The fact that the Land Development Agency initially will have &euro;1.25 billion of capital gives it a good working capital base and there is the potential to increase that up to &euro;2.5 billion.  Senator Cummins has already mentioned that scale is important.  There are nine sites and 4,000 houses already in train, which is welcome, but we need housing on massive scale and housing on a significant scale within the next 12 to 24 months and beyond.  <\/p><p>It is welcome the Land Development Agency is being set up as a development agency.  I have seen in my constituency the way a development agency such as the Grangegorman Development Agency was able to assemble lands.  In that instance, it was HSE lands and city council lands and it is now a world-class leading university campus.  The Land Development Agency as a development agency will have similar powers but, critically, it will not have planning powers.  That is important also.  We have spoken about the powers of elected members to our local authorities.  We have also spoken a great deal about the powers we are giving them under the planning and development Bill to control the making of their development plans.  In their development plans they get to determine what lands are zoned for housing, recreational, industrial and other uses.  Our local authority members are those who are closest to their communities.  They are the people who understand best what their community needs in terms of housing.  It is the local authorities, if we are all honest about it, that have the tradition of providing housing not only for those who need it most but for their own communities.  It is important that under the development plans, our local authority members will determine how lands will be used in each local authority area.  This legislation will then further determine other State-owned lands as held by the Departments of Defence, Education or Justice and will ensure that in Dublin and Cork, it will be 100% social and affordable housing.  The development agency, as has been demonstrated in Shanganagh, will work to support local authorities where they have designated and zoned their own lands for housing and will provide them with expertise and capacity, which is important.  I speak as a former local authority member who has been greatly frustrated by the fact that local authorities were not previously empowered to deliver affordable housing.  Now that they will have the power to deliver affordable purchase and cost rental housing, our elected local authority members are both ambitious and capable of delivering for their communities.  I believe this agency can help them.<\/p><p>I want to refer specifically to section 183.  The president of the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, Mary Hoade, made a comprehensive presentation to the Oireachtas joint committee.  That association demonstrated how close its members are to their communities.  They argued strongly for the removal of section 183.  We have all spoken to the Minister of State and I know all my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues have spoken to him and to the Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, on this issue.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mary Fitzpatrick:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MaryFitzpatrick&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It remains a significant point of contention for us.  We accept section 183 is only being removed when it comes to lands zoned for housing and that it will not apply to every other piece of land designated and zoned in a development plan.  We strongly believe, and want to see it in the legislation or in the regulations, that if lands are transferred without applying section 183, a timescale should be put on the Land Development Agency to deliver housing on those lands.  That is the only reasonable approach.  It is the only acceptable approach for our local authority members.  I ask the Minister of State to come back to me on that point.  <\/p><p>We support the Land Development Agency.  It has significant potential.  It will be accountable to the Oireachtas and its committees and to the Minister of State and the Government.  It has adequate funding to commence with but we want there to be scaling up of development and for the agency to be ambitious.  We want to ensure our local authority members are supported and resourced in order that they can use the Affordable Housing Bill and the Land Development Agency's capacity to deliver in every local authority around the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070900002#KKKK00200","speaker":"1656","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625819400,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House again.  He must be sick of looking at us.  Between the Minister and all the Ministers of State with responsibility for the housing sector, he has been in the House a great deal as we approach the end of term.<\/p> <p>I am supportive, in principle, of the Land Development Agency Bill before the Seanad.  The Bill was initiated in the D&aacute;il but, in practice, the Government did not accept amendments to the Bill from the Opposition on Committee Stage and was not prepared to work with us on them.  Unfortunately, our party will be voting against the Bill on Second Stage in the same way as we voted against it, in its eventuality, in the D&aacute;il.  <\/p> <p>We all accept the Land Development Agency is to use public land, effectively, to get houses built.  We are fully supportive of the concept of a development plan to develop public housing on public land.  It has been our party&rsquo;s policy for a very long time.  If the Land Development Agency works as it should, and works as a true State-run public developer, it should supply public housing on public land and create a long-term secure mechanism for proactive management of the State&rsquo;s land to solve the housing crisis, both today and into the future, and deliver social and affordable housing.<\/p> <p>I am encouraged by some of the amendments accepted by the Government in terms of the delivery of public housing on public land but it is very limited in terms of the population centres to which it will apply.  For example, it will not apply to Limerick which has a severe social housing crisis.  An aspect that concerns me is the amount of the Bill that will be included in regulation and that it will be left up to the Minister.  For something of this significance, the principles under which it operates must be copper-fastened in legislation.  While I might be encouraged in some respects by some of the movement that has happened, we do not know who will be in ministerial office in the next Government or in ten or 15 years' time.  There is a danger in the long term that public land could be sold off and used for private developers.  <\/p> <p>I want to touch on the issue of affordability.  A fundamental flaw in the Bill, and it is perhaps even more of a fundamental flaw than with respect to the Affordable Housing Bill, is linking of what is affordable and affordability.  Specifically in this Bill, what will be provided will be linked to market rates.  I am specifically referring to the land that will be available at or below market rates.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Rebecca Moynihan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RebeccaMoynihan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->An affordable home should be affordable to buy or to rent and what a person pays should amount to about one third of his or her income.  The concept and definition of affordability and how that will work in the context of public land should be enshrined in the Bill and this should have been done in tandem with the Affordable Housing Bill 2021.  I worry that the LDA could end up as a mechanism for the privatisation of large tranches of public land, with windfall profits for agents, while delivering the bare minimum of 50% and a welcome 20% of social housing.  I again acknowledge that the Government has moved in that regard.  The arguments I am making, however, are not just for how the LDA is going to be in the short term, but how such a body will be structured in the long term.<\/p><p>This Bill addresses the idea of market value in that section 53 provides that where there is a dispute, the Minister should prescribe the manner in which the market value of the relevant public land should be determined.  Under section 76, housing pursuant to section 73 must be below the prevailing market price or rent, but, equally, it fails to make any provision for how far below the market price or rent the cost of the housing should be.  We must provide for these aspects now and not allow the door to be opened for manipulation in respect of true affordability and value.  Again, that is an element which worries me.<\/p><p>I welcome an approach such as that taken by the Minister in the Affordable Housing Bill 2021, where he specified the parameters of affordability.  It is being delivered on in places like Lusk, for example.  It is a concern, however, that this might not always be the case.  We also then see certain developers arguing that the 10% affordable stipulation be provided in respect of &euro;600,000.  Equally, at the Irish Glass Bottle site, affordability is going to be in the region of &euro;450,000.  That is why it is so important that we define \"affordability\" in the Bill in the context of land and for the housing that will eventually be available, tie such aspects to changes in people's incomes and find a mechanism for doing that.<\/p><p>Under the Bill before us, the Minister will have an astounding amount of power regarding the determination of the prices of land and affordable housing.  We must have some control over the power the Minister has to potentially transfer land of significant value from public to private ownership.  I am also concerned about the LDA's lack of accountability.  This Bill explicitly removes the role of local authorities in examining and scrutinising deals involving land acquisition from local councils, as set out in section 183 of the Local Government Act 2001.  However, I welcome the clarification that this change does not involve land which has been zoned for housing.<\/p><p>Those of us who have been members of local authorities understand the significance that the power of section 183 has for local authority members.  An example relates to where I was able to use this power in respect of land disposal in my area of Dublin 8 to deliver one of the first parks ever created there and where the management of the local authority wanted to sell the land concerned to developers.  It was going to happen, but I was supported by my colleagues across the council chamber who recognised the need for green spaces to balance the high density of construction in that area.  The members of the local authorities had the power to intervene in such cases.  The park I referred to has been packed during the pandemic because such a green space was badly needed by many people.<\/p><p>The consistent removal of the powers of local councillors is very unfair.  As Senator Fitzpatrick said, we must be able to trust the members of our local authorities because they are as ambitious and as focused on housing as we are and as are the officials in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.<\/p><p>It is, with regret that I will not be supporting this Bill.  I believe in the concept of a State development agency, but we must enshrine affordability and accountability in the Bill and ensure that the Minister does not have too many powers in the context of such a body.  This issue centres on public housing on public land and on delivering affordable housing, not just in the short term but in the long term of the next 50 to 100 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070900002#MMMM00200","speaker":"1672","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625819400,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RoisinGarvey&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is not an easy task trying to deal with housing.  I welcome the Bill.  It is definitely progress.  Housing in Ireland is a complete mess.  On top of the existing crisis, the pandemic has meant it has not been possible to build houses for more than a year, while there are also now issues with accessing materials.  We could spend the whole day playing the blame game but the basic point is that we must deal with housing in some way.<\/p><p>The establishment of the Land Development Agency is progressive and timely.  It would have been great if we had done this 20 years ago, but it is happening now and better late than never.  It was good that all three parties in government agreed on this agency as part of the programme for Government.  We also agreed that it will be covered by the Freedom of Information Act, which is good.  In addition, we agreed that we would try to provide houses at an affordable price and also on the concept of cost rental for the first time in the history of the State.  People talk about affordability, but they forget that is what we are trying to do.  We care as much about affordable housing as does anybody in the Opposition.  It is ridiculous to say otherwise.<\/p><p>The cost-rental model is of great importance.  Over the years, we have put pressure on people to become house owners because of the lack of trust in tenure.  Historically, there has been a major issue with freedom of tenure, which was one of the three F's long ago.  We are only starting with the cost-rental model.  It will set an important precedent in allowing people to become long-term renters and pay the cost of building the house, without a private builder making loads of money.  Renters will pay the cost of the house and have fixed tenure, so they will not have to worry in that regard.  I was one of the stressed out renters who never know how long the contract will last.<\/p><p>This is a positive day.  It is a shame that people cannot see when progress is being made and we cannot have a little space for positivity.  That is what people in Ireland need now.  They must have some faith that we are trying our best here to come up with some solutions.  The Land Development Agency is finally going to properly identify how much public land exists and then decide what to do with it.  For the most part, no private houses will be built on this land.  In two cities, 100% of it will be used for affordable, cost-rental and social housing, and 70% of it will be used for this purpose everywhere else.  That is a huge reason to celebrate today.  It is so frustrating that every time something good happens, there are complaints and questions about why it not this, that or the other and why free houses are not being provided for everybody today.<\/p><p>We must live in the reality of the challenge we face.  For the first time, affordable, social and cost-rental housing will be built on 70% of all public land all over the Twenty-six Counties.  In addition, 100% of all public land in the cities of Dublin and Cork will not be used for private housing but for affordable and cost-rental housing.  Therefore, let us celebrate this Bill, try to make progress and give people hope.  Despite all the challenges we faced during the Covid-19 pandemic, including the lack of houses that were built, which was nobody&rsquo;s fault, we start here today with a positive Bill.  Let us move forward in a positive direction, working together in government and opposition, to finally start solving the housing crisis by having proper cost rental, increased social housing and public land used in a correct way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070900002#NNNN00200","speaker":"1659","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625819400,"counter":288,"content":"<p>This legislation comes to the Seanad having passed all Stages in the D&aacute;il.  I am sure the Bill will pass in this House as well, given the Government's majority and the support coming from some Members of the Opposition.

The answer, instead, is to adequately fund local authorities to build public homes on public land.  The LDA was set up by the former Deputy and Minister, Eoghan Murphy, and has staff, offices, etc.  I urge the Minister to essentially split the LDA into two separate functions.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Fintan Warfield:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2458\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->One would deal with land management and the other would involve an office located in the County and City Management Association, CCMA, that would assist local authorities with the delivery of housing plans.  In our view, there is an urgent need for a non-commercial State agency to have responsibility to ensure the best strategic use of all public lands.  Such an agency should have comprehensive CPO powers, a significant land acquisition budget and the political backing of the Government to transfer land from one Department or agency to another, or to local authorities, so it may be used in the best way.  In particular, the agency should be a driver for increasing the stock of local authority land in every county for public housing delivery.<\/p><p>Rebuilding Ireland committed to establishing a housing delivery office within the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Its purpose was to assist in speeding up the delivery of social housing through assisting councils with their project pipelines.  While the office was established, it was not a success and, at the end of 2019, it was transferred from the Department to the CCMA.  As we are aware, however, it is hampered by the continued existence of the Department's overly bureaucratic four-stage approval process.  We are also aware that the procurement process adds about 18 months to the development time alone for social housing projects.  Moreover, the office does not have enough staff to work with local authorities to meet their housing targets.<\/p><p>Ultimately, we do not need another housing quango; we need local authorities to be adequately funded to deliver social and affordable homes, whereby we provide housing delivered based on local need and local democratic decisions, as outlined by Senator Boyhan.  We have failed to support local authorities to do what they do best, that is, build public housing on public land.  The answer, therefore, is to fund local authorities adequately, not set up a quango to do exactly what we have prevented them from doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070900002#OOOO00200","speaker":"1686","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625819400,"counter":290,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is hearing from everybody that everybody wants public houses on public land.  Like Senator Moynihan, I had wanted a land development agency, or something close to it, for some time but I always believed that, for one to be successful, it would need to be a non-commercial State agency.  The delivery of public housing on public land, as described by Senator Warfield, should be through supporting local authorities and through a non-commercial State entity.  That combination is clear but there is still a fundamental misunderstanding at the core of the Bill, just as there was at the core of Government proposals over the previous term and the term beforehand.  I refer to the fundamental misunderstanding of the relationship between the speculative market and supply.  These are the philosophical points we probably will not have time to cover in our two-hour debate next week.<\/p> <p>Reference has been made to addressing deficiencies in the housing market and the shortage of land where the market is experiencing a systemic housing shortage.  Let us be clear: the market is not simply experiencing a housing shortage; in many cases, the market is driving a systemic housing shortage, and it has been encouraged and facilitated in this regard because market logic dictates that the narrowing of supply drives up prices.  That is a known fact.  We see it right now with vaccines.  Artificial scarcity is being created so vaccines can be sold for more rather than addressing a human need.  This is because the priority of investors is to get the best value.<\/p> <p>Over five or six years, we have had a lot of housing legislation.  It is always offering more.  First, tax breaks were introduced.  There were waivers on capital gains tax in the hope it would encourage supply.  The easiest option was taken, and that often meant commercial property.  Many commercial units are empty under the measure.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We also considered the strategic housing developments and we were told they were the issue and that all that was needed in respect of them was faster planning permission.  More than half of the strategic housing developments that have received planning permission are sitting on it.  There are vacant properties all over this State because a property can be rented out for more if the prices go up.  Those are the market dynamics.  Again, the Bill is trying to place them at the centre.  In fact, they are acting as perverse incentives.  Even the systemic lowering of standards, to which former Minister, Eoghan Murphy, contributed to, in some cases encouraged people to sit on a development because they knew that if they waited for a year or two longer, the standards might go down and more units could be crammed into the same space.  Those are perverse incentives that have been created systemically.<\/p><p>It was, of course, the market that led to the property crash.  Then NAMA again placed the interests of investors centre stage.  That is why there is a commission of investigation examining the relationship between it and investors, particularly regarding the Project Eagle portfolio.  When NAMA had all the housing, it worked with investors.  That is why I will ask the Minister to ensure the new agency will not commence until we have what is promised for September, the long-awaited publication of the final report of the commission of investigation into NAMA.  Let us learn from the previous time we had a State agency with a large portfolio of property.  Let us make sure the mistakes are not being set up to be made again.  Let us wait for the report to inform the detail of how the new Land Development Agency might work. <\/p><p>I am going to highlight three or four key issues, including the role of local authorities.  Others have spoken eloquently about this.  Others, on all sides of the House, have experience of the power and importance of section 183.  As was mentioned, this is not simply associated with housing because it also relates to issues such as accessibility, the needs of the community for whom access is a concern, and matters related to how a development will fit into the fabric and vision of a local area plan or local development plan.  The section is important because local authorities know the balance of housing needs in their area and what is required.  I hope the Minister of State will listen to his colleagues on section 183 because there is a big difference between locations of individual developments and how they fit into the fabric and meet the needs of plans.  I am even thinking of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the particular demographic breakdown and needs in a local area and its local area plan, or, indeed, the connectivity requirements.  There is a lot to be thought about.  I am referring to the intelligence and insight to be had from the section 183 conditions attached to disposals.  The provision is still in the Bill.  It is still a concern.  <\/p><p>If the LDA wants to complement the work of local authorities, it needs to relate to local development plans.  There is concern that many of the new local development plans may be delayed so it is important that if local authorities are in the process of developing a new local development plan, the vision for the next five years be considered.  The agency should not simply work off a previous local development plan when a new and different one may be in process.  That will be important.<\/p><p>On the question of the 80%, there is a concern that it may be varied by the Minister.  It is not a guaranteed 80% because section 77 permits the Minister to vary the percentage unilaterally.  That is a concern.  The 80% is not a proportion of public housing because much of it will be public only for a few moments before it is sold as affordable housing and direct provision accommodation.  Crucially, if it is cost rental, it can be private cost rental.  That is the concern.  Again, the market would be involved and those concerned would be allowed to have cost-rental arrangements, possibly on public land, and get equity returns.  They would take the property out of public ownership.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It becomes a private asset at the end.

I will make a final point on shares, which I think is important.  It is unacceptable that there is provision in the Bill to allow the Ministers to dispose of shares in this company.  They must be held publicly, in trust and in perpetuity, and there should not be any danger that Ministers could choose to effectively privatise the Land Development Agency.  I urge that that be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070900002#PPPP00200","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625819400,"counter":293,"content":"<p>Like Senator Moynihan, I welcome the Minister of State.

We are talking about legislation that will unlock unused public lands for housing, an affordable rental scheme and a council-led affordable purchase scheme.  All of this is combined with the highest social housing budget in the history of the State.  That shows clearly that the Government is strongly committed to addressing the housing issue.<\/p><p>I read with interest the interview published this morning in <i>The Currency <\/i>with Ed Brophy, the recently retired special adviser to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  The interview was conducted by Stephen Kinsella.  He talked about how the incrementalism of Government is often a problem in terms of decisions being taken.  In this case and for this Government, there is clearly a whole-of-government approach to housing.  It is an issue we want to see addressed and the reason my party went into Government.  My party has a strong tradition of wanting to build homes and communities.  Unlike some Opposition parties, we support the aspiration of an individual to own his or her own home.  That continues to be important.<\/p><p>Senator Higgins's criticisms reminded me of the phrase once ascribed to Garret FitzGerald: &quot;That's fine in practice, but will it work in theory?&quot;  Too often, there is an obsession around ideology.  Our obsession in this House should be about mechanisms to ensure we combine the best of the public and private sectors to deliver homes and communities.<\/p><p>I say to Senator Warfield that we all want to see public homes build on public lands but the best thing the Senator can do is encourage his Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues on local councils, including most recently in Bray, to stop opposing the building of social housing.  It is another example of ideological talk in these Chambers and failure to deliver on local authorities across the country.  I agree with Senator Moynihan about trusting our local councillors.  I trust them.  I know that Government, particularly Fianna F&aacute;il, councillors want to see homes built.  We are working in government to put in place the mechanisms, including through the Land Development Agency Bill, for this to happen.  Our councillors at local level are voting to provide it.  We are not being hypocrites in this regard.<\/p><p>There are a couple of things the Minister of State might consider during the course of the legislation.  The membership of the board of the agency and knowledge of the type of individuals that go on the board is dealt with in section 16(6).  The Minister of State might consider adding the word &quot;design&quot;, so it is not just the knowledge of construction, the market and so on but also of design.  Part of the problem we often have in large-scale development of housing is a lack of emphasis on design.  Senator Moynihan is right that we are not just designing housing but communities.  Frequently, when we see trouble arise in estates, it is because of poor design at the start.  As the Land Development Agency starts to grow, I would love to see it have an experienced team of architects to advise local authorities and so on.  We need a clear design function on it.  I welcome the commitment to investing in research in that area.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Malcolm Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There are clear mechanisms.

Such an arrangement exists in other areas, including, as Senator Warfield and I know, with regard to appointments to the board of RT&Eacute; and BAI.  That is done through the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media.  We could consider looking at a number of appointments to the board coming through the Oireachtas committee.  I commend the legislation.  It is part of an overall package of work the Government is committed to bringing forward.  I ask the Minister of State to consider that greater emphasis be placed on the design of these estates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070900002#RRRR00200","speaker":"1638","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625819400,"counter":295,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Senator Buttimer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070900002#SSSS00200","speaker":"1636"},{"type":"speech","time":1625819400,"counter":296,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

We have a lot of State control in the country.  Too much State control, in my view, is not a good thing.  We have seen where NAMA failed miserably.  It was the biggest land development agency in the world and it failed to deliver housing in this country.  The whole NAMA situation is shameful.  When it was set up, the late Brian Lenihan said there should be 25,000 units per year.  That was not delivered.  NAMA had the land and, in many cases, the houses, but it failed to deliver and failed the people.<\/p> <p>I have a fear in relation to where local authorities request assistance from the Land Development Agency.  We have seen this time after time when the local authority contacts the Department looking for assistance and nothing happens.  It is fobbed off.  In this case, the local authority in towns with populations of more than 30,000 can request the assistance of the Land Development Agency.  It can look for assistance in design, money and everything to provide housing and to go into joint ventures.  It will not have enough money to satisfy every town.  We will be on the merry-go-round again, like with water services and sewerage.  You are waiting and waiting and then you are fobbed off.  Will the Minister of State make it clear that there will be an open, transparent structure in place and the local authorities will know exactly how long they will have to wait for the assistance and the money?  Other than that, I welcome the Bill.  I ask that the cost of the Land Development Agency be taken account in relation to unit costing so it is not just fobbed off and paid for by the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070900002#SSSS00400","speaker":"1636"},{"type":"speech","time":1625819400,"counter":298,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.

I broadly support this Bill, as I did the recent Affordable Housing Bill.  As I said then, the scale of the housing problem is such that the Oireachtas should be willing to make serious direct interventions to tackle it, and to give the Government the benefit of the doubt when it seeks to do so.<\/p> <p>The Bill establishes the Land Development Agency as a commercial State entity.  Its objective will be to assemble land for development and to utilise State and public lands properly, and, using that land, to implement the affordable purchase and cost-rental schemes envisaged under the Affordable Housing Bill.  I support all of these aims. <\/p> <p>This Bill has proved controversial, not least among city and county councils and councillors themselves.  Legitimate concerns have been expressed that it represents a further erosion of local democracy, taking reserved functions out of the hands of councillors.  There are also concerns about the accountability and transparency of how the agency will operate, and whether oversight by the Ministers with responsibility for housing and public expenditure is sufficient.  In a way, these concerns mirror those expressed at the time of the establishment of NAMA in 2009, another agency that was taking major decisions in the public interest, albeit on an infinitely larger scale. <\/p> <p>I share all of these concerns.  What we need is more local democracy and more decisions made locally in the communities affected by them but the reality is that many councils have repeatedly failed to address adequately the housing problem in their functional areas.  The failings of Dublin City Council in this regard are nothing short of appalling for the local authority of a modern European city.  That council seems to spend most of its time debating whether to display the Palestinian flag, or vanity projects such as the white-water rafting white elephant, or pie in the sky issues such as a four-day working week for its staff, which was the latest flight of fancy discussed at its meeting this week.  This is what is on the agenda of an elected local authority of a city that cannot adequately house its own population.  Can we blame central government for intervening?<\/p> <p>There are two primary reasons for the failures of local authorities in recent years.  I say this with fraternal affection for my colleague, Senator Warfield.  One reason is the deliberate obstruction of large-density housing projects by the Sinn F&eacute;in party.  The party says that it is not doing so deliberately and cites what it says are legitimate objections each time.  However, the reality is that no matter what the project, Sinn F&eacute;in councillors always manage to find reasons to oppose it.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The developments are either too large or too small, or they do not have enough social housing, or they are the wrong mix, or there are objections to the use of publicly-owned land by private developers, and so on <i>ad infinitum<\/i>.  Even Goldilocks found a bowl of porridge to suit her eventually.  It is impossible to accept that these are genuine objections and not part of a deliberate and concerted strategy to prolong the housing crisis for political gain.  I have a funny feeling that if Sinn F&eacute;in were elected to government in the near future, new orders will be issued - and many new orders I might worry about - to its councillors by the armchair generals, and we would see a sudden increase in the number of developments being approved.<br\/><br\/>The greatest reason for the dysfunction of local government are the so-called reforms of the system rammed through by the Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition in 2014.  The amusingly-titled Putting People First plan, implemented in the Local Government Reform Act 2014, slashed and burned town councils, reduced the number of local representatives and rebranded city and county managers as chief executives.  The net effect was to continue the centralisation of power in unelected management and to continue the paralysis in decision-making.  Having failed to improve the effectiveness of local government in the last attempt, these problems will just not be solved in the short term.  While I accept the concerns raised by councillors about the lack of oversight and the usurpation of their powers, the nature of the housing shortage is such that we urgently need to take bold steps and soon. <br\/><br\/>As the Bill aims to increase the availability of land for housing, I want to raise an issue I have raised several times in recent weeks, namely, the vacant site levy.  I have submitted an amendment to the Bill for Committee Stage and I pressed a similar amendment during Report Stage of the Affordable Housing Bill.  The vacant site levy is not working.  It is not generating any revenue worth talking about for councils and nor is it freeing up land for development.  Meanwhile, there are many vacant sites that are not being registered or levied because the rules on what qualifies as a vacant site are so complicated and vague, leading some councils to not even try to implement it.<br\/><br\/>The Minister has a lot to think about these days so I will just remind him that what I have been proposing is that we simplify the operation of the levy by introducing an element of self-assessment, placing an onus on landowners to register their own sites, and by bringing within the definition of a vacant site properties on which planning permission for the development of multiple residential units had been granted but where development has not commenced.  This would help get a more effective vacant site levy.  It would help lead to more sites being developed.  This is the kind of proposal that could have broad cross-party support.  I acknowledge that on Report Stage of the Affordable Housing Bill in this House, the Minister of State said a wider review of the levy is under way and he assured me that proposals such as that which I put forward would form part of that review and I welcomed it.  I intend to keep the issue on the agenda, however.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070900002#TTTT00600","speaker":"1673","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625819400,"counter":306,"content":"<p>Before I begin to speak on the Land Development Agency, I want to say that I agree with Senator Mullen on the vacant site levy.  At this stage, we all agree it is not fit for purpose.  How it is applied in the various local authorities differs and there is no consistency.  It does not do what it was intended to do.<\/p> <p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on Second Stage of the Bill and I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Having served on the housing committee in the previous D&aacute;il I was there when the heads of the first Land Development Agency Bill came before us.  At that time, I had serious reservations about the Bill and how it was formed.  What was presented originally in the Bill was completely different to what we saw on Committee Stage in 2019.  In fairness to everybody involved in the legislation, they have listened to what Members have said until this point.  What is before us now is significantly different to what was laid before the House initially.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State mentioned the phrase \"market value\" and the Opposition love to hang onto such phrases.  The Minister of State gave a fair description of how it is working out.  While it might start at market value, the obligations in delivering affordable housing, cost rental housing and social housing will have a huge impact on land.  I am glad to see the legislative provisions on this have been changed.<\/p> <p>Another element is public land for public housing.  In fairness, the Minister of State has more or less delivered on this, particularly in Dublin and Cork where it is now 80%, with 20% under Part V.  It is now delivering 100% public housing on public land.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Pat Casey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2431\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2431&amp;amp;pid=PatCasey&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We also need to give things time to work and to see whether they work out.  As I pointed out through amendments a while ago, we need private housing in some localities.  We need that mix in communities and to get the right balance.  Building 100% public housing on public lands is not always the best option.  We sometimes need to have a mix.  <\/p><p>I will move on to section 183 of the Local Government Act 2001, which my colleagues have all mentioned.  We are all on the one page in this regard.  I acknowledge and recognise the work done in this regard and the amendments that have been made.  The provision now only relates to land zoned for housing.  While I encourage the Minister of State to see if a bit more could be done for local authorities in this regard and to see if it can be pushed out a bit more, I understand why the provision is needed, as my colleague referred to earlier on.  As a Senator from Wicklow who was a Deputy for Wicklow in the previous D&aacute;il and who has served on the local authority in Wicklow for 12 years, I know that when something lands on one's desk in one's own county, one understands it better.  What happened in Wicklow on Tuesday night and how Sinn F&eacute;in voted in Bray shows nothing other than hypocrisy of the worst kind.  I am sick and tired of listening to Deputy Brady's megaphone politics.  On Tuesday night, his two councillors voted against 18 social housing units on public land.  Sinn F&eacute;in does not want social housing on public land.  The hypocrisy in which Sinn F&eacute;in engages time and again must stop.  I have served with Deputy &Oacute; Broin on the housing committee and, while I have respect for him, the hypocrisy of the Sinn F&eacute;in Party must be called out for once and for all.<\/p><p>The Land Development Agency Bill 2021 represents another avenue to deliver housing and must be welcomed.  It is now a matter of multiple choice.  Housing may be provided through the local authority, approved housing bodies or the LDA.  We have multiple avenues through which to deliver affordable, social and cost-rental homes.  I have concerns about the legislation.  I always will and always should because we should always question legislation that comes before us.  In my own business, I sometimes have to say that things are not working out.  We have had to amend this legislation since it was originally launched.  If we can keep the legislation under review, we can identify aspects that are working and others that are not.  We should not be afraid to come back and change the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070900002#UUUU00200","speaker":"1640","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625819400,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I will share my time with Senator Ward.  The Minister of State is very welcome to the House.  I am very supportive of this Bill, which puts the LDA on a statutory footing.  It is good news, especially for Dublin.  There are two principles that are central to tackling the housing crisis, and we are working on them.  These are accessibility, whether through affordability measures or social support, and stock and supply.  We will not have a healthy housing system without both.  They are inextricably linked.  The Land Development Agency Bill 2021 and the Affordable Housing Bill 2021 will provide a significant framework and step change.  The Land Development Agency is about scale and supply and unlocking State land to build affordable homes and sustainable communities.  It is an agency which will develop significant housing developments on lands owned by the State.  Increasing the supply of homes will have a knock-on effect on affordability and increasing the supply of sites will reduce the cost of housing.<\/p> <p>There are two stories in housing.  There is one where councillors continuously vote against housing projects based on catchy sound bites masquerading as ideology and another where bids to build 600 social and affordable homes in Shankill are being sought by the LDA in partnership with the local authority.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Emer Currie:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EmerCurrie&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Some 200 of these homes are to be social housing, 91 are to be sold to low and middle-income workers under the forthcoming affordability scheme and 206 are to be cost-rental units.

It is really reassuring to hear that this kind of project is going to be scaled up.  It is not about building disaffection but about building homes. <\/p><p>I completely agree that the LDA has to work alongside and complement local authorities and local authority members.  Nobody knows their area better than councillors.  It would be welcome to allow them as much input as they can give.  I believe in the importance of local county development plans, which are crafted by and consented to by local authorities, and that we should learn from the mistakes made in respect of strategic housing developments, which circumvented those plans.  I welcome the Minister of State's reassurances with regard to section 183 to the effect that existing zoning will be respected.  With regard to flexibility, it is great news that while developments in Dublin will be 100% social and affordable housing, including the 20% under Part V, the model in general requires a minimum of 50% plus 20%.

I will touch on just a few points.  With regard to section 51(1), which I believe was section 48 in the original Bill before being amended in the D&aacute;il, I pay tribute to the Minister of State and the Department.  I wrote to the Department and to the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, on this matter.  It was initially proposed that local authority members would have to give every possible assistance to the Land Development Agency, which was deeply inappropriate.  I note that the Government put down an amendment in the D&aacute;il in this regard, which was a welcome reaction to the objections of many councillors around the country.  In my own area of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, Councillor Jim Gildea has done an enormous amount of work during the term of this council and the last council to promote the development of the lands at Shanganagh in the Shankill area to provide for a whole range of different housing models.  He has been in touch with me about this, as have other councillors in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  I very much welcome the reaction to the representations made on that issue.  I welcome the change to what is now section 51.<\/p> <p>I agree with those other Members who have talked about the general reduction in the powers of local authority members.  That is regrettable.  It has not only arisen under this Government or the last Government but goes back to the passing of planning and development legislation in 2000.  We have successively stripped away powers from councillors, the people who make decisions that are informed at a local level.  The executive of the council is never going to knock on a constituent's door to ask what he or she thinks about something but councillors do that all the time.  There is a failure to recognise the important value they bring to the process and the role that they have.  In that regard, I have misgivings about section 58, which deals with section 183 of the Local Government Act 2001.  I heard what Senator Cummins said about this earlier and Senator Currie has just raised the same issue.  I wonder about the wisdom of stripping from councillors the power to decide on the disposal of land.  However, I also recognise, as I said earlier, that this has now been limited.

I fully agree with most of the comments made by the Government side.  I again bring people's attention to section 183 and the good way we in which can engage with local authority members and take their knowledge into account.  They are not going to run amok.  They know well what needs to be done here and they will make a very valuable contribution.  We should keep that in mind at all costs.<\/p><p>The Affordable Housing Bill went through the D&aacute;il last night.  That was a very important decision.  Now we are dealing with the Land Development Agency Bill.  I can say with full confidence that we will see a major change in how housing is developed in the months and years ahead.  Many people who have struggled, and are struggling, with high rents will be able to afford a house because of everything the Government is doing.  I am not saying that everything that comes from the Opposition is negative and critical, but much of it is.  Let me make this quite clear.  Many people and politicians are investing much time and are doing a lot of work on this, in all the Government parties.  Our party meets about this issue constantly and puts in hours upon hours late at night when nobody knows about it.  That is being led by Senators Fitzpatrick, Casey and others.  I am sure other parties are doing the same thing.<\/p><p>We have to solve the issue of housing.  We think of it as a problem in the major cities but as Senator Dolan will know, in rural areas such as Ballinasloe and parts of Roscommon houses that were available for rent at &euro;600 or &euro;700 per month have gone up to &euro;1,200 or &euro;1,400.  The Minister of State will know that from his own part of the country as well.  It makes perfect sense to bring in schemes, such as those that will now come in under the Affordable Housing Bill, that will put people in houses where their mortgage payments will be far less than they would have paid in rent.  I am confident for the future.  We are on the right track and we have to have a little patience for this to work.  Maybe some members of the Opposition are scared that we are on the right track, that we are going to make progress and solve this.  We have two major issues in Ireland at the moment: Covid and housing.  I expect that all politicians, no matter what side of the House they are on, would take into account the two crises with which we are dealing.  Of course everybody's point of view is very important but we should not be obstructing progress that needs to be made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070900002#WWWW00400","speaker":"1674","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625819400,"counter":314,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Senator Seery Kearney.

I welcome the clarity the Minister of State has given on section 183.  He has stated very clearly that it will only not apply where land has been zoned for housing.  In other words, the only place it would not be implemented is in county development plans where the local authorities have indicated that the land is there for housing.  Senator Murphy referred to certain areas of Roscommon and east Galway where we do not have large urban centres - at least not yet.  Hopefully we will soon but many of our centres have populations of under 10,000.  How can we capture the tracts of land in our areas on the public land register?  I am thinking in particular of lands owned by the HSE.  We have an awful lot of land from Bord na M&oacute;na as well but that is probably not as suitable for housing, although it is suitable for many other things.  As far as I am aware, the ESRI maps on the website show State-owned lands.  Will the public land register reflect the ESRI maps and areas outside those large urban centres?  What resources could the Government offer to support local authorities?  For example, Galway County Council is the second lowest funded council in the country.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has indicated that supports will be offered in the form of project teams for the directors of housing within local authorities.  How will the LDA be able to support county councils where there are not urban centres over 10,000 with resources?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070900002#XXXX00200","speaker":"1654","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625819400,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

Much has been said here today, as well as in the D&aacute;il.  I have read over the debate on this Bill in the D&aacute;il and I have no doubt that during Committee and Report Stages in this House much will be said to create misinformation, spin and nice little sound bites to be posted on social media about the LDA, which will not do anything to advance real people getting into real houses.  The Government is working together and ensuring people have affordable and social housing in the two great pieces of legislation that are going through the House, namely, the Affordable Housing Bill, which was passed last night, and this Bill.<\/p> <p>This Bill is a game changer.  I am very proud that this agency was born under a Fine Gael Minister, who brought this idea forward.  We are now putting it on a statutory footing.  A little bit of spin goes on in that regard as well.  I am terribly fond of Senator Fitzpatrick but to use the Jim Mitchell version of the famous phrase, if you keep telling lies about us one of these days we will start telling the truth about you.  There are cost-rental initiatives here that are now coming into fruition, as we said they would.  I am very proud of them.  I am very anxious that they come to fruition, especially in my home area of Dublin South-Central, where there are tracts of land in Cherry Orchard, Bluebell and the CIE works.  There are tracts of land there about which there have been plans for years but they have not come to fruition until now.  The pressure and structure of the LDA is going to allow that to happen.  The combination of the Affordable Housing Bill and the Land Development Agency Bill will bring those projects to fruition.  It is important that happens with a sense of urgency.  The fact that Senators comment on how frequently both the Minister of State and the Minister appear in this House is a testament to that urgency and the commitment of the Government to ensuring that real people are in real houses.  The pilot cost-rental scheme in Emmet Road is going to hit the ground running very soon.  We have so many initiatives that are not about spouting ideology, voting against housing or setting up cynical websites like LDA Watch, which promotes press releases from political organisations opposed to housing.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is not that cynical an obstruction and delay.

Section 13 sets out the functions of the LDA, which are to develop and manage relevant public land and, thereafter, other lands for \"the provision of housing for the public good\".  It is acknowledged that there is a shortage of new housing being developed and, in particular, housing that is affordable in certain areas.  There is a requirement in this Bill that a proportion of any housing provided on public land and former relevant public land be made available for affordable housing by the agency and other agencies that may require such land.  This Bill will increase the supply of affordable and social housing by establishing the LDA as a publicly owned commercial State body that will be accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas through the Committee of Public Accounts, as stated in section 17.  I agree with Senator Byrne's proposals regarding nominations to the LDA coming through the joint Oireachtas committee.  That is a very positive proposal.<\/p> <p>The Government is assigning the LDA a key role in the delivery of housing, while also assisting local authorities by developing on public lands not used heretofore.  The Bill comes about on foot of a commitment in the programme for Government, which prioritises health, housing and climate action as the three key pillars of our coalition.  The climate action Bill went through earlier today and the Affordable Housing Bill was signed last night.  I concur with Senator Seery Kearney in remembering former Deputy Eoghan Murphy, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government who introduced the Land Development Agency Bill a number of years ago.  It is a very simple concept that has been complicated by the Opposition because, unlike Government, it does not want the housing situation resolved because that will take away the opportunity for the usual sound bites about vulture funds, developers, etc.<\/p> <p>If you have a problem with your teeth, you go to a dentist and if you want a wardrobe in your house, you go to a carpenter.  To get your car fixed, you go to a mechanic.  Developers build housing and infrastructure that is needed.  It is their profession and career and what they have experience in doing.  Nine sites have been opened up or are on the way, and 4,000 houses are currently on track with more to come.  It is important that we create sustainable and well-planned communities and that the focus is not on high-density development but on building homes in such communities that will have sufficient open, public amenity spaces and are close to all public services, be they education, health or transport.<\/p> <p>I share the views expressed regarding NAMA, which was not a success.  We saw situations a number of years back where houses were demolished and, indeed, housing stock disposed of at cheap sale prices.  I also believe that any decision we make must be made in conjunction with those who operate on the ground and who know best, namely, elected representatives in local authorities throughout the country.  They are the voice of the people and are elected by the people.  Any decisions that are made, must be made in conjunction with members of local authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021070900002#ZZZZ00200","speaker":"1639"},{"type":"speech","time":1625819400,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I thank all the Senators for their contributions.  At the heart of the role of the LDA is ensuring that we make a step change in how we manage State lands and take a long term strategic land management approach to provide a more sustainable approach to housing delivery at affordable levels.  This is part of a wider suite of measures the Government is implementing as part of its housing for all mission to improve overall supply and bring forward new initiatives on affordable housing.<\/p><p>From listening to the debate, it is apparent that there is major consensus across all sides of the House that we should ensure public lands not required for other purposes should be used for housing.  I want to be clear that the decisions the Government will make on transferring public lands to the LDA will apply to those lands already in the ownership of the State.  This is clearly what is set out in Part 7.This will be a very transparent process as details of public lands will be available on the register on the LDA website and the reports to Government by the LDA will also be published.<\/p><p>In the case of local authority lands<b>,<\/b>it remains the position that it is up to local authorities to determine how best to deliver housing on their lands.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Peter Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2457\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2457&amp;amp;pid=PeterBurke&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Under section 15 of the LDA Bill, local authorities can request the assistance of the Land Development Agency to manage the development of large-scale complex sites and the LDA will generally be required, by statute, to give assistance in this regard.  A number of people have raised concerns about section 183 in that process and I hear them fully.  I am firmly of the belief that local authority members should have maximum power.  In my role as Minister of State with responsibility for local government, every day I try to give local authority members more power.  It is interesting to note that was not the case in the original Bill, so this is a change that has been made.  I will bring Senators' views back to the Minister in connection with that issue.  On the residential aspect, the Minister has conceded that land zoned as residential is the only aspect where section 183 can be changed.  I will absolutely raise all concerns regarding that with the Minister.<\/p><p>Separately, where local authorities no longer require land for their own purposes, as I mentioned, similar to other public bodies, including commercial bodies, they must give first refusal to the LDA before selling to the market.  It is only in circumstances where land is already zoned for housing that section 183 of the Local Government Act would not apply, as it is moving land from one public body to another to deliver housing.  These provisions support the role of local authority members, allowing them to work in partnership with the LDA to deliver on complex sites.  They will need to be able to avail of a centre of excellence, which will also be developed through the LDA in delivering housing in key urban areas. <\/p><p>The LDA will be a powerful land management agency.  While its immediate focus will be on developing housing on public lands, in the longer term it will assemble strategic land banks from a mix of public and private lands, making these available for housing and bringing essential long-term stability to the Irish housing market.  I also welcome the positive commitments and comments today on the prototype that the LDA's land register already has available on its website.<\/p><p>I will follow up on a few other specific issues.  On the land valuation for public land being sold to the LDA, I want to reiterate that while the LDA will pay for such land, and the price will take into account the proposed use of the land, it will also deliver significant levels of affordable housing in addition to Part V housing.  <\/p><p>Many Senators referenced the affordability requirement in the Bill.  As I said in my opening comments, the Part 9 provision has been amended to ensure that there is 80% affordability on relevant public lands in Cork and Dublin cities.  This, when taken together with Part V housing, will ensure that there will be 100% social and affordable housing on these sites.  The affordability requirement will be set at a minimum of 50% in all other areas, which will be effectively 70%, including Part V.  This housing will not be linked to market rents or market prices, as was referenced by some during the debate, but will be delivered in accordance with the Affordable Housing Bill in relation to the cost rental and affordable housing purchase schemes.<\/p><p>Quite the opposite of the LDA being a vehicle for divestment of public lands to the private sector, the LDA, as a fully State-owned agency, represents a far more active and impactful role for the State in the land development market, including utilising public lands more efficiently.  The LDA is mandated to replenish and assemble land banks, including by way of acquisition from the open market, which means that certain privately held lands may become publicly owned in the future.  It is also important to note that ministerial approval is required under section 57 of the Bill for the LDA and its subsidiaries to sell land.  There is no question of any mass sell-off of public land or housing to be developed on those lands.<\/p><p>The LDA marks an important step for the State in actively managing its own land for the common good.  As has been referenced, we are all about trying to ensure as much public housing on public land, and affordable housing for all our citizens, as possible.  On finances, as has been pointed out, the LDA will receive a cash injection of &euro;1.25 billion and can borrow up to &euro;1.25 billion.  The point about the LDA budget has been well made by some Senators, including Senator Cummins.  We need to be serious about this and put the maximum possible amount the State can afford into the Land Development Agency because it will be a key driver of social and affordable housing in our State.  We need to give it maximum support so it can carry out all its activities in the best interests of all our citizens.<\/p><p>I acknowledge a long-standing Member of the House, Senator Ivana Bacik.
