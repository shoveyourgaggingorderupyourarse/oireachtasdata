The scheme is a key action in the Government's comprehensive action plan for survivors and former residents of the mother and baby and county home institutions.  Following on from the State apology in January 2021, the action plan was developed to demonstrate the State's commitment to recognising and responding to the suffering experienced, and to support survivors who were so badly failed in these institutions.<\/p> <p>  Given the payment scheme's scale, the Government agreed that it should be grounded in statute.  This legislation, therefore, aims to support a user-friendly, one-stop-shop approach for applicants, as well as providing for lawful access to records.<\/p> <p>  I will broadly and briefly set out what is covered by the proposed legislation.  An applicant to the payment scheme is referred to as a \"relevant person\" in the heads of the Bill.  The definition of a \"relevant person\" encompasses a person who was resident as a child or as a mother in one of the institutions listed in schedule 1 of the heads of the Bill.  The scheme will be administered by an executive office established within the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  This arrangement provides the best opportunity to open the scheme to applications as quickly as possible, following the enactment of the legislation.  This is because we can work on setting up the office in parallel with our work on the legislation.  While the office of the chief deciding officer of the mother and baby institutions payment scheme will be part of the Department, the chief deciding officer will be statutorily independent in the performance of her or his functions.  She or he will also have staff.<\/p> <p>  Heads 7 to 10 set out the general duties and powers of the chief deciding officer.  He or she will make determinations on applicants' eligibility to the scheme, in accordance with criteria and processes that are set out later in the legislation.  He or she will also advertise the scheme, prepare an annual report on its operation and have the power to delegate operations to the staff of the executive office to ensure efficient administration of the scheme.<\/p> <p>  A number of the heads between 11 and 24 concern the benefits available under the scheme, as well as the application and determination processes.  The benefits include a general payment, a work-related payment, a form of enhanced medical card or, for those who live outside of Ireland, a once-off health support payment of &euro;3,000 in lieu of the enhanced medical card.<\/p> <p>  It is the intention that payments will be disregarded for the purposes of income tax and means assessments and work is ongoing with the Departments of Health, Finance and Social Protection in this regard.<\/p> <p>  Staff of the executive office will have the power to search the commission&rsquo;s database and related records so that they can assist an applicant in providing relevant information and to verify information.  Staff will also have the authority to request relevant information from the bodies listed in schedule 2 of the heads of the Bill, where relevant.<\/p> <p>  The Department is currently preparing a data processing impact assessment in relation to the processing of personal data and special category personal data under the scheme and has engaged with the Data Protection Commission as required.  The eligibility criteria for each of the scheme's benefits are included in heads 18, 19 and 21.  A general payment may be made to an applicant who was resident as a child in a relevant institution for six months or more, and to an applicant who was resident as a mother in a relevant institution for at least one night.  A work-related payment may be payable to any mother who was in the Tuam institution or a county home for at least three months, as well as to a mother who was resident in another relevant institution for a minimum of three months and who undertook commercial work without pay outside of that institution.  The overarching rates for these payments are set out in schedule 3.<\/p> <p>  Applicants who were resident in a relevant institution for at least six months will be entitled to an enhanced medical card and those who live abroad can choose a health support payment in lieu of the card.<\/p> <p>  Head 22 provides that in order to receive a payment from the scheme, an applicant will be required to sign a waiver.  The waiver would only be signed at the point where the applicant accepts an offer, so he or she will know precisely what they are being offered prior to signing.  The waiver is not attached to the enhanced medical card or the health support payment.<\/p> <p>  A person can apply to the scheme on behalf of a \"relevant person\" where the \"relevant person\" does not have the capacity to apply or has died since the date of the State apology.<\/p> <p>  Heads 25 to 34 provide for a number of other matters related to the administration of the scheme, including rights of review and appeal, support for legal costs, the carrying out of independent reviews of the scheme's operation and the power to add additional institutions to schedule 1.<\/p> <p>  We thank the committee again for the invitation today and we are happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022052400002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Laura McGarrigle"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":7,"content":"<p>Thank you very much Ms McGarrigle.

The mother and baby institutions are a really dark stain on the history of this State.  Listening to the testimonies at the committee of those who were personally affected was heart-wrenching.  I have met a number of survivors and it was absolutely traumatising for me, even though I did not have to go through that experience.  Hearing their personal experiences was absolutely traumatising and it is really a dark stain on our society.<\/p> <p>  The exclusion from this redress scheme of infants who spent less than six months in a mother and baby home and of preventing them from accessing an enhanced medical card tells me that survivors have not been listened to.  This was one of the things survivors called for.  Infants were taken from their mothers, they were stolen and, in some cases, they were shipped overseas.  The Government is effectively telling these children that their forced separation and suffering is not worthy of compensation and telling women that their suffering may only be worth &euro;5,000.  To me, that is an absolute scandal.

In that regard, the importance of access to records and information was noted, particularly as an overriding concern for those who were resident as infants in mother and baby homes for less than six months.  The overwhelming need that has been expressed is for access to records and the real trauma that has been expressed is caused by the denial of access to information from that period in their lives.  The Birth Information and Tracing Bill is the key mechanism to respond to those concerns.  Alongside it, the IDG has noted the paramount importance of the action plan providing for counselling support for every single survivor and former resident in a mother and baby and county home so that counselling support is there for everyone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022052400002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Laura McGarrigle","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Did the Government get any expert opinion from, say, medical experts?

The development of the proposals for the payment scheme was seen as responding to the recognition of those unduly long periods of time spent in the institutions.

In looking at the starting point of the commission's recommendations, the commission made recommendations that recognised these unduly long lengths of stay and the commission had used the phrase \"for example, in excess of six months\" when referring to mothers who had unduly long lengths of stay.  The reference to six months started in the commission's recommendations.  It is important to say that the IDG did not just stick to the commission's recommendations.

It is a long time since I read the report and I did not read it page for page at the time because it was large.

We are taking an arbitrary number from the commission and using it without any sort of assessment of what is considered unduly long or what is considered trauma.<\/p> <p>  We will hear from witnesses in this afternoon's session.  I have explored trauma for a long time.  We know there are different types of trauma.  There is big trauma caused by a one-off event.  That can happen in the space of five minutes, not six months.  There are also little traumas caused by the consistent, everyday chipping away at somebody's sense of safety and what that means in the world.  The idea that it is in any way related to childhood trauma is premised on a shaky bed of accuracy.  Trauma can be caused by a one-off event.  One can witness an accident.  A child could have witnessed violence against her mother in the first month or two of life and heard the mother wailing beside her every night.  There are many things that can happen in a moment that have nothing to do with a point in time.  I struggle with the six months and the designation as unduly long and that type of thing.  It does not make sense when we consider the trauma piece.<\/p> <p>  We know many records have been falsified.

Aligned with that is the idea that a person should be able to rely on qualifying for a payment solely based on residency.

If an unborn child is <i>in utero<\/i>and the mother is in one of those settings, is that period counted?  There is a lot of research that shows there will be effects if a mother is not properly nourished and stressed.  I note that many of the women concerned carried out commercial work without pay.  Another way of putting that would be that they were engaged in slave labour.  If a woman is engaged in slave labour and is pregnant and stressed out, and knows there is going to be a negative outcome, that is going to have serious implications for the development of the child <i>in utero<\/i>.  There is a long-established body of research that shows the negative consequences and outcomes.<\/p><p>Does that period of time apply to children?  Does the legislation include that time or does it start to apply from the date of birth?<br\/><br\/>I wish to echo Deputy Ward's question and hope that Ms McGarrigle will answer this time.  Did the Department or Government use expert advice to address these kinds of questions?  This matter occurs to me as a parent without any qualifications in the area.  In a previous life I was a primary schoolteacher, so I know that a lot of our major software as human beings is installed <i>in utero<\/i>or in the first 72 hours.  If a mother experiences a trauma during that early period, it can have profound and life-altering or life-limiting consequences on the individual.  I think that the six-month cut-off point is arbitrary and idiosyncratic.  Is it based on evidence?  If so, who supplied the evidence?  Will the Department take into account whether the child was there with the mother while she was pregnant?  Will that time be counted?  Finally, what expert inputs were used to arrive at these arbitrary cut-off points? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022052400002#B01600","speaker":"1699","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653346800,"counter":27,"content":"<p>On the question about taking account of the period when the child was <i>in utero<\/i>, the policy proposals that were developed and the general scheme do not provide for that time to be taken into account in terms of the six months, including the period before the birth of the child.<br\/><br\/>On expert advice, the IDG considered whether there was a specific question that it could put to an expert in trauma in order to assist in its deliberations.  At the same time, and it was a point that the IDG considered very carefully as part of its deliberations, the IDG listened to feedback from stakeholders and looked at national and international evidence that talked about a scheme that would be non-adversarial and kind in approach and would not be grounded in people having to relive their trauma and provide evidence of abuse.  All of this caused the IDG to propose very strongly the general payment approach that would provide for a single common experience payment, grounded in the length of stay, as a way of recognising these harsh institutional experiences without requiring people to bring forward evidence of abuse.  The IDG did not look to bring in experts that would speak to individual trauma at the level of designing an individualised approach.  Again, it was very mindful not to disregard in any way the experience of children who were in a mother and baby home for fewer than six months, and instead to recognise counselling support and access to records as key measures that would respond to needs that the IDG understood had been raised as priority needs in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022052400002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Laura McGarrigle"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":28,"content":"<p>May I respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022052400002#C00300","speaker":"1699"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Time is tight but I may let the Senator back in after Deputy Murnane O'Connor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022052400002#C00400","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":30,"content":"<p>Please forgive me for asking but this is my first time to be a member of a committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022052400002#C00500","speaker":"1699"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":31,"content":"<p>The Senator is very good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022052400002#C00600","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":32,"content":"<p>My concerns are the same as previous speakers.  We must remember that this process has been very painful for survivors.  I feel strongly about the fact that  survivors are getting older, so timing is of the utmost importance.  The longer this matter goes on, the longer people will have to wait and the harder it is on them because they must constantly fight a battle, which is unfair to them.  We must be very aware of our timing on this matter.<\/p> <p>  I, too, am concerned about the six-month period and feel that it is unfair.  We must be very mindful that a day or a week is very hard for survivors.  I ask that the committee considers this matter.  The Minister has explained the matter and Ms McGarrigle has explained it just now.  Like others, we have spoken to survivors.  Nothing can repay the heartache that they have experienced.  The Government has provided a good bit of money and we must be mindful of survivors.<\/p> <p>  At one stage an interim payment of &euro;10,000 or &euro;15,000 was spoken about.  Perhaps that proposal should be examined again because survivors are getting older.  The provision of an enhanced medical card to survivors is the most important thing we can do.<\/p> <p>  Earlier the assistant Secretary General mentioned counselling and I welcome that.  I believe we should provide counselling to families because so many survivors and their survivors have been affected.  I emphasise that families feel stress every day when they talk to their mothers.  These experiences have been very hard on survivors and their families.  I ask the Department to recognise the need to provide supports and counselling to families.<\/p> <p>  There is another issue that arose when we spoke about the redress scheme.  People raised with me the need for the application process to be as simple, clear and transparent as possible.  That is an important aspect for survivors too.<\/p> <p>  Another important issue that has been raised is the need to provide an advocate, social worker or adviser to assist survivors in liaising with the Department.  Another area that arose when I met survivors, and I am involved with survivors in my own area, is regional and local accessibility.  Both of these aspects must be addressed.  I feel that issues have arisen that we can try to sort out.  If survivors are watching this debate, I am sure it has not been easy for them.

I will also answer the question on the interim payment.<\/p> <p>  It is the firm intention of the Minister to establish the scheme as quickly as possible but that depends on the passage of this legislation.  That is one of the factors behind the IDG's recommendation that we establish an executive office where we can do an awful lot more work in parallel than if an agency were to be created, which would take a longer lead-in time to establish.  It would take time to establish all of the ancillary infrastructure that an agency would need, which is not needed in a Department as it can start to leverage existing ICT, human resources, etc.<\/p> <p>  I confirm that there is a commitment to establish the scheme as quickly as possible.  The Deputy mentioned the need for a firm commitment.  That is something that came through strongly in the consultation with survivors and stakeholders, and it was a key concern of the IDG.  The IDG recommended that the scheme be as clear, transparent, simple and user-friendly as possible so that entitlements  would be very clear.  Again, that is the idea - the general approach would be one where it is very clear to applicants that the payment is based on the length of time a person was a resident.  One would know that if one were a resident, one would have a good degree of certainty in terms of applying to the scheme and qualifying for benefits versus having to bring forward a burden of proof.  Obviously that is also a much more straightforward and efficient type of scheme to run than one that would require individual engagement with people having to bring forward evidence, which would have the potential to have a traumatising effect.  There is also the question of the length of time such a process would take.  These aspects are very much reflected in the intention of putting together this general scheme and in the work that the team is undertaking at the moment to prepare the infrastructure to deliver the scheme.<\/p> <p>  We appreciate that people are very keen for an interim payment to be made.  Also, it is very important that the scheme is opened up as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>A practical challenge is that because the scheme is already designed to provide one payment, which is based as simply as possible on residence, it is not apparent how we would make an interim payment in any faster way, particularly because we require the same infrastructure to make the payment.  Therefore, we need the IT system and the human resources in place to make the interim payment in the same way we would need it to make the full payment.  The scale of this scheme is way in excess of any other of its kind the State has ever administered in terms of the anticipated 34,000 applicants at an estimated cost of &euro;800 million.  With the expected number of applicants, the scheme is the largest of its kind in the history of the State.  We need a legislative basis for access to records and data sharing.  For those reasons, unfortunately, we cannot see how we can move any faster because we need those core blocks to make any form of payment but we are committed to wanting to do this as quickly as possible in the interests of survivors.<\/p><p> The Deputy mentioned advocacy and support for people making applications.  Action 1, which is a measure that sits within a much broader Government response and a suite of measures to respond to the needs and concerns of survivors and to recognise the wrong that was done and the suffering, is the creation of enhanced stakeholder engagement mechanisms.  We are currently working on proposals for a new form of advocate model that would enhance the level of advocacy support provided in this space.  That is something we hope to progress alongside progressing this scheme as well as ensuring existing mechanisms can be supported.  <\/p><p> The Deputy mentioned the fact that nothing can repay what has happened to people.  That point, absolutely, was very much recognised in the work of the IDG.  It is so sad but, sadly, we cannot give back what was taken away.  We cannot hope to compensate.  Therefore, this scheme, as part of the broader action plan, is an attempt to acknowledge, recognise and make amends for the suffering and wrong but recognising that no money can compensate and it does not attempt to do so.  It attempts to recognise and acknowledge.<\/p><p> The Deputy also mentioned counselling for families.  The commitments made and the supports put in place to date for counselling services and prioritised access are for survivors and former residents.  There is not anything specific that has been put in place for families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022052400002#C01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Laura McGarrigle","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":37,"content":"<p>Ms McGarrigle might consider that or talk to the Minister about it.

It is just part of the discussion and the dialogue.  I am just concerned about an aspect of this matter.  The length of time spent at the site of the trauma does not correlate in any way with the outcomes of the trauma.  Trauma is an inevitable organic and automatic consequence of being in the wrong place at the wrong time but there is no evidence whatsoever that its depth equates to the length of time spent at that place.  There cannot be a quantitative measure of the manner in which trauma is inflicted.  It is a qualitative, experiential phenomenological event in someone&rsquo;s life.  If one is exposed to those circumstances, one automatically qualifies irrespective of the length of time.  That is evidence based.<\/p><p>The other thing I am concerned about is the arbitrary decision to disregard or exclude time spent <i>in utero<\/i>.  Again, this is not evidence based.  It is not an intellectual position.  There has been an <i>a priori<\/i>assumption that we are just not going to consider that.  I would reference those two factors taken together.  I point to the absence of an evidence basis leading to an arbitrary, unnecessary and cruel distinction between categories of survivors based on six months, one day or three months in residence.  Given that we will spend so much money on this scheme as a republic, is it possible at any stage in the process to reverse or remove that provision?  I do not know if that can be done or if it is something we would have to revisit.  I would be concerned about that. <\/p><p>Regarding the expert advice that was consulted, without naming those experts what were their disciplines or their professional formation?  How could they be replied upon to have arrived at those conclusions when to me as a layperson it is quite clear?  I have published on trauma as an academic but the approach being pursued in this instance seems very clearly not to be evidence based.  I am curious to know what was discipline area or the professional formation of the experts the Department consulted in drafting these arbitrary timeframes of six months, one day etc.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022052400002#D00500","speaker":"1699"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653346800,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I apologise if my earlier answer was not clear.  When I referenced national and international evidence earlier, it was not with respect to an individual psychiatrist or psychologist coming in and speaking to us.  I was referring to evidence we gained from taking learnings from other schemes within this jurisdiction and in other jurisdictions.  One example the IDG would have thought interesting in terms of learning, which is referenced in its published report, was the Australian stolen generation scheme.  We would have examined it with respect to learnings from the perspective of the best way to construct a scheme that would deliver for survivors in a way that would not retraumatise and that would do no harm.  The principle of &quot;do no harm&quot; was a key point put to us by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC.<br\/><br\/>The stolen generation scheme would have started out with individualised payments that might have been set based on trauma and abuse.  The individual assessor reported to the Australian Government and recommended moving away from that model to a common experience payment for a couple of reasons.  First, he felt that he was being asked to make individualised judgments that were subjective in nature.  He thought this could lead to unfair judgments as he was trying to gauge one person&rsquo;s level of suffering and trauma <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>another in making these individualised assessments.  He was also worried that it was deeply retraumatising for the individuals affected and it was causing them to feel let down by the process and feel retraumatised.  There was a concern among advocates in Australia that it was also proving to be a more divisive approach.  For that reason, the scheme in Australia moved to a common experience model instead.<br\/><br\/>When I referred to the evidence, it was evidence of that level that was informing the IDG when it recommended that in putting parameters around the scheme, the general approach of the scheme would be one that would be non-adversarial and grounded in a common experience payment based on residency.  Within that, there is a length of residency scale.  The rationale for that, which the IDG put forward, was that the longer the length of stay, the longer one endured the harsh conditions, particularly noting the harshest conditions were associated with longer lengths of stay in earlier decades of the State when conditions, particularly in county homes or in Tuam, were really appalling.  It recognised that this is a scheme on an unprecedented scale that takes account of survivors coming from many different institutions over a span of many decades.  If we look at the commission, we see that this was across eight decades.  The age range of survivors spans quite a number of decades.  It is quite a broad demographic as well.  I hope that helps to answer the Senator's question and I apologise if my previous answer was not clear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022052400002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Laura McGarrigle"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":42,"content":"<p>It does.

The enhanced medical card is one of the key features.  The six-month cut-off point is a major issue but previous speakers raised that matter, so I will not do so again.  What is actually covered by an enhanced medical card?  A number of women have asked me that question.  Some were left to give birth in horrific circumstances which resulted in lifelong medical conditions.  That can be very personal for people.  I hate that people have to tell that story in order to get any help.  It is a very difficult thing to do.  What is covered by the enhanced medical card?  We all know how much pressure the health system is under.  A medical card will only be of significant benefit if it enables people to access services or operations for which they may have been waiting for a number of years.<\/p> <p>  On the payment of &euro;3,000 for those living abroad, how was that figure arrived at?  Similarly, how were the other figures of &euro;12,500 for those who were resident for up to six months and &euro;5,000 for those who were resident for at least six months decided?  How many people who were born in one of these institutions stayed for less than six months and how many stayed for more than six months?  With all due respect, it seems to people who are following this process and those affected by it that it is coming down to numbers.

In regard to the enhanced medical card and what it provides, head 20 sets out the legislative explanation of what it provides, namely, access to GP services and public acute hospital services, without charge in both cases, access to drugs, medicines, medical and surgical supplies, access to therapies, home help and nursing services, home nursing, and dental, ophthalmic and aural services.  Counselling is included just to give it a statutory basis but acknowledging it is already provided outside of this legislation.  Access to chiropody and physiotherapy is also provided.  The Bill provides access to therapies, GP, acute inpatient services, without charge; access to drugs, medicines, aids and appliances, without charge; and access to dental, aural and ophthalmic services.<\/p> <p>  Separately, it is worth mentioning that another one of the actions in the action plan is a commitment to further health research to identify whether any further health needs exist in the population of survivors and former residents of mother and baby homes that would need to be captured in any future review or update of services provided to survivors or as part of this enhanced medical card.  That commitment is also in place.  I hope I have answered the Chairman question but I ask her to let me know if she needs more detail on any aspect.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the &euro;3,000 payment, this was difficult for the interdepartmental group to grapple with because in January 2021 the Government agreed the commitment to an enhanced medical card for everyone with a length of stay of more than six months in a mother and baby or county home institution.  Everybody qualifies for that enhanced medical card but of course it is of limited value to those living overseas unless they spend significant periods in Ireland or move back to Ireland.  The &euro;3,000 health support payment is an attempt to acknowledge that reality for the individuals affected.  It acknowledges that the Irish State cannot legislate for the provision of health services in other jurisdictions.  The reality is that health systems can be very different between jurisdictions and health needs can differ from survivor to survivor.  It is accepted that there is no easy answer.  The interdepartmental group grappled with this but the health support payment is an attempt to acknowledge the circumstances of those survivors.  <\/p> <p>  In regard to payment rates, as mentioned, the interdepartmental group acknowledged that the payment scheme could not possibly compensate for what was lost and the suffering endured by people.

The group recognised that.<\/p><p>It also decided that the recommended approach to the payment was this general, common experience payment grounded in the non-adversarial approach.

Given the scale of this scheme with 19,000 people with length of stay of over six months, and the fact that the commission had recommended that Government consider providing for those with health needs, it was considered that the enhanced medical card was a way of giving a level of assurance of guaranteed access to statutory services.

We do so very much from the perspective of the 561 survivors who participated in the consultation process undertaken by us with them in March 2021.  We acknowledge and thank all those who took the time to participate in the consultation process, which, for many, reopened painful memories and feelings.<br\/><br\/>In considering the provisions of the Bill, the greatest disparity we discern between the provisions of the Bill and the views of the survivors relates to eligibility.  Survivors overwhelmingly asked for a universal common experience scheme that recognised all survivors, regardless of duration of time spent by them in the homes.  However, eligibility for financial redress is provided for in the Bill for all mothers regardless of duration of residence, but only for survivors who, as children, spent more than six months in the homes.  The Bill also uses duration of stay as a determinant for eligibility for an enhanced medical card for both mothers and children and, similarly, it will be provided only to those who spent more than six months in a home.<br\/><br\/>The survivors described the nature of the harms they experienced for which reparation is needed.  The Bill provides for a general payment of redress for unspecified harm, trauma, discrimination and stigma experienced by mothers and children while resident in the homes.  The survivors, however, identified at least 17 different harms suffered by them, many of which have lifelong negative consequences.  The primary harm described by them is the involuntary loss of the mother-child bond they suffered, but this is not recognised in the Bill.<br\/><br\/>Similarly, when considering financial recognition, survivors believed that a universal common experience payment was the most suitable form of redress, but with an additional 12 categories of claim identified, and that an initial interim payment of &euro;15,000, on average, should be paid immediately.  The Bill provides a general payment starting at &euro;5,000 for mothers who were resident for up to three months and &euro;12,500 for children resident for at least six months, with only two additional categories of claim, which are confined to lengths of stay in the homes and periods of work in excess of three months undertaken by mothers or pregnant women without pay.<br\/><br\/>The survivors stressed the importance of a human rights-based approach to the design of the scheme and, in particular, the need for accountability, truth-telling, identification of harm, participation, inclusion, equality, apology and restorative justice, all of which provide greater opportunity for healing.  The eligibility and financial payments provisions of the Bill are, however, evidently based on a rights-based approach, operating within the current statutory framework of entitlements and, in particular, those applying to the residential institutions redress scheme and the Magdalen restorative justice <i>ex gratia<\/i>scheme, which, similar to what is recommended for this mother and baby home scheme, comprises a general payment based on length of stay and a work-type payment rather than on the particular human rights violations and common experience of harms particular to the mother and baby homes survivors, the main defining feature of which is the loss of the mother-child bond they suffered.  Nowhere in the Bill or the general scheme is this recognised.<br\/><br\/>Other key concerns identified by the survivors that are not provided for in the Bill are listed in my written submission.  In light of the time constraints, I emphasise in particular the option of financial payment by lump sum, periodic payments or enhanced pension payments and the provision of trauma-informed counselling or psychotherapy beyond that of the counselling services currently provided by the HSE national counselling service for survivors and their family members.  There should be provision for a medical card equivalent to that granted under the Health (Amendment) Act 1996, as well as supports additional to those provided for in the Bill.<br\/><br\/>As regards the application, delivery of the scheme should be by trauma-trained and experienced staff.  In terms of administration, a personal liaison advocate, social worker or adviser should be available to assist each individual with applications and to provide the necessary emotional and practical support they need.  There should be no cut-off date or period for the duration of the scheme because many survivors do not have access to records and may not be aware of the circumstances of their birth.  As such, it may take time for them to become aware of their eligibility for the scheme.<br\/><br\/>Our written submission provides summary tables of all of the key requests made by the survivors and the extent to which these are provided for in the Bill, with a commentary on each.  Although our opening statement focuses on the issues not provided for within the Bill as it currently stands, that is not to ignore the amount of work and attention by the Department in the context of providing for the needs of the survivors.  We make our observations with the intention of continuing to represent the needs of the survivors as expressed by them in a way that will enhance the scheme.

I am a clinical psychologist working with young people who have experienced trauma and adversity, within a specialist setting.  I welcome the opportunity to disseminate information in respect of research and best practice and to have this knowledge, in turn, shape and influence thinking in respect of the mother and baby home institutions payment scheme.<\/p> <p>  The committee may be aware that I was prompted to make contact with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, in respect of the scheme in November 2021.  I, alongside co-signatories across disciplines working in the area of trauma, raised concerns regarding the current iteration of the scheme.  These concerns stemmed from a knowledge base in respect of the impact of early trauma and its consequences throughout the lifespan, as well as the exclusion of certain cohorts of individuals from the scheme.  In considering the impact from the perspective of early childhood trauma, this is not to negate the profound experience for the mother.  We know it has been a profoundly harmful experience for many women to have given birth and resided in a mother and baby home.  Indeed, we cannot separate maternal experiences from babies' experiences, given how important and intertwined the relationships are.<\/p> <p>  Donald Winnicott, one of the earliest proponents of developmental psychology in the early 1900s, stated, \"There is no such thing as a baby.  There is a baby and someone.\"  Babies are born helpless and utterly dependent on another for survival.  The context into which babies are born matters, as does the pre-birth context.  Experiences are required to shape the potential of the child.  The brain has a timetable for development, if you like, with different areas developing at different stages.  Disruptions of experiences at different stages can lead to deficits in later development.  For example, high maternal levels of cortisol, a stress hormone, during pregnancy will influence functions controlled by the brainstem for children, such as sensory processing, sleep, feeding and physiological functions such as cardiovascular and temperature regulation.  When we reflect on pervasive experiences of shame, stress and trauma that are at the heart of the many stories women have told of their experiences in mother and baby home institutions, we would naturally expect higher levels of stress during pregnancy as a result.<\/p><p>Of course, their babies, who are now adults, will not be able to narrate their experiences, but many children born in mother and baby home institutions will experience sensory and physiological difficulties well into adulthood.<br\/><br\/>Apart from the impact of<i>in utero<\/i>and birth experiences, we must also consider what babies need after birth.  Babies need to be rocked, held, soothed and comforted in predictable and safe ways for optimal relational growth to happen.  They need caregivers who themselves are psychologically well and have a sense of safety to adequately care for and meet the needs of their babies.  Infancy is a crucial period for attachment, in which the brain organises around expectations of safety and comfort within relationships.  Daily experiences of caregiving shape the child&rsquo;s later attachment system.  Good enough caregiving, by which I mean attuned, present and responsive care, enables the baby to learn that the adults and the world are safe and predictable.  The converse is also true.  If babies are not responded to in a way that promotes safety and care, they learn to organise their own behaviour and emotions to respond to an unpredictable, unsafe or sometimes frightening environment.  As such, they learn that others are not reliable and trustworthy to meet their needs.  Institutional environments such as the mother and baby homes are suboptimal and indeed often harmful environments for relational growth.  Thus, babies who have been raised in institutional settings are less likely to present with security of attachment and more likely to have developed strategies such as inhibition and suppression of emotional needs by withdrawing or exaggeration of emotional responses in order to have their needs met.  Without intervention, these patterns tend to persist into childhood and, indeed, adulthood, and form the bedrock for all subsequent relationships.<br\/><br\/>It was only in the 1990s that we began to look at the impact of separation of mother and baby soon after birth on later development, something Nancy Verrier called the &ldquo;primal wound&rdquo;.  She reflected that early separation can lead to profound experiences of loss, mistrust and difficulties in relationships with others later in life.  Yet in many ways, the impact of this separation is often denied.  The assumption is that babies do not remember, and therefore this does not matter.  Of course, we know that the process of moving from one caregiver to another, such as through adoption, which was often an outcome for children born in these institutions, is a profoundly stressful one, even if the environment is ultimately an enriching and positive one.  All of these experiences of separation and loss leave a lasting mark and shape how those who have experienced them navigate all future relationships.<br\/><br\/>To conclude, the message from research on childhood trauma is clear.  The earlier the impact of trauma, the more pervasive and long-lasting the consequences.  This is due to the rapid nature of brain growth and development at this time and the crucial nature of experiences to shape brain functioning and attachment.  Impact is not time-dependent, but rather is related to the nature and quality of experiences and how these shaped later development.  All who passed through mother and baby homes have been affected and these experiences will have shaped and influenced childhood and adult development.  Indeed, we know that adults who experienced childhood trauma are much more predisposed to a range of both physical and mental health needs in adulthood, not to mention relational difficulties.<br\/><br\/>Recovery from early trauma is possible with the right ingredients.  These are acknowledgement of harm, provision of tailored therapeutic supports, love and validation of experiences.  We need to look towards the future while also orienting to the past, and recognise the harms caused by inadequate care to mothers and babies.  Rupture and repair is at the heart of all good relationships.  This Bill offers the potential to be a moment of repair in the lives of generations of families who were and continue to be impacted by the mother and baby homes.  It can serve as an act of validation of people&rsquo;s lived experiences and support genuine recovery, but revisions will be required to encapsulate all of those affected, not just some.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022052400002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sara O'Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Both group&rsquo;s contributions are invaluable in terms of our scrutiny of this Bill.

The overriding wish from them, as I said, was that it would be a common experience payment and there would not be a burden of proof on them to prove trauma or harms done.  The kind of financial figure that was discussed for an interim payment - which would not be the totality of the payment, but an immediate interim payment - was estimated to be on average about &euro;15,000.  Other than that, there was much ambivalence by the survivors to put a figure on compensation because there was a sense that moneys would be seen as some form of compensation, and what they had experienced could not be compensated for.  Figures went up to &euro;200,000.  People looked at what they could potentially seek as way of payment through the courts if they were to take a legal action around their experience.  The amounts, I suppose, were not specific in the totality.<\/p> <p>  The kinds of harms that were referred to were extensive.  There are 17 listed in the report: the loss of the mother-child relationship; the impact of psychological abuse that was suffered; the suffering inflicted as a consequence of a lack of proper vetting of family placements for children placed in the community; the damaging consequences of the withholding of personal information for mother and child survivors; the economic exploitation of work undertaken without payment, which was recognised; the suffering and harmful consequences of physical and-or sexual abuse in some of the placements and experiences of children; the impact of unspecified abuse or treatment; opportunities lost due to the lack of education, which has not been acknowledged; arbitrary detention and coercive control; the negative effects of stigma and discrimination, which have been recognised; greater harm experienced by those of mixed race; the suffering associated with the loss of the father, siblings and extended family relationships; the harm inflicted as a result of racial profiling and suppression of ethnic identity; health issues related to the lack of information or neglect; non-consensual participation in vaccine trials, which was a significant one; and the consequences of the loss of nationality and heritage.<\/p><p>There are so many impacts and harms experienced that the way it is set out in the Bill by comparison is so limited that it does not reflect the experience of the survivors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022052400002#J01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Lou O'Kennedy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":82,"content":"<p>I thank both sets of witnesses.

The overriding issue is the use of the duration of stay of children as a criterion for the medical card.  Many of the medical issues that arose for women happened at the point of birth.  As has been explained to us today, the impact on children starts prior to birth.  This is the primary issue.  The survivors also expressed the harm that would be done if different groups were identified groups over others.  This would be divisive to their community.  They took great solidarity from being together in the consultations.  Solidarity among the survivor community is very important to them.  This is another reason the six-month cut-off is very problematic.  It is divisive and could be damaging in this way.<\/p> <p>  Trauma-informed counselling is another issue.  It was referred to again and again as one of the overriding needs that survivors requested.  The HSE counselling service was not designed to work with trauma at this level.

Medical card eligibility does not always mean access because there are waiting lists and all sorts of limitations at times.  There were all sorts of suggestions around private healthcare being provided.  The main card referenced by people was the Health (Amendment) Act medical card.  This is the one they felt would be the most comprehensive.  It would include many of the provisions already listed among those that have been put in place but with the addition of alternative therapies.  Many of the women in particular are interested in alternative therapies, such as body work, and some of the other supports that would be available to them through that card but not through the one being recommended.<\/p> <p>  Extra practical supports were mentioned for fuel allowances and phone allowances.  Things such as free genetic testing and health screening came up as a key issue because people do not know their family medical histories.  There was also mention of services for genetic illnesses linked to ethnicity and addiction services.  There is a range of needs.  As comprehensive as possible health cover is what was asked for.<\/p> <p>  The need for trauma-informed counselling for the survivors and their family members cannot be overstated.  It is not my field and I do not know how it would be put to the survivors in a way that would build trust in using the service and seeing it as something helpful to them.  It would need to be designed specifically to their needs and not a generic counselling service.  This is very much the feedback to us.  The intergenerational aspect that has already been mentioned would also have to be considered under this.<\/p> <p>  Trauma-trained staff who would work with survivors in the administration and application process is something that was very much emphasised.  It could probably go hand-in-hand with the advocate case worker support being put in place.

These are the history of adversity and the history of relational health.  If we consider these aspects in the context of pregnant women living in mother and baby home institutions, we would look at elements such as whether the mother was safe, was she harmed in any way and felt safe physically and psychologically.  All those factors have an impact on the growing baby.  Babies are tuned into their mothers' heartbeat rate.  We know this from the type of beats that babies seek out after they are born.  Babies are tuned into that heartbeat rate and it becomes soothing for them because they are used to it.  Consideration must then be given to the impact of separation from an environment that has been familiar and soothing to the baby or that has been familiar post birth.<br\/><br\/>Turning to the history of relational health, this element would include consideration of whether the mother was shamed or isolated from family members or the community.  All these relational health factors have an impact on the growth and development of the baby in turn, because that has been the environment in which the baby has been growing and developing.  The baby's development will be impacted by that context.  The parts of our brains developing <i>in utero<\/i>are the most impacted by such experiences.  The brainstem is the oldest part of our brain, nearly fully formed when we are born, and that is what is responsible for our sensory and physiological regulation skills.

Significant numbers of these survivors live abroad.  They asked that they be given access to health services overseas as well, at the equivalent level to that to be provided to survivors in Ireland.  Sometimes, again, the solution to this request was seen to be covering the costs of those survivors' private health insurance overseas, because that would be the only way in which any sense of equivalency could be provided to them.

A great deal of outreach must be done, especially internationally, in a proactive way to ensure those survivors are made aware of this scheme.  Before I came in here today, I spoke to someone in a different context entirely.  He shared with me that his mother told him last year on her deathbed that she had had a baby in one of the mother and baby homes.  Her son is now aged 50, and it is only now that he has become aware of what happened.  Many of the survivors do not wish to talk about their experiences and have not shared accounts of what happened to them.  For many of the survivors we spoke with, it was their first time sharing their stories and being in a group helped them.  The solidarity we spoke about is so important.  It is crucial, therefore, to remember that the legacy of these experiences continues to be felt by many people.  There are impacts over lifetimes and intergenerationally.

World Skills Ireland wishes to thank the committee for providing us with this opportunity to speak about the further expansion and funding of craft apprenticeships and new generation apprenticeships.  This statement will give an overview of the current situation regarding the provision of apprenticeship training in Munster Technological University, MTU.  The issues raised are common to all higher education apprenticeship providers.  Furthermore, the statement will outline what World Skills Ireland does on a day-to-day basis and will give an overview of upcoming World Skills activities at national and international level.<\/p> <p>  Apprenticeships are central to the mission, remit and activities of the technological university and institute of technology sector.  Munster Technological University is the largest provider of craft apprenticeship programmes in the country.  Approximately 1,600 craft apprenticeships will complete their off-the-job phases in MTU during the 2022-2023 academic year.  Craft apprentices in electrical, refrigeration, plumbing, carpentry and joinery, plastering, pipe fitting, metal fabrication fitting, motor, construction plant fitting, instrumentation and agricultural mechanics complete phases four and six of their apprenticeship in MTU.  Furthermore, post-2016, MTU delivers consortium-led apprenticeship programmes, which offer university degree qualifications.  Currently, more than 200 students are registered across programmes, in the areas of manufacturing and engineering, and engineering services management, among others.  The flexibility and availability of online learning options provides blended learning opportunities which enable us to extend the reach of new apprenticeship programmes and to enhance the delivery of the craft apprenticeship programmes.  <\/p> <p>  Apprenticeships are offered at all levels of the national qualification framework, from level 6 to level 10.  It is a mode of learning that is built around an employer requirement, with the learning provided by both higher education and further education, depending on the level of the award.  The level of engagement of the higher level community in apprentice provision is significant and therefore the level of annual and capital investment should be significant.  With that in mind, the main challenges that are facing MTU and, indeed, most of the technological universities and institutes of technology, with regard to the delivery of apprenticeship programmes are the lack of facilities.<\/p><p>By facilities, I mean classrooms, laboratories, workshops and offices.  Technological universities, TU, and institutes of technology, IT, receive capital funding for equipment when new curriculums are introduced but no funding is provided for new buildings or for the upgrade of existing buildings to facilitate the installation of this new equipment.  Specific funding to upgrade buildings is essential for the successful delivery of both craft and consortium-led apprenticeship programmes.  In the case of the Bishopstown campus of the Munster Technological University, MTU, there will be a requirement in the region of &euro;30 million for the upgrade and development of buildings to facilitate the delivery of existing and new apprenticeship programmes.<\/p><p> Both MTU and WorldSkills Ireland fully support and welcome the new Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 and the establishment of the national apprenticeship office.  It should be noted that the higher education sector and WorldSkills Ireland play a key role in the transition of current SOLAS co-ordinated craft apprenticeships to a consortium-led model, a process which will be managed by the national apprenticeship office.  We look forward to the development of a single apprenticeship model, and both higher education and WorldSkills Ireland are well-placed to help and, indeed, lead in the development process to ensure the result will be a workable and world-class model.<\/p><p> I will hand over to my colleague, Mr. English, who is the technical delegate for WorldSkills Ireland, to outline activities in the WorldSkills Ireland organisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022052400002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Hourihan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653346800,"counter":121,"content":"<p>Ireland, through the Department of Education, joined WorldSkills International in 1956 and competed for the first time in 1957.  We have competed in every competition since then, winning 65 gold medals, 53 silver medals, 81 bronze medals and 174 diplomas or medallions of excellence.  With us in the room today we have a gold medal winner and also a medallion of excellence award winner from the previous competition in 2019 in Kazan.  That really is a significant award level and it really goes to show that Ireland can compete on the international scale across a range of skills.<\/p> <p>  WorldSkills gives youths the chance to compete, experience and learn how to become the best in their skill of choice in what is known as the Olympics of Skills.  From the traditional trades to multi-skilled technological careers supported by partners, industry, Government, volunteers and educational and training institutions, WorldSkills Ireland is making a direct impact on raising the level of skills nationally, ensuring equity of career perception and promoting skills careers nationally and throughout the world with the 89 member countries in WorldSkills International.<\/p> <p>  To outline some of the activities in which we are engaged, WorldSkills is tasked by the Department, which remains a member of WorldSkills, with organising a national competitive event.  In 2019, for the first time, we brought all of these skill competitions together into the RDS arena.  Senator Malcolm Byrne was certainly there at the start of it, which we remember well.  We would have liked to have proceeded in 2020 and 2021 but, obviously, Covid-19 got in the way.  In that first event, 12,500 students came through the door to witness 25 skill competitions over three days and also experience the exhibitors and training zone, recruitment zone and education and skills zone.  Undoubtedly, it was a really successful event.<\/p> <p>  We are lucky that we are able to organise WorldSkills Ireland live 2022, again, in the RDS Simmonscourt arena from 13 September to 15 September, which will be Ireland's largest ever apprenticeship and skills event.  We will have more than 25 competitions over three days, increasing the range of opportunities and the visual impact that young students can have.  Members will obviously know competitions from the traditional skills and particularly apt, as Ireland is seeking to recruit into the construction industry zone, we have brick and stone laying, plastering, painting and decorating, plumbing and refrigeration skills.  Additionally, on the side of that, we have also grown the competitions into areas such as ICT and cloud computing, in which Ireland was the first country in WorldSkills to run a competition, and building information modelling, which is now called digital construction.  Again, Ireland led the way with WorldSkills in running the first competitions in that and they are both now WorldSkills International competitions.<\/p> <p>  Again for the first time, we are introducing a new competition we are calling digital infrastructure for sustainability, which looks at pre-building, that is, the groundworks, mapping and setting out of areas.<\/p><p>Again, it is about that move into digital and green spaces.<\/p><p> We believe we are being innovative in our approach.  World Skills Ireland has always crossed the range of Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, skill levels.  We have competitions from level 5 through to levels 6, 7 and 8.  We cover further education, apprenticeships, traineeships and higher education.  The committee will have seen the CAO offering but we have been ahead of that and have been doing that for a number of years.  It is great that our offering will match what the State is looking for.  When people come into the RDS in September they will see all those offerings and activities clearly displayed.  They can try it, see it, believe it and become what they want to be.  We have talked about \"see it and be it\" but for the first time ever we are actually presenting that to students.  We are delighted that it is looking like there will be an increase in footfall compared to previous years.  The morning sessions are completely sold out.  The 12,000 sq. m RDS event space is now full and we cannot accommodate any more competitions.  As the committee knows, the number of apprenticeships in Ireland has now grown from 27 when we started out to 67, plus 13 that are in development and a number of others that are being considered.  If we are to increase our range of skill offerings and experiences in order to be that single event that will supply everybody, which we want to do, we also need to grow some of our funding.<\/p><p> There is also the international aspect.  It is important that we have a pipeline of activities.  World Skills Shanghai is due to happen in October 2022.  In line with the Osnabr&uuml;ck declaration by the Department of Education, we are becoming members of EuroSkills, which will be held in Pozna in Poland in 2023.  We will also be holding the general assembly of World Skills, bringing the 91 member countries to Dublin in September 2023.  The story Ireland will be able to tell those other 90 countries involved is incredible and the opportunity to share our experience of how we have changed perceptions around skills and grown apprenticeships is important. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022052400002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray English","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. English.

I have approached schools and offered a completely free talk or presentation or even just to provide material on the opportunities and jobs in the sector but found that either you cannot find a contact or the schools do not want to engage.  By contrast, official engagements arranged along with the Institute of Guidance Counsellors have been very well received.  Therefore, we must find avenues.  There are plenty of apprentices.  A team of 17 apprentices travelled to Kazan in Russia with Mr. Twomey and myself and I know that plenty of us are willing to share our stories to help to show people the opportunities that are available whether that is through a level 8 course or as an apprenticeship.  We would like to show the different avenues you can take to enter these careers.  We must find ways to bridge that gap, which is why I think that the World Skills Ireland event at the RDS is a great opportunity to showcase careers.  While that event is great for anyone who attends, the question is how do you reach the people who do not engage.  Perhaps it would be helpful if we went to people.

We are inviting anyone to come along and engage with this programme and allowing them to get the first visualisation of what Fusion 360 looks like.  Free certification will be provided for those who want it.  This is something we are looking to add on.  It has worked successfully.  The first roll-out of the programme involved 75 people and in the first online training session, we are hoping to grow that and then expand into other offerings, such as building information modelling, that might lead people into the construction side.<\/p> <p>  To return to the Senator's point, we anticipate digitalisation will have a strong impact on the building industry.  That might change perceptions.  The industry is never not going to be noisy and it will never be totally clean because it is still using cement, etc.  However, for gender balance, the digitalisation side is one that could work.

I wish all those present the very best in their careers.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Hourihan mentioned that there are 1,600 craft apprenticeships, if I heard him correctly, which is certainly very welcome.  As somebody who has been very supportive of apprenticeships, I believe that we should be trying to get to the level that Germany has achieved.  Ireland has serious gaps.  Education and Training Boards Ireland is constantly raising the fact that we have serious gaps in apprenticeships.  Unfortunately, there does seem to be a snobbery in the education system where people feel that the only education they should go through at third level is academic courses.  It is shameful.  I believe this needs to change.  Craftsmanship needs to be valued and we need to promote apprenticeships in our education system.

We need to return to that and ask why it is not happening.  <\/p><p> Mr. Hourihan mentioned that there is a need to upgrade facilities to get more apprenticeship courses in place.

She is quite correct.  There is a certain level of snobbery there.  That is what we in World Skills Ireland are trying to work on.  We are trying to highlight the fact that apprenticeship is a viable, workable option that is really valuable.  The only way of really learning something is to actually work on it.  They talk about medicine and how it is pushed through and of course it is suitable for some people.  However, after seven years at university a doctor is not allowed into an operating theatre to operate on you or me.  They have to have practical experience.  The apprenticeship model is what is used throughout.  The snobbery end of it is reducing.  We hope to be able to bring it down.  The career guidance organisation we are dealing with is certainly open to that and has engaged with us.  We are delighted it has done so.<\/p> <p>  I can be specific about the funding in MTU Cork.  To bring those buildings up to spec we are talking in the region of &euro;20 million to &euro;25 million.  That only one part of the building, however.  The apprenticeship building in MTU Bishopstown campus was built in 1976.  The throughput at that time was very low.  It was a regional technical college back then and the numbers going though were relatively low.  The building was fit for purpose at that point.  It is certainly not fit for purpose at this point in time.  The numbers going through are huge.  Our facilities in the apprenticeship area are used not just by the apprentices but by the full-time engineering students as well.  These students expect and are entitled to the best facilities.  At this point we have the best equipment but we do not have the best facilities.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022052400002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Hourihan"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":222,"content":"<p>That is fair enough.

Are IBEC and IDA Ireland linking in with World Skills Ireland in any way?  When we have these high-calibre apprentices achieving so much on the world stage, it would make sense to have collaboration and cohesion.  Maybe that is happening.

There is a shortage everywhere.  Through promotion of skills we can encourage more people to come in.<\/p><p>We really have to step back a number of years and link those who are in second level now to get them thinking about what their career options will be.  The developments in the formation of the National Apprenticeship Office are very interesting and important.  The conversations that are starting between further education and higher education and the linking right the way through are also very important.  The issue is to get over that idea which parents have that if one goes to an apprenticeship, one somehow stops at some stage.  One must say, however, that it is absolutely wide open and the ability and options to return to further education, part-time or full-time, are fully there.  It is important and we need to sell the idea that it is lifelong learning and it never stops.<\/p><p> The same way in which one can upskill in one&rsquo;s career, one can equally upskill throughout one&rsquo;s education.

The metalwork and the woodwork were in the boys&rsquo; school and the home economics was in the girls&rsquo; school.  Maybe we could somehow start from secondary school and have these subject available to all of the students and, from there, tell the students that they have done the subject and they can now move on to the apprenticeship.  If the subject is not available, however, the apprenticeship is not going to come up for consideration.

We leave it too late to approach the students.  I remember being in fifth year and people had already set their mind on what they were going to do when they left school.  If a career guidance or talk was given in sixth year, they were so closed-minded because they had already selected something that might not necessarily have been something that they wanted to do.  They had made that decision and did not have to think about it further as they approached the leaving certificate examinations.<\/p> <p>  As Mr. Twomey said, going into schools and sharing those stories and opportunities sooner rather than later, and targeting students at a younger age, would be a good idea.

It is great to have champions for apprenticeship programmes here, because that is what we want to see.  We want people to be champions who will encourage and show many other students coming into the leaving certificate that there are other options out there.<\/p> <p>  I come from Ballinasloe and I represent Roscommon and Galway.  Yesterday, I was at the Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board open day.  All of the tutors were there.  There were girls and people of all ages coming in, including people in their 30s and 40s, looking to do different courses.  They were not just school leavers.  Lifelong learning is very important, so I might ask Mr. Hourihan for a couple of comments on that.  <\/p> <p>  Something that happened there really struck me.  One of the girls who came in was a non-national who was doing her leaving certificate.  I think she was under a lot of stress and pressure.  She just said that she felt she came in with no hope, and after a half an hour talking with tutors and trainers there, she left with hope.  There was a smile on her face.  She wanted to do a particular qualification and if she could not get it through the points system, there would be another opportunity to do it through further education or apprenticeships.  There is that sense of hope that the apprenticeship programme has to give.  <\/p> <p>  With regard to World Skills Ireland, I have a few comments and questions for Mr. Hourihan and Mr. English on lifelong learning.  Potentially, how do we encourage people at different age groups to consider apprenticeships or changing careers?  What do we need to do on that?  It was referenced in the opening statement as well.  I think they have also probably spoken before about other European countries, in particular their apprenticeship uptakes.  We heard last year from Norway, and I know Germany has a very high uptake of apprenticeships as well.  What do they do that we do not?  They spoke to us, but is there something simple we can do?<\/p> <p>  My next question relates to the buildings.  In Fine Gael, we have been looking at how we use school buildings and how they can be used after school hours.  We look at how we use premises in regional areas.  For example, ETBs across the country sometimes have further education colleges that will not be in use potentially over the summer months until they start up their courses again in September.  How are we working with our ETBs and our TUs to make the most of existing buildings?  I understand that everybody always wants new buildings.  That is the number one request.  However, there are existing buildings there.  When it comes to being able to develop and deliver classes, is there a way we can look at existing buildings and how we are working with the ETBs, which I think are quite integrated now with the TUs as well?<\/p> <p>  I have a few questions for our champions as well.  I think Mr. McSherry is the competitor on the bricklaying side.  Is that correct?  When I promote apprenticeships, I get to hear from people.  When I was getting the car washed, which is a treat, a guy came in behind me who was getting his car done too.  He told me he was working on 40 housing units that are getting built in town.  As I was chatting to him, he mentioned that he had met me before.  He was from one of the villages in east Galway.  I asked him if he had been in the leaving certificate class because I remembered he had been at that school, and he said he had been.  I asked him if he was working now - it was only two or three years later - and he told me he had joined the apprentice programme and was doing plastering.  I told him that was amazing and asked him why he thought we did not see more people doing it.  He spoke about the hard work and everything else.  He was a young guy.  He said he did not know.  I asked him if other people knew he had a nice car.  It was his pride and joy.  I ask Mr. McSherry how he tackles that when it is put back on the younger generation that it is not the same as 20 or 30 years ago.  How do we combat that sort of narrative?<\/p> <p>  I ask the rest of our guests if they have any comments.  There is a story that we have to tell about what apprenticeships are.  We can see how successful they are in places such as Germany and Norway.<\/p><p>What is it we need to do as public representatives?

On the question of Germany and Norway, it is a real issue of equity.

It is not a new culture and it comes from the longer term.  We are starting that again and for us that journey might be slightly longer.  It is the value that is really important.  It is a collective value and it is really important to drive it on.  It is also about visibility, which is really important.  The more visibility we can get of young people, the better.  Both Mr. Hourihan and myself are qualified tradespeople so we need to get to the younger people.  It is really key to much of the outputs.<\/p> <p>  I will also take off my World Skills Ireland hat and put on my TU Dublin hat.  We had Bolton Street and Kevin Street, although that building has been demolished and the programme has moved to Grangegorman.  The building at Bolton Street is very old.  In many cases, it is about the type of space that is available and it may not be a flexible space that allows for the new type of education we are seeking.  As Mr. Hourihan pointed out, those facilities would be used both for undergraduate courses, research and apprenticeships.  It is that combination that will give us the flexibility to grow that equity in everything we deliver.

We have a huge backlog.

If we got the opportunity to know what it would be possible for us to do if we continued with a subject, that would help.  If we are shown a subject and we like it, we might take it on.  It would be good, however, if we could know more about what we could do as a result of continuing on with a subject.  Home economics, for example, is seen as a subject where people just do cooking.  I am a chef and I am biased, but we also do a lot of financial work in home economics, as well as sewing.  It would be possible to do many jobs as a result of having studied this subject, but when students experience it for one month and they make a curry, for example, they might come away from that experience thinking all they will be able to do in the long term as a result of taking on home economics is to take on a role as a chef.

The review sponsored by the European Commission Directorate General for Structural Reform Support was undertaken in early 2020 and I recently brought the report to Government for approval and publication.<\/p> <p>  I publicly thank the European Commission and the independent consultants for their extensive support and work in developing this comprehensive assessment.  It provided a clear and detailed economic assessment to the funding options presented in the 2016 Cassells report, requested formally by this committee in 2019.  On that note, I thank this committee, current and former members, Peter Cassells for his work, and everyone for their collective drive and ambition to see a sustainable model of funding for higher education, a truly important strategic national asset.<\/p> <p>  I am delighted to be with the committee to discuss our policy response and the decisions we have made, as published by the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, and me on 4 May.  As colleagues will be aware, I also published the review of the student grant scheme, fulfilling a key programme for Government commitment.<\/p> <p>  Funding the Future is the Department&rsquo;s landmark policy document which settles the question of both the funding model and the funding gap.  I want to be clear about what the Government decided not to do in Funding the Future.  We have ruled out the possibility of introducing student loans into the system.  We believe they are unfair and do not work.  We have decided that the higher education system will have a multi-funded model, through additional Exchequer investment, because higher education is a public good, and through ongoing but not increased employer contributions to the national training fund.  The student contribution will be retained but will be reduced over time.<\/p> <p>  We have put in place a twin-track approach.  A funding gap of &euro;307 million has been identified.  There is a plan on how to fund higher education with a reform process.  In the interests of time, I will not go through my full statement, but this is the exciting part.  Now that we have identified the funding gap of &euro;307 million, this enables a conversation to take place about what sort of education system we want to create.  Up until now, legitimate conversations have been legitimately stymied by people saying that they cannot do more because the core funding has to be provided.  We have now identified the core funding and the Government is committed to delivering it.  We have to continue with the reform discussion.<\/p> <p>  How do we create an education system in Ireland that can meet the skills needs of the country now and in the future, and is accessible to all, flexible and recognises that students come to the education system at all stages of life?  Not everyone can come in for a four-year degree, pack the bags, and move to another town or city.  I am particularly passionate about creating better pathways between further education and higher education, so there is not a singular focus on rote learning, leaving certificate points and the CAO.  This is a common ambition that we share across the political divide in this House.<\/p> <p>  We cannot talk about core funding and a sustainable plan that works for the universities without talking about a sustainable plan that works for families.  While we can have a legitimate debate about whether we should reduce the registration fee or student grant fee first, or a bit of both, I will be clear that it is the Government's policy position that the cost of education for working families must be reduced.  My Department only has two levers at its disposal to do that: the registration fee and the student grant.  The Government has stated in a policy document that it wishes to see the student grant system significantly improved and that it wants to reduce the registration fee.<\/p> <p>  While maybe it is wonky and part of a process, I think it is exciting that, every year, in advance of the budget, we will publish a cost of education paper that will set out all the options.  What options are available to the Minister or Government and why did it choose one over another?  I think this will provide a focus on what options the Houses of the Oireachtas have to reduce the cost.<\/p> <p>  The student grant scheme review involved significant work.  I thank colleagues for it.  More than 9,000 people participated in the consultation.  We have begun to implement some of the actions, including changes to the adjacency rate and the first increases to the grant and the income threshold in ten years.  There is no doubt that we have much more to do.  I hope and expect that we can make more progress on that in the budget.<\/p><p> We have established an implementation group to deliver the Funding the Future model.  I am delighted I will be co-chairing it with Professor Anne Looney and Professor Tom Collins.  I want to thank them both for their leadership.  The inaugural meeting will take place tomorrow.  We do not intend to lose any time in getting on with the agenda.  The group membership is comprised of enterprise voices, student voices, societal voices and, of course, Government and agency representatives.  I am very excited about the work we will undertake.  As the members are aware, there are fives strands to the work of the group.  No doubt, there will be an opportunity during questions and exchanges to address that.<\/p><p> I was also asked to touch on the issue of technological universities.  Every application for every technological university has now been delivered.  There is a gap in the north-east that we need to work together to address, but all technological university applications received by this Government have now been progressed.  All the technological universities which sought status are now open and functioning.  We are excited about the next stage of their journey.  I can get into that during the questioning. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022052400002#CC00200","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":332,"content":"<p>Before the Minister came in, he met some of the apprentices.  We really need to hear what they have said.  Their contribution was very valuable in informing where we need to go with apprenticeships.  I thank them for that.  Saint Brendan's College in Belmullet asked me to pass on its thanks to the Minister for the message.  My son is in the leaving certificate class there.<\/p> <p>  We have had several conversations about the Funding the Future policy in the D&aacute;il, and we agree with the sentiments of where the Minister is trying to go with it.  We need some timeframes on delivery in terms of the reduction of the fees and the other things mentioned in it.  If many of the changes recommended in the Cassells report are not introduced until 2026, that will be ten years after the publication of the report.  We are in an ever-changing environment.  My concern is we are going to be playing catch-up all the time.  People want to see timescales on where we are going both with the SUSI reforms and the deficit in third level education.  I know the Minister agrees we are reaping the negative effects of the deficit and the austerity in the third level sector in terms of our workforce planning.  We may be faced with the situation again this year where students with the maximum number of points cannot get places on high-demand courses.  I do not know if the Minister has any further information on the extra places on high-demand courses that were discussed last week.  If the Minister has that information, I ask him to supply us with it.<\/p> <p>  I also want to raise the issue of the borrowing ability of technological universities.  When will the technological universities be in a situation where they can borrow?  <\/p> <p>  I also want to make two points that are relevant in the immediate term.  Due to the cost-of-living crisis we are experiencing and ever-increasing inflation, is there any way the SUSI grants can be provided earlier this year?  On the timing of the student assistance fund, we often hear it is October or November before students receive their funds.  Getting a place in college involves stresses and strains and upfront costs.  Is there a way that we can make the assistance more accessible earlier because of the cost-of-living crisis we are in?  I will leave it at that.  I want to give the Minister time to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022052400002#DD00200","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":333,"content":"<p>I echo the Deputy's comments on the apprentices.  We need to hear more from apprentices.  We hear a lot from agencies that represent good people, but the voice of the apprentice needs to be heard.  It is good the committee invited them to attend today.<\/p> <p>  On timelines, the Deputy's question is a valid one.  We now have a shared understanding across the sector, and I think across the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, as to what needs to be done.  The &euro;307 million figure has not been disputed.  There is a good technical paper that explains how we got to that figure.  It is about getting on and delivering it.<\/p> <p>  People reference the Cassells report.  I think it is important to state the review found a lot has happened since the publication of the Cassells report.  One of the myths circulating was that Cassells did his work, which was very good work, from 2014 to 2016, and then the report sat on a shelf.  That Cassells report mentioned a figure of &euro;1 billion.  Looking at the technical report, that figure is now &euro;307 million.  That shows that there has been a lot of movement, particularly post 2016 and onwards.<\/p> <p>  The honest answer is we are starting the work now.  The Deputy mentioned a delivery date in 2026.  I am talking about starting now, in budget 2023.  On the pace at which we can deliver it, out of respect to all my Government colleagues and the collective we form, it is matter for the Estimates process.  However, I wish to highlight there are three budgets left, all going to plan, in the lifetime of this Government.<\/p><p>Given the &euro;307 million figure, we should be able to significantly close that gap during those three budgets.  I think that is a shared ambition across Government.  I do not think I am speaking out of turn in relation to that.  We can make an awful lot of progress on that &euro;307 million figure in the three remaining budgets before the next general election.<\/p><p> I do not have any more information on extra places but am finalising a memo to Government and expect to bring it to Government very shortly.  We will try to provide, as I said to the Deputy in the D&aacute;il last week, 1,000 additional places or thereabouts.  It is different from previous years in that, as the Deputy has called for, we are targeting it in areas where there is high demand in terms of students looking for it as well as a skills need, specifically medicine, nursing, engineering, environmental areas and medical scientists.  I will be happy to share the information with the Deputy once I have briefed Cabinet.<\/p><p> On the technological universities, that provision exists so we have clarified that the Housing Finance Agency is in a position under legislation to borrow.  That is not the same thing as saying the structures are in place or the tradition in the sector is in place but legally it is possible as of now.<\/p><p> The Deputy made a fair point on the timing of the student assistance fund, considering the immediate pressures students can face at the start of a college year.  I will reflect on that and see what we can do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022052400002#DD00300","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":335,"content":"<p>The Minister is welcome and I thank his officials for joining us.

For those struggling around SUSI grants, the expansion is welcome.  Will the Minister comment on areas that are essential to get right immediately?  We have a global cost-of-living crisis.<\/p> <p>  We have had people in to us saying we could have accelerated programmes around apprenticeships to develop skills quickly and bring a workforce on in areas, particularly around retrofitting and building, which is what we really need.

On the cost of living, there are measures the Government needs to look at specifically for students and their families.  A number of the measures we have taken as a Government benefit students.  In fairness to the Senator's party leader, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, one of the most impactful has been the change brought about in public transport costs.  They have reduced for everybody but overwhelmingly reduced for people under the age of 24, many of whom are students, by up to 50%.  That is an example of a whole-of-population measure with a specific targeted element that will benefit students above and beyond the rest of the population.  We need to look at clever ways to do more things like that.  The electricity credit will benefit students in student accommodation as well.<\/p> <p>  There will be a budget in October and we want to do much more on student supports, but from September we will see immediate improvements for students.  They include the &euro;1,000 extra a home can earn and still qualify for a SUSI grant, the first income threshold increase in a decade.  The grant will go up by &euro;200 for all students.  That is the first time in a decade.  That does not tell the full story because we have changed the adjacency rates.  One had to live 45 km or more from college to get the higher grant.  That goes down to 30 km from September, meaning many students will see their grant increase by more than 25%.  That is thousands of euro of an increase.<\/p><p>We are eager to do more.  As I said to Deputy Conway-Walsh, we are eager to see, in terms of the timing of that, what more can be done in the coming academic year as well.  We will work through that in the Estimates process.<\/p><p> One group of students that I would like to see prioritised in the SUSI is postgraduate students.  The cost of doing postgraduate education in Ireland is particularly high.  We made improvements to the level of support through Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, in our first budget as a Government.  There is a shared view across Government that we would like to do more in that space as well.<\/p><p> On the accelerated programmes, I agree fully with Senator Pauline O'Reilly.  I do not mean the following in relation to the Senator.  We all, including me, use the term apprenticeship sometimes as a catch-all phrase for upskilling and reskilling.  What I saw yesterday when I opened a new retrofitting training centre in Limerick was that there are many accelerated programmes where somebody can access a piece of training, that might only take three or four days, to get the green skills that he or she needs to retrofit somebody's home.  For an unemployed person with no construction background, a month in a retrofitting training centre can get him or her probably back into a decent well-paid job with lots of work to come.  I am eager that we broaden the apprenticeships, and we are doing so.  We have 65 now and 17 more in the pipeline.  I am also eager that we look, as the Senator says, at traineeships and shorter courses as well.<\/p><p> On capital, I will make a couple of points.  The sector has been starved of capital for a long time.  That changes now.  We have &euro;450 million to spend between now and 2024, which is a big increase.  Forty-five per cent of that will be spent on further education and apprenticeships.  As we speak, SOLAS, is assessing applications with others and we expect this summer to be able to start announcing projects in the technological universities.  In addition, we have also through the European Research Development Fund ring-fenced funding of &euro;80 million specifically for research in the technological universities, TUs.  Only the TUs will be able to apply, which should benefit them.<\/p><p> Apologies, I ran over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022052400002#EE00300","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":338,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022052400002#FF00200","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":339,"content":"<p>Who did I say was next?

We have such excellent talent but it has to be acknowledged the numbers that are attending third level now are up to 240,000 to 245,000.<\/p> <p>  I am interested in the mention of the National Training Fund around the employer contributions and acknowledge the work that has been done around SUSI.  The Minister stated that he engaged with more than 9,000 people.  In my own local area in Galway, the Minister held webinars with people there to find out what was needed.  It will be important looking at that postgraduate element, as the Minister mentioned.  The reduction of the travel is crucial and also the public transport side of things.  Public transport is very important for travel if the students are going longer distances.<\/p> <p>  The Minister might comment as well on the one-stop-shop now that it has been started up in Maynooth University for the third level students coming from Ukraine.<\/p> <p>  If I may, on the implementation group for funding and reform, the Minister mentioned the cost of education report that he will do prior to the budget.

I am glad the Senator reminded me because one of the key objectives that I want to see from the &euro;307 million of additional funding into the sector is that we do not talk about it as &euro;307 million.  What that roughly means to people is we are spending much more on everybody's education every year.  That will achieve more staff in the universities and an improvement on the student-staffing ratios which, in Ireland, are somewhere between 19:1 and 20:1.  The European average is in or around 15:1.  It is not done in the rigid way that a pupil-teacher ratio in a classroom is done.  Students are used to large lectures in universities, and technological universities in due course, but overall the ratios of staff to students need to improve in the sector.  That is a key aim that we want to deliver on.<\/p> <p>  On the SUSI review, I thank the team in the Department which worked hard on this.  It is a really good piece of work and a key commitment in the programme for Government.  It was done efficiently and also comprehensively in terms of the breadth, as the Senator acknowledged, of consultation.<\/p> <p>  The encouraging aspect is that much of what the review said is what we had begun.  I am not suggesting we have done enough - we have not - but the review basically says we must ensure we increase the rates.  We have started that.  There is much more we need to do.  The review said we must reduce the adjacency-non-adjacency rate.  We have done that and need to do more on that.  The review pointed to postgraduates in which area we need to do more.  One area I must be honest about is that we have a piece of work to do is around part-time education.  At present, we do not provide SUSI for part-time education.  We need to bottom out.  The Senator might ask what I mean by that.<\/p><p>I do not mean this in a flippant way.  What do we define part-time education as?  How long a period of education does it have to be?  Where does it fit on the qualifications framework?  We need to do work to get moving on that.  We cannot have the policy contradiction of telling people that studying part-time is great and then not providing them with support.  I feel strongly about that.<\/p><p> The one-stop shop for Ukrainian students, researchers and staff is going well.  I thank Maynooth University for hosting it, but it is very much a cross-sector initiative.  I thank the admissions offices of universities which have seconded people to this facility.  It has provided a phone line and an email address.  The higher education system can be difficult for anyone to navigate at the best of times, so it could be especially difficult for someone coming here from a war-torn country.  The idea is that people will have an individual conversation with Ukrainian students, researchers or staff members about their stage of education in Ukraine and how that can work in Ireland, with the ultimate goal of ensuring that everyone can continue their education and research.  I am pleased that we have been working on this at a European level.  I thank Commissioner Mariya Gabriel for her work on this.<\/p><p> There are many ways to deal with the cost of education, the cost-of-living crisis and ways to support students outside my Department's remit.  My Department only has two levers to address it directly, which are the student registration fee and the student grant scheme.  The student assistance fund helps to a degree.  The Government paper states that we will look at the options relating to both in each budget.  In one year, the Minister might decide to use one over the other, another Minister might decide to do a little of both in the next year, and in another year, the Minister might decide it is not possible to do either.  There will be a focus on it on budget day every year, just like we do with the pension.  We have a debate every year, as we should, about what the pension should be.  No one is begrudging people getting an increase in the pension.  We do not have that discussion every year.  That changes for students and their families.  The cost of education paper will give us a seat at the table and provide focus to these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022052400002#FF00500","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":343,"content":"<p>I will take a scattergun approach here because I have a number of points I want to raise.  I will start with the last of them.  The Minister referred to the debate we have on the pension every year.  I disagree with him.  I would prefer if we did not have a debate on the pension each year and it was instead benchmarked so that we have certainty about the future and are sure it is keeping pace with the rapidly changing cost of living.  All of the figures here are welcome.  We need to disambiguate between what the different pots of money are doing.  There tends to be conflation in the public consciousness.  Some &euro;307 million is for core funding.  It is about driving research and student-teacher ratios.  We have &euro;450 million in capital funding.  There is a pot of money for technological university research, which is extremely important.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, was in the Walton Institute with me on Friday.  We saw a range of extremely exciting research.  The difficulty for staff working in the technological university and the balance of teaching hours versus research hours, which makes it difficult for them to compete directly with the university sector, was discussed.  We might need to work on that.<\/p> <p>  I have heard clear figures about capital funding and capital.  I am not really hearing figures about how we tackle the costs for the student and the end user.  That is important and we need to have a discussion.  The Minister talked about the two levers available to him.  We need to discuss how we balance universal interventions with more targeted interventions.  In this context, we see the SUSI grant as being more targeted and the reduction of fees as being more universal.  We need to have a proper public discussion about which way we want to go.<\/p> <p>  On the bigger picture, we have repeatedly heard about how Ireland spends a lower percentage of its GDP on higher education than other OECD countries, in particular.  I know GDP is a frothy figure in Ireland so we might prefer to use GNI or GNI*.  We do not compare favourably with other OECD countries.  I would be interested in hearing about the Minister's vision and the global overview.  Do we intend to shift the needle on that percentage spend?  We need to have that conversation openly and publicly.<\/p><p>If we are raising tax, we have a responsibility to talk to the public about how that tax will be spent and explain the decision-making behind it.  I am glad we have turned our face against student borrowing.  We heard different points of view during this unit of work we are doing on student borrowing.  I think student borrowing would present a mountain to climb for families from particular socioeconomic groups, so I am glad that the Minister has set his face against it.<\/p><p> Those are the things I would like the Minister to dig down into.  What specifically are we talking about in terms of funding that we think is going to get to the student?<\/p><p> In terms of tackling the cost of living, I accept the changes that have been made to SUSI grants in terms of eligibility, adjacency etc.  All of those things are very important but I think we would all accept those are running to stand still in terms of chasing the cost of living.

Up until the previous budget the grants did not increase, and up until now we have not talked about reducing registration fees.  That is wrong.  I do not know whether it is a subconscious ageism within our political system but it is stupid and short-termist in terms of investing in human capital.  We talk a lot about investing in capital, but investing in human capital is so important.  Every other measure that was brought in during the austerity era seems to have been eased or improved but the grants did not increase and the registration fees stayed up.  That is not passing the buck.  We were in government.  This is a genuine and honest discussion about how we must have a much more policy-focused approach to the cost of education and investment in education, which needs to happen annually.  Education cannot be the poor relation in any discussion.  To be fair to this Government, I believe we have applied, from the Taoiseach down, a level of focus to these issues.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy specifically referred to the technological university of the south east and to research and research time for staff, which is a core piece.  If our new technological universities are to succeed, which they will and we want them to succeed, the work we are doing with the OECD around a new academic contract is key.  We expect to bottom-out that work this year in our engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the like.  I hope to be in a position to start talking publicly about this matter in more detail shortly.  It is a really key moment.  It is not about imposing contracts or anything like that but more about offering, after a period of consultation and engagement, new contracts to people to work in a new way that is reflective of being in a university, which I believe could be very exiting and transformational for the sector and probably for some of the people whom the Deputy and the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, met.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh is entirely correct in what he said about universal versus targeted in terms of the cost of education, and I could not agree more.  I argue that, as a Government, we tend to do both.  The Minister for Health brought a proposal to Government recently that recommended the removal of the cost of hospital care for children.  He did not bring a proposal suggesting an increase in the income threshold and giving medical cards to more children.  We as a Government made a decision, in line with the idea that we should have a universal healthcare system, that every child should be able to access healthcare without paying.  We did not decide just to tweak the income thresholds for the medical card.  We did not say we would just improve a financial grant for some.  We decided that as we value our kids' health, then healthcare was going to be free for everybody.  That is an example and there are other measures we take in health that are targeted.  It is never either-or when it comes to universal and targeted and it annoys me when people - I do not mean the Deputy because he did not do so - try to make the debate binary, because it never is.<\/p> <p>  On energy, and the Deputy and his party, along with the Minister, Deputy Ryan, have led on the issue, we have done targeted measures on the fuel allowance and we have done universal measures on the energy credit.  Why would education be any different?  We obviously need to target proactively those most in need.  There is no doubt in the wide earthly world that we are already doing so, with &euro;42 million spent on targeted measures from what we call the Programme for Access to Higher Education, PATH, initiatives, which include bursaries of &euro;5,000 to increase diversity among teachers and increasing the SUSI grant, which is a targeted measure.  However, we must recognise also that if a person has two children going to college at the same time and each is doing a four-year degree, it will cost that person &euro;24,000 in registration fees.  I believe that would have cost about &euro;1,500 in 1997.<\/p> <p>  It has to be about where we want to get to, and I do not want to dodge that question in any way, shape or form.  The good news about the work the European Commission did is this will bring us to the average level of spending in Europe.  This will fund our university system roughly to the same level as the Swedish.<\/p><p>We will go from being below average to being in line.

I start by welcoming the positive developments and changes to make things easier for students availing of grants, with the travel distance being cut.  More students can now qualify for a full grant.  The maintenance grant has been increased by &euro;200, along with the income threshold being increased by &euro;1,000 for the standard grant.  They are all welcome measures.  The cost of living is affecting everybody, including our students.  We all know that quite well.<\/p> <p>  I have raised my main concern with the Minister before, which relates to the student earnings cap of &euro;4,500.  I feel this is posing difficulties to students, who cannot work many hours.  They want to work and do not want to have the burden of their education fall on their family who are also grappling with the cost of living.  It would be good to increase this cap incrementally.  I know it cannot be done all at once.  It has not been increased since 2016 and I think it needs to be done.  It is possibly a lost opportunity.  I made a submission on this issue to the steering group review.  I know the Union of Students in Ireland also feels strongly about this issue.  It said it is an obstacle.  I have met many employers in the hospitality sector.  They cannot fill job vacancies because they cannot source enough students to fill the vacancies because of the cap.  The cap affects the employer and the local economy too.  It would be progressive to incrementally increase this in budget 2023.  I called for this when I spoke during Leaders' Questions last week.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge the long overdue positive developments with apprenticeships and traineeships.  We have a serious gap in apprentices to fill.  In order to initiate change at second level and make sure that apprenticeships and traineeships are valued, especially apprenticeships, is there a plan to roll out a programme to bring everybody on board, including career guidance teachers who, through no fault of their own, were focusing more on the academic side than on apprenticeships?  It would be beneficial.  We have listened today to some fantastic young students who were apprentices.  They certainly gave us insight.  If those young people went into schools to interact and talk with students, it would be a positive development.  We should bring the whole school community on board, including teachers, especially career guidance teachers.  It would initiate a change in our way of thinking about what constitutes education.  Craftsmanship should be highly valued, as it is in Germany.  Apprenticeships in Ireland should be no different.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022052400002#JJ00200","speaker":"1592"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":348,"content":"<p>I think I agree with everything the Deputy said.  I thank her for welcoming the positive changes that have been made.  I would be the first to acknowledge that they are a start and there is much more to do, as the SUSI review shows clearly and comprehensively.  The good thing about the SUSI review is that we now know what we need to do.  For the first time, we have identified the real cost of education in further education and training, at an undergraduate level and at a postgraduate level, and looked at how our grant system compares.  The long and short of it is that the SUSI grant system was largely fit for purpose when it was introduced ten years ago, but the cost of living and the cost of accommodation have changed in that time.  We are working to respond to that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy made a fair point about the earnings cap, which comes up a lot.  The earnings cap recognises that a student in full-time education is in full-time education.  At the same time, everything has changed and the &euro;4,500 figure seems low compared with when it was set.  As the Deputy rightly said, it has not been reviewed in a long time.  We will look at it in the pre-Estimates discussion.  My gut feeling is that it could be increased without having any unintended consequences.  It would be welcomed by students, by parents and, as the Deputy says, by sectors of our economy that want students to work part-time.<\/p><p>I am grateful for the Deputy's submission on that.  On second-level change, we started a process with the CAO now having the visibility of apprenticeships and further education.  A number of our schools are rolling out apprenticeship taster courses, as it were, at transition year level.  I think we will have 30 being rolled out with ETBs through Solas.  I will get the details for the Deputy.  I am aware that KWETB does that.  Of course, there is a really important piece around senior cycle reform and the exciting agenda the Minister, Deputy Foley is pursuing.  That can help broaden the discussion around education and skills and maybe allow for more flexibility between what was the traditional leaving certificate and the leaving certificate vocational programme.  We are very eager to do more on CAO reform.  That website and process has narrowed the discussion too much in Ireland.  I am absolutely determined that we change it.  When I talk about future funding, that is going to be a key ask of ours.  There has to be parity and visibility at the very least for students around all their options.  It is not accidental that we have shortages in the construction, hospitality and green skills sectors.  We need to fix that.  I will send on some details on those taster programmes to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022052400002#JJ00300","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and acknowledge the leadership he provided on the development of the technological universities and also in getting the funding debate really out there.

One of the points the Minister made is around the provision of additional places in higher education in specific skills areas.  These obviously include programmes like medicine where over the full six-year course we are talking about a full economic cost of something in the order of &euro;100,000.  It has been flagged in some of the media that up to 1,000 additional places are going to be provided in medicine, climate-related programmes and those where a skills shortage has been identified.  Can the Minister give us an assurance that they will all be fully funded?  I appreciate his point.

On borrowing, to be clear, I want to thank the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien for working very closely with us on the whole issue of student accommodation; the borrowing framework can now be accessed by our technological universities through the Housing Finance Agency.  Of course, as I said in answer to an earlier question, for obvious reasons they do not have a lot of experience in drawing this down so we need to build a collective sense of confidence around it.  There is no legal impediment today to that and we are very much open.<\/p><p>I delivered this message to a technological university yesterday in the context of receiving applications and pilot projects in terms of student accommodation for technological universities.<\/p><p>  On the Senator's broader question, my view and, I believe, that of the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, although I will not speak for him, is that we need to come up with a new model for student accommodation.  It is very tricky to come up with a new model but we need to do so.  We have many planning permissions granted to build on-campus student accommodation.  The challenge is that they are not being built in a way that is affordable and, therefore, in some cases they are not being built because they cannot be built and rented at an affordable level.  My officials and I are considering several matters in very close work with the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, and his officials.  There are exciting ideas in the pipeline.  An example of that relates to the Government announcement in respect of helping people to build apartments and whether there is a variation of that which could be used to help bridge that funding gap for some of our institutions.  The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, and I are hoping to bottom out some of these options in the coming weeks.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022052400002#KK00900","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":359,"content":"<p>The Minister referred to part-time student funding.

There is a further piece we need to do.  We have asked the OECD to do a piece of work - it is in the field now - in terms of the skills infrastructure of the country, but specifically looking at lifelong learning.  As the Senator is aware, participation rates here are below the UN and OECD average when it comes to lifelong learning.  The Government agreed at Cabinet last week to a proposal from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to significantly increase those rates by 2030, from approximately 40% to 60% of people participating in lifelong learning in any one calendar year.  Does that mean one funds the citizen or the business or a bit of both?  How do we crack that model?

It will know, however, that no Minister, no matter what portfolio he or she holds, can ever say that grants will be increased by X or fees decreased by Y outside of a budgetary cycle.
