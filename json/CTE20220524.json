I am joined by my colleagues, Brian O'Mahony, Ruth Buggie, Gillian Baker and Andy Fox.  I thank the committee for affording me the opportunity to present my opening statement.<\/p> <p>  The SEAI is at the forefront of Ireland&rsquo;s clean energy transition.  We are funded by the Government through the Departments of the Environment, Climate, and Communications and Transport.  We have had a major transformative impact on the Irish economy and in the last decade, our actions have underpinned more than &euro;1.2 billion in energy savings.  We are catalysts for action through our grant and incentive programmes and capacity-building processes.  Citizens, communities, businesses and other stakeholders are at the heart of everything we deliver.<\/p> <p>  The SEAI&rsquo;s work supports the delivery of the climate action plan.  The climate action plan outlines many actions supporting citizens and communities on their transition to a climate neutral Ireland, such as supporting sustainable energy communities and existing, supporting planned renewable energy schemes and enabling community-led climate action, including on microgeneration and retrofitting.  The climate action plan commits to further strengthening the community energy framework, including community-benefit funds and community-ownership provisions such as in the renewable energy support scheme, RESS.  It is against this backdrop that I will set out SEAI&rsquo;s priorities and actions.<\/p> <p>  The SEAI delivers a number of programmes and initiatives empowering communities and enabling local climate action, including programmes such as the communities energy grant, CEG, sustainable energy communities, SEC, and RESS.  In addition, SEAI works with local authorities on a range of other measures, such as supporting their decarbonisation journey, providing energy and data to support local authority climate action plans, supporting community energy officers and working with local authorities on decarbonisation zones.<\/p> <p>  The CEG programme aims to fund projects that deliver energy savings to a range of homeowners, communities, and private sector organisations.  All projects applying for communities funding are required to include a community benefit to the project and to take a cross-sectoral approach.  The preference is for larger projects, which deliver significant energy savings, to assist and support smaller community projects which may be less cost effective or require additional investment.  Thus far in 2022, the SEAI has received 11 applications to support energy projects with a total value of &euro;74.8 million.  The level of grant support requested is &euro;29.5 million.  The current call for communities projects remains open for applications.<\/p> <p>  The SEAI recognises the importance of the citizen in our transition to a low carbon economy.  The ongoing convergence of energy technology around the individual and trends towards smaller scale energy generation will give the energy citizen more power to help shape our future.  It is essential, therefore, that we prepare society for newer technologies as we move beyond basic energy efficiency.  This will see us promote new behaviours and technologies, beyond early adopters, to society as a whole.<\/p> <p>  The sustainable energy communities programme was set up in 2015 to support communities in the transition to a low carbon society.  Communities are provided with a range of supports as they develop along the SEAI&rsquo;s three-stage journey of learn-plan-do.  The learn stage is the SEC network whereby communities are supported via mentoring and through a peer-to-peer network.  The plan stage is the development of local energy master plans with 100% financial support from the SEAI and the development of a register of opportunities of projects that best suit the community.  The do stage involves actioning what communities can achieve, with support from SEAI programmes, especially the CEG.<\/p> <p>  The 2019 climate action plan set a target of 500 SEC network members by 2025 and 1,500 by 2030.<\/p><p>The SEC network has 655 communities nationwide, and there are 12 local authority members within it.<\/p><p> On RESS, there is a new range of supports for communities that wish to develop a community electricity-generation project for inclusion in the scheme's auction.  These supports include a combination of grants and trusted advisers who guide the projects through the process.  The SEAI has developed an excellent online toolkit of supports and information on the key aspects of renewable energy, including wind, solar, planning and grid.<\/p><p> Another aspect of RESS that the SEAI is responsible for is the management of the community benefit fund national register.  All RESS projects, both commercial and community, must pay into the fund &euro;2 per MWh of electricity generated.  The register has two main objectives: it will act as a transparent information resource for communities to identify where significant sources of funding are available in their localities; and it will have a central registration and reporting system that can be monitored for compliance.  Over the lifetime of the RESS, the value of community-benefit funding is estimated to be in the region of &euro;750 million.  This is a significant investment in local communities from renewable energy projects.<\/p><p> The SEAI supports local authorities through the development of local authority renewable energy strategies, LARESs.  LARESs aim to facilitate the consistency of approach to spatial planning for renewable energy by local and regional planning authorities, guiding the preparation of renewable energy strategies and assisting local authorities in developing robust, co-ordinated and sustainable strategies in accordance with national and EU obligations.<\/p><p> The SEAI public sector programme provides a range of supports to public bodies in the delivery of their 2030 targets.  Local authorities are actively engaged in the partnership delivery of a range of pathfinder projects supported by the SEAI.<\/p><p> The SEAI also provides a range of best-practice guides, energy-reporting advice, supports for energy-performance contracting, dedicated energy advisers and energy management training and mentoring to local authorities.  In addition, every local authority has been asked to select a pilot decarbonisation zone.  The SEAI has worked closely with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to develop draft management guidelines for these zones.  The majority of locations identified as decarbonisation zones are supported by existing SECs in these locations.<\/p><p> We recognise the challenge in empowering Ireland's citizens in the transition to a carbon-free future.  We passionately believe the clean energy transition must happen urgently and we stand ready to support all of society on this journey.  Our programmes are far reaching and have a proven ability to support and enable climate action.  We are ambitious in our strategy to strengthen these platforms of engagement because the challenges ahead require us to work at pace and to deliver ever greater results, learnings and improvements in collaboration with key stakeholders.  We thank our colleagues in the Department of Environment, Climate Action and Communications for their continued support and close collaboration.  I welcome discussion with the committee, and my colleagues and I will be happy to answer any questions members may have for us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022052400002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ciaran Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653346800,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to this meeting on local authority- and community-led climate action.  I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Justina Corcoran, principal officer in the national climate policy division, and Mr. Rory Somers from the retail energy policy division.<\/p> <p>  The climate action plan highlights that the transition to climate neutrality will require changes across our society and economy, including the built environment, energy, transport, waste and agriculture.  This will require a collaborative effort by all levels of government, communities, businesses and individuals to implement new and ambitious policies, technological innovations, systems and infrastructures.  It makes it clear that this will also require changes to individual behaviours, including to how we work, heat our homes, travel, consume goods and services, and manage our waste.  <\/p> <p>  The local authorities have a particularly important role in delivering both climate mitigation and adaptation.  This is reflected in the provisions of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, under which local authorities will have to prepare climate action plans.  These plans will set out the mitigation and adaptation policies, measures and actions required at local level to drive the achievement of our national climate ambition.  The Department is fully committed to ensuring that local authorities are adequately funded to fulfil this important mandate.  Significant funding is in place to support both climate mitigation and adaptation at local authority level.<\/p> <p>  In 2018, the Department entered into a five-year financial commitment of &euro;10 million to establish four climate action regional offices, CAROs.  The CAROs co-ordinate actions between local authorities and assist in the development and monitoring of implementation of 31 local climate adaptation strategies, which are currently being delivered.  Since 2019, the Department has funded and engaged with the CAROs concerning the implementation of an extensive local authority climate action training programme.  More than 13,000 local authority staff received training in 2021 and further courses are in development.<\/p> <p>  Empowering local communities to address the challenges they face in transitioning to carbon neutrality is central to the delivery of the climate action plan.  The National Dialogue for Climate Action, NDCA, is the key mechanism through which climate actions related to public engagement, participation, community action, networking and capacity building are delivered.  As well as acting as the co-ordinating structure facilitating societal engagement on climate action, the NDCA will also provide financial supports for local innovations through the climate action fund.  In November 2021, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, launched the community climate action programme, CCAP, with funding of &euro;60 million over three years from the climate action fund.  The purpose of this funding is to facilitate eligible organisations to collaboratively develop supports, tools, know-how and approaches to assist local communities in taking climate action.<\/p> <p>  The national retrofit plan was published last year as part of Climate Action Plan 2021.  This plan sets out the Government's approach to retrofitting 500,000 homes to a building energy rating of B2 and installing 400,000 heat pumps in existing homes by 2030.  An unprecedented &euro;8 billion in national development plan, NDP, funding will be available to support the implementation of the plan through SEAI residential and community retrofit schemes to 2030.  A total of &euro;267 million has been allocated for these schemes this year.  This is the highest ever allocation for SEAI retrofit schemes and will support almost 27,000 home energy upgrades in communities across the country.  Local authority retrofit funding is in addition to this amount and is provided by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.<\/p> <p>  Funding of &euro;43 million has been allocated for the community energy grant scheme in 2022.  This represents a 43% increase on the 2021 allocation and is the largest ever budget for the scheme.  Under the national retrofit plan, SECs will be supported by the Government to continue and expand their roles as activators.  The plan includes a target to grow this number to 1,500 by 2030.  Members will have got further detail on these initiatives in Dr. Ciaran Byrne's opening statement.<\/p> <p>  Micro- and small-scale generation will also have a key role to play in helping to achieve overall renewable electricity and climate targets and will allow citizens, businesses, communities and local authorities to take part in the energy transition.  The introduction of the clean export guarantee tariff represents the first phase of a comprehensive enabling framework for micro- and small-scale generators in Ireland that allows them to receive payment from their electricity supplier for all excess renewable electricity they export to the grid, reflecting the market value of the electricity.<\/p> <p>  The Government approved the microgeneration support scheme last December.  It provides supports for up to 380 MW of microgeneration by 2030, primarily for self-consumption.  Funding of &euro;16 million has been allocated in 2022 for the scheme, which provides capital grants for new domestic solar photovoltaic, PV, installations.  Later this year, it will also provide grants for new small non-domestic solar PV installations, including public and local authority installations.  Larger non-domestic users, including farms, businesses and public and community buildings, that install new larger installations will be able to avail of a clean export premium tariff that will provide a fixed tariff for 15 years for electricity exported to the grid in conjunction with the clean export guarantee.<\/p> <p>  The climate action plan also commits to the development of a support scheme for small-scale generators that are above 50 kW but smaller than those supported by the RESS.  This is expected to become available by early 2023.<\/p> <p>  In conclusion, we are working closely with colleagues across government and in local authorities and communities throughout the country to further build momentum and ensure that we meet our 2050 net-zero commitments.

The key question concerns implementation.  What, when, where?  This is where I get a bit worried.  So far, the local authorities have failed to roll out any electric vehicle, EV, chargers.  Not a single one has been rolled out.  For three years, they have had grants of &euro;5,000 per charger.  If they are missing the low-hanging fruit, how good are their plans and the execution?<\/p> <p>  SECs are great and motivate many people.<\/p><p>But I would like to see what they are leveraging in actual delivery beyond informing people and getting them to an understanding.  Does the SEAI have tools to ensure that each delivers a certain amount or sets the ambition to deliver a certain energy saving and that they are not waiting for the various obligated entities to come on with those grants?<\/p><p> Last week, a witness told the committee that technology is shifting fast and that we should focus on the shallow first, that is, the early wins.  A company submitted to me that for &euro;350 it can install a heat controller that will save 25% of fuel use in homes but it is not being rolled out on the scale that we ought to see.  The witness last week said that we should exploit the lower-hanging fruit.  Take smart meters.  There are 750,000 installed but they are not being activated to switch people to consume at night.  My question for the SEAI and the Department is how we get from the good planning frameworks to delivering the low-hanging fruit and then the deeper change?  How is that accountability driven?

That is real hand-holding for communities to support them to achieve their ambitions.<\/p> <p>  The development of energy master plans, in which about one third of our communities have participated, helps identify a register of opportunity of projects that then leads them to our community energy grant.

The biggest challenge around community ambition is nearly moderating it.  Communities have so much ambition so we do our best to help them achieve that.

Solar Energy Ireland told us about the impact of restrictions on direct lines for people who could have a solar farm, and possibly sell direct to community buildings or houses.  Section 37 of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 prohibits direct lines going in.  Will the Department change that situation and thus allow communities to produce their own energy and removing the necessity of waiting for a grid connection?<\/p> <p>   My next question is for the SEAI regarding its three-stage journey of learn-plan-do.  Earlier Dr. Byrne said that 655 sustainable energy communities have been established.  Can I have a breakdown on how many SECs have reached each stage?  I have heard anecdotally that many of them only get through the first two stages of learn and plan.  Is that the case?  Is there a high level of attrition?  Has the attrition rate been analysed and reasons sought to explain why community groups do not continue?<\/p> <p>   Finally, LED floodlights are very popular in communities and have sparked a conversation on the importance of LED in energy efficiency.  Is it true that the SEAI will stop providing grants to community sports groups for LED floodlights? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022052400002#E00200","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653346800,"counter":28,"content":"<p>It is likely that the Minister will issue a direction to the local authorities, probably in November or December of this year.

There are a couple of reasons for us leaving it that late.  We have worked with the local authorities, the EPA, Climate Ireland and the CAROs to devise a set of statutory guidelines.  They will cover mitigation or adaptation annexes and set out how the local authority should go about doing this in a coherent and co-ordinated approach.  The guidelines have been signed off by the local authorities but we are going through them internally in the Department.  Once we have those, the Minister will probably issue them along with the direction.

Traditionally, we would have passed the committees on the do phase into the CEG programme and we still do a lot of that, as my colleague has outlined.  As much as 100% of the CEG projects last year had an SEC linked into them.  We are looking at the do phase.  We are trying to understand whether we need to do more within that phase and whether another sub-step is required before they go to the CEG programme.

Certainly the \"do\" stage is the most challenging.  The bar to enter the network is very low.  It is a sharing and learning peer network for communities to find out what other communities are doing and some may never progress.  This is very much a way of supporting communities at their own pace.  We do not put a timeline on them having to move to another stage and it is self-determined but fully recognise that challenge of the \"do\" stage.  The challenge for us is building a pathway for communities into all SEAI programmes.  While the CEG is the most obviously for communities some are interested in, say, the support scheme for renewable heat or the Excellence in Energy Efficiency Design, EXEED, programme.  It is finding ways for communities to participate in their own way.  There are challenges around how grants are structured and seek co-finance.  Up until recently we did not have a multi-annual framework so there is a very tight timeline for them to deliver.  Typically, if this is the first time that they have ran a project then it can take longer so it did not fit in that.  All of these changes have made it an awful lot easier for communities.

Within the community programme, our communities develop their own charter that sets out their aims and ambitions, of which quite a number are to eliminate energy poverty locally, and they really do know the houses to bring in.  With the development of one-stop shops and the extension to the warmer homes scheme, it is easier for communities to refer households into those systems because they themselves may not be in a position to deliver the services directly but they can do the referral.

I thank the witnesses.  I will pick up on some of those points.  In terms of sustainable energy communities, the SEAI came stated that it has a target of 500 SECs by 2025 and that it has 655.  Very often in this field, it is the exact opposite, which says to me, that communities are champing at the bit.  They are eager in this regard.<\/p> <p>  I met with many SECs, which will reflect on the experience.  Some of the issues that have arisen relate to, for example, getting to grips with finance.  A number of local authorities are now supporting them in that regard.  It is a question of getting into the doing phase and delivering.  We will have an opportunity to come back with further questions.  What do the witnesses see as the potential for the SECs in their experience of them thus far?  It seems that there is spectacular potential in terms of identifying place-based solutions on an area-by-area basis, mapping out the areas of greatest need and the potential to address energy poverty.  How do we enable and empower those communities to take the next step?

The potential is absolutely huge.  The ambition that we see at a community level is incredible.  We talk about the stage of doing an energy project, but communities are doing from the very day they start.  I refer to all they do in hosting events and bringing people together, identifying contractors, trying to identify supply chains to do works and trying to see which buildings need the most work.  Even just coming together and having that conversation with local people is hugely valuable to us.  Obviously, during Covid we did not see as much of that, but they have come back very strongly in recent months and we are seeing an awful lot more activity in terms of communities launching energy master plans.  It is very welcome that local authorities have stepped up and are doing the pre-funding of the energy master plan for communities.  A number of local authorities have reached out and said that they see the opportunity there, that those local energy master plans will feed into their climate action plan at a county level.  They see the opportunity to be able to bring them together.  We encourage communities to look for their unique opportunities and challenges.  Personally, and from an ambition point of view, when communities knock on the door, I wish I could hand them their energy master plans and then help them get started, rather than start the process with them having to draw up those plans themselves.  We hold a lot of data in Ireland and we want to try to find better ways to give the information to guide them on their doing stage, which would be hugely valuable.

The Government is dedicated to supporting the community network to engage in the transition.  We have a suite of policy measures that has been implemented in that vein.  The first of those, in terms of communities, was to build a dedicated, ring-fenced community pot into each RESS.  It is a competitive auction for relatively large-scale renewable projects.  As our colleague said, seven projects are currently in RESS 1, involving 23 MW.  They are a mixture of wind and solar projects.  That is direct community involvement.<\/p> <p>  Our colleagues also referenced that RESS has a community benefit fund.  All projects, including community projects, must contribute &euro;2 per megawatt for all electricity generated.  There are projects already generating electricity.  We have two or three projects that are already connected.  One of them is in Ashford, which is the first solar farm project in Ireland.  That means those funds are now beginning to get populated with moneys.  The fund is there to support local communities and local people impacted by those projects.  That money will begin to become available for community projects in the area, including renewable projects.  There is &euro;4 million per annum in terms of the community benefit from RESS 1 alone, across all the projects, and we expect somewhere in the region of &euro;5 million plus for RESS 2, depending on what the final decision is.  That is real money coming into a distributed network of community and commercially related local community sectors.<\/p> <p>  RESS was the first vehicle for the community supports in this suite of measures.  It started with slightly larger-scale projects.  As our colleague mentioned, they are 0.5 MW up to 5 MW.  That is quite a challenge for communities.  We recognise that it is not easy to just go from zero to a relatively large project which requires a lot of professional co-ordination and funding.<\/p><p>We have moved forward with the microgeneration support scheme, as my colleague mentioned in her opening remarks.  That provides grants for, currently, domestic and, soon, non-domestic, including community-based, organisations around solar PV.  They will include sports organisations and non-domestic businesses, including local authorities.  For slightly larger microgenerators from 6 kW to 50 kW, we will introduce an export tariff premium in order for those companies or organisations to get involved in installing solar PV, typically, but also other retrofit technologies.  That is beginning to provide on the other end of the spectrum, in the microgeneration space, supports that can be accessed by the community. <\/p><p>We propose to go to public consultation later this year on a draft small-scale generation support scheme, which fills in the space between 50 kW at the smallest end up to RESS size, maybe even up to 1 MW.  RESS is a competitive auction, so 15 community projects entered RESS and nine were successful.  There is a fall-out rate but we are considering, and it will be part of the public consultation in the small-scale generation, using our ability to use the climate, energy and environmental aid guidelines, CEEAG, from the EU to avoid forcing communities into competitive environment with the potential to make a guaranteed feed-in tariff scheme available to them.

Ireland applied for, and was granted, state aid approval for RESS.  Within that we specifically requested provision for a ring-fenced category for the community sector, which was innovative in relation to what is being done in other member states.  It was heavily scrutinised by the Commission DG ENER and we were granted it.  Events have overtaken us now and the new CEEAG have made it much easier to exclude people from competitive auctions.  One of the conditions put in place by the Commission was that only 1% of the auction could be ring-fenced for the community sector.  We are handcuffed by the state aid in respect of the scheme.  That is why a limited number is available.  Projects that are not successful can compete in subsequent auctions.  If they are not successful in the first round, much of the work done, including technical, financial and planning work and grid connection, can be utilised to go again in the next round.<\/p> <p>  As our colleague from SEAI mentioned, we are planning to introduce next year an easier route for projects to access supports through the small-scale generation scheme.

I missed the very beginning of the meeting because I was out on the picket lines.  As a starting point, Dr. Ciaran Byrne mentioned there is a single homogenous definition of communities.  I want to tease out what that might be.  For example, back in 2018, I met a sixth-year leaving certificate class from a boys school in Sutton who came regularly to the D&aacute;il, looking for our support because they had worked out a plan.  It was very interesting to see young men working out the science and to see the preciseness of what they were doing in order to solar power the entire school and all its needs, and to have solar panels located on the roof.  They were looking everywhere for support but they were getting none, back in the day.  If Dr. Byrne is familiar with the project, he might respond.<\/p> <p>  What struck me was that they were not getting a good response from any Department or, at the time, the SEAI.  If I remember it correctly, the total amount it would have cost was some &euro;20,000 and they were willing to do fundraising to try to raise about half of it but they were not getting support.  Had that been supported and had it worked, there would have been a school in a community that has set an example that could be rolled out elsewhere and that nearly every school could take on board, not just as part of an education of the leaving certificate science students, but also as part of showing what can be done to power through renewable energy an aspect of the community.  That is why am asking about this homogenous definition of community.<\/p> <p> The other point I would like to make about definitions of communities is this.  I live in Dublin South-Central, one of the poorest areas.  I will not say it is disadvantaged but it has a high level of low-income earners throughout the inner city and in places like Ballyfermot and Crumlin.  If they are not highly organised into community groups, how do they get to access this kind of project that the witnesses are talking about?  In other words, do the SEAI and other bodies see it as part of their job to have an outreach programme to make sure all communities are engaged and to ensure nobody is left behind?  One of the witnesses mentioned earlier that the focus is on delivering deeper retrofits and it is Government policy and SEAI policy, and it is very expensive and all the rest of it.<\/p><p>Surely, though, we should be starting with the basics and ensuring that everyone has some way of accessing renewables.  Dare I mention, as Deputy Bruton did, the matter of retrofitting?  The Chairman does not want us to dwell on it, but I have a question.  I have encountered many people who got support 15 or 20 years ago to have their attics lagged.  That lagging is no longer sufficient, perhaps because the material used was not good enough, and they are now living in cold homes.  Every time I ask the SEAI, I am told that these people had work done and are not getting any further support.  Has this situation changed?  I would like a definite answer because I am getting mixed messages from the SEAI.<\/p><p> My final question relates to charging points in apartment blocks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022052400002#H01600","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy, but she has had approximately four and a half minutes.

I thank the witnesses for their presentations.<\/p> <p>  I will pick up on something that Deputy Bruton touched on at the start.  I will not say that there was evasion, but we need to dig deeper into this matter, namely, the fact that no EV charging points have been installed by local authorities.  This is based on a parliamentary question that I tabled to the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications asking how many EV chargers Cork County Council had installed.  The answer was \"Zero\".  The council did not just install zero EV charging points, though.  It also did not apply for any funding under the SEAI&rsquo;s EV public grant scheme, which is specifically for local authorities to provide EV charging points.  Interestingly, the Department confirmed in the reply that the council had asked for a single application form.  This tells me that the council thought about the scheme, looked at it and then decided that the scheme was not for it.<\/p> <p>  I find this disappointing.  We are seeing more EVs on the road.  In future, the majority of people will be charging their EVs at home overnight at lower tariff periods.  For tourism areas in particular, public EV charging points will be vital infrastructure, but people are coming up against brick walls and all types of obstacle to providing charging points in their communities and villages.  I could provide examples.  Durrus is a village between the Mizen Head and Sheep&rsquo;s Head peninsulas and an incredibly popular tourist destination.  It has been trying for years to get an EV charging point through the local authority, failing on every occasion.  That is a shame, given the desire in Durrus.  An even more disappointing scenario arose in Courtmacsherry, another popular tourist destination.

It has been a good engagement thus far.  There have certainly been many good answers coming back from the officials.<\/p> <p>  I begin with the various schemes outlined in the opening statement.  It is useful to hear how certain schemes are progressing.  I caution against the use of acronyms because while I am aware that there are many schemes, we are trying to take people with us here and there is a lot of similarity between those acronyms.  People could get lost.  For the benefit of the committee, will our guests outline the difference between the community energy grant, the sustainable energy communities grant, the renewable electricity support scheme, the community benefit fund and the microgeneration scheme?  I ask because some of them, as I heard in the opening statement, are ones people can apply for.  Local communities were mentioned earlier in a response to one of the other members.  Some of the organisations and groups have already come together.  They are very familiar with making these applications and that is true.  I am more conscious of the ones that are new to the whole idea.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Byrne also mentioned the community energy officers in his opening statement.  Are they going to be there to assist with all these schemes or is it specifically around microgeneration?  Are they there to assist the local authorities in delivering on the authorities' own plans?

We have spoken about that before but by my reckoning things have not improved on that.  There is a great willingness to participate from the public.  Mr. Deegan might provide an update.  People who were previously approved for schemes were mentioned earlier, I think by Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith.  That could have been the new 80% scheme announced earlier this year or indeed a previous scheme many years ago.  Where do those people stand in regard to applying for the new 80% scheme?  Let us say they made an application last year.  The terms have improved, so can they avail of that improved scheme?  The final point concerns the people who have actually had the assessments done.  I think Deputy Bruton spoke about them earlier.  We might refer to this cohort as the low-hanging fruit.  These are simple, semi-detached houses, or maybe end-of-terrace ones.  They are the ones that are easy and straightforward.  However, what of more complex properties?

It is a well-made point.<\/p> <p>  The community energy grant programme is just a larger communities programme that links industry and communities together.  As I mentioned at the outset, you are looking at significant levels of grant applications - up &euro;74 million, with up to &euro;25 million in grant support.  That is the largest of the programmes.  The SEC has a grant within that and it is effectively to fund the energy master plan.  A small community can come together and get a 100% grant for their energy master plan.  Separate to that, my colleague Ms Baker outlined the renewable energy support scheme.  Within that we have a grant available for the schemes on their journey towards their renewables projects.  Separate to that again is when they are up and running and generating electricity, there is a community benefit fund which is effectively the money going back.  That is it at a very high level.

We have schemes to support people who want to make applications for a single home.  That amounts to the bulk of our customer-facing programmes.  The community energy grant scheme, which Mr. Byrne mentioned, supports people who live in more complicated buildings like apartments and multi-family homes.  We are looking at what the uptake is, how we can deliver that and what technologies are available.  There is an opportunity in the future to move into solutions other than those available today, like heat pumps and things like that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about complex buildings such as older buildings.  Generally, in the Irish housing stock there is cement based or concrete construction that commenced from the 1930s onwards.  Many of those homes are very suitable for the products we support through our schemes.  Many of the older homes, which some people call heritage buildings or buildings that are protected, were constructed a long time ago, maybe more than 100 years ago.  They perform differently from a physics perspective because some of those buildings need to breathe.  They need specific insulation or materials during retrofitting.  The Department carried out a consultation on this and is developing guidance on how to retrofit those homes and the appropriate materials to do so.<\/p> <p>  SEAI has funded the retrofitting of older homes but some of those older homes face a challenge in the market, which is recognised by the Department and the industry.  Our schemes require the materials used to meet certain standards and to be agr&eacute;ment certified because we want to make sure the right product goes in, that the home is upgraded to the right level, so that there will not be a problem down the road in a number of years time.  That is really important and is the reason the Department and NSAI are doing this study into what are the appropriate products that we can support.  When that study is complete, we will incorporate that into our grant schemes to support those homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022052400002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian O'Mahony"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653346800,"counter":127,"content":"<p>By way of information on the State aid issue, RESS is an auction-based support scheme for grid-scale renewables and it is there to deliver on the objective of reaching the 80% renewable electricity target by 2030.  It is a very substantial target, higher than any other member state is attempting to reach.  We are very much at the vanguard of the deployment of renewable electricity into the electricity grid.  In order to do that, there is guaranteed funding for the successful prices bid.  At the moment, we all recognise that with electricity prices being high, there is no need for the public service obligation levy, PSO, to fund because there is no gap between the market value of electricity they receive and their bid price.  However, those projects would not go ahead unless they had an insurance policy, if they were not underwritten by the PSO for times when we all hope electricity prices will reduce again; it certainly was the case when the scheme was developed and approved by the former Minister who is sitting with us today.<br\/><br\/>When one relies on the public service obligation levy, from which public money is effectively used through the payment of electricity customers, one has obligations in relation to state aid.  The committee is probably aware that member states are obliged to comply with state aid regulations.  For small amounts of money there are <i>de minimis<\/i>amounts.  There is a self-reporting requirement under general block exemption regulations, whereby the member state has to notify the EU, but there is not a lot of other reporting.<br\/><br\/>With the scale of moneys required under the RESS scheme overall, billions of euro, the EU has a policy around interfering in the marketplace and it wants everything done on a competitive basis because the electricity market is an open, competitive market.  To allow us to have the community ring-fenced category within the State aid approval was innovative at member state level within the EU.  It was a departure for the Commission and I wish to say that upfront.  It was also recognised by the Government that it wanted to include communities and bring them along the journey.  That was the reason we went to the Commission knowing it was something it had not supported in the past but we recognised as a Government and a Department that it was important to separate community involvement.  We believe in the principle that if you bring the communities along, it will support and reinforce local attitudes towards grid-scale renewables.  To get them involved directly, initially in the renewable electricity support scheme, they had to be at least 51% owned by community members.  That was recently changed for RESS 2.  That figure is now 100% owned by community members.  That is to deal with the potential.  There were other examples, such as in Germany, where that was attempted but developers found ways around that to take up that capacity within the auctions in Germany.  We wanted to avoid that, and the requirement in RESS 2 is for 100% community owned.  That again puts us at the vanguard of what is happening in the EU.<br\/><br\/>I was in Brussels last week at a seminar of the Commission with all the member states on active consumers in energy communities.  We were invited to present to the other member states on what we have done in Ireland in relation to the supports and how we are developing the community network.  The response from the Commission was that we were very far ahead of many other member states.  I wish to tease that out a little bit.  Many countries have done community-activated projects, but that has happened primarily in the past ten years.  There is very little going on with a lot of stagnation in that space. Many member states are looking at it in a purely competitive, market price environment.  Communities are offered the opportunity to participate but they do not participate.  From our perspective, the Commission was very interested in the fact that we have these community supports through the SEAI that are very well developed and clear.  We have a network of a huge number of active sustainable energy communities that are widely dispersed across the country and are supporting community efforts to get involved across a range of activities.  The fact that we were funding this directly with Exchequer funding was also a point of note.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022052400002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Rory Somers"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":128,"content":"<p>It is very interesting to hear that.

That is a key part of the Government's approach and it is the right approach.  We are looking at sectoral emissions ceilings.<\/p> <p>  How will we achieve things if we do not ensure there is more than an opt-in from local authorities?  I know we had a witness with us a couple of weeks ago, Mr. Seamus Hoyne, from the climate action regional offices who does education.  He looked at county and city development plans before engaging with the councils.  He looked at how they might be improved to help to ensure there was more sustainable development.  The question is whether that is enough.

My first question is for the SEAI.  Its opening statement stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWe are catalysts for action through our grant and incentive programmes and capacity-building processes.  Citizens, communities, businesses and other stakeholders are at the heart of everything we deliver. <\/blockquote> <p>Many of these schemes were conceived when we were in a different position.  We are now in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis in respect of fuel, rent and shortly food too.  There is a war going on on our Continent.  A previous meeting of the committee heard there was some confusion among the public around the grants and incentives that exist and around applying for them.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul recommended that local community energy advisers be deployed in communities for two reasons.  First they would act as a point of information and second they could target certain people.  We all know our communities well and we know the people who are involved in things like the Tidy Towns.  They are often retired people who have time but there is another cohort who are working every hour God sends and are collecting their children from cr&egrave;ches and so on and they do not really have time to find this information.  What efforts are the local SEAI groups making to target those working people who are in good jobs and who may be new to experiencing fuel poverty, as well as those who are well used to it?  How are we actually targeting those people?  They often do not have the time to find out what is available.<\/p><p>My next question is for the Department.  Earlier sessions have heard about the national retrofit scheme.  Is there a named person in each local authority with the responsibility for sign-off to ensure that public money and grants are going to the right people and being spent?  Is there a person or a group of people that they report to at national level?  Is there a scrutiny process?  Is that information published?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022052400002#N01100","speaker":"1585"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653346800,"counter":159,"content":"<p>On grant funding, we launched our new array of grants in February.  The main ones is the warmer home scheme, which is fully 100% funded.  That takes into account of whatever the current market costs are.  The other schemes, the generation schemes, are demand-led.  There is the community energy grant scheme which we talked a bit about here and the one-stop shop, OSS, and the better energy home scheme.  The OSS and better energy home scheme have aligned in grant levels.  Those grant levels were set late last year after they were quantity surveyed.  We looked at the cost in the market and at the existing schemes.  We did a lot of work with behavioural economics, quantity surveyor, QS, costs and the market to set the grant levels.  The Deputy rightly identified that the situation has changed and rapidly with the cost of living and particularly around the energy sector especially after the war in Ukraine.  Recognising that when the schemes were launched, we put in 80% grant levels for attic and cavity insulation which is a very significant level of funding to address those who may not qualify for the warmer home scheme but who have smaller disposable income.  That was specifically included to get a relatively affordable measure that could be delivered quickly and adds value to the person's home.<\/p> <p>  The SEAI does participate in the energy security emergency group and we are working on a vulnerable households scheme.

We also host things like energy clinics where people can drop in with any queries they have.  One of our communities set up something they called Watt Watchers.  It is a bit like Weight Watchers but you come in with your energy bill and understand how to reduce your watt usage each month to try and overcome the challenges of people not understanding their bill or what to expect when they get their next bill.  We do a lot of education around that side of it to help people to address the concerns they may have.  That local conversation around energy questions that people have and giving advice is there.  I believe we participated in a recent campaign around energy saving opportunities in light of the recent price increases.  We have upgraded the level of information through a new booklet to help people as well.

There is a significant drive towards supporting the UN sustainable development goals, specifically calling out climate adaptation and education as some of the key elements of that.  There is a percentage allocation of those funds that has to be spent towards that, and there are caps as to what can be spent in other areas.  Our role is to maintain the national register of that process so, as each individual project comes online, it will register through us and we will then maintain an annual reporting cycle and measure its compliance with those terms and conditions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022052400002#O01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andy Fox"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":173,"content":"<p>Does anyone wish to take my question about the community initiative in respect of shared vehicles and facilities that would accelerate our decarbonisation of travel?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022052400002#O01200","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653346800,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I will so as not to leave a hanging end.

I am really keen, as is I think everyone else on the committee, when we talk about climate change that we also talk about biodiversity and making sure any actions that are taken to address and to meet our climate targets do not inadvertently impact biodiversity.  Yesterday I was contacted by someone asking about swifts and whether they had started migrating back into Ireland yet because they have been quite late this year.  There has been a 60% decline in swift numbers over the past 20 years.  Someone replied to me privately to say they had got their house retrofitted.  Swifts used to live under the eaves of the house, but they got external insulation on it and they do not have swifts any more.  Is that something the SEAI takes into account or has the Department even considered it?  Is there even a very basic assessment to be done on houses that are retrofitted to ensure that, if they are to be retrofitted to the point that they will impact bat or bird species, alternatives such as swift boxes are provided to those households as part of the retrofitting package?  The witnesses were not expecting that question, were they?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022052400002#O01900","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653346800,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  I have as much a professional as a personal interest in this area.  The number of swifts has declined catastrophically.  The number of bird species generally, since the 1970s, has declined catastrophically.  The short answer is that it is not something we look at in detail at present.  To get into the biology of this, swifts often lose their nests when homes are externally retrofitted but they can rebuild the nests.  There is nothing stopping them.  There is a really interesting initiative with Birdwatch Ireland I came across, whereby swift boxes are pinned up and aligned over the retrofit.  That helps biodiversity.  We have to look into this more.  As for our current schemes and what we can do, there are bat roofs and so on.  They are probably more for heritage buildings.  Bats and many other species are protected under the various Wildlife Acts, so certain works cannot be done while there are bats in place.  There are probably separate procedures in respect of wildlife regarding heritage buildings, but the Deputy's point is really well made and it is something we will look into.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022052400002#O02000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ciaran Byrne"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":182,"content":"<p>I would appreciate it if the SEAI would take it into account when looking at this.

I am delighted to say that a group in Clonakilty was successful in a 5 MW project.  It is very much community-led, driven by the chamber of commerce there, with all dividends from the proceeds generated from the generation of the electricity going back into the community.<\/p><p>Community is very much at the heart of it.  The project is still far from being delivered and there are many obstacles to overcome.  I am sure many community projects throughout the country will encounter issues with delivery, some of which were alluded to, including cost and the different aspects of it.  One of the aspects that has been highlighted by some of the projects is connection to the closest power station.  The solar farm might be located in one location but the power station may be located, in some cases, a kilometre away.  In most cases, that will require the laying of a cable between the solar farm and the power station using public roads.  That brings with it the cost of road cutting, road closure and installation, which adds up to tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of euro.<\/p><p> To bring it back to local authorities and how we can help them out, is there any way, to help the final delivery of the scheme, either SEAI or the Department would help out communities through them?  They could do so by compensating local authorities for waiving, for example, road closure fees, which can be quite expensive.  Could they help out with the cost of laying the cable, especially where it is a community-driven and community-led project?  That particular project in Clonakilty is phenomenal because 5 MW is the energy use of Clonakilty and the surrounding area in the summer months.  On certain days in the summer, we could meet the power needs of the entire town through this renewable energy source that will, in essence, take the town off-grid, which is the future.

That is typically done in a competitive commercial environment.  In granting approval for the community pot, the European Commission limited the scope of the state aid for the community ring-fenced pot to 1% over the course of the RESS approval.  I stress that the RESS approval was up to 2025.  For the RESS to progress beyond that, a further assessment would be required.  The state aid approval that follows subsequent auctions within the period after that could have different rules under revised state aid approval.<\/p> <p>  As I said earlier, the CEEAG eclipsed the original RESS state-aid approach on the basis that those community projects of between 0.5 MW and 5 MW that are allowed for within RESS today had to be in a competitive environment when RESS was approved.  They no longer need to be.  That is where it is possible for them to be taken out of the competitive environment and it is then up to the Department to decide what support arrangements are appropriate.  I mentioned that the small-scale generation scheme, which would be a different mechanism and a guaranteed feed-in tariff, is one possible way of filling that gap.<\/p> <p>  If we look at the continuum of what we are trying to do from a policy perspective, it is important to recognise that as was mentioned earlier we started with one project in one location which took ten years to come to fruition and very much community led fully delivered by the local community efforts and funding.  We really need to move forward bringing communities through the phases of development.<\/p> <p>  RESS has provided the first opportunity for that.  We anticipate that those successful RESS 1 projects as entities could continue to produce second and third projects in subsequent auctions.  When they become scaled community entities in their own right, they no longer need to be ring-fenced.  They become experienced and ought to become efficient and competitive in their own right and no longer need the benefit of a ring-fenced community pot.  That is a long-term aim.  It will take a number of years to achieve.  That assumes they are fairly large projects.  We have another route.  Microgeneration is the local community self-consumption model.  Small-scale generation is the bit in between which marries the ability for small-scale generators to do it primarily for self-consumption but also creates an avenue for them to participate without getting into a competitive environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022052400002#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Rory Somers"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":202,"content":"<p>I had a question on EnergyCloud.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022052400002#Q00600","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653346800,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I might take that question.  Regarding smart technologies and digitisation, the Deputy will be aware that there are 750,000 smart meters.  We believe that smart meters are a key enabling infrastructure to allow for the digitisation of the energy transition.  In the first instance, they provide people with quick information on their own energy consumption.  That allows them to make behavioural change to reduce their energy consumption and to get the benefit of that through their bills.  That is just a pricing behavioural change.  They can then move their consumption patterns and change their consumption equipment to use less energy and be more energy efficient by moving off peak, which brings a benefit to the overall grid.  They can be incentivised to do that.  The way that incentive works is that the time-of-use and volume-of-use change of behaviour is recompensed from their energy supplier through lower off-peak tariffs and also specifically through load-shifting demand-response services that they can offer into the market.<\/p> <p>  From a renewable generation perspective, we are obviously talking about people not only consuming electricity and electrifying the consumption of energy by moving from fossil fuel heating systems to heat pumps and from fossil fuel combustion engine cars to electrified mobility but also about generation.  When they become prosumers, they are generating their own electricity for their own self-consumption and they can then sell that electricity on the grid.  On 15 February the Minister signed the regulations which transpose those articles of the recast renewable energy directive that allow and provide an obligation for suppliers to remunerate those prosumers for any electricity they export to the grid at the market value for that electricity.<\/p> <p>  Given that the market value is quite high at the moment, it might seem a glib statement but the one upside to high wholesale energy prices is that those people who are selling electricity onto the grid are getting considerably more for it today - and will get paid for it by the beginning of July onwards - than they would have done 12 months ago.  That makes the business case for investing in renewable technology so much better.  By self-consuming, people are avoiding the cost of the retail price of electricity for consumers.  They can then get additional remuneration to pay back the investment by exporting the electricity they cannot consume themselves, the residual, and get paid at the market value of that electricity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022052400002#Q00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Rory Somers"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":204,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Deegan wish to comment on the EnergyCloud proposition, namely, the social enterprise of linking industry with an approved housing body to try to support people to get out of energy poverty?

I have a smart meter and I do not know what its benefit is because all I can do is request at the end of the day what my energy usage was.  I have queried this with the CRU.  Should the Department insist we have dynamic tariffs, as opposed to just on-peak and off-peak tariffs?  My understanding of some of the off-peak tariffs is that people need to wait until midnight and run their washing machines at night, but it is not good advice for anybody to be switching on electrical appliances going to bed.

Is there a timeline for when we are going to move from that phase to allowing more people to opt into this programme?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022052400002#Q01100","speaker":"1635","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653346800,"counter":209,"content":"<p>The smart metering programme is a large-scale infrastructure project to replace all the electricity meters in Ireland by the end of 2024 or early 2025.  It involves more than &euro;1 billion of investment with 2.3 million meters to be replaced.  Therefore, it will take time to implement.  The programme commenced in 2019.  As the Senator pointed out, some 750,000 smart meters have been installed already.  Each month, some 40,000 meters are installed.  By the end of this year, the project is on target to have installed 1.1 million smart meters, which will be approximately half of all electricity consumers, certainly domestic consumers.  Returning to the seminar with the Commission, this puts us ahead of many European member states.  Some large countries have fully rolled out their electricity smart meter programmes, but a greater number of member states have done no work in smart metering.  Therefore, we are relatively well advanced.<\/p> <p>  The programme is managed by the CRU and ESB Networks is involved in the delivery of the meters themselves.  The CRU is an independent regulator.  I probably do not need to explain that the Department's role is never to instruct the CRU.  It has statutory power and obligations.  We do, however, work closely with the CRU on the national smart metering programme and we receive regular updates in that regard.  Specifically on the question of tariffs, there is an obligation on all suppliers now to provide at least one standard smart tariff.  Typically, this is a day-night peak tariff.  In the context of tariffs as well, though, Ireland has been operating time-of-use tariffs for more than 30 years in the context of day-night meters.  It is a well-established pattern in Ireland that people have been incentivised to move in this way and to shift from peak times.  My understanding, and I could stand corrected on this point, is that this off-peak time runs from 11 p.m.-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022052400002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Rory Somers"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":210,"content":"<p>These would be dynamic tariffs, similar to what is in Germany, whereby people would get a notification on their phones to inform them that a certain time would be a good one to use a large appliance.

Dynamic tariffs in a European sense are those tariffs that are reflective of changes in the wholesale market.  A recent report from the EU's Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators, ACER, on the experience of this type of tariff in Spain, where more than 1 million customers had been moved to dynamic tariffs, showed it had been a good system for those people when electricity prices were low, because they had benefited.  As soon as electricity prices started to increase during the recent crisis, however, the customers on the dynamic tariff were exposed to the full market costs associated with those tariffs.  It was quite a shock for many people.  Therefore, there are many lessons to be learned around dynamic tariffs.<\/p> <p>  I think what the Senator was referring to, though, in the language we use, is \"demand response\", which is where messages are sent to end users to do particular things to deal with a specific and short-term benefit they can provide to the system.  This is something the Department is certainly working on with the CRU.  It does require the infrastructure of the smart meter system to be fully deployed.  At the moment, there is a smart meter change in respect of the IT systems and a market settlement solution that goes with that.  All the information gathered by those meters is sent back to the central database hub.  ESB Networks then has the ability to share that information with suppliers on behalf of those end consumers who have registered with smart meters.  That then allows the suppliers to be able to offer different tariff arrangements and different time-of-use tariffs and the type of dynamic pricing that the Senator referred to.  This system is due to be implemented on 27 June.  This is the latest information we have.  We are therefore on the cusp of achieving this outcome in respect of the critical mass of smart meters we have available in Ireland.  We will reach a stage where 50% of them have been installed by the end of this year.  In that context, some 30,000 people have moved over to smart tariffs with a day-night peak.  It is a small number of people as a percentage of the 750,000 meters deployed.<\/p> <p>  An initiative in this regard is under way involving the CRU and suppliers.  I have seen recent adverts in the media promoting the use of smart meters.  This is being done in the context of smart tariffs and the benefit those can yield to consumers on costs when we now have high electricity prices and people are struggling with their energy bills.  It also, however, involves benefits for the system itself.  From there, it will be another step forward for suppliers to react to the availability of all these data and offer tariffs not for products, but in respect of moving into the dynamic sphere of electricity pricing.  <\/p> <p>  A good message we need to remember is that this is a complex area.  As much as we do our very best to make this accessible to the end consumer, even professional energy services companies struggle with the complexities in the market and how much dynamic shifting there is in pricing and how that can create risks for them.  There is no intention here to try to expose end consumers to any of these risks.  Therefore, it is extremely important that we get clear messages out to people regarding whether participating will be something that will change their ability to sit back and relax and depend on fixed tariffs, as opposed to having to be careful about entering into commitments that will expose them to the market.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022052400002#R00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Rory Somers"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":212,"content":"<p>The CRU said it will react to Government and Departmental policy.

They do not have to provide a bid or performance bond, as is required in the commercial sphere.  Therefore, several factors make it easier for them to compete.

The scheme is a key action in the Government's comprehensive action plan for survivors and former residents of the mother and baby and county home institutions.  Following on from the State apology in January 2021, the action plan was developed to demonstrate the State's commitment to recognising and responding to the suffering experienced, and to support survivors who were so badly failed in these institutions.<\/p> <p>  Given the payment scheme's scale, the Government agreed that it should be grounded in statute.  This legislation, therefore, aims to support a user-friendly, one-stop-shop approach for applicants, as well as providing for lawful access to records.<\/p> <p>  I will broadly and briefly set out what is covered by the proposed legislation.  An applicant to the payment scheme is referred to as a \"relevant person\" in the heads of the Bill.  The definition of a \"relevant person\" encompasses a person who was resident as a child or as a mother in one of the institutions listed in schedule 1 of the heads of the Bill.  The scheme will be administered by an executive office established within the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  This arrangement provides the best opportunity to open the scheme to applications as quickly as possible, following the enactment of the legislation.  This is because we can work on setting up the office in parallel with our work on the legislation.  While the office of the chief deciding officer of the mother and baby institutions payment scheme will be part of the Department, the chief deciding officer will be statutorily independent in the performance of her or his functions.  She or he will also have staff.<\/p> <p>  Heads 7 to 10 set out the general duties and powers of the chief deciding officer.  He or she will make determinations on applicants' eligibility to the scheme, in accordance with criteria and processes that are set out later in the legislation.  He or she will also advertise the scheme, prepare an annual report on its operation and have the power to delegate operations to the staff of the executive office to ensure efficient administration of the scheme.<\/p> <p>  A number of the heads between 11 and 24 concern the benefits available under the scheme, as well as the application and determination processes.  The benefits include a general payment, a work-related payment, a form of enhanced medical card or, for those who live outside of Ireland, a once-off health support payment of &euro;3,000 in lieu of the enhanced medical card.<\/p> <p>  It is the intention that payments will be disregarded for the purposes of income tax and means assessments and work is ongoing with the Departments of Health, Finance and Social Protection in this regard.<\/p> <p>  Staff of the executive office will have the power to search the commission&rsquo;s database and related records so that they can assist an applicant in providing relevant information and to verify information.  Staff will also have the authority to request relevant information from the bodies listed in schedule 2 of the heads of the Bill, where relevant.<\/p> <p>  The Department is currently preparing a data processing impact assessment in relation to the processing of personal data and special category personal data under the scheme and has engaged with the Data Protection Commission as required.  The eligibility criteria for each of the scheme's benefits are included in heads 18, 19 and 21.  A general payment may be made to an applicant who was resident as a child in a relevant institution for six months or more, and to an applicant who was resident as a mother in a relevant institution for at least one night.  A work-related payment may be payable to any mother who was in the Tuam institution or a county home for at least three months, as well as to a mother who was resident in another relevant institution for a minimum of three months and who undertook commercial work without pay outside of that institution.  The overarching rates for these payments are set out in schedule 3.<\/p> <p>  Applicants who were resident in a relevant institution for at least six months will be entitled to an enhanced medical card and those who live abroad can choose a health support payment in lieu of the card.<\/p> <p>  Head 22 provides that in order to receive a payment from the scheme, an applicant will be required to sign a waiver.  The waiver would only be signed at the point where the applicant accepts an offer, so he or she will know precisely what they are being offered prior to signing.  The waiver is not attached to the enhanced medical card or the health support payment.<\/p> <p>  A person can apply to the scheme on behalf of a \"relevant person\" where the \"relevant person\" does not have the capacity to apply or has died since the date of the State apology.<\/p> <p>  Heads 25 to 34 provide for a number of other matters related to the administration of the scheme, including rights of review and appeal, support for legal costs, the carrying out of independent reviews of the scheme's operation and the power to add additional institutions to schedule 1.<\/p> <p>  We thank the committee again for the invitation today and we are happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022052400002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Laura McGarrigle"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":230,"content":"<p>Thank you very much Ms McGarrigle.

There are also little traumas caused by the consistent, everyday chipping away at somebody's sense of safety and what that means in the world.  The idea that it is in any way related to childhood trauma is premised on a shaky bed of accuracy.  Trauma can be caused by a one-off event.  One can witness an accident.  A child could have witnessed violence against her mother in the first month or two of life and heard the mother wailing beside her every night.  There are many things that can happen in a moment that have nothing to do with a point in time.  I struggle with the six months and the designation as unduly long and that type of thing.

If an unborn child is <i>in utero<\/i>and the mother is in one of those settings, is that period counted?  There is a lot of research that shows there will be effects if a mother is not properly nourished and stressed.  I note that many of the women concerned carried out commercial work without pay.  Another way of putting that would be that they were engaged in slave labour.  If a woman is engaged in slave labour and is pregnant and stressed out, and knows there is going to be a negative outcome, that is going to have serious implications for the development of the child <i>in utero<\/i>.

In a previous life I was a primary schoolteacher, so I know that a lot of our major software as human beings is installed <i>in utero<\/i>or in the first 72 hours.  If a mother experiences a trauma during that early period, it can have profound and life-altering or life-limiting consequences on the individual.  I think that the six-month cut-off point is arbitrary and idiosyncratic.  Is it based on evidence?  If so, who supplied the evidence?  Will the Department take into account whether the child was there with the mother while she was pregnant?  Will that time be counted?

All of this caused the IDG to propose very strongly the general payment approach that would provide for a single common experience payment, grounded in the length of stay, as a way of recognising these harsh institutional experiences without requiring people to bring forward evidence of abuse.  The IDG did not look to bring in experts that would speak to individual trauma at the level of designing an individualised approach.  Again, it was very mindful not to disregard in any way the experience of children who were in a mother and baby home for fewer than six months, and instead to recognise counselling support and access to records as key measures that would respond to needs that the IDG understood had been raised as priority needs in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022052400002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Laura McGarrigle"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":251,"content":"<p>May I respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022052400002#C00300","speaker":"1699"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":252,"content":"<p>Time is tight but I may let the Senator back in after Deputy Murnane O'Connor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022052400002#C00400","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":253,"content":"<p>Please forgive me for asking but this is my first time to be a member of a committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022052400002#C00500","speaker":"1699"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":254,"content":"<p>The Senator is very good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022052400002#C00600","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":255,"content":"<p>My concerns are the same as previous speakers.  We must remember that this process has been very painful for survivors.  I feel strongly about the fact that  survivors are getting older, so timing is of the utmost importance.  The longer this matter goes on, the longer people will have to wait and the harder it is on them because they must constantly fight a battle, which is unfair to them.  We must be very aware of our timing on this matter.<\/p> <p>  I, too, am concerned about the six-month period and feel that it is unfair.  We must be very mindful that a day or a week is very hard for survivors.  I ask that the committee considers this matter.  The Minister has explained the matter and Ms McGarrigle has explained it just now.  Like others, we have spoken to survivors.  Nothing can repay the heartache that they have experienced.  The Government has provided a good bit of money and we must be mindful of survivors.<\/p> <p>  At one stage an interim payment of &euro;10,000 or &euro;15,000 was spoken about.  Perhaps that proposal should be examined again because survivors are getting older.  The provision of an enhanced medical card to survivors is the most important thing we can do.<\/p> <p>  Earlier the assistant Secretary General mentioned counselling and I welcome that.  I believe we should provide counselling to families because so many survivors and their survivors have been affected.  I emphasise that families feel stress every day when they talk to their mothers.  These experiences have been very hard on survivors and their families.  I ask the Department to recognise the need to provide supports and counselling to families.<\/p> <p>  There is another issue that arose when we spoke about the redress scheme.  People raised with me the need for the application process to be as simple, clear and transparent as possible.  That is an important aspect for survivors too.<\/p> <p>  Another important issue that has been raised is the need to provide an advocate, social worker or adviser to assist survivors in liaising with the Department.  Another area that arose when I met survivors, and I am involved with survivors in my own area, is regional and local accessibility.  Both of these aspects must be addressed.  I feel that issues have arisen that we can try to sort out.  If survivors are watching this debate, I am sure it has not been easy for them.

Then I will explain how it runs, respond to the timing question and speak about having a scheme that is simple, clear and transparent.  I will also answer the question on the interim payment.<\/p> <p>  It is the firm intention of the Minister to establish the scheme as quickly as possible but that depends on the passage of this legislation.  That is one of the factors behind the IDG's recommendation that we establish an executive office where we can do an awful lot more work in parallel than if an agency were to be created, which would take a longer lead-in time to establish.  It would take time to establish all of the ancillary infrastructure that an agency would need, which is not needed in a Department as it can start to leverage existing ICT, human resources, etc.<\/p> <p>  I confirm that there is a commitment to establish the scheme as quickly as possible.  The Deputy mentioned the need for a firm commitment.  That is something that came through strongly in the consultation with survivors and stakeholders, and it was a key concern of the IDG.  The IDG recommended that the scheme be as clear, transparent, simple and user-friendly as possible so that entitlements  would be very clear.  Again, that is the idea - the general approach would be one where it is very clear to applicants that the payment is based on the length of time a person was a resident.  One would know that if one were a resident, one would have a good degree of certainty in terms of applying to the scheme and qualifying for benefits versus having to bring forward a burden of proof.  Obviously that is also a much more straightforward and efficient type of scheme to run than one that would require individual engagement with people having to bring forward evidence, which would have the potential to have a traumatising effect.  There is also the question of the length of time such a process would take.  These aspects are very much reflected in the intention of putting together this general scheme and in the work that the team is undertaking at the moment to prepare the infrastructure to deliver the scheme.<\/p> <p>  We appreciate that people are very keen for an interim payment to be made.  Also, it is very important that the scheme is opened up as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>A practical challenge is that because the scheme is already designed to provide one payment, which is based as simply as possible on residence, it is not apparent how we would make an interim payment in any faster way, particularly because we require the same infrastructure to make the payment.  Therefore, we need the IT system and the human resources in place to make the interim payment in the same way we would need it to make the full payment.  The scale of this scheme is way in excess of any other of its kind the State has ever administered in terms of the anticipated 34,000 applicants at an estimated cost of &euro;800 million.  With the expected number of applicants, the scheme is the largest of its kind in the history of the State.  We need a legislative basis for access to records and data sharing.  For those reasons, unfortunately, we cannot see how we can move any faster because we need those core blocks to make any form of payment but we are committed to wanting to do this as quickly as possible in the interests of survivors.<\/p><p> The Deputy mentioned advocacy and support for people making applications.  Action 1, which is a measure that sits within a much broader Government response and a suite of measures to respond to the needs and concerns of survivors and to recognise the wrong that was done and the suffering, is the creation of enhanced stakeholder engagement mechanisms.  We are currently working on proposals for a new form of advocate model that would enhance the level of advocacy support provided in this space.  That is something we hope to progress alongside progressing this scheme as well as ensuring existing mechanisms can be supported.  <\/p><p> The Deputy mentioned the fact that nothing can repay what has happened to people.  That point, absolutely, was very much recognised in the work of the IDG.  It is so sad but, sadly, we cannot give back what was taken away.  We cannot hope to compensate.  Therefore, this scheme, as part of the broader action plan, is an attempt to acknowledge, recognise and make amends for the suffering and wrong but recognising that no money can compensate and it does not attempt to do so.  It attempts to recognise and acknowledge.<\/p><p> The Deputy also mentioned counselling for families.  The commitments made and the supports put in place to date for counselling services and prioritised access are for survivors and former residents.

It is just part of the discussion and the dialogue.  I am just concerned about an aspect of this matter.  The length of time spent at the site of the trauma does not correlate in any way with the outcomes of the trauma.  Trauma is an inevitable organic and automatic consequence of being in the wrong place at the wrong time but there is no evidence whatsoever that its depth equates to the length of time spent at that place.  There cannot be a quantitative measure of the manner in which trauma is inflicted.  It is a qualitative, experiential phenomenological event in someone&rsquo;s life.  If one is exposed to those circumstances, one automatically qualifies irrespective of the length of time.  That is evidence based.<\/p><p>The other thing I am concerned about is the arbitrary decision to disregard or exclude time spent <i>in utero<\/i>.  Again, this is not evidence based.  It is not an intellectual position.  There has been an <i>a priori<\/i>assumption that we are just not going to consider that.  I would reference those two factors taken together.  I point to the absence of an evidence basis leading to an arbitrary, unnecessary and cruel distinction between categories of survivors based on six months, one day or three months in residence.  Given that we will spend so much money on this scheme as a republic, is it possible at any stage in the process to reverse or remove that provision?  I do not know if that can be done or if it is something we would have to revisit.  I would be concerned about that. <\/p><p>Regarding the expert advice that was consulted, without naming those experts what were their disciplines or their professional formation?  How could they be replied upon to have arrived at those conclusions when to me as a layperson it is quite clear?  I have published on trauma as an academic but the approach being pursued in this instance seems very clearly not to be evidence based.  I am curious to know what was discipline area or the professional formation of the experts the Department consulted in drafting these arbitrary timeframes of six months, one day etc.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022052400002#D00500","speaker":"1699"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653346800,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I apologise if my earlier answer was not clear.  When I referenced national and international evidence earlier, it was not with respect to an individual psychiatrist or psychologist coming in and speaking to us.  I was referring to evidence we gained from taking learnings from other schemes within this jurisdiction and in other jurisdictions.  One example the IDG would have thought interesting in terms of learning, which is referenced in its published report, was the Australian stolen generation scheme.  We would have examined it with respect to learnings from the perspective of the best way to construct a scheme that would deliver for survivors in a way that would not retraumatise and that would do no harm.  The principle of &quot;do no harm&quot; was a key point put to us by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC.<br\/><br\/>The stolen generation scheme would have started out with individualised payments that might have been set based on trauma and abuse.  The individual assessor reported to the Australian Government and recommended moving away from that model to a common experience payment for a couple of reasons.  First, he felt that he was being asked to make individualised judgments that were subjective in nature.  He thought this could lead to unfair judgments as he was trying to gauge one person&rsquo;s level of suffering and trauma <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>another in making these individualised assessments.  He was also worried that it was deeply retraumatising for the individuals affected and it was causing them to feel let down by the process and feel retraumatised.  There was a concern among advocates in Australia that it was also proving to be a more divisive approach.  For that reason, the scheme in Australia moved to a common experience model instead.<br\/><br\/>When I referred to the evidence, it was evidence of that level that was informing the IDG when it recommended that in putting parameters around the scheme, the general approach of the scheme would be one that would be non-adversarial and grounded in a common experience payment based on residency.  Within that, there is a length of residency scale.  The rationale for that, which the IDG put forward, was that the longer the length of stay, the longer one endured the harsh conditions, particularly noting the harshest conditions were associated with longer lengths of stay in earlier decades of the State when conditions, particularly in county homes or in Tuam, were really appalling.  It recognised that this is a scheme on an unprecedented scale that takes account of survivors coming from many different institutions over a span of many decades.  If we look at the commission, we see that this was across eight decades.  The age range of survivors spans quite a number of decades.  It is quite a broad demographic as well.

The enhanced medical card is one of the key features.  The six-month cut-off point is a major issue but previous speakers raised that matter, so I will not do so again.  What is actually covered by an enhanced medical card?  A number of women have asked me that question.  Some were left to give birth in horrific circumstances which resulted in lifelong medical conditions.  That can be very personal for people.  I hate that people have to tell that story in order to get any help.  It is a very difficult thing to do.  What is covered by the enhanced medical card?

How many people who were born in one of these institutions stayed for less than six months and how many stayed for more than six months?  With all due respect, it seems to people who are following this process and those affected by it that it is coming down to numbers.

In regard to the enhanced medical card and what it provides, head 20 sets out the legislative explanation of what it provides, namely, access to GP services and public acute hospital services, without charge in both cases, access to drugs, medicines, medical and surgical supplies, access to therapies, home help and nursing services, home nursing, and dental, ophthalmic and aural services.  Counselling is included just to give it a statutory basis but acknowledging it is already provided outside of this legislation.  Access to chiropody and physiotherapy is also provided.  The Bill provides access to therapies, GP, acute inpatient services, without charge; access to drugs, medicines, aids and appliances, without charge; and access to dental, aural and ophthalmic services.<\/p> <p>  Separately, it is worth mentioning that another one of the actions in the action plan is a commitment to further health research to identify whether any further health needs exist in the population of survivors and former residents of mother and baby homes that would need to be captured in any future review or update of services provided to survivors or as part of this enhanced medical card.  That commitment is also in place.  I hope I have answered the Chairman question but I ask her to let me know if she needs more detail on any aspect.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the &euro;3,000 payment, this was difficult for the interdepartmental group to grapple with because in January 2021 the Government agreed the commitment to an enhanced medical card for everyone with a length of stay of more than six months in a mother and baby or county home institution.  Everybody qualifies for that enhanced medical card but of course it is of limited value to those living overseas unless they spend significant periods in Ireland or move back to Ireland.  The &euro;3,000 health support payment is an attempt to acknowledge that reality for the individuals affected.  It acknowledges that the Irish State cannot legislate for the provision of health services in other jurisdictions.  The reality is that health systems can be very different between jurisdictions and health needs can differ from survivor to survivor.  It is accepted that there is no easy answer.  The interdepartmental group grappled with this but the health support payment is an attempt to acknowledge the circumstances of those survivors.  <\/p> <p>  In regard to payment rates, as mentioned, the interdepartmental group acknowledged that the payment scheme could not possibly compensate for what was lost and the suffering endured by people.  It is just one in a range of measures designed to recognise and acknowledge the suffering but it cannot hope to compensate for it.  The group recognised that.<\/p><p>It also decided that the recommended approach to the payment was this general, common experience payment grounded in the non-adversarial approach.  In that regard, in terms of looking at something that might be in some way comparable, the IDG noted the payment approach and rates used in the Magdalen restorative justice scheme whereby a schedule of rates was recommended by Mr. Justice Quirke recognising periods of time in institutions with harsh conditions.

Given the scale of this scheme with 19,000 people with length of stay of over six months, and the fact that the commission had recommended that Government consider providing for those with health needs, it was considered that the enhanced medical card was a way of giving a level of assurance of guaranteed access to statutory services.

We do so very much from the perspective of the 561 survivors who participated in the consultation process undertaken by us with them in March 2021.  We acknowledge and thank all those who took the time to participate in the consultation process, which, for many, reopened painful memories and feelings.<br\/><br\/>In considering the provisions of the Bill, the greatest disparity we discern between the provisions of the Bill and the views of the survivors relates to eligibility.  Survivors overwhelmingly asked for a universal common experience scheme that recognised all survivors, regardless of duration of time spent by them in the homes.  However, eligibility for financial redress is provided for in the Bill for all mothers regardless of duration of residence, but only for survivors who, as children, spent more than six months in the homes.  The Bill also uses duration of stay as a determinant for eligibility for an enhanced medical card for both mothers and children and, similarly, it will be provided only to those who spent more than six months in a home.<br\/><br\/>The survivors described the nature of the harms they experienced for which reparation is needed.  The Bill provides for a general payment of redress for unspecified harm, trauma, discrimination and stigma experienced by mothers and children while resident in the homes.  The survivors, however, identified at least 17 different harms suffered by them, many of which have lifelong negative consequences.  The primary harm described by them is the involuntary loss of the mother-child bond they suffered, but this is not recognised in the Bill.<br\/><br\/>Similarly, when considering financial recognition, survivors believed that a universal common experience payment was the most suitable form of redress, but with an additional 12 categories of claim identified, and that an initial interim payment of &euro;15,000, on average, should be paid immediately.  The Bill provides a general payment starting at &euro;5,000 for mothers who were resident for up to three months and &euro;12,500 for children resident for at least six months, with only two additional categories of claim, which are confined to lengths of stay in the homes and periods of work in excess of three months undertaken by mothers or pregnant women without pay.<br\/><br\/>The survivors stressed the importance of a human rights-based approach to the design of the scheme and, in particular, the need for accountability, truth-telling, identification of harm, participation, inclusion, equality, apology and restorative justice, all of which provide greater opportunity for healing.  The eligibility and financial payments provisions of the Bill are, however, evidently based on a rights-based approach, operating within the current statutory framework of entitlements and, in particular, those applying to the residential institutions redress scheme and the Magdalen restorative justice <i>ex gratia<\/i>scheme, which, similar to what is recommended for this mother and baby home scheme, comprises a general payment based on length of stay and a work-type payment rather than on the particular human rights violations and common experience of harms particular to the mother and baby homes survivors, the main defining feature of which is the loss of the mother-child bond they suffered.  Nowhere in the Bill or the general scheme is this recognised.<br\/><br\/>Other key concerns identified by the survivors that are not provided for in the Bill are listed in my written submission.  In light of the time constraints, I emphasise in particular the option of financial payment by lump sum, periodic payments or enhanced pension payments and the provision of trauma-informed counselling or psychotherapy beyond that of the counselling services currently provided by the HSE national counselling service for survivors and their family members.  There should be provision for a medical card equivalent to that granted under the Health (Amendment) Act 1996, as well as supports additional to those provided for in the Bill.<br\/><br\/>As regards the application, delivery of the scheme should be by trauma-trained and experienced staff.  In terms of administration, a personal liaison advocate, social worker or adviser should be available to assist each individual with applications and to provide the necessary emotional and practical support they need.  There should be no cut-off date or period for the duration of the scheme because many survivors do not have access to records and may not be aware of the circumstances of their birth.  As such, it may take time for them to become aware of their eligibility for the scheme.<br\/><br\/>Our written submission provides summary tables of all of the key requests made by the survivors and the extent to which these are provided for in the Bill, with a commentary on each.  Although our opening statement focuses on the issues not provided for within the Bill as it currently stands, that is not to ignore the amount of work and attention by the Department in the context of providing for the needs of the survivors.  We make our observations with the intention of continuing to represent the needs of the survivors as expressed by them in a way that will enhance the scheme.

I am a clinical psychologist working with young people who have experienced trauma and adversity, within a specialist setting.  I welcome the opportunity to disseminate information in respect of research and best practice and to have this knowledge, in turn, shape and influence thinking in respect of the mother and baby home institutions payment scheme.<\/p> <p>  The committee may be aware that I was prompted to make contact with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, in respect of the scheme in November 2021.  I, alongside co-signatories across disciplines working in the area of trauma, raised concerns regarding the current iteration of the scheme.  These concerns stemmed from a knowledge base in respect of the impact of early trauma and its consequences throughout the lifespan, as well as the exclusion of certain cohorts of individuals from the scheme.  In considering the impact from the perspective of early childhood trauma, this is not to negate the profound experience for the mother.  We know it has been a profoundly harmful experience for many women to have given birth and resided in a mother and baby home.  Indeed, we cannot separate maternal experiences from babies' experiences, given how important and intertwined the relationships are.<\/p> <p>  Donald Winnicott, one of the earliest proponents of developmental psychology in the early 1900s, stated, \"There is no such thing as a baby.  There is a baby and someone.\"  Babies are born helpless and utterly dependent on another for survival.  The context into which babies are born matters, as does the pre-birth context.  Experiences are required to shape the potential of the child.  The brain has a timetable for development, if you like, with different areas developing at different stages.  Disruptions of experiences at different stages can lead to deficits in later development.  For example, high maternal levels of cortisol, a stress hormone, during pregnancy will influence functions controlled by the brainstem for children, such as sensory processing, sleep, feeding and physiological functions such as cardiovascular and temperature regulation.  When we reflect on pervasive experiences of shame, stress and trauma that are at the heart of the many stories women have told of their experiences in mother and baby home institutions, we would naturally expect higher levels of stress during pregnancy as a result.<\/p><p>Of course, their babies, who are now adults, will not be able to narrate their experiences, but many children born in mother and baby home institutions will experience sensory and physiological difficulties well into adulthood.<br\/><br\/>Apart from the impact of<i>in utero<\/i>and birth experiences, we must also consider what babies need after birth.  Babies need to be rocked, held, soothed and comforted in predictable and safe ways for optimal relational growth to happen.  They need caregivers who themselves are psychologically well and have a sense of safety to adequately care for and meet the needs of their babies.  Infancy is a crucial period for attachment, in which the brain organises around expectations of safety and comfort within relationships.  Daily experiences of caregiving shape the child&rsquo;s later attachment system.  Good enough caregiving, by which I mean attuned, present and responsive care, enables the baby to learn that the adults and the world are safe and predictable.  The converse is also true.  If babies are not responded to in a way that promotes safety and care, they learn to organise their own behaviour and emotions to respond to an unpredictable, unsafe or sometimes frightening environment.  As such, they learn that others are not reliable and trustworthy to meet their needs.  Institutional environments such as the mother and baby homes are suboptimal and indeed often harmful environments for relational growth.  Thus, babies who have been raised in institutional settings are less likely to present with security of attachment and more likely to have developed strategies such as inhibition and suppression of emotional needs by withdrawing or exaggeration of emotional responses in order to have their needs met.  Without intervention, these patterns tend to persist into childhood and, indeed, adulthood, and form the bedrock for all subsequent relationships.<br\/><br\/>It was only in the 1990s that we began to look at the impact of separation of mother and baby soon after birth on later development, something Nancy Verrier called the &ldquo;primal wound&rdquo;.  She reflected that early separation can lead to profound experiences of loss, mistrust and difficulties in relationships with others later in life.  Yet in many ways, the impact of this separation is often denied.  The assumption is that babies do not remember, and therefore this does not matter.  Of course, we know that the process of moving from one caregiver to another, such as through adoption, which was often an outcome for children born in these institutions, is a profoundly stressful one, even if the environment is ultimately an enriching and positive one.  All of these experiences of separation and loss leave a lasting mark and shape how those who have experienced them navigate all future relationships.<br\/><br\/>To conclude, the message from research on childhood trauma is clear.  The earlier the impact of trauma, the more pervasive and long-lasting the consequences.  This is due to the rapid nature of brain growth and development at this time and the crucial nature of experiences to shape brain functioning and attachment.  Impact is not time-dependent, but rather is related to the nature and quality of experiences and how these shaped later development.  All who passed through mother and baby homes have been affected and these experiences will have shaped and influenced childhood and adult development.  Indeed, we know that adults who experienced childhood trauma are much more predisposed to a range of both physical and mental health needs in adulthood, not to mention relational difficulties.<br\/><br\/>Recovery from early trauma is possible with the right ingredients.  These are acknowledgement of harm, provision of tailored therapeutic supports, love and validation of experiences.  We need to look towards the future while also orienting to the past, and recognise the harms caused by inadequate care to mothers and babies.  Rupture and repair is at the heart of all good relationships.  This Bill offers the potential to be a moment of repair in the lives of generations of families who were and continue to be impacted by the mother and baby homes.  It can serve as an act of validation of people&rsquo;s lived experiences and support genuine recovery, but revisions will be required to encapsulate all of those affected, not just some.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022052400002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sara O'Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":294,"content":"<p>Both group&rsquo;s contributions are invaluable in terms of our scrutiny of this Bill.

The overriding wish from them, as I said, was that it would be a common experience payment and there would not be a burden of proof on them to prove trauma or harms done.  The kind of financial figure that was discussed for an interim payment - which would not be the totality of the payment, but an immediate interim payment - was estimated to be on average about &euro;15,000.  Other than that, there was much ambivalence by the survivors to put a figure on compensation because there was a sense that moneys would be seen as some form of compensation, and what they had experienced could not be compensated for.  Figures went up to &euro;200,000.  People looked at what they could potentially seek as way of payment through the courts if they were to take a legal action around their experience.  The amounts, I suppose, were not specific in the totality.<\/p> <p>  The kinds of harms that were referred to were extensive.  There are 17 listed in the report: the loss of the mother-child relationship; the impact of psychological abuse that was suffered; the suffering inflicted as a consequence of a lack of proper vetting of family placements for children placed in the community; the damaging consequences of the withholding of personal information for mother and child survivors; the economic exploitation of work undertaken without payment, which was recognised; the suffering and harmful consequences of physical and-or sexual abuse in some of the placements and experiences of children; the impact of unspecified abuse or treatment; opportunities lost due to the lack of education, which has not been acknowledged; arbitrary detention and coercive control; the negative effects of stigma and discrimination, which have been recognised; greater harm experienced by those of mixed race; the suffering associated with the loss of the father, siblings and extended family relationships; the harm inflicted as a result of racial profiling and suppression of ethnic identity; health issues related to the lack of information or neglect; non-consensual participation in vaccine trials, which was a significant one; and the consequences of the loss of nationality and heritage.<\/p><p>There are so many impacts and harms experienced that the way it is set out in the Bill by comparison is so limited that it does not reflect the experience of the survivors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022052400002#J01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Lou O'Kennedy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":305,"content":"<p>I thank both sets of witnesses.

The overriding issue is the use of the duration of stay of children as a criterion for the medical card.  Many of the medical issues that arose for women happened at the point of birth.  As has been explained to us today, the impact on children starts prior to birth.  This is the primary issue.  The survivors also expressed the harm that would be done if different groups were identified groups over others.  This would be divisive to their community.  They took great solidarity from being together in the consultations.  Solidarity among the survivor community is very important to them.  This is another reason the six-month cut-off is very problematic.  It is divisive and could be damaging in this way.<\/p> <p>  Trauma-informed counselling is another issue.  It was referred to again and again as one of the overriding needs that survivors requested.  The HSE counselling service was not designed to work with trauma at this level.  The focus on having trauma-trained staff and an informed process in the administration was deemed to be equally as important in this respect.<\/p> <p>  The other item I would speak about is providing emotional support and administrative support to applicants by way of a personal advocate or personal case worker.  Many of the survivors have simply expressed a need for this type of assistance in going through the bureaucratic application process.

Medical card eligibility does not always mean access because there are waiting lists and all sorts of limitations at times.  There were all sorts of suggestions around private healthcare being provided.  The main card referenced by people was the Health (Amendment) Act medical card.  This is the one they felt would be the most comprehensive.  It would include many of the provisions already listed among those that have been put in place but with the addition of alternative therapies.  Many of the women in particular are interested in alternative therapies, such as body work, and some of the other supports that would be available to them through that card but not through the one being recommended.<\/p> <p>  Extra practical supports were mentioned for fuel allowances and phone allowances.  Things such as free genetic testing and health screening came up as a key issue because people do not know their family medical histories.  There was also mention of services for genetic illnesses linked to ethnicity and addiction services.  There is a range of needs.  As comprehensive as possible health cover is what was asked for.<\/p> <p>  The need for trauma-informed counselling for the survivors and their family members cannot be overstated.

If we consider these aspects in the context of pregnant women living in mother and baby home institutions, we would look at elements such as whether the mother was safe, was she harmed in any way and felt safe physically and psychologically.  All those factors have an impact on the growing baby.  Babies are tuned into their mothers' heartbeat rate.  We know this from the type of beats that babies seek out after they are born.  Babies are tuned into that heartbeat rate and it becomes soothing for them because they are used to it.  Consideration must then be given to the impact of separation from an environment that has been familiar and soothing to the baby or that has been familiar post birth.<br\/><br\/>Turning to the history of relational health, this element would include consideration of whether the mother was shamed or isolated from family members or the community.

It is important to say this in the context of the six-month eligibility provision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022052400002#M01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray Flaherty"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":332,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022052400002#M01200","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":333,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Flaherty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022052400002#M01300","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653346800,"counter":334,"content":"<p>I also wish to point out that a five-year duration was put on the scheme itself.  It is important to remember that, as Mr. Flaherty told us that one survivor said, the consequences are lifelong.  Provision in this regard should, therefore, be left open indefinitely for any survivors not aware of it during the period specified.  I say that because many of the survivors are not part of networks and are not aware of the scheme.  A great deal of outreach must be done, especially internationally, in a proactive way to ensure those survivors are made aware of this scheme.  Before I came in here today, I spoke to someone in a different context entirely.  He shared with me that his mother told him last year on her deathbed that she had had a baby in one of the mother and baby homes.  Her son is now aged 50, and it is only now that he has become aware of what happened.  Many of the survivors do not wish to talk about their experiences and have not shared accounts of what happened to them.  For many of the survivors we spoke with, it was their first time sharing their stories and being in a group helped them.  The solidarity we spoke about is so important.  It is crucial, therefore, to remember that the legacy of these experiences continues to be felt by many people.  There are impacts over lifetimes and intergenerationally.  A five-year window does not seem to respond to that issue.  This is something to be considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022052400002#M01400","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Lou O'Kennedy"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":335,"content":"<p>If no one else wishes to contribute, I thank all the witnesses sincerely for coming in and for their time.

It is imperative that they comply with any such direction. <\/p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for coming here today.  I hope that the discussion will be of a productive nature and that it will inform our members of the important work that World Skills Ireland does.

World Skills Ireland wishes to thank the committee for providing us with this opportunity to speak about the further expansion and funding of craft apprenticeships and new generation apprenticeships.  This statement will give an overview of the current situation regarding the provision of apprenticeship training in Munster Technological University, MTU.  The issues raised are common to all higher education apprenticeship providers.  Furthermore, the statement will outline what World Skills Ireland does on a day-to-day basis and will give an overview of upcoming World Skills activities at national and international level.<\/p> <p>  Apprenticeships are central to the mission, remit and activities of the technological university and institute of technology sector.  Munster Technological University is the largest provider of craft apprenticeship programmes in the country.  Approximately 1,600 craft apprenticeships will complete their off-the-job phases in MTU during the 2022-2023 academic year.  Craft apprentices in electrical, refrigeration, plumbing, carpentry and joinery, plastering, pipe fitting, metal fabrication fitting, motor, construction plant fitting, instrumentation and agricultural mechanics complete phases four and six of their apprenticeship in MTU.  Furthermore, post-2016, MTU delivers consortium-led apprenticeship programmes, which offer university degree qualifications.  Currently, more than 200 students are registered across programmes, in the areas of manufacturing and engineering, and engineering services management, among others.  The flexibility and availability of online learning options provides blended learning opportunities which enable us to extend the reach of new apprenticeship programmes and to enhance the delivery of the craft apprenticeship programmes.  <\/p> <p>  Apprenticeships are offered at all levels of the national qualification framework, from level 6 to level 10.  It is a mode of learning that is built around an employer requirement, with the learning provided by both higher education and further education, depending on the level of the award.  The level of engagement of the higher level community in apprentice provision is significant and therefore the level of annual and capital investment should be significant.  With that in mind, the main challenges that are facing MTU and, indeed, most of the technological universities and institutes of technology, with regard to the delivery of apprenticeship programmes are the lack of facilities.<\/p><p>By facilities, I mean classrooms, laboratories, workshops and offices.  Technological universities, TU, and institutes of technology, IT, receive capital funding for equipment when new curriculums are introduced but no funding is provided for new buildings or for the upgrade of existing buildings to facilitate the installation of this new equipment.  Specific funding to upgrade buildings is essential for the successful delivery of both craft and consortium-led apprenticeship programmes.  In the case of the Bishopstown campus of the Munster Technological University, MTU, there will be a requirement in the region of &euro;30 million for the upgrade and development of buildings to facilitate the delivery of existing and new apprenticeship programmes.<\/p><p> Both MTU and WorldSkills Ireland fully support and welcome the new Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 and the establishment of the national apprenticeship office.  It should be noted that the higher education sector and WorldSkills Ireland play a key role in the transition of current SOLAS co-ordinated craft apprenticeships to a consortium-led model, a process which will be managed by the national apprenticeship office.  We look forward to the development of a single apprenticeship model, and both higher education and WorldSkills Ireland are well-placed to help and, indeed, lead in the development process to ensure the result will be a workable and world-class model.<\/p><p> I will hand over to my colleague, Mr. English, who is the technical delegate for WorldSkills Ireland, to outline activities in the WorldSkills Ireland organisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022052400002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Hourihan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653346800,"counter":344,"content":"<p>Ireland, through the Department of Education, joined WorldSkills International in 1956 and competed for the first time in 1957.  We have competed in every competition since then, winning 65 gold medals, 53 silver medals, 81 bronze medals and 174 diplomas or medallions of excellence.  With us in the room today we have a gold medal winner and also a medallion of excellence award winner from the previous competition in 2019 in Kazan.  That really is a significant award level and it really goes to show that Ireland can compete on the international scale across a range of skills.<\/p> <p>  WorldSkills gives youths the chance to compete, experience and learn how to become the best in their skill of choice in what is known as the Olympics of Skills.  From the traditional trades to multi-skilled technological careers supported by partners, industry, Government, volunteers and educational and training institutions, WorldSkills Ireland is making a direct impact on raising the level of skills nationally, ensuring equity of career perception and promoting skills careers nationally and throughout the world with the 89 member countries in WorldSkills International.<\/p> <p>  To outline some of the activities in which we are engaged, WorldSkills is tasked by the Department, which remains a member of WorldSkills, with organising a national competitive event.  In 2019, for the first time, we brought all of these skill competitions together into the RDS arena.  Senator Malcolm Byrne was certainly there at the start of it, which we remember well.  We would have liked to have proceeded in 2020 and 2021 but, obviously, Covid-19 got in the way.  In that first event, 12,500 students came through the door to witness 25 skill competitions over three days and also experience the exhibitors and training zone, recruitment zone and education and skills zone.  Undoubtedly, it was a really successful event.<\/p> <p>  We are lucky that we are able to organise WorldSkills Ireland live 2022, again, in the RDS Simmonscourt arena from 13 September to 15 September, which will be Ireland's largest ever apprenticeship and skills event.  We will have more than 25 competitions over three days, increasing the range of opportunities and the visual impact that young students can have.  Members will obviously know competitions from the traditional skills and particularly apt, as Ireland is seeking to recruit into the construction industry zone, we have brick and stone laying, plastering, painting and decorating, plumbing and refrigeration skills.  Additionally, on the side of that, we have also grown the competitions into areas such as ICT and cloud computing, in which Ireland was the first country in WorldSkills to run a competition, and building information modelling, which is now called digital construction.  Again, Ireland led the way with WorldSkills in running the first competitions in that and they are both now WorldSkills International competitions.<\/p> <p>  Again for the first time, we are introducing a new competition we are calling digital infrastructure for sustainability, which looks at pre-building, that is, the groundworks, mapping and setting out of areas.<\/p><p>Again, it is about that move into digital and green spaces.<\/p><p> We believe we are being innovative in our approach.  World Skills Ireland has always crossed the range of Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, skill levels.  We have competitions from level 5 through to levels 6, 7 and 8.  We cover further education, apprenticeships, traineeships and higher education.  The committee will have seen the CAO offering but we have been ahead of that and have been doing that for a number of years.  It is great that our offering will match what the State is looking for.  When people come into the RDS in September they will see all those offerings and activities clearly displayed.  They can try it, see it, believe it and become what they want to be.  We have talked about \"see it and be it\" but for the first time ever we are actually presenting that to students.  We are delighted that it is looking like there will be an increase in footfall compared to previous years.  The morning sessions are completely sold out.  The 12,000 sq. m RDS event space is now full and we cannot accommodate any more competitions.  As the committee knows, the number of apprenticeships in Ireland has now grown from 27 when we started out to 67, plus 13 that are in development and a number of others that are being considered.  If we are to increase our range of skill offerings and experiences in order to be that single event that will supply everybody, which we want to do, we also need to grow some of our funding.<\/p><p> There is also the international aspect.  It is important that we have a pipeline of activities.  World Skills Shanghai is due to happen in October 2022.  In line with the Osnabr&uuml;ck declaration by the Department of Education, we are becoming members of EuroSkills, which will be held in Pozna in Poland in 2023.  We will also be holding the general assembly of World Skills, bringing the 91 member countries to Dublin in September 2023.  The story Ireland will be able to tell those other 90 countries involved is incredible and the opportunity to share our experience of how we have changed perceptions around skills and grown apprenticeships is important. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022052400002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray English","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. English.

I believe that men also should have opportunities that they have not had before.

One thing that I have always loved doing is sharing my story in order to inspire women to join the industry.  I do so because the industry is very male dominated, very intimidating and has a negative image.  Let me outline where I have encountered difficulties.  I have approached schools and offered a completely free talk or presentation or even just to provide material on the opportunities and jobs in the sector but found that either you cannot find a contact or the schools do not want to engage.  By contrast, official engagements arranged along with the Institute of Guidance Counsellors have been very well received.  Therefore, we must find avenues.  There are plenty of apprentices.  A team of 17 apprentices travelled to Kazan in Russia with Mr. Twomey and myself and I know that plenty of us are willing to share our stories to help to show people the opportunities that are available whether that is through a level 8 course or as an apprenticeship.  We would like to show the different avenues you can take to enter these careers.  We must find ways to bridge that gap, which is why I think that the World Skills Ireland event at the RDS is a great opportunity to showcase careers.  While that event is great for anyone who attends, the question is how do you reach the people who do not engage.  Perhaps it would be helpful if we went to people.

As winners of the Department's silver medal, we always consider Ms Leane, Mr. McSherry, Ms Yeates and Mr. Twomey national champions.  We are keen to develop how those national champions go and engage with second-level schools and students.  We would like to include that outreach from the schools base outwards in our work plan.<\/p> <p>  We also have longer-term plans not only to link the national competitions but to create junior school competitions alongside them.  We can link second-level students into the junior school competitions and get junior school students to participate in appropriate competitions.  Those students are then learning and feeding in, which will engage second-level students even more.<\/p> <p>  The third spoke in that wheel is that we are looking to develop skills packages from targeted industries for transition-year students.  We must engage further with transition year.  If we can supply materials to them that would engage them and if they look at the competitions available and the skills and careers packages, they might get a focus and become invested.<\/p> <p>  We must acknowledge the work of the Institute of Guidance Counsellors, IGC.  It is helpful to us in World Skills Ireland.  We have created some videos for the IGC and it is distributing them through its networks.  It is keen to promote apprenticeship programmes and particular skills.  That should be acknowledged.<\/p> <p>  We are also involved in looking at the need for digitisation and its increase with one of Worlds Skills Ireland's partners, namely, Autodesk.  We have set up, and are currently running, a series of online engagements for anybody who wants to come along.  It is like a massive open online course, MOOC, for Fusion 360, which is used particularly in mechanical and manufacturing industries.  We are inviting anyone to come along and engage with this programme and allowing them to get the first visualisation of what Fusion 360 looks like.  Free certification will be provided for those who want it.  This is something we are looking to add on.  It has worked successfully.  The first roll-out of the programme involved 75 people and in the first online training session, we are hoping to grow that and then expand into other offerings, such as building information modelling, that might lead people into the construction side.<\/p> <p>  To return to the Senator's point, we anticipate digitalisation will have a strong impact on the building industry.  That might change perceptions.  The industry is never not going to be noisy and it will never be totally clean because it is still using cement, etc.  However, for gender balance, the digitalisation side is one that could work.  Building information modelling is ubiquitous in Irish industry now and that should provide a pathway to gender balance in that career.  We can look to promote that.

She is quite correct.  There is a certain level of snobbery there.  That is what we in World Skills Ireland are trying to work on.

They talk about medicine and how it is pushed through and of course it is suitable for some people.  However, after seven years at university a doctor is not allowed into an operating theatre to operate on you or me.  They have to have practical experience.

To bring those buildings up to spec we are talking in the region of &euro;20 million to &euro;25 million.  That only one part of the building, however.  The apprenticeship building in MTU Bishopstown campus was built in 1976.  The throughput at that time was very low.  It was a regional technical college back then and the numbers going though were relatively low.  The building was fit for purpose at that point.  It is certainly not fit for purpose at this point in time.  The numbers going through are huge.

The issue is to get over that idea which parents have that if one goes to an apprenticeship, one somehow stops at some stage.  One must say, however, that it is absolutely wide open and the ability and options to return to further education, part-time or full-time, are fully there.

I was very lucky in the secondary school I went to because it was very trades-orientated and was a mixed school.  We had woodwork, metalwork and home economics, but if one looked at the other two schools in the town, they were very gender-split.  The metalwork and the woodwork were in the boys&rsquo; school and the home economics was in the girls&rsquo; school.  Maybe we could somehow start from secondary school and have these subject available to all of the students and, from there, tell the students that they have done the subject and they can now move on to the apprenticeship.  If the subject is not available, however, the apprenticeship is not going to come up for consideration.

We leave it too late to approach the students.  I remember being in fifth year and people had already set their mind on what they were going to do when they left school.  If a career guidance or talk was given in sixth year, they were so closed-minded because they had already selected something that might not necessarily have been something that they wanted to do.  They had made that decision and did not have to think about it further as they approached the leaving certificate examinations.<\/p> <p>  As Mr. Twomey said, going into schools and sharing those stories and opportunities sooner rather than later, and targeting students at a younger age, would be a good idea.

It is great to have champions for apprenticeship programmes here, because that is what we want to see.  We want people to be champions who will encourage and show many other students coming into the leaving certificate that there are other options out there.<\/p> <p>  I come from Ballinasloe and I represent Roscommon and Galway.  Yesterday, I was at the Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board open day.  All of the tutors were there.  There were girls and people of all ages coming in, including people in their 30s and 40s, looking to do different courses.  They were not just school leavers.  Lifelong learning is very important, so I might ask Mr. Hourihan for a couple of comments on that.  <\/p> <p>  Something that happened there really struck me.  One of the girls who came in was a non-national who was doing her leaving certificate.  I think she was under a lot of stress and pressure.  She just said that she felt she came in with no hope, and after a half an hour talking with tutors and trainers there, she left with hope.  There was a smile on her face.  She wanted to do a particular qualification and if she could not get it through the points system, there would be another opportunity to do it through further education or apprenticeships.  There is that sense of hope that the apprenticeship programme has to give.  <\/p> <p>  With regard to World Skills Ireland, I have a few comments and questions for Mr. Hourihan and Mr. English on lifelong learning.  Potentially, how do we encourage people at different age groups to consider apprenticeships or changing careers?  What do we need to do on that?  It was referenced in the opening statement as well.  I think they have also probably spoken before about other European countries, in particular their apprenticeship uptakes.  We heard last year from Norway, and I know Germany has a very high uptake of apprenticeships as well.  What do they do that we do not?  They spoke to us, but is there something simple we can do?<\/p> <p>  My next question relates to the buildings.  In Fine Gael, we have been looking at how we use school buildings and how they can be used after school hours.  We look at how we use premises in regional areas.  For example, ETBs across the country sometimes have further education colleges that will not be in use potentially over the summer months until they start up their courses again in September.  How are we working with our ETBs and our TUs to make the most of existing buildings?  I understand that everybody always wants new buildings.  That is the number one request.  However, there are existing buildings there.  When it comes to being able to develop and deliver classes, is there a way we can look at existing buildings and how we are working with the ETBs, which I think are quite integrated now with the TUs as well?<\/p> <p>  I have a few questions for our champions as well.  I think Mr. McSherry is the competitor on the bricklaying side.  Is that correct?  When I promote apprenticeships, I get to hear from people.  When I was getting the car washed, which is a treat, a guy came in behind me who was getting his car done too.  He told me he was working on 40 housing units that are getting built in town.  As I was chatting to him, he mentioned that he had met me before.  He was from one of the villages in east Galway.  I asked him if he had been in the leaving certificate class because I remembered he had been at that school, and he said he had been.  I asked him if he was working now - it was only two or three years later - and he told me he had joined the apprentice programme and was doing plastering.  I told him that was amazing and asked him why he thought we did not see more people doing it.  He spoke about the hard work and everything else.  He was a young guy.  He said he did not know.  I asked him if other people knew he had a nice car.  It was his pride and joy.  I ask Mr. McSherry how he tackles that when it is put back on the younger generation that it is not the same as 20 or 30 years ago.  How do we combat that sort of narrative?<\/p> <p>  I ask the rest of our guests if they have any comments.  There is a story that we have to tell about what apprenticeships are.

On the question of Germany and Norway, it is a real issue of equity.  It is more than equality and they value apprenticeships in a totally different way and support them accordingly and more where they are needed.  It is not a new culture and it comes from the longer term.  We are starting that again and for us that journey might be slightly longer.  It is the value that is really important.  It is a collective value and it is really important to drive it on.  It is also about visibility, which is really important.  The more visibility we can get of young people, the better.  Both Mr. Hourihan and myself are qualified tradespeople so we need to get to the younger people.  It is really key to much of the outputs.<\/p> <p>  I will also take off my World Skills Ireland hat and put on my TU Dublin hat.  We had Bolton Street and Kevin Street, although that building has been demolished and the programme has moved to Grangegorman.  The building at Bolton Street is very old.  In many cases, it is about the type of space that is available and it may not be a flexible space that allows for the new type of education we are seeking.  As Mr. Hourihan pointed out, those facilities would be used both for undergraduate courses, research and apprenticeships.  It is that combination that will give us the flexibility to grow that equity in everything we deliver.

I welcome the capital funding available to the ETBs and I hope it will make a big difference.  One of the biggest challenges is that we do not have the workshops and space, and we know that.  We have a huge backlog.  It would take a number of years to clear, even if a project could be approved tomorrow.<\/p><p>I asked the Minister to examine this aspect in respect of speeding up the procurement process and exploring what needs to be done in this context.  I refer to the urgency in areas such as workforce planning and what we need to achieve there.  Therefore, I hear loud and clear what is being said about the capital investment required.  We also, however, need there to be proper collaboration.  I wish to see the same outcome in this regard as the witnesses.  I spent yesterday afternoon in Castlebar education and training board, ETB, centre and I saw the good work being done there.  It is evident from the premises, though, that there has been no investment in the facility for years.  In that regard, I would like to see the same type of collaboration with the Atlantic Technological University, ATU.  This is the way forward.  The committee will be fully supportive in the context of what was said.<\/p><p> Turning to the apprentices, how early in the secondary school cycle do people need to be made aware of apprenticeships and of the opportunities available in this area?  Would it be in first year, second year, third year or at what stage should such an intervention be made?

Based on my experience, we got a sample of all the trade subjects we could do in first year.  We then had to pick about three of them that we wished to continue with.  Going into them, we got a month's worth of experience in that one area and then we were moved on to another.  If we got the opportunity to know what it would be possible for us to do if we continued with a subject, that would help.  If we are shown a subject and we like it, we might take it on.  It would be good, however, if we could know more about what we could do as a result of continuing on with a subject.  Home economics, for example, is seen as a subject where people just do cooking.  I am a chef and I am biased, but we also do a lot of financial work in home economics, as well as sewing.  It would be possible to do many jobs as a result of having studied this subject, but when students experience it for one month and they make a curry, for example, they might come away from that experience thinking all they will be able to do in the long term as a result of taking on home economics is to take on a role as a chef.  If it were to be explained to students what different apprenticeship programmes can be done based on the subjects taken, that would be great.

I previously stated to this committee that the Government will not be found wanting when it comes to addressing the question of sustainable funding for higher education.  It has profound impacts for our economy, society and the citizens we all serve.  The review sponsored by the European Commission Directorate General for Structural Reform Support was undertaken in early 2020 and I recently brought the report to Government for approval and publication.<\/p> <p>  I publicly thank the European Commission and the independent consultants for their extensive support and work in developing this comprehensive assessment.  It provided a clear and detailed economic assessment to the funding options presented in the 2016 Cassells report, requested formally by this committee in 2019.  On that note, I thank this committee, current and former members, Peter Cassells for his work, and everyone for their collective drive and ambition to see a sustainable model of funding for higher education, a truly important strategic national asset.<\/p> <p>  I am delighted to be with the committee to discuss our policy response and the decisions we have made, as published by the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, and me on 4 May.  As colleagues will be aware, I also published the review of the student grant scheme, fulfilling a key programme for Government commitment.<\/p> <p>  Funding the Future is the Department&rsquo;s landmark policy document which settles the question of both the funding model and the funding gap.  I want to be clear about what the Government decided not to do in Funding the Future.  We have ruled out the possibility of introducing student loans into the system.  We believe they are unfair and do not work.  We have decided that the higher education system will have a multi-funded model, through additional Exchequer investment, because higher education is a public good, and through ongoing but not increased employer contributions to the national training fund.  The student contribution will be retained but will be reduced over time.<\/p> <p>  We have put in place a twin-track approach.  A funding gap of &euro;307 million has been identified.  There is a plan on how to fund higher education with a reform process.  In the interests of time, I will not go through my full statement, but this is the exciting part.  Now that we have identified the funding gap of &euro;307 million, this enables a conversation to take place about what sort of education system we want to create.  Up until now, legitimate conversations have been legitimately stymied by people saying that they cannot do more because the core funding has to be provided.  We have now identified the core funding and the Government is committed to delivering it.  We have to continue with the reform discussion.<\/p> <p>  How do we create an education system in Ireland that can meet the skills needs of the country now and in the future, and is accessible to all, flexible and recognises that students come to the education system at all stages of life?  Not everyone can come in for a four-year degree, pack the bags, and move to another town or city.  I am particularly passionate about creating better pathways between further education and higher education, so there is not a singular focus on rote learning, leaving certificate points and the CAO.  This is a common ambition that we share across the political divide in this House.<\/p> <p>  We cannot talk about core funding and a sustainable plan that works for the universities without talking about a sustainable plan that works for families.  While we can have a legitimate debate about whether we should reduce the registration fee or student grant fee first, or a bit of both, I will be clear that it is the Government's policy position that the cost of education for working families must be reduced.  My Department only has two levers at its disposal to do that: the registration fee and the student grant.  The Government has stated in a policy document that it wishes to see the student grant system significantly improved and that it wants to reduce the registration fee.<\/p> <p>  While maybe it is wonky and part of a process, I think it is exciting that, every year, in advance of the budget, we will publish a cost of education paper that will set out all the options.  What options are available to the Minister or Government and why did it choose one over another?  I think this will provide a focus on what options the Houses of the Oireachtas have to reduce the cost.<\/p> <p>  The student grant scheme review involved significant work.  I thank colleagues for it.  More than 9,000 people participated in the consultation.  We have begun to implement some of the actions, including changes to the adjacency rate and the first increases to the grant and the income threshold in ten years.  There is no doubt that we have much more to do.  I hope and expect that we can make more progress on that in the budget.<\/p><p> We have established an implementation group to deliver the Funding the Future model.  I am delighted I will be co-chairing it with Professor Anne Looney and Professor Tom Collins.  I want to thank them both for their leadership.  The inaugural meeting will take place tomorrow.  We do not intend to lose any time in getting on with the agenda.  The group membership is comprised of enterprise voices, student voices, societal voices and, of course, Government and agency representatives.  I am very excited about the work we will undertake.  As the members are aware, there are fives strands to the work of the group.  No doubt, there will be an opportunity during questions and exchanges to address that.<\/p><p> I was also asked to touch on the issue of technological universities.  Every application for every technological university has now been delivered.  There is a gap in the north-east that we need to work together to address, but all technological university applications received by this Government have now been progressed.  All the technological universities which sought status are now open and functioning.  We are excited about the next stage of their journey.  I can get into that during the questioning. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022052400002#CC00200","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":555,"content":"<p>Before the Minister came in, he met some of the apprentices.

My son is in the leaving certificate class there.<\/p> <p>  We have had several conversations about the Funding the Future policy in the D&aacute;il, and we agree with the sentiments of where the Minister is trying to go with it.  We need some timeframes on delivery in terms of the reduction of the fees and the other things mentioned in it.  If many of the changes recommended in the Cassells report are not introduced until 2026, that will be ten years after the publication of the report.  We are in an ever-changing environment.  My concern is we are going to be playing catch-up all the time.  People want to see timescales on where we are going both with the SUSI reforms and the deficit in third level education.  I know the Minister agrees we are reaping the negative effects of the deficit and the austerity in the third level sector in terms of our workforce planning.  We may be faced with the situation again this year where students with the maximum number of points cannot get places on high-demand courses.  I do not know if the Minister has any further information on the extra places on high-demand courses that were discussed last week.

When will the technological universities be in a situation where they can borrow?  <\/p> <p>  I also want to make two points that are relevant in the immediate term.  Due to the cost-of-living crisis we are experiencing and ever-increasing inflation, is there any way the SUSI grants can be provided earlier this year?  On the timing of the student assistance fund, we often hear it is October or November before students receive their funds.  Getting a place in college involves stresses and strains and upfront costs.  Is there a way that we can make the assistance more accessible earlier because of the cost-of-living crisis we are in?

We now have a shared understanding across the sector, and I think across the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, as to what needs to be done.  The &euro;307 million figure has not been disputed.  There is a good technical paper that explains how we got to that figure.  It is about getting on and delivering it.<\/p> <p>  People reference the Cassells report.  I think it is important to state the review found a lot has happened since the publication of the Cassells report.  One of the myths circulating was that Cassells did his work, which was very good work, from 2014 to 2016, and then the report sat on a shelf.  That Cassells report mentioned a figure of &euro;1 billion.  Looking at the technical report, that figure is now &euro;307 million.  That shows that there has been a lot of movement, particularly post 2016 and onwards.<\/p> <p>  The honest answer is we are starting the work now.  The Deputy mentioned a delivery date in 2026.  I am talking about starting now, in budget 2023.  On the pace at which we can deliver it, out of respect to all my Government colleagues and the collective we form, it is matter for the Estimates process.  However, I wish to highlight there are three budgets left, all going to plan, in the lifetime of this Government.<\/p><p>Given the &euro;307 million figure, we should be able to significantly close that gap during those three budgets.  I think that is a shared ambition across Government.  I do not think I am speaking out of turn in relation to that.

We will try to provide, as I said to the Deputy in the D&aacute;il last week, 1,000 additional places or thereabouts.  It is different from previous years in that, as the Deputy has called for, we are targeting it in areas where there is high demand in terms of students looking for it as well as a skills need, specifically medicine, nursing, engineering, environmental areas and medical scientists.

On the cost of living, there are measures the Government needs to look at specifically for students and their families.  A number of the measures we have taken as a Government benefit students.  In fairness to the Senator's party leader, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, one of the most impactful has been the change brought about in public transport costs.  They have reduced for everybody but overwhelmingly reduced for people under the age of 24, many of whom are students, by up to 50%.  That is an example of a whole-of-population measure with a specific targeted element that will benefit students above and beyond the rest of the population.  We need to look at clever ways to do more things like that.  The electricity credit will benefit students in student accommodation as well.<\/p> <p>  There will be a budget in October and we want to do much more on student supports, but from September we will see immediate improvements for students.  They include the &euro;1,000 extra a home can earn and still qualify for a SUSI grant, the first income threshold increase in a decade.  The grant will go up by &euro;200 for all students.  That is the first time in a decade.  That does not tell the full story because we have changed the adjacency rates.  One had to live 45 km or more from college to get the higher grant.  That goes down to 30 km from September, meaning many students will see their grant increase by more than 25%.  That is thousands of euro of an increase.<\/p><p>We are eager to do more.

We will work through that in the Estimates process.<\/p><p> One group of students that I would like to see prioritised in the SUSI is postgraduate students.  The cost of doing postgraduate education in Ireland is particularly high.  We made improvements to the level of support through Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, in our first budget as a Government.  There is a shared view across Government that we would like to do more in that space as well.<\/p><p> On the accelerated programmes, I agree fully with Senator Pauline O'Reilly.  I do not mean the following in relation to the Senator.  We all, including me, use the term apprenticeship sometimes as a catch-all phrase for upskilling and reskilling.  What I saw yesterday when I opened a new retrofitting training centre in Limerick was that there are many accelerated programmes where somebody can access a piece of training, that might only take three or four days, to get the green skills that he or she needs to retrofit somebody's home.  For an unemployed person with no construction background, a month in a retrofitting training centre can get him or her probably back into a decent well-paid job with lots of work to come.  I am eager that we broaden the apprenticeships, and we are doing so.  We have 65 now and 17 more in the pipeline.  I am also eager that we look, as the Senator says, at traineeships and shorter courses as well.<\/p><p> On capital, I will make a couple of points.  The sector has been starved of capital for a long time.  That changes now.  We have &euro;450 million to spend between now and 2024, which is a big increase.  Forty-five per cent of that will be spent on further education and apprenticeships.  As we speak, SOLAS, is assessing applications with others and we expect this summer to be able to start announcing projects in the technological universities.  In addition, we have also through the European Research Development Fund ring-fenced funding of &euro;80 million specifically for research in the technological universities, TUs.  Only the TUs will be able to apply, which should benefit them.<\/p><p> Apologies, I ran over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022052400002#EE00300","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":561,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022052400002#FF00200","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":562,"content":"<p>Who did I say was next?

We have such excellent talent but it has to be acknowledged the numbers that are attending third level now are up to 240,000 to 245,000.<\/p> <p>  I am interested in the mention of the National Training Fund around the employer contributions and acknowledge the work that has been done around SUSI.  The Minister stated that he engaged with more than 9,000 people.  In my own local area in Galway, the Minister held webinars with people there to find out what was needed.  It will be important looking at that postgraduate element, as the Minister mentioned.  The reduction of the travel is crucial and also the public transport side of things.  Public transport is very important for travel if the students are going longer distances.<\/p> <p>  The Minister might comment as well on the one-stop-shop now that it has been started up in Maynooth University for the third level students coming from Ukraine.<\/p> <p>  If I may, on the implementation group for funding and reform, the Minister mentioned the cost of education report that he will do prior to the budget.

I am glad the Senator reminded me because one of the key objectives that I want to see from the &euro;307 million of additional funding into the sector is that we do not talk about it as &euro;307 million.  What that roughly means to people is we are spending much more on everybody's education every year.  That will achieve more staff in the universities and an improvement on the student-staffing ratios which, in Ireland, are somewhere between 19:1 and 20:1.  The European average is in or around 15:1.  It is not done in the rigid way that a pupil-teacher ratio in a classroom is done.  Students are used to large lectures in universities, and technological universities in due course, but overall the ratios of staff to students need to improve in the sector.  That is a key aim that we want to deliver on.<\/p> <p>  On the SUSI review, I thank the team in the Department which worked hard on this.  It is a really good piece of work and a key commitment in the programme for Government.  It was done efficiently and also comprehensively in terms of the breadth, as the Senator acknowledged, of consultation.<\/p> <p>  The encouraging aspect is that much of what the review said is what we had begun.  I am not suggesting we have done enough - we have not - but the review basically says we must ensure we increase the rates.  We have started that.  There is much more we need to do.  The review said we must reduce the adjacency-non-adjacency rate.  We have done that and need to do more on that.  The review pointed to postgraduates in which area we need to do more.  One area I must be honest about is that we have a piece of work to do is around part-time education.  At present, we do not provide SUSI for part-time education.  We need to bottom out.  The Senator might ask what I mean by that.<\/p><p>I do not mean this in a flippant way.  What do we define part-time education as?  How long a period of education does it have to be?  Where does it fit on the qualifications framework?  We need to do work to get moving on that.  We cannot have the policy contradiction of telling people that studying part-time is great and then not providing them with support.  I feel strongly about that.<\/p><p> The one-stop shop for Ukrainian students, researchers and staff is going well.  I thank Maynooth University for hosting it, but it is very much a cross-sector initiative.  I thank the admissions offices of universities which have seconded people to this facility.  It has provided a phone line and an email address.  The higher education system can be difficult for anyone to navigate at the best of times, so it could be especially difficult for someone coming here from a war-torn country.  The idea is that people will have an individual conversation with Ukrainian students, researchers or staff members about their stage of education in Ukraine and how that can work in Ireland, with the ultimate goal of ensuring that everyone can continue their education and research.  I am pleased that we have been working on this at a European level.  I thank Commissioner Mariya Gabriel for her work on this.<\/p><p> There are many ways to deal with the cost of education, the cost-of-living crisis and ways to support students outside my Department's remit.  My Department only has two levers to address it directly, which are the student registration fee and the student grant scheme.  The student assistance fund helps to a degree.  The Government paper states that we will look at the options relating to both in each budget.  In one year, the Minister might decide to use one over the other, another Minister might decide to do a little of both in the next year, and in another year, the Minister might decide it is not possible to do either.  There will be a focus on it on budget day every year, just like we do with the pension.  We have a debate every year, as we should, about what the pension should be.  No one is begrudging people getting an increase in the pension.  We do not have that discussion every year.  That changes for students and their families.  The cost of education paper will give us a seat at the table and provide focus to these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022052400002#FF00500","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":566,"content":"<p>I will take a scattergun approach here because I have a number of points I want to raise.  I will start with the last of them.  The Minister referred to the debate we have on the pension every year.  I disagree with him.  I would prefer if we did not have a debate on the pension each year and it was instead benchmarked so that we have certainty about the future and are sure it is keeping pace with the rapidly changing cost of living.  All of the figures here are welcome.  We need to disambiguate between what the different pots of money are doing.  There tends to be conflation in the public consciousness.  Some &euro;307 million is for core funding.  It is about driving research and student-teacher ratios.  We have &euro;450 million in capital funding.  There is a pot of money for technological university research, which is extremely important.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, was in the Walton Institute with me on Friday.  We saw a range of extremely exciting research.  The difficulty for staff working in the technological university and the balance of teaching hours versus research hours, which makes it difficult for them to compete directly with the university sector, was discussed.  We might need to work on that.<\/p> <p>  I have heard clear figures about capital funding and capital.  I am not really hearing figures about how we tackle the costs for the student and the end user.  That is important and we need to have a discussion.  The Minister talked about the two levers available to him.  We need to discuss how we balance universal interventions with more targeted interventions.  In this context, we see the SUSI grant as being more targeted and the reduction of fees as being more universal.  We need to have a proper public discussion about which way we want to go.<\/p> <p>  On the bigger picture, we have repeatedly heard about how Ireland spends a lower percentage of its GDP on higher education than other OECD countries, in particular.  I know GDP is a frothy figure in Ireland so we might prefer to use GNI or GNI*.  We do not compare favourably with other OECD countries.  I would be interested in hearing about the Minister's vision and the global overview.  Do we intend to shift the needle on that percentage spend?  We need to have that conversation openly and publicly.<\/p><p>If we are raising tax, we have a responsibility to talk to the public about how that tax will be spent and explain the decision-making behind it.  I am glad we have turned our face against student borrowing.  We heard different points of view during this unit of work we are doing on student borrowing.  I think student borrowing would present a mountain to climb for families from particular socioeconomic groups, so I am glad that the Minister has set his face against it.<\/p><p> Those are the things I would like the Minister to dig down into.  What specifically are we talking about in terms of funding that we think is going to get to the student?<\/p><p> In terms of tackling the cost of living, I accept the changes that have been made to SUSI grants in terms of eligibility, adjacency etc.  All of those things are very important but I think we would all accept those are running to stand still in terms of chasing the cost of living.  I would like to hear from the Minister what it is in particular and specifically we want to do to tackle that cost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022052400002#GG00200","speaker":"1617","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":568,"content":"<p>The point I was making about the annual debate and pensions and the like was that it seems to me peculiar that we went through a period of austerity and then a period of significant economic growth, and many areas saw improvements and upticks in terms of supports, grants, reductions in Government charges, yet this area did not.  Up until the previous budget the grants did not increase, and up until now we have not talked about reducing registration fees.  That is wrong.  I do not know whether it is a subconscious ageism within our political system but it is stupid and short-termist in terms of investing in human capital.  We talk a lot about investing in capital, but investing in human capital is so important.  Every other measure that was brought in during the austerity era seems to have been eased or improved but the grants did not increase and the registration fees stayed up.  That is not passing the buck.  We were in government.  This is a genuine and honest discussion about how we must have a much more policy-focused approach to the cost of education and investment in education, which needs to happen annually.  Education cannot be the poor relation in any discussion.  To be fair to this Government, I believe we have applied, from the Taoiseach down, a level of focus to these issues.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy specifically referred to the technological university of the south east and to research and research time for staff, which is a core piece.  If our new technological universities are to succeed, which they will and we want them to succeed, the work we are doing with the OECD around a new academic contract is key.  We expect to bottom-out that work this year in our engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the like.  I hope to be in a position to start talking publicly about this matter in more detail shortly.  It is a really key moment.  It is not about imposing contracts or anything like that but more about offering, after a period of consultation and engagement, new contracts to people to work in a new way that is reflective of being in a university, which I believe could be very exiting and transformational for the sector and probably for some of the people whom the Deputy and the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, met.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh is entirely correct in what he said about universal versus targeted in terms of the cost of education, and I could not agree more.  I argue that, as a Government, we tend to do both.  The Minister for Health brought a proposal to Government recently that recommended the removal of the cost of hospital care for children.  He did not bring a proposal suggesting an increase in the income threshold and giving medical cards to more children.  We as a Government made a decision, in line with the idea that we should have a universal healthcare system, that every child should be able to access healthcare without paying.  We did not decide just to tweak the income thresholds for the medical card.  We did not say we would just improve a financial grant for some.  We decided that as we value our kids' health, then healthcare was going to be free for everybody.  That is an example and there are other measures we take in health that are targeted.  It is never either-or when it comes to universal and targeted and it annoys me when people - I do not mean the Deputy because he did not do so - try to make the debate binary, because it never is.<\/p> <p>  On energy, and the Deputy and his party, along with the Minister, Deputy Ryan, have led on the issue, we have done targeted measures on the fuel allowance and we have done universal measures on the energy credit.  Why would education be any different?  We obviously need to target proactively those most in need.  There is no doubt in the wide earthly world that we are already doing so, with &euro;42 million spent on targeted measures from what we call the Programme for Access to Higher Education, PATH, initiatives, which include bursaries of &euro;5,000 to increase diversity among teachers and increasing the SUSI grant, which is a targeted measure.  However, we must recognise also that if a person has two children going to college at the same time and each is doing a four-year degree, it will cost that person &euro;24,000 in registration fees.  I believe that would have cost about &euro;1,500 in 1997.<\/p> <p>  It has to be about where we want to get to, and I do not want to dodge that question in any way, shape or form.  The good news about the work the European Commission did is this will bring us to the average level of spending in Europe.  This will fund our university system roughly to the same level as the Swedish.<\/p><p>We will go from being below average to being in line.  I can get the Deputy more details on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022052400002#HH00400","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":570,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his presentation.  I start by welcoming the positive developments and changes to make things easier for students availing of grants, with the travel distance being cut.  More students can now qualify for a full grant.  The maintenance grant has been increased by &euro;200, along with the income threshold being increased by &euro;1,000 for the standard grant.  They are all welcome measures.  The cost of living is affecting everybody, including our students.  We all know that quite well.<\/p> <p>  I have raised my main concern with the Minister before, which relates to the student earnings cap of &euro;4,500.  I feel this is posing difficulties to students, who cannot work many hours.  They want to work and do not want to have the burden of their education fall on their family who are also grappling with the cost of living.  It would be good to increase this cap incrementally.  I know it cannot be done all at once.  It has not been increased since 2016 and I think it needs to be done.  It is possibly a lost opportunity.  I made a submission on this issue to the steering group review.  I know the Union of Students in Ireland also feels strongly about this issue.  It said it is an obstacle.  I have met many employers in the hospitality sector.  They cannot fill job vacancies because they cannot source enough students to fill the vacancies because of the cap.  The cap affects the employer and the local economy too.  It would be progressive to incrementally increase this in budget 2023.  I called for this when I spoke during Leaders' Questions last week.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge the long overdue positive developments with apprenticeships and traineeships.  We have a serious gap in apprentices to fill.  In order to initiate change at second level and make sure that apprenticeships and traineeships are valued, especially apprenticeships, is there a plan to roll out a programme to bring everybody on board, including career guidance teachers who, through no fault of their own, were focusing more on the academic side than on apprenticeships?  It would be beneficial.  We have listened today to some fantastic young students who were apprentices.  They certainly gave us insight.  If those young people went into schools to interact and talk with students, it would be a positive development.  We should bring the whole school community on board, including teachers, especially career guidance teachers.  It would initiate a change in our way of thinking about what constitutes education.  Craftsmanship should be highly valued, as it is in Germany.  Apprenticeships in Ireland should be no different.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022052400002#JJ00200","speaker":"1592"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":571,"content":"<p>I think I agree with everything the Deputy said.  I thank her for welcoming the positive changes that have been made.  I would be the first to acknowledge that they are a start and there is much more to do, as the SUSI review shows clearly and comprehensively.  The good thing about the SUSI review is that we now know what we need to do.  For the first time, we have identified the real cost of education in further education and training, at an undergraduate level and at a postgraduate level, and looked at how our grant system compares.  The long and short of it is that the SUSI grant system was largely fit for purpose when it was introduced ten years ago, but the cost of living and the cost of accommodation have changed in that time.  We are working to respond to that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy made a fair point about the earnings cap, which comes up a lot.  The earnings cap recognises that a student in full-time education is in full-time education.  At the same time, everything has changed and the &euro;4,500 figure seems low compared with when it was set.  As the Deputy rightly said, it has not been reviewed in a long time.  We will look at it in the pre-Estimates discussion.  My gut feeling is that it could be increased without having any unintended consequences.  It would be welcomed by students, by parents and, as the Deputy says, by sectors of our economy that want students to work part-time.<\/p><p>I am grateful for the Deputy's submission on that.  On second-level change, we started a process with the CAO now having the visibility of apprenticeships and further education.  A number of our schools are rolling out apprenticeship taster courses, as it were, at transition year level.  I think we will have 30 being rolled out with ETBs through Solas.  I will get the details for the Deputy.  I am aware that KWETB does that.  Of course, there is a really important piece around senior cycle reform and the exciting agenda the Minister, Deputy Foley is pursuing.  That can help broaden the discussion around education and skills and maybe allow for more flexibility between what was the traditional leaving certificate and the leaving certificate vocational programme.  We are very eager to do more on CAO reform.  That website and process has narrowed the discussion too much in Ireland.  I am absolutely determined that we change it.  When I talk about future funding, that is going to be a key ask of ours.  There has to be parity and visibility at the very least for students around all their options.  It is not accidental that we have shortages in the construction, hospitality and green skills sectors.  We need to fix that.

One of the points the Minister made is around the provision of additional places in higher education in specific skills areas.  These obviously include programmes like medicine where over the full six-year course we are talking about a full economic cost of something in the order of &euro;100,000.  It has been flagged in some of the media that up to 1,000 additional places are going to be provided in medicine, climate-related programmes and those where a skills shortage has been identified.

Of course, as I said in answer to an earlier question, for obvious reasons they do not have a lot of experience in drawing this down so we need to build a collective sense of confidence around it.

The challenge is that they are not being built in a way that is affordable and, therefore, in some cases they are not being built because they cannot be built and rented at an affordable level.  My officials and I are considering several matters in very close work with the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, and his officials.  There are exciting ideas in the pipeline.  An example of that relates to the Government announcement in respect of helping people to build apartments and whether there is a variation of that which could be used to help bridge that funding gap for some of our institutions.

One relates to whether we can open up student grants to part-time students.  Let us be clear that the legislation allows for that to be done.  That section of the legislation has not been commenced.  On foot of the SUSI work, my Department will do a piece of work in respect of defining the rules and criteria applying to part-time students and, therefore, the eligibility of part-time students for SUSI grants.  There is a further piece we need to do.  We have asked the OECD to do a piece of work - it is in the field now - in terms of the skills infrastructure of the country, but specifically looking at lifelong learning.  As the Senator is aware, participation rates here are below the UN and OECD average when it comes to lifelong learning.  The Government agreed at Cabinet last week to a proposal from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to significantly increase those rates by 2030, from approximately 40% to 60% of people participating in lifelong learning in any one calendar year.  Does that mean one funds the citizen or the business or a bit of both?  How do we crack that model?  We have asked the OECD to specifically come up with policy proposals we can consider as a Government.  It is due to complete the work at the start of 2023 but we hope to get an indication earlier than that of some of the levers we can pursue in the context of lifelong learning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022052400002#LL00300","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":584,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022052400002#LL00400","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":585,"content":"<p>This is the last time I will sit beside Senator Malcolm Byrne.

A students' union would not be doing its job if it was not agitating for the Minister of the day to do more and do it faster.  That is its job.  The USI is a constructive partner and has been very helpful in addressing many student welfare issues and needs through a very difficult period with Covid.  It will know, however, that no Minister, no matter what portfolio he or she holds, can ever say that grants will be increased by X or fees decreased by Y outside of a budgetary cycle.

It is on the implementation group, as is the Technological Higher Education Association and others.  It is a matter for the budget but if the Government goes the full term, which I hope it does, then three budgets remain in its lifetime.

However, the situation is not directly comparable with the SUSI system for several reasons.  Students on the apprenticeship model are paid and earning as they go.  There are also additional payments if students are travelling some distance and other similar aspects.  In many ways, therefore, the earnings of students on apprenticeship programmes would well exceed what would be paid through SUSI.  We would not wish to do something that could end up having an unintended consequence.

After a brief introduction, I will ask Ms Ryan to outline the work of the consortium and Mr. Sadlier to speak about the areas of ongoing concern on which we might seek the support, solidarity and advice of the committee.<\/p> <p>  United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 on women, peace and security was adopted by the UN Security Council in 2001.  That means we have had the last 20 years to reflect on the value of this resolution and, in broader terms, the value of a resolution adopted by the Security Council.  When we look back over that time, we can see some significant strides have been made owing to this resolution.  These developments and the benefits stemming from them have been enjoyed by member states in all corners of the globe.  Today, 98 members of the UN have developed action plans under this resolution.  By way of example, in Uganda, where GOAL has worked since 1989, women now enjoy the highest level of representation in public office and in senior cabinet roles under this action plan.  In another example, in Ukraine, which we will talk more about later, under the national action plan on women, peace and security, significant investments have been made in services for survivors of gender-based violence in the past five years.  Indeed, there have also been significant legal reforms in respect of the recognition of people from the LGBTQI+ community under the auspices of the action plan.  <\/p> <p>  Noting these successes, and many more, including here in Ireland, we do also have concerns about some softening of language used in international forums on the issue of women's rights and on women, peace and security more specifically.  We also have some concerns that the rights of women and girls in armed conflicts and violent settings are not fully appreciated by all actors.  Therefore, we are here to talk to the committee about some of these concerns and the work we are doing to address them.  As the Chair said, UN Resolution 1325 addresses two critical issues: the inordinate impact of conflict and violent armed settings on women and girls; and the crucial role women can and do play in conflict resolution and peacebuilding, when they are so allowed.  <\/p> <p>  The committee has had a presentation from Ireland's representatives on our national action plan, but allow me to outline the four key dimensions of Resolution 1325.  It binds us all when we understand these four dimensions under which the work takes place.  The first dimension under this resolution is participation.  Under this dimension, actions are set out to ensure that women and girls equally participate in society, and in all forums of society that are relevant to their ages and capacities, to be leaders for peacebuilding and conflict resolution and prevention.<\/p> <p>  The second dimension is prevention.  This refers to the prevention of discrimination and violence against women and girls during armed conflict through legislation on gender equality and gender empowerment.  The third dimension is protection.  I refer to important work to protect women and girls from illegal, unlawful violence during conflict.  Under this arm of protection, we see many kinds of work undertaken to ensure that peacekeeping forces are appropriately trained in the rights of girls and women during armed conflict.<\/p> <p>  The fourth pillar of these dimensions is relief and recovery.  Under this pillar, the UN has set out numerous actions to ensure that, following conflict, the rights of and opportunities for girls and women in all their identities, be they displaced or disabled and of all ages, are protected during post-conflict periods and that investments in humanitarian work are proportionately and equally shared to ensure that girls and women enjoy the benefits of those investments and opportunities.  <\/p> <p>  This was a quick tour of UN Resolution 1325.  Under these four dimensions, the ICGBV has been conducting its work for over a decade now.  I ask Ms Ryan to describe some of the important actions we have been taking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022052400002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Van Lieshout"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653346800,"counter":615,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Van Lieshout and the members.  As noted by the Chair, I am the co-ordinator for the ICGBV.<\/p><p> We are a slightly unique organisation in that we are made up of government and civil society organisations working in the international development and humanitarian space to increase our learning and understanding on the issue of gender-based violence, GBV, and improve our programming across the more than 50 countries in which our members work.  We also go out into the world to speak about GBV and to try to target policy change, especially at UN level.  We are made up of 13 members.  As I said, Irish Aid and the Defence Forces are the Government representatives.  We also have 11 of the NGOs that are based in Ireland, including the very big ones such as GOAL, Concern and Tr&oacute;caire, and the very small ones such as the Ifrah Foundation, which is a two-person team working on the issue of female genital mutilation, FGM, in Somalia.  We run the gamut in the Irish international, development and humanitarian space.<\/p><p> We are currently working on our strategic plan, which came into effect last year.  We focused on three key areas: increasing the work on GBV prevention programming; response programming; and risk mitigation.  We have lots of activities going on, including many learning sessions.  This year, we focused quite strongly on GBV and climate change.  We have produced a policy paper on the interconnected impacts of GBV and climate change and we had a session with the Commission on the Status of Women at the UN this year, which included people form the Solomon Islands and Columbia who spoke to what was happening in their communities regarding GBV and climate change and how they were impacted.  We do a lot of work on disability inclusion within GBV programming and try to improve the inclusion of people with disabilities in the work our members are doing.  We have also done a lot of work on psychosocial support and, again, try to improve our members' programming on such support and provide that space for them to learn from each other.<\/p><p> When Ireland took a seat on the UN Security Council last year, we saw a key opportunity to deepen our work on women, peace and security, with Ireland taking a co-chair position on the informal expert group on women, peace and security.  In that moment, we reached out to colleagues in the Department to see how we might be able to bring about a situation where we would have some sessions with departmental officials, and women from countries that were coming up for discussion, on what the realities are for women and girls around the world are on women, peace and security.  We have had eight sessions so far on Haiti, Myanmar, Afghanistan and, most recently, Sudan.  We held these sessions under the Chatham House Rule because for many of the women who came forward to speak there were severe questions regarding their safety and security if they were very public about what they said, but they found a great moment to have real conversations with colleagues from the Department about the reality in their countries.<\/p><p> In Myanmar, for example, we have heard that many of the organisations and women that spoke out about what was happening there had to flee their countries.  The reprisals, not only on them, as individuals, but also on their organisations in terms of violence and cutting of funding, have been so severe that most of them have had to leave.  We have heard that in Columbia, even now after the peace process, women are facing high levels of violence and indigenous women, in particular, have a real fear of being killed for speaking out about what is happening in their communities.  We heard from colleagues in Afghanistan that limitations on the freedom of movement of women there have had significant impacts, not only on their access to education, but their ability to engage in employment.  Many of the women's rights organisations, or women-led organisations, have had to consider closing, if not actually close, because their staff simply cannot get to work.  We are hearing about many major issues regarding how repression in women's lives means they are struggling to engage in their communities.<\/p><p> I will leave it there for now and pass over to my colleague, Mr. Sadlier, who will talk about some of the recommendations for today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022052400002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Abby Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653346800,"counter":617,"content":"<p>This set of recommendations came out of those listening sessions and the work that we as implementing partners do on the ground.  There are five recommendations we believe will strengthen the approach to women, peace and security, if they are implemented.<\/p> <p>  To be honest, the first recommendation is an embarrassment for me to say, and it should be an embarrassment for all of us sitting in this room that it has to be repeated 27 years after the Beijing Declaration, which is the inclusion of women and minorities in decision-making.  The fact we are so far into this agenda and we still have to remind ourselves that women and minorities have to be included in processes that affect their lives is simply not acceptable.  We know that women face greater barriers to involvement in processes, leadership and decision-making processes and we have to do better to overcome those barriers and provide that support.  That requires finance, capacity building and a change of mindset at all levels in order for us to do that.  It is not only that our results are not taking on board the needs of women and minorities.  It is that if such needs are taken into account, it leads to better results.  We know when women are involved results are better, so it is something we have to improve on.<\/p> <p>  The second recommendation is removing the barriers to access to services and basic needs.  We recently did a study of 28 camps of internally displaced people in north-west Syria.  Some 88% of the women we interviewed said they lacked access to basic essential services, namely, education, healthcare and general support.  It is not only detrimental to survivors of GBV that they cannot access the relevant support services they require; education is a way to break many of these cycles.  I have seen this in South Sudan where in a school of 700 or 800 children, there are approximately 120 children in the early years class and the gender divide is approximately 50-50.  As we go up through the years, the numbers dwindle and the number of girls in the classes really dwindles.  Girls are missing their opportunity, which we know can bring about profound changes.  It is also becoming much more complex.  Ms Ryan mentioned the issues around GBV and climate change.  I was in South Sudan last December and schools we had supported, with the help of Irish Aid, had been washed away by floods along the River Nile.  There is an internally displaced people, IDP, camp, schools are flooded and the local health centre, which was built by GOAL in the same IDP camp, was also flooded.  The nexus of climate change, protection and access to services is becoming increasingly important.<\/p> <p>  The third area involves the protection and provision of safe spaces for human rights defenders and civil society organisations.  We see this from our community work where we need to provide places for women and survivors of GBV to come together to support each other.  By providing these very simple areas that are safe and protected for women in the community they get to have peer support and access services they need.  We need this at different levels so we can provide spaces for women to come together to support each other, and to plan, talk and take things forward.  It is becoming increasingly important and, again, we see that many human rights defenders need this support.<\/p> <p>  The fourth area relates to active support and collaboration with civil society organisations.  This is an area where Irish Aid is incredibly strong, as are many of the Irish agencies, in supporting the localisation agenda and the grand bargain, looking at how we support local civil society and local organisations to be a voice for themselves and, increasingly, allowing them to play the leadership role in how we build capacity, especially for local women's organisations and how we help them develop to be in the lead and support their own communities.<\/p> <p>  The fifth area is that of the implementation of children's rights in conflict and post-conflict situations.  Again, our recent study in north-west Syria showed that 43% of children we spoke with knew of somebody under the age of 18 who had been married.  Child marriage is an increasing issue, as are teenage pregnancies.  The recruitment of children into armed forces, especially  young boys, is also a major issue.  We cannot talk about women, peace and security without looking at the impact on children and ensuring we protect their safety in it.  In many cases, it is the mother who is looking after the security of the child.  By making sure women are safe, therefore, we are also protecting their children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022052400002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Sadlier"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":618,"content":"<p>That was most interesting.  Members and witnesses will be aware of Ireland's participation in the third national action plan on women, peace and security.  In fact, this committee has a direct role in monitoring and engagement.  The first report of the oversight group was received by the committee last year.  We understand work is under way on the second report and it will be lodged with us as soon as it has been completed.<\/p><p> Senator Wilson has departed.  Last week he had the opportunity of attending the UN Security Council and seeing at first hand the leadership being employed by Ireland at that level and indeed the great privilege it has been for Ireland to join the council yet again.  I acknowledge the work of our team, especially, Ms Geraldine Byrne Nason, who, for many years and in various roles in the Department, has been most active in highlighting the need to ensure a greater level of equality, and empowering women and girls.  We saw first-hand last week the leadership position she has taken in that regard.<\/p><p> Turning to Ms Ryan and Mr. Sadlier in particular, Ms Ryan mentioned some parts of the world where there are acute challenges and where Ireland, through our NGOs and especially through the leadership of Irish Aid, is assisting in ensuring the changing of attitudes and moving away from what often is a real barrier, in the form of traditional regulation and attitudes.  We can oversee regulatory change in many countries across the world but regulatory change alone will not change attitudes.  Perhaps our guests will give us their experience, particularly of the current crisis in Afghanistan and the seriously adverse and disadvantaged position within which women and girls find themselves on a daily basis with reference to education and work.  I ask them to also outline the position regarding the dangers in that country of a proliferation of GBV.  An issue this committee has looked at not in recent times but in the past is the scourge of FGM.  Have our guests seen, in the context of their work in recent years, an improvement in the situation in the sense of a changing of attitudes that would lead them to believe firm progress is being made?  Ireland took part in the Generation Equality Forum last year.  Is it too early to evaluate our takeaways from the participation or how our participation might best ensure a greater level of success or a greater level of surmounting what would appear to be serious barriers in the form of attitude, traditions and laws in many countries across the world?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022052400002#C00300","speaker":"1589","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653346800,"counter":620,"content":"<p>Are there other questions the Chair wants put on the table?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022052400002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Van Lieshout"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":621,"content":"<p>Yes, I will ask Deputy Cowen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022052400002#D00300","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":622,"content":"<p>I wish to briefly pick up on a point Ms Ryan made on the work of the Security Council and Ireland's chairing of the sub-committee.

On Afghanistan, I am not an expert on it so I apologise if I cannot give the Chair all the information on that.  For me it is clear in those moments that the work in communities, particularly around gender-based violence prevention, is really important.  When perhaps there is not a possibility to engage in looking to change regulatory systems that work happening directly in communities with GOAL, World Vision and all the members of the consortium becomes ever more to the front of your mind.  I might let some others speak on that in a minute.<\/p> <p>  On FGM, it is hard to measure progress on these things.  One of the fears you have is some things we are hearing are about a slight trend change in FGM moving more towards medicalisation of it.  That is very worrying.  If doctors are performing FGM and cutting in countries that is a really different challenge we are facing.  You hear in some countries that is where the trend is going.  There has been much work done by lots of organisations trying to work in communities to try to change mindsets on FGM.  That is the slow work of changing people's perceptions on this being the right thing to do.  Here in Ireland that is also coming up as working with communities here and some of our organisations, for example Action Aid, are working in direct provision centres on issues around FGM.  It is a challenging one for sure.<\/p> <p>  I might pass over to Ms Van Lieshout to talk about the UN Security Council.  To clarify, the eight meetings were meetings we had internally with the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022052400002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Abby Ryan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653346800,"counter":624,"content":"<p>If I may, I will take up the Deputy's question on the UN Security Council, such as I can.  All of us involved in watching the Security Council and involved in watching Ireland's promise when it was running for election to the council have been immensely proud and gratified for the leadership.  Ms Byrne Nason is a formidable leader, but she has a team of people around her who are extremely well prepared before the meetings.  I sit for GOAL on the UN Security Council stakeholders' advisory committee, which was established by the Institute of International and European Affairs, IIEA.  A number of agencies sit together and we are regularly briefed on the agenda.<\/p> <p>  This has been a very difficult period for anyone newly elected to the Security Council.  You need only look at the conflicts around the world, such as the situations in Ethiopia and Ukraine.  Some of the real legacy of the Irish contribution will be in the context of significant accomplishments.  One of them was a resolution recently on managing the transition out of conflict of UN peacekeeping forces.  That is a very fragile time for any community.  A community has become comfortable with the safety and protection of UN forces and when it is deemed safe enough for those forces to depart that is a frightening moment for many communities.  Ireland has played a strong leadership role in ensuring there are strong protocols and procedures managing those withdrawals, so the community is safe.  It is untold how much benefit that will be to poor communities that are very frightened following conflict.<\/p> <p>  Other significant achievements include the resolution on the cross-border access of humanitarian goods into Syria.  Last year, Ireland was the pen-holder on that resolution.  It had to be one of the most difficult conversations, yet this year it is made all the more difficult by the conflict in Ukraine, such are the politics of that discussion.  We are talking about accessing the community of north-west Syria with humanitarian goods over the border from Turkey.  There will be another vote on whether that access will continue or be discontinued.  That vote happens annually.  This year it is a very difficult vote but last year Ireland managed it with a strong political nous and very sophisticated behind-the-scenes negotiations trying to depolarise the conversation.  That will be a legacy to the people of Syria of which Ireland can be proud.<\/p><p> Among many other contributions, a final contribution that will stand to Ireland was some work it did with Niger on climate change, the environment and conflict.  While the resolution did not pass because of the politics at the Security Council - we have seen it, so we cannot always be surprised by that - Ireland managed to build a solid consensus, knowledge, awareness and support across the general membership on the understanding of the interaction between conflict and the environment.  Mr. Sadlier has described some of it, including significant development gains being lost to environmental damage.  Ireland worked with Niger quietly and behind the scenes on something that has not captured media attention as a great success, but it is the consensus behind the issue now that will be Ireland's legacy.<\/p><p> These are just a few contributions that should give us all the great pride that the Chairman has expressed.  Ireland's tenure is not over yet, but the legacy of the past two years will be rich and something we will be proud of for many years to come.<\/p><p> I will hand over to Mr. Sadlier to discuss some of the on-the-ground work the Chairman has mentioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022052400002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Van Lieshout","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653346800,"counter":626,"content":"<p>I will address three points, the first of which has to do with Afghanistan.  It is concerning to see the regression there.  World Vision is active on the ground and has been in Afghanistan for 30-plus years.  We had hoped my colleague, Ms Asuntha Charles, the national director in Afghanistan, would be in attendance today, but she is actually taking some leave for the first time since it all backslid last year.<\/p> <p>  As actors on the ground, we will continue with quiet diplomacy and advocacy for education and women's rights, but we need engagement at the highest level as well.  It must be continuous engagement.  The situation is not something we as implementers on the ground can fix.  It is very concerning and has significant implications.<\/p> <p>  Regarding behavioural change and legal elements, the Chairman is right.  This is not just about Afghanistan.  We are also working in Puntland in Somalia with three different levels of law, those being, state law, traditional law and Sharia law.  It is a two-pronged approach where we work to ensure enforcement of the laws while also working on behavioural changes at community level.  We are trying to engage men.  People often throw their hands up in their air and ask \"What about the men?\"  We are engaging men for the benefit of women and for all.  However, progress is a slow burn and changing behaviours and mindsets takes a long time.  We are doing some interesting work in South Sudan.  Laws are difficult to understand, so we are ensuring people understand them and bring them into local languages.  Tanzania has 70 plus languages, for example.  Laws need to be transposed into local languages and popularised.  We take multiple tracks to achieve change and it is a slow burn.  It is easier to get legislative frameworks in place, and getting things to work on the ground takes longer.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman right about the Generation Equality Forum in that it is too early to know fully.  What Ireland has done well - Ms Van Lieshout has alluded to some of it - at the Security Council and in all other forums is putting women at the centre of discussions and listening to those on the front lines.  I do not necessarily mean the three of us, but women from the community and people on the front line.  Ireland gives them space and uses its access to let their voices be heard, which is important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022052400002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Sadlier"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":627,"content":"<p>I am glad we are joined by Deputy Clarke, lest the committee give the impression our deliberations are dominated by men.

I join our guests in acknowledging the work Ms Byrne Nason, our UN ambassador, and her team are doing.  The Chairman and I have engaged with them a number of times and we were impressed with what they have done.  I am pleased to hear they are continuing in that vein now that we have a seat on the Security Council.<\/p> <p>  A number of issues arise, the first of which is the Istanbul Convention and its implementation globally.  Our guests might address this.  As Ms Van Lieshout has stated, violence and war are occurring more frequently around the world.  We are living in an awful time, one with a great deal of conflict around the world.  Obviously, women and girls suffer much more in such situations.<\/p> <p>  Ms Van Lieshout referred to the impact of climate change.  We have met people from the Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands, Nauru and elsewhere who are impacted by climate change.  It affects Africa and Asia as well, where there are climate extremes.  The impact of this on women and girls is disproportionate.  They carry the brunt of it.  Our guests might comment on this point.<\/p> <p>  We all feel helpless about what is happening in Afghanistan.  The way in which women and girls there are being treated is appalling, not only for the reasons the guests set out, but for the loss of potential, talent and ability to the people of Afghanistan and the world.  It is shocking.  The Oireachtas has worked on gender pay reporting and gender budgeting, introduced laws criminalising coercive control and so on.  While we must keep an eye on what is happening in Ireland, we must also be cognisant of what is happening abroad, which is the other extreme.<\/p> <p>  At some stage, the committee should invite the Front Line Defenders to a meeting.

I had sight of the draft plan.  What pleased me was the strong policy coherence between what was happening at domestic level and in the international space.  I am pleased to see the plan advancing.

Ms Robinson will be happy to hear she had a lasting impact.<\/p> <p>  We are seeing the effects of the climate change issue in Afghanistan as well.  The current hunger crisis is driven in part by the Ukraine crisis, but it is also driven by climate change.  We are seeing a major global hunger crisis.  It does not just affect a number of countries.<\/p><p>We see an increase in child marriage in Afghanistan because families are pushed to the brink of their coping mechanisms.  There is nothing else they can do aside from, ultimately, selling their children into child marriage.  We see an increase in inter-partner violence in South Sudan, again because of the stress put on households, including the stress of having to feed one's family and not being able to do so.  It is raising a whole load of issues.  We see a really strong correlation between the impacts of climate change and gender-based violence, not necessarily always physical violence but also psychosocial and emotional violence.  I think we are all having an impact on that.<\/p><p> It is, as I said, a matter of access to services.  Many of these places are being washed away, with the banks of the Nile flooding away a health centre and a school.  There is erosion and it is really difficult.  Deputy Stanton mentioned the Marshall Islands, and there is also Kiribati.  We work with the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu as well and with communities that are very remote and cut off from services and that are in very difficult situations.  I was in Sierra Leone a few years ago and spent two hours trying to get off a very remote island because of torrential downpours - in the dry season.  It was all right for me, but a woman experiencing a very dangerous delivery there who could not get to the mainland, to the hospital, would have been more than likely dead, to be honest.  We see an ever-increasing impact of climate change on the well-being of women.  It is also driving conflict in lots of places and hampering access to scarce resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022052400002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Sadlier","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":633,"content":"<p>I thank our guests.  I apologise for needing to step out.  I find it somewhat ironic to have to leave a meeting on gender-based violence to go to a briefing on gender equality because we have an Oireachtas Committee on Gender Equality on the back of the Citizens' Assembly that reported last year.<\/p> <p>  I think Mr. Sadlier touched on this somewhat when he spoke of those polarising conversations that need to be had and the good work that can come out of them, but where international agreements meet and overlap somewhat with domestic policy, particularly around the aspect of equality, how does he see that working on the ground?  Internationally, we may have a vision of where we want access to education, laws applied or representation figures, but how do we bridge that?  How do we nudge forward what the international community sees as best practice in a way that is culturally appropriate to the countries in which the NGOs operate?<\/p> <p>  Second, 20 years on, what progress do the witnesses think has still to be made?  We know that good steps have been taken in some areas, and they need to be recognised, but there are other areas where perhaps the anticipated progress has not quite got there yet.  In what areas is that the case, and what work do the witnesses see as needing to happen to reach those anticipated outcomes?<\/p> <p>  The third area I wish to focus on is gender-based and sexual violence as a weapon of war.  In the witnesses' experience, what is the prevalence of reporting, not of experiencing?  What, then, are the barriers to reporting and to conviction?  Ultimately, what are the training needs of the NGOs on the ground or those points of first contact with somebody who has experienced gender-based or sexual violence as a weapon of war?  I would also like the witnesses to give us a little more information on where conflict overlaps with environment.  As to how we approach that, climate change is changing all the time and its repercussions are changing.  What impact does that have on the work the witnesses do on the ground?  Does it change their approach to certain things?  Do they find themselves needing to target more specific resources into certain areas?<\/p> <p>  The last topic I wish to touch on is the exploitation of children.  Unfortunately, we see a large number of unaccompanied minors coming from all areas of conflict.  What involvement do the witnesses have with children who then become unidentifiable or perhaps missing in the system?

I will keep my answers at the highest possible level and with a note of caution and concern.  Multilateralism and absolute commitment to the multilateral institutions are critical to nudging forward public policy in every single member state.  My caution is that what we have seen in the past ten years is a reduced commitment to multilateralism.  I come back to the Irish bravery and courage in going for the UN Security Council seat at a time when commitment to multilateralism is at a low point.  I will not say the lowest ever point, but in almost 60 years of the existence of the United Nations, I think it is hard for many of us in the room to remember when support for the UN has been more difficult.  I hope, through public policy at the United Nations, that we bring forward a consensus that is almost a peer pressure on neighbouring states and regions.  It is through the regional bodies, such as the Organisation of African Unity and the European Union, that the United Nations mechanisms come down regionally and on to states.  Of course, people can talk to the committee about what can happen on the ground in addition to public policy, but there is no gainsaying the effect of peer pressure state by state.  I believe we have seen some of that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked for examples of what has happened and what remains to be done.  We could point to quite significant movement in public recognition of girls' access to schools.  We have certainly seen much greater support for and understanding of that internationally.  As Mr. Sadlier said, one can go into many schools and see at least early participation.  That participation decreases and decreases as girls get older, but we have widespread and better understanding of the value of girls' education to the family doing better and coping better with scarce resources.  That is one major accomplishment of the past decade.<\/p> <p>  Where do we need good, concrete work?  We need it in women's participation in peace processes and women's recognition at the peacebuilding table and the negotiating table.  As an example, in the past six years of peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, there have been no female delegates on the Russian team and only two female delegates from Ukraine.  Yet a significant majority of those affected by the displacement and the conflict in Ukraine are women on the move.  That displacement renders them extremely vulnerable to increased levels of gender-based violence.  There is the excessive military presence and the displacement from their own legal frameworks.  All of that renders them much more susceptible to victimisation and gender-based violence, yet there is very low import of their knowledge and their experience at the negotiating table.  If we could do one thing in every peace negotiation and ensure there is representation of women of all identities bringing their experience to the table, we would achieve a significant amount in making sure that the rights of women, girls and children are protected in that post-conflict period.  That is one area where I hope we can take concrete actions and watch every single peace negotiation and ask where the female representation is.  That looks small.  Certainly, it looks easier than some of the more complex things we have been asking for, but its impact is very significant.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked us about GBV as a weapon of war and talked to us about counting and numbers.<\/p><p>If, in any given conflict, we cannot put a number on how many women are experiencing GBV, it is very important to us that we do not allow this absence of numbers to prevent us from taking action.  We can make some assumptions based on evidence from previous conflicts.  We have to act to protect people in the knowledge that displacement in and of itself increases the risk.  What we know in Ukraine is that even prior to this war, women who were displaced in the region had three times the level of GBV, compared with women who were not displaced.  Our argument is that we cannot wait for more data to allow us to act.<\/p><p> Ms Ryan spoke about some of the sessions we have had with the informal expert group on violence against women and the need for Chatham House rules.  In one of our most recent informal expert listening sessions, we heard from women from across the iNGO network, including Concern, Tr&oacute;caire, World Vision and Goal.  All of the women who spoke on our behalf from the ground spoke about a fear of reprisal when they document or report GBV.  They are afraid of reporting it to the authorities due to the reprisals they and their families will experience.  Documenting GBV and making it safe to report would be another extremely significant achievement if we could only do it.  It is very difficult to say to a woman, \"You be the first, you go across that line because we need the numbers.\"  It is extremely high-risk for many women to take those risks for their families and their organisations, as I hope we have demonstrated.  The one reason we are not joined by our colleagues from the field to some degree is because of this awareness of the dangers that attach to publicly speaking about public policy in this area in particular.<\/p><p> While I absolutely want to say that documenting is really important and accountability is critical, it is hard to see the progress in that area as quickly as in some other areas for investment.  This is simply because it is a life of danger and it puts children in danger for many of our colleagues who are asked to do so.  I cannot give an easy answer on that.<\/p><p> On the issue of the exploitation of children, I will look to my colleagues and ask if there is someone who is more comfortable answering on that from the basis of their work with children and child protection on the ground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022052400002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Van Lieshout","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653346800,"counter":636,"content":"<p>I will add to Ms van Lieshout&rsquo;s comments.  I have a figure but I would not generalise the figure.  It is from a very discreet piece of work in north-west Syria where 25% of women interviewed said they had witnessed GBV but only 9% reported that they had been victims of it.  It is very problematic.  I think it is far higher than either of those figures.  A place such as north-west Syria has multiple issues, including cultural issues, lack of accountability and lack of services.  I mentioned that I have been to South Sudan.  I have been to places in the middle of nowhere where it is pointless.  There are no police services and no health services - there is nothing.  That is what we do on the ground.  We are building these services and trying to make those connections.<\/p> <p>  On the exploitation of children, we work at community and national levels.  We leave the reunification and repatriation stuff to the UN agencies.  Ireland is one of the strongest donors around education and protection programming.  I spoke to my colleagues across a number of countries as part of a piece of work we did recently.  When I asked them why they were not asking me for money for food - we know that food and climate change are big issues - I was told the reason was that Ireland funds protection but no other donors do so.  Protection at a community level is vital.<\/p> <p>  When I was looking through my notes this morning from my last trip to South Sudan, I was reminded that one of the kids said that peace comes from education.  That answers many of the questions that Deputy Clarke asked.  For me, it is accountability and education.  Until we have accountability from the ground up and implementation from the top down, we will not see anything.  We have many international agreements and national laws, but we will only see changes when local communities and local citizenry can hold their governments to account.  <\/p> <p>  In the climate sphere, we have a programme that is implemented in Galway and in Tanzania around holding local government to account on climate action.  That is the sort of work I really enjoy.  I have just finished a piece of work with the Philippines on a similar process.  We need local communities to be able to hold their governments to account for delivery of services and plans.  Deputies may not always enjoy being held to account or being shouted at by people outside the D&aacute;il but ultimately that is what I would like to see in many of the places we work.  I want people to be free and able to hold their governments to account.  That is where we will actually make progress and reach things.<\/p> <p>  On the conflict around climate change and resources, we have not been able to travel very much in the past few years.  South Sudan was my most recent trip.  Food is a problem.  The World Food Programme, through World Vision, is distributing food.  People in internally displaced camps are getting food parcels, but people in local host communities are not.  They have equal challenges.  Climate change is impacting the lives of both groups equally.  There is conflict between host communities and internally displaced persons, so much so that host communities can refuse land rights or fishing rights to those who are internally displaced.  Such conflict often happens, although not always to this extent.  They are no longer allowed to grow crops or to fish.  It is causing friction between communities.  We have seen that when resources pass through communities in northern Uganda to South Sudan or northern Kenya, there is conflict for water and grazing rights, etc.  Where resources are more scarce, we are seeing increased intercommunal violence around those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022052400002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Sadlier"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":637,"content":"<p>I think Ms Van Lieshout is absolutely correct.

If the country of arrival does not have the resources to meet the needs of those crossing the border, which are often based on trauma, how best can the host country react and address that trauma before it gets to the point where it is hugely destructive?<\/p> <p>  Ms Van Lieshout is correct about needing women&rsquo;s voices at the table.

The short answer &ndash; it is not very simple &ndash; is that in an emergency context, GBV services have to be seen as essential life-saving services from the very beginning.  Protection clusters and GBV subclusters through the humanitarian architecture need to be activated from the start.  We know that when there is a mass movement of people, conflict or any kind of emergency situation, the levels of GBV will rise.  As Ms Van Lieshout said, we do not need the data to know that is the case.  We hear it all the time.  In short, those things need to be there from the very start.<\/p> <p>  That means they need to be funded.  In 2019, the International Rescue Committee brought out a report which looked over the previous three years.  That is all it could look at because we have only had aggregated data on GBV services since 2016.  It looked at how much funding there had been for GBV services between 2016 and 2018 in emergencies and in humanitarian calls.<\/p><p>Some 0.12% went to GBV services, which was a third of what was requested.  That is not to say that funding is the only answer, but there is a need to triple the amount of funding given to GBV services in emergency settings.  Another stark finding from that report was about the need to increase levels of GBV expertise.  In some cases, people are literally not available to work on these programmes.  There are two sides to that and some big needs are becoming evident.  My colleagues will speak about ensuring and embedding peace so that it is not fragile and lost.  That has happened in many countries, where this has rolled back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022052400002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Abby Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653346800,"counter":641,"content":"<p>I have just completed work on how peace is fragile.

I was quite clear that women have to step in as mediators, since they will be listened to, so that further outbreaks are prevented and it does not grow in scale.  We see it everywhere.  Peace is fragile.  It is difficult and it will get more difficult.  As Deputy Stanton said, the world is squeezed for resources and there is increasing conflict.

Clearly, I do not believe it would be held in this forum, but too often we are binary about what is peace and what is not.  Many communities are exiting a violent armed conflict and going into a period of chronic instability and fragility.  That is the period in which we cannot convince ourselves that it is peace and that we have to keep the work going.  Our teams in Haiti speak about the women working in some informal urban settlements there and how they are the front line of building social cohesion on a daily basis.  Who would call that peacebuilding?  Building social cohesion and the capacity of a community to resolve problems when they are small and still a flashpoint, following a conflict, is peacebuilding.  Recognising that those periods can continue to require support, funding and social cohesion investment for years before we can confidently ask if peace has arrived is increasingly part of our work.  These fragile settings with protracted conflict require a greater appreciation of the investment and support that is required.  Our understanding is that women are playing a critical leadership role in those communities.

We support home builders to deliver quality affordable homes to home buyers.  The past number of years have been particularly difficult as home buyers have struggled against the lack of supply and affordability.  In 2020, the IHBA launched a comprehensive report, commissioned from EY, which offered a thorough and detailed analysis of housing affordability in Ireland.  The report, the most wide-ranging and rigorous examination of the residential sector in Ireland for some years, provided a full analysis of affordability and supply of homes in Ireland and highlighted how difficult things were then.<\/p> <p>  The current situation is that things are worse now.  Affordability remains challenging and recent extraordinary increases in the costs and availability of materials do not help.  Supply of housing is not meeting demand.  With mounting construction costs, home builders are challenged to bring new homes to the market at a level that average income earners can afford.  The IHBA fully supports the goals of the national planning framework and the assurances provided that it would not lead to large-scale dezoning.<\/p><p>We support the concept of evidence-based policymaking.  In recent years the sector has witnessed a vastly changed policy environment.  Therefore the requirement for robust evidence-based assessments informing preparation of city and county development plans is critical.  Prematurely, some planning authorities dezoned residential development lands in their current review cycle.<\/p><p> To inform the distribution of population and housing targets, the national planning framework, NPF, requires planning authorities to prepare and publish an infrastructural assessment of settlements distinguishing between lands that are serviced and serviceable.  To date, these assessments have either not been carried out or the approach has been inconsistent due to a lack of resources and detailed guidance available to the authorities at the time of preparation.  Constraining supply of zoned residential lands to a six-year development plan cycle compromises the forward acquisition and investment programme required by house builders to ensure continuity of development over the medium to longer term.  We welcome the promised review of the NPF and the opportunity to use up-to-date information from our recent census to fully inform housing needs and demands.<\/p><p> We are currently experiencing a shortage of labour, in part due to a prolonged period of uncertainty in the past.  We do, however, have a national development plan and Housing for All, both of which set out what developments will happen over the next decade.  Both plans bring committed funding from the Government, giving certainty that developments will happen and confidence for people coming into the industry that they can make a living.  The recent future skills report estimates that 27,000 additional workers will be required in the residential sector when delivery will be at its highest under the current plan.  While we are already witnessing greater numbers enter the sector across the various professions and trades, we must continue to make the sector attractive to new entrants and remove current blockages.  Work permits for those coming from outside the EU are currently taking 16 weeks to process.  This is too long to expect someone to wait when we badly need workers.  We welcome the additional resources in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  This timeframe must reduce dramatically.  The apprenticeship model could also be enhanced by providing some trades through a traineeship model ranging from six to 18 months depending on the type of work.<\/p><p> The rising cost of building homes is a real challenge for builders and consumers.  Residential material costs are going up daily and putting homes further out of the reach of those who so desperately need them.  The sector continues to raise specific concerns and examples regarding how inflation is impacting the industry.  However, the situation is worsening weekly.  If an increased cost of delivery of &euro;15,000 to &euro;20,000 is not added to the purchase price of a home, taking a purchase price of approximately &euro;350,000, pre-tax profit margins drop from 10% to 5%.  As a result, the builder will not meet the primary criteria for financing and, therefore, will not be able to secure funding and cannot commence development.  If the increased cost of delivery because of product inflation is added to the purchase price of a home, the consumer's ability to secure a mortgage is further diminished and those currently locked out of the market are further restricted.<\/p><p> It is not widely appreciated that over half the cost of bringing a home to market is made up of soft costs &ndash; VAT, levies, taxes, contributions, land, professional fees and margin.  These costs are often incurred many years in advance of commencement.  There is potential to streamline those costs, deliver homes sooner, reduce costs and make homes more affordable.  There is a difference between construction costs and development costs and asking the new home purchaser to pay for all these soft costs is inequitable when compared to the second-hand home market.<\/p><p> While we support the advances in standards in recent years, these come at a cost.  A regulatory impact assessment of recent changes to building regulations alone in the past five years would demonstrate the challenge to home building.  There must be an urgent review of our compact growth design standards.  By applying a qualitative assessment rather than a quantitative approach, we can increase affordability and optimise greater land efficiency.  Through standardising open spaces, private open space and separation distances, we can increase affordability and viability and improve community spaces.  Additionally, we recommend it be made possible to conduct early discussions with approved housing bodies, AHBs, before planning permissions are granted.  By doing this, it is more likely that the design ultimately granted would be more suitable for their needs and more cost-effective for all.<\/p><p> Our members continue to work hard to supply much-needed homes.  However, it is important that critical issues such as material costs and availability, zoning, infrastructure, planning, affordability and viability, which are impeding delivery, are tackled with urgency.  I am happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022052400002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Benson","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1653346800,"counter":654,"content":"<p>Deputy Emer Higgins took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":655,"content":"<p>A vote has been called in the Seanad so the Senators have had to step out.

I am also the CCMA nominee to the Government construction contracts committee, or GCCC, hosted by the Office of Government Procurement, OGP.  I am accompanied by Ms Margaret Geraghty of the LGMA's housing delivery co-ordination office, which co-ordinates the delivery of social and affordable housing by local authorities.  On behalf of the CCMA, I thank the committee for its invitation to the meeting today and I look forward to assisting the committee in its discussion of construction costs in housing.<\/p> <p>  All local authorities, along with AHBs, perform an extensive range of housing services, including a multi-billion euro programme of new social housing construction across all parts of the country.  A variety of procurement methods is used to deliver social and affordable housing, ranging from traditional employer-designed projects, using public works contracts to design and build, to public private partnerships, joint ventures, competitive dialogue and turnkeys.  Since the end of the last Covid-19 related suspension in construction work in early 2021, building contractors involved in housing construction for local authorities and AHBs have experienced delays, disruption and uncertainty with material supplies and material costs.  While towards the end of 2021 delays and uncertainty in material supply chains had appeared to ease somewhat, the uncertainty and volatility in construction materials have, if anything, significantly increased since the start of the year.<\/p> <p>  Until the end of 2021, the public works form of contract was essentially a fixed-price form of contract.  However, given the level of material price increases seen in 2021, the OGP modified the standard forms of contract in January 2022 to allow tenderers to recover material price increases in excess of 15%.  The construction sector has reported that the rate of material price increase accelerated in the first quarter of 2022 and was also seriously impacted by energy price increases from March.  Local authorities' experience since the start of the year is that a significant number of contractors involved in social housing construction were experiencing negative financial impacts from increased material costs and in several instances had indicated that, reluctantly, they would not be in a position to continue to deliver housing on a fixed-price basis.  This situation was particularly prevalent in small to medium sized builders who, local authorities believe, have less scope to absorb costs.  This experience was also prevalent in turnkey type projects which, heretofore, have also been fixed-price in nature.  Furthermore, local authorities were also seeing a marked decline in the number of tenders being received for house construction projects.  There is a sense that some building contractors were opting not to tender for projects until there was greater certainty both in terms of increasing material costs and also in anticipation of a change to the fixed-price tendering system.  This has the potential to reduce delivery in 2023 and 2024.<\/p> <p>  The HDCO, on behalf of local authorities, submitted examples of those issues to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to assist Departments in their deliberations.  Local authority housing capital teams welcome the measures announced by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, on 10 May this year to address the impact of construction material price inflation on public works projects.  The ability of contractors to recover 70% of material cost increases on contracts dated prior to 7 January and fuel-related cost increases on all projects brings a greater level of certainty to both contracting authorities and contractors operating public works contracts.  Detailed guidance and templates have been published by the Office of Government Procurement, which will assist with clarity and consistency in the application of these new measures across the local authority sector.<\/p> <p>  To conclude, the delivery by local authorities of social and affordable housing under Housing for All, in co-operation with the construction sector, continues to experience issues relating to material price increases, supply chain delays and disruption, along with an increasing demand for skilled workers.  However, it is hoped that the recent changes to the public works contracts will reduce the level of uncertainty and risk associated with material cost increases.  These issues require close co-operation by all stakeholders for the foreseeable future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022052400002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Taaffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":657,"content":"<p>Thank you.

We thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to the meeting.<\/p> <p>  As the leading professional body for chartered surveyors working in the property, construction and land sectors across Ireland, we undertake research on a wide range of economic, industry and practice-related issues in the public interest.  Chartered surveyor members of the SCSI work across the built environment in both the public and private sectors, providing advice to clients across the entire life cycle of a build from greenfield site through to design, mapping, budgets, project management, sales, lettings and property management.<\/p><p>As such, surveyors are well placed to provide real-time independent evidence of increasing construction costs and their impact on the sector, including the consequences for housing delivery. <\/p><p> The current housing crisis, with demand outstripping supply, is well documented.  It is forecast that the population of Ireland will grow by up to 600,000 in the next ten years, which will place additional pressures on the market to produce a greater selection of housing units of various sizes, not just for growing families but also for those who wish to downsize to two- and one-bedroom apartments.  A proportionate number of private and publicly developed units is therefore required to ensure our urban and regional centres are developed in a way that caters for all demographics and family sizes, of varying levels, in a co-ordinated and inclusive manner.<\/p><p> For our economy to remain in a healthy position and to ensure that there is sufficient accommodation for future needs, the housing delivery market should be in a sustainable and well-functioning state.  The delivery of new housing units to the market has been playing catch-up since as far back as 2014, when the SCSI flagged to policymakers that the supply of housing to cater for demand was well below what was needed.  This has been exacerbated by the lower-than-anticipated new housing output, compounded by the impact of Brexit and Covid over the past couple of years.  The tragic conflict in Ukraine and its impact on energy costs are contributing to rises in material prices, all of which are pushing many planned developments out of viability. <\/p><p> The SCSI supports the ambitions of the Housing for All strategy and the many initiatives of the Government aimed at increasing housing supply, including the recent measures to mitigate the high levels of inflation absorbed by the construction sector for public works, including the inflation co-operation agreement.  However, our research has identified significant cost inflation across the sector that, if not tackled with a sense of urgency, will result in the ambitious housing delivery targets of Housing for All not being met.  The increased construction costs are not limited to urban centres but are evident across the country in every region.  It is the long-standing view of the SCSI that if we are to tackle rising costs of construction, including the most recent material and labour hyperinflation, every facet of the input costs of residential development needs to be reduced.  While several initiatives already under way to address some of the blockages to housing delivery, such as planning reform,  are to be commended, these are longer term.  What is required now is urgent action to address construction cost inflation. <\/p><p> Mitigating measures to tackle the high costs of housing delivery will require a proactive and cohesive response from government.  Many interventions may be outside the control of government; however, there are many construction input costs that are under the direct remit of local and national government.  There is no single solution to driving down costs but the cumulative impact of reducing costs across multiple headings will make a positive overall difference in the delivery costs of housing.<\/p><p> Our submission and its recommendations, which focus on short-, medium- and long-term solutions, build on evidence-based SCSI reports highlighting the critical construction cost areas that we hope will provide some helpful up-to-date insights on how construction inflation can be tackled to ensure the sector meets the Government's housing targets. <\/p><p> To turn now to the specifics of construction, I will draw on some recent SCSI construction cost reports.  The detail is in our main submission but I will focus on some key statistics.  The SCSI report, The Real Cost of New House Delivery, dated 2020, reported an average increase in inflation of 12% between 2016 and 2020, which does not take account of more recent pressures from increased inflation.  Our research found that the cost of delivering a new estate home, namely a three-bedroom semi-detached home, was &euro;330,000 in 2016 and rose to &euro;371,000 in 2020.  The SCSI report The Real Costs of New Apartment Delivery, published in 2021, shows that lower-rise suburban apartment delivery costs rose from &euro;155,000 to &euro;177,000 in the four-year period between 2017 and 2021.  The SCSI monitors commercial construction inflation through our tender price index, TPI, first established in 1998.  The TPI tracks commercial projects over &euro;500,000 and reports that national annual inflation is at 13%.  This figure pertains to the year to December 2021.  The report concluded that the main reasons for current price inflation are high price volatility across a range of building materials &ndash; particularly insulation, cement, plasterboard, metals and fuel &ndash; along with labour shortages and the extremely high demand for projects across all tiers as the industry continues to readjust in the wake of the Covid crisis.  In respect of the first half of 2022, it is clear that Russia's invasion of Ukraine is having an impact on the prices of materials previously sourced in the region, especially steel and base metals, while it has also led to a dramatic increase in fuel and energy costs.<\/p><p> The data from our report also highlight the other factors present on foot of inflation, such as labour cost increases, following the implementation of the sectoral employment order, which came into effect on 1 February.  It is expected that our next report, which is due in June or July 2022, will show the TPI will be somewhat impacted by this.<\/p><p> Management of risk has now become a primary focus for companies to ensure that construction competitions awarded are structured to protect against inflation pressures within the market.  Some contracting firms are no longer accepting previous contract risks due to material inflation and are either delaying jobs or selecting jobs where the client is taking on the risk.  This is apparent in the private sector.<\/p><p> Our submission addresses each of the input costs of construction, including hard and soft costs, planning and zoning, enabling works and other statutory costs, utility connections and charges, building regulation, labour costs, public procurement and modern methods of construction.  It provides specific detail on building materials price inflation.  Drawing from the expertise of our surveyor members working across the construction, land and property sectors, we have found the impact of increasing construction costs is clear.  The sector is functioning with considerable uncertainty about the pipeline of construction projects as viability remains so challenged across the country.  The SCSI has numerous anecdotal examples of housing projects being paused and, in worst-case scenarios, cancelled outright.  If this persists, housing completions will not be near the numbers required to meet the Government's targets and to house our growing population.  We are now at a pivotal point where considered decisions must be made to take action in the short term in addition to those medium- to long-term initiatives that are already under way and are addressed in our submission, including in respect of land, taxation and vacant properties.<\/p><p> Priority must be given immediately to addressing those construction cost inputs that are within the direct control of the Government.  Utilities and local authorities have a significant impact on the speed and cost of housing delivery.  As such, they should be appropriately resourced in terms of staffing and funding to assist them to meet targets and improve efficiency.  The following key construction cost inputs should be considered: resourcing local authorities and utilities to facilitate faster processing times; the pausing of increases to local authority contributions; the early engagement of Irish Water to avoid costly delays and provide the cost certainty required regarding connection fees; reducing ESB connection and associated site-works charges and engaging earlier with developments to improve visibility of costs and connection timelines; allowing local authorities to approve alterations to specification of buildings that do not materially alter the planning permission but allow for the use of more cost-effective building materials that may be available at the time given the material price volatility; requiring standard compliance with the fire regulations minimum and removing more onerous costly measures not prescribed by regulation; improving public procurement processes to ensure barriers do not exist for smaller operators who will be needed in order to have sufficient capacity in the sector; and reviewing charges and fees associated with other site-enabling works, such as temporary road closure fees and licensing fees.<\/p><p> The impact of these measures would be significant and, coupled with the other initiatives, could be the difference in ensuring the viability of projects and delivering vital housing in the public interest.  I am happy to take any questions and provide further detail on these recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022052400002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin James","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":660,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. James.

Many of the provisions in Housing for All are tools to deliver affordability.  In many cases, we are using State lands.  We are using a State agency to master-plan or design.  When projects go to tender, we use direct subsidy by the Department, in some cases amounting to up to &euro;100,000 off the cost price.  We are also providing funding to service sites.  Even with all this support, which can be almost &euro;150,000 per unit, we sometimes do not get a price that my colleagues here might regard as affordable.  Is the cost of construction the key barrier?  What can we do to tackle the issue of the cost of construction and the inflationary impacts?  I welcome the announcement of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, on covering the inflationary impacts, but all that is being achieved is an increase in the cost, which, despite all the other interventions, is deemed by many to be unaffordable.<\/p><p>Perhaps Ms Geraghty will address that question.  <\/p><p> There is also an issue for the industry and I would very much appreciate the input of our guests with regard to specifications and standards.

We have a few examples from around the country, including Dublin city, of projects that we are trying to get under way.  One of the key issues is the procurement model and local authorities are looking at that in terms of a design, build, fund and direct sale.  That would be the tender process.  At the moment the margins are tight.  The Deputy is right that with an affordable housing fund and the provision of land at a reduced cost or a nil cost, we are trying to deliver an affordable product but the type of product is important.  In some places if it is an apartment development, the costs are greater and we can be challenged to get to an affordable sale price, taking account of that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of current projects the tender processes for projects in both Cork and Fingal are managing to deliver what would be considered affordable units but most of those are houses at this point in time.

Anecdotally, that is under pressure at the moment.  Points have been well made here regarding the pressures on construction but one of the other key issues that we have to take account of is funding, that is, how developers will fund projects and the rates at which they can get funding, through partnerships with Home Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, or otherwise.  We need to determine what we can do to ensure that developers and contractors have access to competitive funding and borrowing facilities that can enable them to give the best price for the affordable product at the end of the day.

I will try to set out the context behind hard and soft costs.  As we have heard from the industry and from SCSI, the hard costs, at 48% are very much compressed into a 20- to 26-week delivery timeframe from the time we pull foundations to the time we turn a key in a door.  We are looking at 48% within 26 weeks and that has increased, on average, from last year, when we would have expected to see the delivery of homes in 16 to 20 weeks.  That is a very compact timeframe.  However, in advance of that, going through zoning, the placement of critical infrastructure, planning and procurement is taking years and, in some cases, decades.  There is an opportunity to streamline some of those timeframes and as a result, the costs will come down and greater affordability will ensue-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022052400002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Benson"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":669,"content":"<p>Mr. Benson is speaking about supply in general terms but I am focused on public housing supply, where developers are tendering for the construction of public housing.

We need to look at our compact growth design standards, which set out what can be built and where it can be built and even the communities around those units.  We can bring efficiencies there and enhance those developments without compromising standards or regulations in respect of the units themselves.  If we look at things like open spaces, and separation distances of 22 m back to back garden sizes, these are based on a premise from the 1900s when people had growing allotments and outhouses, as well as for environmental reasons.  We can reduce that and improve community spaces with a qualitative approach as opposed to a quantitative one.  Rather than just having the 20% of open space in one corner of a development, we could have pockets of space within the development and amenities within that that can lead to a greater sense of community.  We can have better own-door access, more units and more affordability-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022052400002#D00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Benson"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":671,"content":"<p>I take Mr. Benson's point.

It is important to say that we organised this hearing, which is one of two we have planned, because almost everybody on the committee shares the concern that all of our guests have raised today.  We are all out and about and are talking to SME builders, buyers, materials suppliers and to our local authorities and in the past year in particular, they are all sounding the alarm about increasing construction sector costs.  What we are trying to achieve today and in our next hearing is a full understanding of the problem to see what recommendations, if any, the committee can make to the Government to try to address this specific issue.  There is always a danger when we have these conversations that we end up talking about everything.  The difficulty is that if we talk about everything and have a long list of recommendations, we will not get to fix the core problem.  I will try to stick specifically to construction sector inflation, not because I think the other issues that have been raised are unimportant but because that is what we are here to discuss today.<\/p> <p>  My first question is for all three groups.  The more accurate information we have about where construction costs are going, the better able we are to try to design the best interventions.  We hear lots of different figures but there is no comprehensive data available.  In as much as they can estimate for the past 12 months, what are we looking at in terms of construction sector inflation?  I ask Mr. Benson to answer on behalf of his members.  I ask Mr. Taaffe to respond in terms of the local government sector and what the contractors are coming back with in regard to their difficulties.  Mr. James said 13% to the end of last year.  Most people were expecting things to level off in the first quarter of this year but now the expectation is the very opposite, with inflation continuing to go upwards.  Where is that at?<\/p> <p>  The second question is whether there are any opportunities to reduce costs by focusing on construction sector materials or whether the only mitigation is on the soft costs or the timelines.  All the solutions that people have proposed are more to do with the timelines and the soft costs than anything else.  Are we just price takers when it comes to construction sector materials?  <\/p> <p>  My third question is about priorities and I will limit our guests to one priority.   Regarding the shopping lists on which they have come here to advise us, what is the most important element?  What does the priority need to be?  The witnesses have all made clear their concern about meeting targets.  In terms of meeting those targets, we are not even really talking about affordability at this point but about viability.  I ask our guests to give us their best stab at the single most important intervention they think the Government could make, with each of their sectors in mind, that is, the builders, the local authority sector and the surveyors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022052400002#D01100","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653346800,"counter":674,"content":"<p>We have just finished travelling around the country delivering a series of workshops for home builders in respect of Housing for All and some of the supports and issues contained therein.

At that time, it added somewhere in the region of &euro;17,000 per unit.  The impact of that was that the pre-tax profit margin dropped by almost half from 10% to 5%.

We have to look at what is happening on the Continent to see the standards countries there have adopted because they are a few years ahead of us in modern methods of construction.

It takes investment to do this, and there needs to be recognition of that and assistance given to the sector to grow that element.<\/p> <p>  Another issue is price variation.  Anything above 15% in new contracts signed since 7 January is recoverable.  It may well be that that would need to be reviewed because 15% on price variation is still quite a chunk of money on a contract.<\/p> <p>  Finally, perhaps consideration could be given to an increased level of flexibility on some procurement elements in respect of the way in which we, as a Government sector, have to procure.  What I am talking about is, once we have prices in, the areas of value engineering, best and final offer and so on.  Generally, we have to accept the prices we get, but perhaps we could have more flexibility post-tender to negotiate and to discuss prices and, perhaps, to ask contractors if there is any way jointly we can save money on these projects through little tweaks that do not affect the standard and give us the same result but might have a big impact on construction costs and construction time.  That is the positive.  The downside, going back to an earlier point, is that that requires time when it comes to appointing a contractor.

I was particularly struck by something Mr. Benson said about traineeships and how some potential apprenticeships could be looked at in that way.  Last week was Construction Work and Skills Week, and I attended the Intreo trade fair in Tallaght Stadium, which was a recruitment event aimed at young people.  There was a massive queue of young people outside the stadium when I got there.  I was struck by it.  All those young people could apply to get their safe passes there and then.  It showed the significant interest in that area from a careers perspective.  I would be interested to hear a little more about what apprenticeships the Construction Industry Federation thinks would be suitable for traineeships.  If it is a safe and quicker way of getting people out on sites, we should consider it.<\/p> <p>  Another thing Mr. Benson touched on, and on which I would value Mr. Taaffe's perspective too, is the six-year county development plan cycle and how sometimes it can be problematic when it comes to future-proofing and planning.  Does Mr. Taaffe think a move to a ten-year cycle would be effective?  Would there be new hurdles arising from that or does he think the amendments and material alterations that could still be brought forward by the chief executive might suffice?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Taaffe spoke about construction companies that just do not want or are not willing to tender because of the shifting sands we are in.  I am aware of that because in my constituency a construction company pulled out of developing a community centre in Saggart.  That was presumably due to the fact that the environment is changing.  That set that project back substantially.  There are also two sites for social housing in South Dublin County Council where contractors pulled out mid-construction.  Obviously, we want to avoid that wherever possible.  I am worried about the impact that will have on the Housing for All social housing targets.  I am looking for the witnesses' perspective as to what interventions the Minister could make to try to reduce that risk.<\/p> <p>  I support what Mr. James said about early engagement with the ESB and, in particular, Irish Water.  That is practical and makes a lot of sense.  Is there resistance to that?  I am interested to learn about the idea Mr. James has put forward, which I think Mr. Taaffe spoke about as well, of alterations to planning permissions and whether they could be approved by local authorities if the standards and the overall plan are the same and it is just a matter of lower cost materials.  Can the witnesses give me some examples of what that would mean in real life?<\/p> <p>  I wish to flag that I was a little concerned to hear Mr. James talk about fire regulation standards.  Fine Gael has had discussions with the Construction Defects Alliance, and I am in favour of maintaining as strong as possible fire regulations.<\/p> <p>  To summarise, my questions relate to traineeships, county development plans, the tendering process and, in particular, the alterations to planning applications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022052400002#E01200","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653346800,"counter":687,"content":"<p>I will be as brief as possible to give Mr. James a chance to contribute.<\/p> <p>  As for the six-year cycle, we need to investigate the potential of having a ten-year or 12-year cycle, similar to what they have in the UK.  That recognises that six years is not enough to get through zoning, infrastructure, planning, procurement, commencement and build.  It is simply not happening.  It is taking decades.  The complication with that is whether it aligns with the regional spatial and economic strategies.  Those councillors who are involved in the drafting of county development plans have only five-year terms.  There is a lot to work out there, but I think we all recognise that six years is not enough, particularly when we do not have tiering of lands for the forward acquisition of those lands and the putting in place of critical infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  As for the traineeship model, it has taken four years plus but we are seeing apprenticeship numbers go up, thankfully, because there is now certainty and committed funding there.  It is not happening quickly enough, however.  We are still not seeing great numbers come into a number of trades - for example, the ill-termed wet trades, that is, blocklaying, bricklaying and tiling.  We should pay extra attention to those areas.  Is there the potential to complete such apprenticeships within 18 or 24 months where there is a combination of classroom and on-site learning?  The apprenticeship model requires the individual to be employed.  Are apprentices guaranteed five years of work to bring them through that apprenticeship full-scale?  If it is a traineeship model, do they go through a scheme, go out to an employer on almost a work placement and demonstrate their competency and are they then taken on by the employer?  There are a lot of benefits, but I would focus on the wet trades at the moment, given that the numbers in them are low.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022052400002#E01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Benson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653346800,"counter":688,"content":"<p>I will respond to the ESB query.  It is about taking the sentiment from our members.  We have gone across the entire society.  We look at projects and the roadblocks there are.  We see projects that have reached completion and do not have power switched on, and the ESB is clearly under a lot of pressure.  We do not want to make a scapegoat out of the ESB but we are trying to create improved dialogue so that we have greater visibility.  Due to the interface with the ESB, you have to pay your fee and you have to make sure there is a commitment before there is engagement.  We want to bring that forward so we understand where the bottlenecks can be.  The priority is to get housing out to the market - the last thing we want to see is completed housing developments that we cannot switch on and allow people to occupy.  With the ESB being a semi-State body, perhaps there are frameworks that can be introduced within it to help with the supply chain in capacity and to help the operatives with the connections.  If they are under-resourced, perhaps that could be subcontracted out to the market and support could be made readily available for those particular sites to support the ESB.  That is what we are trying to advocate for because there is a logjam and a bottleneck with the ESB.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the question on fire regulation standards and I completely agree.  This is not about diluting any of the health and safety standards.  We have found that there is a disparity in the interpretation of the regulations between different fire officers across the country.  I have been working on sites in Dublin and Cork and the interpretation of the regulations can differ.  We are advocating for more accountability for someone to make decisions because there is a lot of risk that anyone embarking on a construction project has to understand the rules of engagement with regard to fire compliance and safety and they employ their own fire safety consultants.  When there are differences of opinion, they need to be ironed out but there is an interpretation of the regulations in one part of the country that differs from an interpretation in another part of the country.  We understand the issues from Grenfell and what that has done to the market and we understand that the sprinkler installations that may be imposed on developers are an additional cost.  What we are trying to do is bring forward visibility again so that we understand the cost.  This is about risk mitigation and managing costs and for us, as consultants in the industry that are advising on what the budgets will be, our interpretations of the regulations have to be quantified and they have to be valued to go into a budget for a development appraisal to move forward.  If that changes, we have to reverse engineer that and say that the fire officer wants us to do X plus Y.  The cost of Y was not initially budgeted for so we have to go back and either take it out of contingency or find another way to make up for the overspend.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022052400002#F00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin James"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653346800,"counter":689,"content":"<p>My view on the county development plan cycle is that ten years is a long time for it.

I am delighted to be here.<\/p> <p>  What difference can we make to help the construction sector?  We have talked about the cost of building houses.  I will use one simple example.  In 2020, a 2,000 sq. ft house cost &euro;240,000 plus VAT which came to &euro;272,400, and the Government had &euro;32,400 in VAT on that outside income tax or any other tax on it.  To build the same 2,000 sq. ft house today costs &euro;480,600 and the Government gets &euro;48,000 VAT at 13.5%, which gives the Government an increase of &euro;16,000 in VAT on the labour alone.<\/p> <p>  The transport costs relating to house construction were only 1.5% to 2% and are now between 6% and 7% and the Government takes &euro;57 on every &euro;100 in tax.  We are talking about the increase in costs.  Builders then need to get materials from the ports to the construction sites and get the tradespeople from their homes to a site.  They cannot travel on a bus because they are tradespeople with tools.  We have been talking around the shop about construction costs when our own Government is taking the most money in carbon taxes, VAT and income tax.<\/p> <p>  Let us be real here.  If we factored all that into it, by how much would the cost of a house reduce?  There are people in this room who voted for the carbon tax at a time when we could have delayed it in order to help our housing industry to build houses.  Instead, we have come up with a proposal to give developers &euro;144,000 per apartment to build apartments when people who want to spend their own money building on their own land cannot build because of Government decisions.  This is why I call certain things hypocritical.  We can have all the meetings we like.  I have been in construction all my life and I understand it.  Every week I get letters from suppliers informing me that costs are rising.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses are right about the planning process.  If there is an objection, it is slowed down on the An Bord Plean&aacute;la side.  If someone wants to build a one-off house in a rural area to take people off the housing waiting list, they are being charged &euro;6,000 or &euro;7,000 to be allowed to open the ditch on their site.  On top of all the excessive taxes, they have to pay all the material costs that are being front-loaded by carbon and other taxes.  At a time of need, we are increasing taxes.  Our Government is tax-rich and everyone else is made to pay.  For eight years, six years as a councillor and two years as a Deputy, I have been asking for the introduction of the apprenticeship model for early school leavers.  I saw it eight years ago because I am involved in construction on the ground and can see it.<\/p> <p>  I am sympathetic to everything the witnesses are trying to do but unless we get a target on all the carbon and other taxes we are paying on building houses at the moment, the only people who will end up paying for this are the people who can afford it.  We will have many more people on the housing lists who cannot afford it because of the rising costs of everyday living.  That is where we have a problem.  We can talk about this all day long and we can come back to it.  It comes back to the fact that our own Government is standing in the way of people building houses.  If we want to help, we should look at this sector which can help all other sectors across the board to build houses - get them to work make them affordable.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to a vote in the D&aacute;il Chamber, people do not look at this.  Are they in business?  I could afford to take on ten more people tomorrow morning to do work but I am not doing it.  I have not priced a house in two years because it is not viable.  It is not viable for me to pay the people who are depending on me.  I depend on them for my livelihood.  That is what it comes down to.<\/p> <p>  Limerick City and County Council is only considering zoning lands within 15 minutes of Limerick city, which takes out over two thirds of my county.  There is no infrastructure so people cannot build houses in the towns and villages because sewers are at capacity.  There is inadequate water supply.  The biggest polluter in County Limerick is the local authority.  We serve notices on people every day fining them because of infrastructure.  We need to start here.<\/p> <p>  I accept that we all have our own climate agendas.  We all want a better world but we have a responsibility to house people affordably and put in something in the short term to help us.  We account for 0.1% of global emissions problems.  What are we doing?  We have the highest taxation in Europe and our Government is the richest in Europe with the amount of taxes it is taking in.  The people who suffer most are the people without adequate transport.  They would use it if it were there.  There is a failure of infrastructure throughout the country.

I note the Senator&rsquo;s scepticism about viability, but one recommendation we should consider has to do with the inclusion of an economic viability assessment within planning applications.  I would not necessarily argue that such an assessment should be the ultimate reason for granting or refusing a project permission, but it is a waste of everyone&rsquo;s time, resources and capacity if people go through the planning process for projects that will never happen because of viability issues.  Many of our European counterparts examine outline planning at the initial stages and take into account policy and local authority requirements, which gives a greater sense of what a project will cost and whether it is viable.

Apartment viability is a conundrum that we have been facing for a long time in terms of construction costs.  The Society of Chartered Surveyors has undertaken a construction report of its own on apartments.  Every single report that we have done, including in conjunction with Cork Chamber, illustrates how constructing apartments is significantly dearer.  There is a long list of reasons for this, including design standards and the elements that go into constructing apartments, for example, the amount of steel, concrete and glazing, managing construction and demolition waste &ndash; it is a city centre site and materials cannot be stored there &ndash; and getting to and from the site.  While some of the problems in the Dublin metropolitan area and other parts of Dublin are due to land costs, I am aware of apartment projects outside of Dublin that have full planning permission and no land costs but are not proceeding because of the viability challenge.  Private rented sector, PRS, funders will not forward fund apartments because they are not viable, given the rents achievable and the yields they are seeking.  The extraordinary period of material cost inflation has not helped either.<\/p> <p>  Regarding land costs in the Dublin region, an exceptional market and an exceptional economy have developed in Dublin over the past ten to 15 years.  It also has significant geographical constraints.  The city centre is right next to the sea, so we cannot develop to the north east, east or south east like we can in other cities.  It has the Wicklow Mountains to the south, Dublin Port to the east and Dublin Airport to the north.  All of these constraints have made the Dublin land market exceptional.<\/p> <p>  Not to be long-winded about it, but I would gladly share copies of our many reports on apartments.  They would give the committee the details of the elements that go into construction and why it is so expensive.<\/p> <p>  Forward funding for apartments is much riskier than it is for traditional houses, which can be built in stages.  For a modest apartment construction scheme of 50 units at &euro;400,000 or &euro;500,000 per unit, we would be talking about forward funding of &euro;20 million to &euro;25 million because apartment developments cannot be built in stages.

That is what we do as surveyors &ndash; understand the brief, translate it, and procure and manage the design team in order to put together a budget for a particular project.<br\/><br\/>Regarding apartments, the funders&rsquo; requirements in terms of margins are dictated to the developer borrowing the cash.  As such, the developer is limited and there is nowhere to go.  Investors need a return on the money they lend developers to build residential developments.<br\/><br\/>On breaking down the costs, we cannot go near VAT.  Certain recommendations have been made on VAT, levies and fees.  We have noted these in our report.  When a project is examined in isolation, there is a <i>pro rata<\/i>calculation of what the constraints, characteristics of a site and the density of what a developer is trying to build contribute to soft costs.  Sometimes, people get locked into translating numbers into the cost per unit, but the variance can be significant.

If we are saying that the economic analysis would be done at the planning stage, then many developments would be deemed unviable by virtue of the fact that high-rise accommodation and other apartments are costlier than houses.

Within that, there is the potential to increase the number of owned or access units through the greater use of traditional units and duplexes.<\/p><p>There is still a requirement for apartments within that, but the number is smaller.  We still get the 35 units per hectare or the higher figure if near critical infrastructure.  Those higher-density and more own-door access units can be achieved by just looking at separation distances, open spaces and private-use spaces.  That is without any derogation to standards or changing the size of homes.  The traditional home could still be the same size but it is about qualitative rather than quantitative assessment of open spaces.  The days of having 20% open space in one corner of a field for someone to play football as opposed to having more potentially quality pockets around the development may be gone.  There could be amenities and little play hubs for people to use.  It is what people want.  When we speak to our members who have dealt with the public, they tell us people want community spaces and a greater sense of community.  They want to go back to what we had before.

I thank all of the witnesses for attending.  They stated the obvious when they noted that the population will grow by up to 600,000 over the next ten years.  I will set out a few facts.  At best, the reversible elements of inflation in housebuilding and construction amount to between 10% and 15% of costs.  That is the best-case reduction in costs.  There is no overnight solution for the skilled labour shortage.  Portable building is great but it is not the panacea as some people believe.  It will build houses faster but will not reduce costs.<\/p><p>I am sure Mr. Taaffe will remember that the last time he was here we spoke about affordable housing for rural Ireland.  I was delighted when he told me that his unit was working with all of the local authorities to help them to move towards an affordable housing plan.  On hearing that news, I left the meeting 5 stone lighter and somewhat elated.  However, when I spoke to representatives of the rural authorities I was told that they had been asked to provide totally affordable models in order to get the green light for affordable housing.  The Department insists on looking at a criterion that is based on historically low house prices that still cannot be balanced against the total absence of a new house sales market in rural Ireland.  We are not comparing like with like or, as Mr. James would say, apples and oranges.  Rural Ireland is facing not only an affordability crisis but also an availability crisis.  Therein lies the opportunity for the industry.<\/p><p>Last week, there were only nine houses to rent in Longford, with an average rent of &euro;925 per month, which is an increase of 60% since 2012.  If the current run rates in Longford continue, we will be 52% off the House for All targets for new starts.  Only 11 counties have been approved for affordable housing schemes.  The league table for new starts shows that County Sligo will be 60% off the target, so it is excluded, and County Leitrim will be off the target by 74%.  If that county continues the way it is going, it may not build anything.  If the bottom five counties in the league table built only 50 houses each per annum for the next five years, that would amount to the guts of 1,400 houses between them.<\/p><p>As everyone in this room knows, the cheapest place to build houses is in the provinces and in rural towns.  It is cheaper to build a house in counties Waterford and Limerick than anywhere in Dublin.  Covid gave us a huge opportunity in that people had the opportunity to work from home.  The pandemic drove up houses prices in rural Ireland because people realised they could work from home and decided to get a house for quality-of-life reasons.  The problem is that the Custom House has not opened up the opportunities to build affordable houses.  Deputies O'Donoghue and &Oacute; Broin blame the Government for every ill but some of the culpability for this lies with the Custom House.  It must take the foot off the brake and give local authorities and bodies the opportunity to provide affordable housing schemes because there is an obvious pent-up demand for them.  We will not solve the entire housing crisis but if we kick-start affordable housing schemes in every county, it would act as a pressure valve and reduce some of the pressure in the housing market.  As I said, only 11 counties have been approved for affordable housing schemes.<\/p><p>It baffles me that the Department has not gone ahead and continues to create obstacles for local authorities that want to provide affordable housing.

The main mechanism for affordable housing delivery is the affordable housing fund administered by the Department.  The main criteria the Deputy is referring to are that for a local authority to be eligible to apply for approved housing funding to provide affordable housing, it has to cover more than 5% of its households, as defined by the housing needs demand assessment.  That is based on Central Statistics Office data on incomes and house prices.  Each local authority has data on that.  Eighteen local authorities met those criteria and are therefore eligible to put forward schemes for approved housing funding.  The other local authorities did not.  The Department has stated clearly to local authorities that if there are local circumstances, such as in the county town, with house prices far above the average for the county and if they can make a case with data to support it, they would be eligible for approved housing funding.  One local authority has made that case and is now eligible.<\/p> <p>  The reality as regards the affordable housing fund is that there is demand for affordable housing across the country and the funding has to be targeted where the need is greatest.

We know that the housing market collapsed and people could have bought a house in Longford for between &euro;40,000 and &euro;60,000.  If only 100 houses were sold each year in Longford over the past ten years, there is no way we will get an average house price that will show an affordability crisis or challenge for the public in Longford.  The reality is that if a young couple wants to buy a three-bedroom, semi-detached starter home, not one has been built in Longford for 12 years.  There is no housing.  The issue has to be looked at in the round.  Clinging to CSO figures, while it is great and ticks a box for the County and City Management Association, is not the solution.

I am always impressed by how informative they are.  It is a special resource.  As Deputies and Senators, we have to be briefed by the witnesses who are pressing the buttons and pulling the levers.  There is much that I could say.  Brexit, Covid and the Ukraine war have increased costs.  Inflation in product prices and the labour shortage in the construction sector are, as I understand from the witnesses' contributions, the main contributors to the rising cost of housing delivery, which we are all here to try to address.

The Government cannot keep reducing soft costs.  Have the witnesses done any modelling on previous price cycles to see where, when or if we will come out of this?  The same applies to apprentices.  I know the witnesses mentioned capacity earlier.  Are we at capacity yet?  When will we be at capacity with apprenticeships?  The witnesses mentioned going outside the country to bring people in.  I hope I am being politically correct.  We had many eastern Europeans working in the sector and many went home.

We must protect the small supply chains, which we are fully dependent on, and ensure we do not create barriers to entry.  In the pre-qualification process, whether for consultants or contractors, providing professional indemnity cover at a high level is an instant barrier due to their inability to provide cover that satisfies the requirements for public procurement.  There are definitely barriers that prohibit small and medium enterprises and small contractors from being able to deliver certain projects.<\/p> <p>  The question about material prices is the crystal ball.  We have done workshops about what the future looks like.  While the war in Ukraine continues and it is difficult to anticipate its impact, there are some green shoots.  We recently did some research on the European supply chain and delivering reinforcement.  In the middle of last year, reinforcement cost perhaps &euro;600 per tonne, which spiked to &euro;900 per tonne by the end of the year.  Speaking with contractors over the last weeks, they could quote &euro;1,400 or &euro;1,500 per tonne of steel.  Apartment complexes have basements that need steel and developers are asking if they should pay a 100% or 120% premium to buy that product to start that first phase of a development and whether it makes sense.  What message are we sending to the industry by indicating that accepting a 100% or 120% premium on a particular material is acceptable?<\/p> <p>  While there are embargoes on Russia and with the war in Ukraine, after speaking to suppliers of steel coming to the UK and Ireland, they were forecasting a 20% reduction because they are beginning to work out their logistics.  The energy issue is significant, because suppliers making products in Europe do not yet know how much the product will supply.  Significant amounts of fossil fuel are required to make glazing systems and steel.  Suppliers are still calibrating their figures.  The subcontractor supply chain cannot fix the price.  Subcontractors pass that message to the main contractor, which then passes it on to us.  It is about understanding the risk profile and what contractors are prepared to accept.

There will be an outcome to this, in case our guests are wondering why they are sitting here answering our questions for two or three hours.  Part of this is about us as a committee writing to the Minister to try to convey some of the urgency that all three organisations are outlining.<\/p> <p>  I might make a couple of general observations before following them up with some questions.  When we debated these issues previously, particularly over the course of the four SCSI reports and the EY Cork apartment reports, much of our debate was about how to narrow that gap between affordability and viability.  The problem is the debate has changed.  Whatever one's view of Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe - it is not the subject of this debate, so I will not open that argument - it has changed the parameters because we are no longer talking about closing a viability-affordability gap but rather a viability-market price gap.  That is a big shift, and I am not sure whether everybody, aside from the specialists, appreciates the significance of that.  If we were to take the various recommendations, good, bad and indifferent, from the SCSI reports and apply all of those savings, we will be no longer moving towards affordability but just towards the market price, which was a problem previously.  I think that is important to emphasise in the context of this conversation.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the Construction Industry Federation, and this is a reflection and not in any way a criticism, given I agree in respect of the data underpinning the housing needs demands assessment, HNDA, Mr. Taaffe and I spent quite a long time in South Dublin County Council, which has an abundance of zoned land and a good deal of serviced lands, including two strategic development zones, SDZs.  We have enough zoned land for ten years on the basis of the current Government projections, so we are okay in that sense.  An SDZ was agreed for Clonburris in 2018 and, although Covid happened, we are only now getting the first two planning applications, one of which is public and the other private.  I am open to an argument regarding the correct targets and level of zoning, but even in local authorities where there has not been a request to dezone land and where there is ample zoned land, that is not solving the particular problems we are discussing here.  Sometimes we look at Cork, Meath or Kildare and their zoning pressures and forget there are also other local authorities that are different.<\/p> <p>  I was trying to get into Mr. Taaffe's mind as Mr. Benson was making his comments about compact growth given, of course, Mr. Taaffe is a former planner.  There are risks in some of these issues.  We can find a really good mechanism for reducing some costs, but there can be negatives elsewhere in terms of good place-making or good-quality urban environments, and in this conversation we have to be careful of that.  That is not a recommendation for inertia or inaction but is about ensuring we will not create a problem somewhere else.  Therefore, everything should be on the table to be considered, but we also need to ensure that as we move towards compact growth, we will get good-quality, high-density, mixed-use inner-city environments in which people will want to live and stay for long periods and that will involve some football pitches for kids, as well as pocket parks and the other shared spaces.<\/p> <p>  On labour - again, this is not in any way to question the point Mr. Benson was making - when I talk to SME builders, particularly outside of Dublin, they tell me that it is not necessarily about the hourly rate for the job but the long-term employment security and the inability to secure a mortgage, not least for those traditional crafts and trades.  While all the work our guests' organisations are involved in along with the relevant Department is important, we also need to think about how we can ensure young men and women coming into the skills trades will have lifetime career progression and opportunities, such as those in Germany and other jurisdictions, to be able to aspire to the kinds of salaries that some of their counterparts on the professional side of the construction have.  I add that only for the record in order that when we come to our report, it will be considered.<\/p> <p>  Some of my questions might reflect foolish ideas but we need to think about everything.  Given the level of price uncertainty with some construction sector inputs and given earlier during Covid the State intervened to play a very significant role in procuring large volumes of materials to tackle the pandemic, are we at a stage whereby the Government needs to think about, for example, certain inputs rather than making each contractor have to bid on the open marketplace?  Should the State step in and, whether through a vehicle such as the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, or something else, use its bulk purchasing power to secure discounts on larger acquisitions and materials and to sell them on at cost over a longer period?  That would have risks, given we might lock in higher prices and there would not be the advantage of a fall, but do we need to start thinking about something like that?  I am thinking, in particular, of timber, steel and some of the other big price-takers at the moment that we do not control.<\/p> <p>  I was taken by Mr. O'Connell's point about finance for apartments.  If there were ever a vehicle that could lend large volumes of money to build the kinds of apartment developments that find it really difficult to get sustainable finance, it is Home Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, but I am not seeing it do that.  Do our guests have thoughts or considerations about how we can improve HBFI to be a more viable lender for some of those projects?<\/p> <p>  On site servicing, I am thinking of the City Edge project, where there are complex externalities.  Is there a role for an expanded Housing Infrastructure Services Company, HISCo-type, vehicle to take off the pressure at the early stages?  It is not money for free or the bureaucratic local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF.  The private sector, ultimately, would have to pay but it would not have to do so as an upfront cost and there would be some of that de-risking.<\/p><p> I am keen to go back to the matter of technology because, despite what other members have said, there are some savings to be made in building technologies.  The question is how we get those in to bring about some of those cost reductions.<\/p><p> I agree with all three organisations about de-risking.  If there is one thing the State can do, it is to improve, clarify and reduce the time involved, whether on planning or procurement or zoning, to reduce the risk.  I am not in any way suggesting we should over-zone or reduce standards but do the witnesses have specific recommendations for changes there?  We could produce a report that does not have 50 recommendations but has more than three.  I am giving a little more latitude than in my first round of questions.  Where are the salient points we could press in that regard?  It would be good if we could give a report to the Minister with some specific recommendations on the issues outlined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022052400002#N01000","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653346800,"counter":796,"content":"<p>I completely agree with the Deputy's point regarding labour and long-term security.  We need to adopt an approach that makes the industry attractive and sustainable to keep people and motivate them to join the industry for the longer term.  The industry is under pressure right now in trying to develop.  We have an acute housing crisis which has been compounded by the arrival of refugees.   The seams are splitting with regard to accommodation requirements.  It is about providing new and additional accommodation.  There are constraints in the workforce on which we depend to deliver buildings in the residential market and other sectors of the industry.  The committee must bear in mind that we also have the issue of mica.  The SCSI spent three months working with the Government on how to support it with regard to how mica was going to unfold.  That will put a burden on the workforce when that traction begins to kick in.  There is also the retrofitting programme, which is running in parallel to that.  There are a lot of competing forces that will draw across the industry, outside of residential buildings.<\/p> <p>  We have to look at apprentices.  The apprentices coming into the industry must serve the entire industry across all sectors, not just residential.  There has to be some sort of process to understand the numbers of apprentices coming in.  How long does it take to train an apprentice?  Is it three or four years or can we do it faster?  Can we fast-track apprentices and can we make it more attractive?  That is the future of our industry.  We need to bring people in and motivate them to join contracting companies.  We do not have a larger workforce compared to 2007 or 2008.  We are depending on the contractors who are inside the tent at the moment and they are in a fragile state.  They are looking at their order books and the economy and wondering whether the subcontractors are going to get paid.  They are looking to the future and the economic outlook.<\/p> <p>  In some respects, we have to be very mindful of attracting contractors to price projects.  Contractors want to deliver projects but if they are at a disadvantage because they cannot offer fixed-price contracts, we have to go back into public procurement.  We have to understand the risk profile in public procurement.  The co-operation inflation agreement is a great move but we also have to think about what are we doing with regard to being flexible.  The Deputy mentioned flexibility in contracts to make them more attractive.  Should we look at new engineering contracts, fitting contracts and shared mechanisms where there is a shared risk?  We must allow the contractors and the industry to come together and find solutions because we are value engineering schemes at the moment and we are still proving they are not viable.<\/p> <p>  Bulk purchasing is a great initiative.  I am not quite sure what the Government stepping into that arena would look like.  Large-scale developers can bulk-buy.  In public procurement, when we agree a contract with a contractor, we do not tell the contractor how and when he can place that order.  It might be a two-year construction project so he might not want to buy the windows on day one and lock in that fee.  He may decide to look at that.  If he decides to buy the window package in a year's time and realises it is 20% more, is that value for money?  Who carries that risk?  We are trying to understand the contractual terms and negotiations when we have the contractors at the outset.<\/p> <p>  Regarding sustainable finance, green finance and how we can encourage lower rates of interest, we are on the way and are looking at motivating other sustainable initiatives.  The environmental, social, and governance, ESG, area is just looking at green finance and motivating contractors to understand it.  That comes down to educating the industry and promoting the fact that we can get cheaper finance if we instil this into future designs and into the contracting industry.  It will also help train the industry over the next nine to 12 months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022052400002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin James"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653346800,"counter":797,"content":"<p>Just to touch on-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022052400002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Taaffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":798,"content":"<p>I hope Mr. Taaffe realises he might have a defamation case against the accusation that he is working in the Custom House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022052400002#O00400","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653346800,"counter":799,"content":"<p>I have a couple of points.  First, what we need to do is give the construction certainty.  At a high level, that is there in Housing for All, where the social and affordable housing targets for each local authority have been published.  Beneath that level, each local authority is preparing a housing delivery action plan, which details how, where and when they are going to meet those projects.  They will state what year the houses will come on stream, the settlements and locations.  They are being worked on at the moment and the intention is to publish them in June.  That will bring a greater level of analysis and transparency to exactly where and when houses will be delivered.  That will be useful for the construction sector.<\/p> <p>  This probably applies more to the larger urban areas such as Dublin, Cork, Galway and so on but there are benefits to master plans.  We need to utilise master plans for areas for redevelopment.  We should get everybody who has a stake in delivery in that area around the table, led by the local authority, the landowners and the various State agencies, to decide what they want to deliver in the area, how it will work and how they will operationalise it.  That was the way the SDZs worked.  There have been positive and negative comments about SDZs but I think the model works.  The timing was unfortunate in that they came with the 2008 crash and that inhibited development on a lot of them.  The development plan states what we want to build, the type of development and where it will go.  The next step in the process is the planning application.  That comes in and it is a \"Yes\" or a \"No\", or it goes to the board and that says \"Yes\" or \"No\".  There has to be a piece in the middle, called active land management, where everybody gets around the table.  They will have zoned the land and they can discuss what they want to develop, how they will operationalise it, who is going to provide what infrastructure and what the costs are.  That way, we can develop those master plans with a collaborative approach.  There is a model there and we need to use that more, particularly on our large development sites.  They are called urban development zones, UDZs, in the Housing for All plan.  That is an area where we could bring people around the table with a collaborative approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022052400002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Taaffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":800,"content":"<p>I agree with Mr. Taaffe.  He and I worked on an SDZ in south Dublin.  I think it is a good one but it took two years.

Landowners are being told there is nothing they can do for two years while there is a public consultation process.  They have to engage and design and only then can they go for planning permission.  The one thing SDZs have not done is accelerate delivery.  I completely accept the point about the crash.

There is merit to an \"SDZ light\" or \"UDZ light\" that could be done much quicker than two years.  With that, everybody could get around the table and the high-level issues and deliverables could be identified, so at least the local authority would have a list of elements that other State actors need to provide and things that need to be done for housing to be unlocked on these sites.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022052400002#O00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Taaffe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653346800,"counter":802,"content":"<p>As a continuation of that point, I note the difference between local area plans and development plans.

If one looks at the document that has been circulated to industry by the Housing Agency, it states what the market price in the area is and that the all-in development cost is now above that.  Even if one thought the subsidy was a good idea, and the witnesses know that I oppose the proposition, it is no longer generating affordability but just delivering things at what was the market price at a certain point.  I have looked at the SCSI reports.  The first one on apartments refers to an affordability challenge for anything above &euro;350,000.  Even with a large subsidy, and it could be LIHAF, and Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe cities fund and possibly the help-to-buy scheme, in real terms one is still looking at a &euro;400,000 starting point for a two-bedroom apartment.

We saw in the report last week from the CSO the drop in transactions in a 12-month period when pent-up demand was as high as ever, which shows that there is a lack of availability.  One the challenges, as the Deputy correctly identified, is that it noted a 6% or 7% increase for the new, but with the existing home market at approximately 18%, which gave an average of 15%.  That is where some of the complications arise.  We are competing not only with a replacement costs and affordability challenge, but also with the existing home market.<\/p> <p>  What I would like to see, and it is not there yet despite a number of reports, is a current costs analysis across all the different delivery models, regardless of who would deliver those homes, that takes into account both recent and future policy and regulation changes.  Everyone would agree that what was required five years ago and what we have coming down the line in the next 12 to 24 months are polar opposites.  It is welcome and there are better units, but there are significant cost differences in both policy and regulatory influenced costs that are going into the cost of delivery.  To get over this debate about who would be best placed to deliver units, it is not just private industry, the State, approved housing bodies or the Land Development Agency, it is a combination of all those across all the different tenure models.  We need to have that detailed costs analysis because unless we know exactly what is going into the delivery of all different units across all those delivery models, we will not be able to see where there is potential to streamline some of those costs.<\/p> <p>  Undoubtedly, there are probably elements of hard costs that can be increased as well.  There is a certain amount that is within the builder's control and a certain amount that is outside the builder's control.  It is likewise in the soft costs.  It is not going to be the case that one element can be reduced and that will be the panacea for housing affordability.  It is going to take a combination of fractions of percentages across all those.

In the UK over a short number of years, there was a quadrupling of the number of women in some of the key construction trades.  It was starting from a very low base but it went up significantly.  One can see in some other countries that there is a lot more female participation in particular trades where perhaps traditionally people thought there was a justifiable or some type of reason for a gender difference.

That is a positive.<\/p> <p>  Construction might be attractive to many other sectors of the economy as a result of Covid-19.  In the past, if one was a pilot, for example, one was almost guaranteed a mortgage.  During Covid-19, due to the lapse in that industry, it is no longer a guarantee.  The construction sector was one of the most positive industries being looked at for the potential there because of the security, the need and the contribution it makes to the economy.  We are probably in a better position with regard to security.  There is never a guarantee in any sector, but we are probably in a better position now than we were previously because of that committed funding.

Sometimes we wait until after university or until they are at an age where their mindset is somewhere else, so there have to be plans.  We are in that space at present.  We are trying to get into schools early.

I am sure it is due to a combination of factors, including viability, infrastructure deficits, trying to get fire certificates or meet compliance obligations, and getting responses back.  There are a number of such uncommenced permissions.  The economic viability assessment is just one of the potential measures that could be included to try to mitigate against that waste of time and resources.  It will not, by any means, be the ultimate reason for the granting or rejection of planning applications, but it will help to further educate those within the system.  One of the benefits that we did see within the strategic housing development applications was section 247 meetings, where a greater number of parties were coming into the conversation earlier.  I think we need to have a greater number of parties involved, including the planning authority, the applicant and prescribed bodies, such as Irish Water, energy providers, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, parks organisations, local authorities and others.

We are not advocating for less open space, but more quality open space.  That will come down to individual assessment by the local authorities and planning authority.  The benefit of that approach is that we could have greater own-door access.  It also allows for a greater mix of tenure within that, and the extension of units for reasons of age and demographics, whatever the case may be.  It opens up the mix and provides for a greater community mix and requirements.  It is not the only solution, but it is something that should be reviewed.  There is potential to enhance without any derogation in standards.  That is where we need to get to.  We do not need to deregulate or have a derogation in standards.

Originally, a lot of compact growth was sold on the basis that while there would be less open space, it would be higher quality space.  Several years on, there is a level of disappointment that some of the high-quality open space has not been delivered on.  There are also issues around who manages the space and who pays for the management of it.  If responsibility for that open space is transferred to the council, there are questions over whether the quality of the space will be lost.  There are all of those challenges.<\/p> <p>  Finally, some very good points were made about land on the issues around viability.  I agree with the point made by the Chair that there are very good reasons why land is constrained through zoning.  When it is done properly it has an effect in terms of increasing land prices and costs and constraining supply.  My view is that the two have not been properly balanced.  I do not think the answer to that is more zoning more land.  As the Chair said earlier, that does not help in terms of trying to match up infrastructure with land.  It actually makes that challenge more difficult.  Initiatives, such as those taken in Vienna, where there are affordable housing zonings and in some zones, limits are placed on the rents or prices that can be paid per square metre for purchased homes, have an effect.  When land is zoned, it  does not increase in value to the same extent as when there is simply open market zoning.  It ties into the issues around viability.  We must be aware that while some measures that are advocated to address viability are well intentioned, they can lead to increases in land and site prices.  We must be able to distinguish been initiatives that address viability and those that, while they may provide an immediate reduction in costs, effectively end up transferring that cost onto the value of the sites.  I think there is a huge opportunity around active land management.  It is an opportunity that has been somewhat missed in terms of what the Land Development Agency is doing at the moment.  I think it could be playing a much bigger role in active land management overall and in master-planning.  There is an issue around master plans and local area plans in respect of them being properly resourced and prioritised, and the delays that causes.  Everyone agrees that it is a good idea, but actually trying to get the resources in place and the prioritisation required to deliver it is a big challenge.  On apartment lending, the whole financial viability and the constraints around it, people are not able to build and sell town houses.  Large forward funding is required and people cannot get it from the banks.  My view is that a public lending model, whereby funds are provided, for example, through Home Building Finance Ireland, is a mechanism for doing that.  Do the witnesses agree that this is the way it needs to be done?  Is there any other way of doing it, given the constraints in place in terms of financing for apartment viability?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022052400002#Q00600","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653346800,"counter":819,"content":"<p>I will make two points, then defer to the other witnesses, who can answer the real questions.  One thing we must recognise is that not all counties require local area plans.  Often, the limited time does not allow the local area plans to be brought forward, because the six-year period quickly runs out.  Our main message is that it is not possible to get through the zoning process, put in the critical infrastructure and get through planning and commencement, all of which are taking longer, in six years.  Looking at a ten-year or longer plan would potentially have a significant impact.  It seems to work in the UK and other places, where there is a ten- or 12-year life cycle.  I do not know if that is the definite solution.  However, what we know at the moment is that the six-year cycle is not working.  We are not getting through it within that limited time period, due to a combination of planning, finance and other reasons.  There are issues there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022052400002#Q00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Benson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653346800,"counter":820,"content":"<p>On the area of solutions, the Deputy mentioned de-risking.

I know what the Deputy is saying when he states that sometimes immediate solutions cause long-term problems in respect of land costs or whatever it may be.  However, currently, we are in extraordinary times.  We have never faced the amount of challenges that we have faced over the past three years, including the extraordinary increases in material cost inflation.  We need to make more sense of it, without being too alarmist about it.  We will monitor the commencements and completions over the number of weeks and months but we need immediate solutions in relation to the situation.  On the price and control levers, we cannot control material costs.  Even if the Government was to buy a lot of steel, timber and blocks, the prices would be locked in as they are now.  The levers of control in relation to deliverability - and deliverability concerns costs - are unfortunately on the soft costs, including the VAT, the development levies, the special charges, the development bonds, to name but a few.

The society&rsquo;s report is saying that everything has to be considered.  Land, depending on whether it is being used for apartments, low-density schemes or high-density schemes, can account for between 8% and 16% of overall development costs.  We need to chip away at these percentages or make land more available. The Land Development Agency, LDA, is in the same scenario as private sector developers and struggling to make projects viable.  We are in extraordinary times.<\/p> <p>  For us, the focus is on short-term measures &ndash; we are not necessarily saying that they should become permanent, as they could be temporary in nature &ndash; that would allow us to make some projects viable.

Even though small developments are equally as important, focusing on them will take away from the focus on creating high-density developments.<\/p> <p>  Our reports clearly show that, due to the limited workforce and so on, there was 13% inflation in the year up to the start of 2022.  Given that a further six months have now passed, some of the large schemes that were in the planning process are no longer viable.  How do we create a scenario that will break the viability deadlock?  A large number of projects will not proceed unless we come up with a solution.  That is what we are trying to do in examining the component parts, for example, land, soft costs and hard costs.  However, further workshops and case studies of separate projects will be required if we are to determine the impact of inflation and see where the gap is.

This puts an extra burden on the main contractor in terms of the ultimate costs.  The main contractor is also looking at the risk profile of the public procurement and the contractual terms for projects.<\/p> <p>  The margin, to some extent, is dictated by the complexity of the project itself and that has to be looked at on its own merits.  When one pre-qualifies contractors, which we do all the time, we look at their solvency, their credibility and at whether they are capitalised and can deliver the particular project.  They have to have a margin.  There must be a reasonable margin but, at the same time, we must make sure that no one is gouging the market.  That is what we are doing in feeding information back to the clients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022052400002#S00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin James"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":845,"content":"<p>My first point relates to apprenticeships.  We need to reach our goals in increasing the number of apprentices in all trades but we also need to have better pay and conditions and better security.  Apprenticeships in countries such as Germany are much more highly valued than they are here.  College is seen as the number one goal when people are leaving school, with apprenticeships valued less.  I come from a working-class area and lots of my friends have risen to the top of their profession through the apprenticeship system in various sectors.  Apprenticeship is particularly important in the construction sector.  The wet trades are hard trades.  There is talk about moving the age of retirement to 67, 68 and beyond but there is no way someone can continue plastering at that age.  We have to make apprenticeships attractive and encourage people to get involved by having proper terms and conditions and by respecting apprentices.<\/p> <p>  An issue that we have not touched on today is the fact that the quickest way to increase capacity is to turn around vacant properties.  Doing that takes fewer materials and less time and the carbon footprint is lower.  It is an easy win and I invite our guests to comment on that.  We have between 60,000 and 90,000 vacant properties, depending on whether one uses data from GeoDirectory or the latest census.

I will go through them as quickly as I can.  Amendment No. 2 inserts a new definition in the section.  This is the interpretation section, which sets out the definitions and meanings for key terms and expressions used in the Bill.  The new definition refers to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, TFEU.  This allows for better definition in the provisions of sections 40, 58 and 59, which are also amended by this group.  Articles 254 and 255 of the TFEU concern appointments to the judicial offices in the Court of Justice of the European Union, including the office of Advocate General and the General Court.  The Deputies will be aware the Bill includes, within this commission remit, recommendations for nominations by Government to all of these offices.  It applies to all of the courts.  Amendments Nos. 15, 25 and 26 are very much connected with that.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 15 is essentially technical.  It provides a more precise reference point for the qualifications required for nomination as judge of the Court of Justice, Advocate General of the Court of Justice or judge of the General Court.  The amendment essentially amends the wording, &quot;the requirements that for the time being stand specified by the court to which the judicial office [is] concerned&quot;, to replace it with a more accurate reference, &quot;qualified for appointment in accordance with the requirements of the TFEU&quot;.<\/p><p>My advice is that the requirements are more correctly attributed to the treaty rather than the specified court.<\/p><p> Under section 58, amendment No. 25 is similar in so far as it relates to the nomination of judge of the Court of Justice, Advocate General of the Court of Justice or judge of the General Court and it makes provision for the statement of requisite knowledge, skills and attributes for judicial office.  It removes reference to \"requirements specified by the court, or the governing body of the court, to which the judicial office relates\" and replaces it with \"requirements of the TFEU, and ... the criteria used by the panel, established under Article 255 of the TFEU, to assess candidates' suitability to perform the duties of the judicial office concerned\".  Again, my advice is that the requirements are more correctly attributed to the treaty rather than to the court.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 26 is a technical amendment.  It provides a more precise reference point in dealing with the selection procedures in so far as it relates to the Court of Justice, Advocate General of the Court of Justice or judge of the General Court.  The amendment seeks to replace reference to \"requirements specified by the court or the governing body of the court, to which that judicial office relates\" with \"any requirements of the TFEU concerning the procedures for selection of candidates for those judicial offices\".  Again, my advice is that it is more correctly attributed to the treaty rather than to particular courts.  It is all quite specific and technical amendment but it is about tidying it up and making sure it relates to the right sections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2022052400002#A00800","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":869,"content":"<p>That all seems to make sense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2022052400002#B00200","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1653346800,"counter":870,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1653346800,"counter":871,"content":"<p>Section 2, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1653346800,"counter":872,"content":"<p>Sections 3 to 7, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1653346800,"counter":873,"content":"<p>SECTION 8<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":874,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 3, 4 and 9 are related and may be taken together.

This would place a specific reference that they must be competent to conduct their functions through Irish, something that is not there when a person is appointed to the position of Chief Justice, Attorney General or other positions.  This amendment would place an additional onus on <i>ex officio<\/i>members.<\/p><p>Separate to that, and I mentioned this at the Irish language committee, by insisting on the competence for all members, another group of people are being excluded.  We put in place a requirement to ensure diversity, including gender-specific diversity, general diversity in terms of background and community, and a third relating to the Irish language.  We have tried, inasmuch as possible, to include diversity in the Bill in the appointment of members, the people coming through the interview process, and the three appointees being put forward so that there is a balance across the board.  By making sure everybody has to be competent, it automatically removes a cohort of people who do not have the language because it is not universal.  This may not be where we would like it to be but the language is not universal.  It is not an expressed requirement for the roles the<i>ex officio<\/i>members are currently in, so it would be adding in an additional layer.<\/p><p>On amendment No. 8, and this may have been dealt with differently in the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin's Bill, we are dealing with people who are not involved in the provision of public-facing services.

This is very specific, particularly when it has been reduced to the small number of three people.  Each recommendation would have to have all three criteria and be based on merit.  It would constrain the commission in putting forward names.

There is a review and the expressed position is that diversity, gender and language must be included.  It would be interesting to get the logic for why this should be 100% for the Supreme Court.  To go back to my initial point, the president of the relevant court will be on the selection commission.  He or she will be able to identify where there is a need and engage with the Courts Service to identify need.  Without expressly including a figure we will be able to address a need and the development of the Irish language.  Nobody who speaks Irish is precluded at any stage from putting themselves forward.

Section 39(2) provides that on making such recommendations the commission must take account of the objective that members of the Judiciary in each court should comprise an equal number of male and female members, should reflect the diversity of the population as a whole and include a sufficient number of judges with proficiency in the Irish language.

The argument is that a person should have ceased to have been Attorney General for at least two years before being eligible to be appointed to the Judiciary.  This would be good practice.  As we have seen in our discussion on the Bill, the Attorney General is very much in the centre of almost everything that happens.  It would be appropriate to have a period for an Attorney General to be away from the Judiciary prior to being considered eligible.  We have had practices in the past and we are trying to introduce legislation that we hope will see a marked change in how things are done.  This is no reflection on anyone.  We are all trying to collaborate to bring this about.  This little amendment would ensure that a cooling-off period would exist and every Attorney General would know there would not be an automatic passage to the Judiciary once his or her term ended.  It would be appropriate that this would happen.  I hope the Minister accepts the amendment.<\/p><p>The issue with regard to amendment No. 19 is that the Attorney General would be at both ends of this process.  The Attorney General would be on the commission that recommends who goes forward to be a judge and would also advise the Cabinet when it comes to selecting who the judge is.  Most people would recognise this is an issue that needs to be dealt with.  The easiest way to avoid it is to ensure the Attorney General is not a member of the commission.  It will come to the Cabinet table and the Attorney General will be involved at that end.  It is not appropriate that the Attorney General should be on the commission and he or she should be removed from it.  There is an ample number of competent legal minds that could be appointed to the commission without needing the Attorney General to be one of them.

This would absolutely apply here.  Other members of the commission could apply to be promoted or go to another role, be it a president of a court or the two judicial nominees who will be judges themselves.  At no stage are we asking that they would recuse themselves.  Somebody who provides the service the Attorney General does to the Government should not be at a disadvantage purely because of taking on that role.  If we were to apply the logic being proposed it would surely apply to other members who will sit on the commission.  They could not apply for a judicial position for two years themselves potentially.  This is not proposed.  The specific recommendation in the 1995 Act will continue in the Bill.  This means if the Attorney General were applying for an appointment he or she would not be anywhere near the process.  This will continue.  I cannot accept amendment No. 16.

If candidates are given a ranking of one, two or three, that obviously takes away any democratic approach and goes against what would be in the handbook, which will be based on the Constitution.<\/p> <p>  On the second amendment, in any job interview process, whether it is for a teacher in a school or anywhere else, there is no process afterwards whereby a person is told why they did not get the job and somebody else did, or where it is publicly published in that way.  I do not think it would be appropriate to do so here.<\/p> <p>  The main focus is around the numbering.  If one was to take away any sort of decision-making power, to me that essentially would require changing the Constitution because it expressly states the Government will appoint judges.  By removing that power, one is potentially not going in line with what the Constitution says.<\/p> <p>  It is absolutely appropriate, where there is an elected Government and an elected Minister, that the Government of the day would retain that power.

That said, for most positions or most jobs - I give the example of a school and I have been in many interview processes - there is a metric on which to score people&rsquo;s various qualifications, abilities and experience.  All of that is taken into account and I expect some mechanism would have to be put in place in respect of this process also.  In that context, if a metric is put in place and there is some system in place, it would be appropriate that that would be used and would at least be available to the Minister for the three names that go forward.  In that context, this is appropriate.  It does not remove the ability of the Minister to choose a different person from the three or other number of names that are put forward, given it may be three for one position or five for two positions, or otherwise.  I think it is appropriate that this means of scoring is clear and is made available to the Minister of the day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2022052400002#E02500","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":956,"content":"<p>The whole point of the Bill is to amend the procedures that we have and to make sure that anybody who comes forward is suitable for the job and, first and foremost, that it is based on merit.  Therefore, all three will now come based on merit and suitable for that particular role in whichever court, and all three will be capable of carrying out that job.  Obviously, there is a provision here so that if there are not three people, and it might be two or otherwise, anybody who comes forward will be suitable for that job.  At the moment, people coming forward are suitable but there is a much larger number and there is a more time-consuming and complex way to go through it.<\/p> <p>  With regard to my previous example of appointing a schoolteacher and a judge, they are two very different things.  In saying that, we do not publish where somebody did not get a job or why, or the rankings and markings.  There is a process that people go through and the same would apply here.  It comes back to the substantial point that the Constitution clearly states that the Government will appoint a judge.<\/p><p>If a list is received with the candidates marked one, two and three, it takes away any discretion.  There is an ability to point to any one of them but there also would be a need to give a reason for doing so.  The question then arises as to why another candidate did not get the job, even though the commission has just said that all three are qualified for it.  I am just not sure how that would work.  There would a requirement to explain why one person got the job over the others when all three have come through the same process and been deemed suitable for the job.  There must be an element of democratic input in appointing the person.  That is clearly set out in the Constitution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2022052400002#E02600","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":958,"content":"<p>I will withdraw the amendment with the possibility of reintroducing it on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2022052400002#F00200","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":959,"content":"<p>That is noted, Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2022052400002#F00300","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1653346800,"counter":960,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1653346800,"counter":961,"content":"<p>Section 47 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1653346800,"counter":962,"content":"<p>SECTION 48<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":963,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 22:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 34, to delete lines 35 to 38 and substitute the following:  \t&quot;(5) The Commission shall, at the same time as making a recommendation, or informing the Minister or the Minister for Foreign Affairs that it cannot make a recommendation under this section, forward the name of each person who made an application in respect of the vacancy concerned, with the names ranked according to the Commission's opinion on their suitability for appointment under section 46.&quot;.  <\/blockquote> <p>I withdraw the amendment and may reintroduce it on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2022052400002#F00700","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1653346800,"counter":964,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1653346800,"counter":965,"content":"<p>Section 48 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1653346800,"counter":966,"content":"<p>Section 49 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1653346800,"counter":967,"content":"<p>SECTION 50<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":968,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 23:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 35, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following:  \t&quot;(d) the rationale for the ranking of names submitted to the Minister or the Minister for Foreign Affairs.&quot;.  <\/blockquote> <p>I withdraw the amendment on the basis that I may reintroduce it on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2022052400002#F01200","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1653346800,"counter":969,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1653346800,"counter":970,"content":"<p>Section 50 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1653346800,"counter":971,"content":"<p>Sections 51 to 56, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1653346800,"counter":972,"content":"<p>SECTION 57<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1653346800,"counter":973,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 24:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 37, lines 37 and 38, to delete all words from and including &quot;The&quot; in line 37 down to and including line 38 and substitute the following:  \t&quot;The Commission shall provide the Minister, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs in so far as it relates to the judicial office of judge of the European Court of Human Rights or the International Criminal Court, with a draft of each statement&mdash;&quot;.  <\/blockquote> <p>Section 57 provides for the preparation and publication by the commission of a judicial selection statement, a statement of selection porcedures, as provided for under section 59, and a statement of knowledge, skills and attributes, as provided for under section 58.
