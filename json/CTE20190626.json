At yesterday's with committee meeting with Eir, it was stated that the UL academics who attended the previous meeting may have said that the standard of Eir's fibre cable was not of the same standard as the fibre that would be overlaid by the preferred bidder in the 300,000 premises exclusion zone.  The UL academics did not state that Eir's fibre was inferior to National Broadband Ireland, NBI's, fibre at any stage.<\/p><p>We will proceed with today's meeting on the national broadband plan and I welcome Mr. Denis O'Leary, head of strategy and innovation, and Mr. Michael Mahon, former national broadband plan, NBP, project manager, from the ESB to discuss the national broadband plan.<\/p><p>Before we begin I wish to draw attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.

There was a southern ring which covered most of south Leinster and much of south Munster.  That was a backhaul network, which basically means it was similar to a motorway network, and all the major retail companies Eir, Enet, Virgin and BT were customers of that network since 2003.<\/p> <p>  A diagram in the submission shows the lower voltage system - the 40,000 or 38,000 volt system.  We have approximately 700 stations all over the country.  One can take it that any town in Ireland with a population greater than 3,000 to 4,000 people has one of those stations.  Another diagram represents the medium voltage system - the 10,000 to 20,000 volt system, which ultimately brings electricity to every home in the country.  We have approximately 90,000 km of that network.<\/p> <p>  We had this idea that as well as being the provider of the backhaul network utilising the electricity network on a larger scale gave us greater commercial opportunities in the telecoms business.  We looked at it in a lot more detail in 2014 because the European Union had produced the digital agenda for Europe.  It was the first time that the whole issue of the replacement of the historical copper networks had been addressed in terms of a new type of high-speed broadband network and what would be required in the more modern economies to deliver both the uptake and the download speeds that both residential customers as well as commercial and industrial customers would work with into the future.  Ireland at that time was lagging behind the European average in terms of the take-up rates, the availability and the speeds available to customers in Ireland at that time.  We decided there was an opportunity there but we had to make a decision as a company as to what level we would get involved in this business.  On the one hand, we could simply lease out the electricity network to a telecoms operator while on the other we could do end to end and do the infrastructure, the wholesale, and the retail.<\/p> <p>  We discounted both of those extremes and landed in a position that we would become an infrastructure company through a joint venture with another telecoms company.  The reason was we did not have real experience in the mass telecoms market, nor did we know enough about telecoms pricing or about the telecoms industry, as such.  At that point, we went into a very extensive procurement process that lasted more than 12 months.  At the end of it, Vodafone was the preferred candidate and it joined up with ESB to form this new company called SIRO.  The structure of SIRO is that there is a joint venture agreement between the two main shareholders, ESB and Vodafone.  SIRO has a separate agreement with ESB Networks called the network access agreement which contain the terms and conditions by which SIRO must abide in order to access the electricity network to string the fibre on the network.<\/p> <p>  That company was set up in 2016 and is functioning at fairly optimum speed since mid-2016 or the start of 2017.  Since then it has passed nearly 250,000 homes with broadband network, or 242,000 homes to be exact.  We have connected more than 42,000 customers.  The target for this phase of the business plan for SIRO, being funded by both shareholders, is to pass 450,000 homes.  This represents an investment of not far off &euro;500 million in the telecoms infrastructure business in Ireland.  We were the first retailer to offer a 500 Mbps and a gigabit service to the residential sector.  We considered the company to be best in class in service delivery and there are nearly 14 retailers operating on the SIRO networks at this time.  It has been a tremendous success.<\/p> <p>  The phase one concentrated on the 50 towns outside the main cities, particularly outside Dublin.  Once that is completed, the shareholders will discuss the options for a phase two.  To date, the business has been very successful and has met the key metrics set in terms of a formal business plan.<\/p> <p>  There was then talk of a national broadband plan.  I have provided a diagram of Ireland and members can see the comparators.  What is in blue in the diagram is what is not in the intervention area.  The areas and premises in the intervention area are coloured light brown and orange.  Those 757,000 homes are in the two coloured areas.<\/p><p>The different colours represent the fact that initially there were to be two lots.  If we compare SIRO's challenge with the challenge of developing and rolling out a national broadband plan, SIRO's plan was to cover 450,000 homes, while the national broadband plan, NBP, was to cover 757,000 homes.  SIRO intended to roll out about 1,300 km of fibre, while the NBP plan, based on our technical design, would have required nearly 77,000 km of fibre.  That is an extraordinary structural, engineering and project management challenge.  The amount underground was minuscule in the NBP.  The reason for the State putting a national broadband plan in place was that it would not be commercial for any of the key operators to go into these rural locations and roll out fibre in the hope the customer take-up and revenue from it would generate an adequate return from the investment over 20 or 25 years.  Some stimulus was needed.  To do it in the way we were going to do the technical design would have involved very close to 600 mini-exchanges throughout the country.  They would have been based in our 38Kv sub-stations and medium voltage sub-stations.  That was the level of network design required to ensure the required broadband speeds set down by the Department in the tender documents could be met for every single household on the island.  That would have required an extensive amount of fibre in the intervention area.  <\/p><p> SIRO was formed in 2014.  From mid-2014 to 2015 there was a lot of discussion with the Department on the strategy and mapping for the NBP.  Much of it was about technical issues, the number of houses and the accuracy of the mapping in the intervention area.  In mid-2015 there was a draft strategy and in December 2015 the Department published the revised strategy and the updated map and commenced the procurement process.  At the time most of the emphasis was on the technical and mapping side and not much on the commercial contract.  In quarters 1 and 2 of 2016 we prepared a detailed pre-qualification submission to show that we had the financial support of our parents and the ability to build, operate and manage large-scale networks.<\/p><p> In June 2016 the Department pre-qualified the bidders and progressed to the formal procurement process.  That was the first time we got sight of the commercial contract and its conditions.  In December 2016 the Department advised bidders that there could be 300,000 premises removed from the contract owing to a commitment by Eir that it would do these premises on a commercial basis and that there would be no need for any subvention or State funding for them.  That had an impact on the business case on which we had been working from a technical point of view and from the point of view of the potential revenues that could have been generated from the original subvention area to what would be a revised subvention area, minus the 300,000 homes.  Nevertheless, we asked for additional time from the Department to redo the technical design because we had to go back and start from scratch.  I can explain later the impact of the 300,000 figure on the business case.  As we progressed, following the withdrawal of the 300,000 premises and with certain challenges in the construct of the commercial contract associated with the NBP, we met the Department on several occasions.  In September 2017, following more urgent meetings, we asked it specifically to consider certain requests that would have made the possibility of presenting a commercial business case less challenging than it was.  While it did move on some issues and tried to help us on others, at the end it was not enough.  Following two years of fairly intensive involvement by a not insignificant number of staff and outside help in the ESB, a decision was taken by both shareholders in SIRO that it would not fit with what they had hoped for and in September 2017 we advised the Department that we were formally withdrawing from the process.<\/p><p> The commercial challenges associated with a significant infrastructural job such as a national broadband plan can be broken down into four parts.  Above the line are the costs, the cost to build the network.  It is very extensive.  I was reminded at the start by one of the guys working on the project that the length of fibre required to serve all homes in rural Ireland, 80,000 km, is roughly twice around the world, but it is a one-off cost that has to be managed.  The second part is the day to day cost of managing that level of telecommunications equipment, managing the maintenance of the equipment, all fault repairs, the information technology, IT, systems and the billing systems.  To match it, there is the amount of revenue from each customer and, most critically, the number of customers who will connect to the system.  There was a point when the number of customers was in the region of 800,000 when we would have been quite positive about the business, but when the 300,000 premises were removed, it had a very serious impact on the potential and projected revenues over the ten, 20 or 30 years of the project.  That is what made it really challenging.  <\/p><p> The key issues that forced SIRO and its shareholders to withdraw from the NBP process approximately two years ago were the removal of the 300,000 premises, the risk apportionment within the structure of the contract, the financial viability of the contract simply owing to the risk apportionment within it, issues with the use of alternate networks, an issue we can discuss, and the rebalancing risk.  When we entered the project in 2015, we entered with high expectations and in very good faith.  We put together a really good team of people to get into a level of detail on the project by which many at senior level in the ESB and Vodafone were astounded.  Mr. Mahon and his team did that work.  The reduction of the intervention area by 300,000 premises had a material impact on the project.  Throughout 2017 we were really challenged as a business to make a business plan that would meet the financial criteria set by both shareholders.  In quarter 3, following significant engagement with the Department, we were left with no choice but to withdraw from the NBP.  The ESB has since moved on.  It has been two years since anybody in the ESB or Vodafone has worked on the national broadband plan.  It is amazing what happens within two years.  In the ESB our focus is on delivery of our Brighter Future strategy in working with and supporting the Government in the implementation of its recently announced climate action plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019062600002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis O'Leary","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Leary.

We have a connection and probably a piece of equipment in most fields throughout the country.  Eir has a similar national infrastructure except that it is predominantly along the roadside.  Fibre can be run on the ESB electricity infrastructure.  Before we signed the joint venture with SIRO and allowed it to roll out fibre on the ESB infrastructure, we carried out intensive testing on the fibre network at our main test centre in Portlaoise.  We also built test facilities in different parts of the country and tested the network under the most extreme conditions in the context of storm loading, wind loading and ice loading.  We then developed a set of criteria and standards that would have to apply and would be applied by the local ESB networks management team to any company that wanted to run fibre on the ESB infrastructure, namely, SIRO.  We are confident about the ability of the electricity infrastructure to hold the fibre network if the standards are applied without any risk to the key purpose of the electricity infrastructure, which is the delivery of a reliable supply of electricity to all customers.  The latter is the one thing we would not want to undermine in any way.  We have done that work and are confident about it.  It is not easy running fibre on the electricity network because there is energy on the infrastructure.  In the vast majority of cases, the network must be disconnected and earthed before any work can be allowed in order to string the fibre.  It can be done and it is possible to do it if due regard is had to the electricity infrastructure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019062600002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis O'Leary"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Is it correct that if repair work were being done on the broadband fibre, there might have to be an electricity outage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019062600002#E00500","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561503600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Not necessarily but it might have to happen.

He is well aware of what Eir has stated about it being cumbersome, complex and difficult.  Let us go back two years to when Mr. O'Leary was in the thick of it.  If he was asked, in a relatively simplistic way, to say how he would deliver high-speed broadband - commensurate with what he was doing in the SIRO areas - to the 540,000 homes, would he have done it in the same way as that proposed in the context of the NBP process?<\/p><p>Yesterday, Eir told us that it has connected 300,000 homes to high-speed broadband in what it refers to as the 300k intervention area.

There is a significant focus on decarbonising the energy sector and on the electrification of transport and heat.  We find ourselves at the centre of the key deliverables that have to be managed in the State over the next 20 to 30 years.

Members of the public are entitled to know exactly what was going on behind the scenes.  There is a feeling that there was some sort of preference for the Granahan McCourt approach.  It was so influential that it persuaded the Government to potentially award it a contract when it does not own any fibre or a single pole.  That is extraordinary.  We have a semi-State company with a proven track record which has accounts in every house in Ireland.  It would be simple to extend the accounting system to fibre.  It would be within ESB's ability to do that.  When I was in the Department of Industry and Commerce, I was in Kuala Lumpur with ESB International.  The ESB went to Malaysia and the Middle East and secured fantastic contracts, employing over 750 people who were top technicians.  I was very impressed by the ESB's work there.  It implemented an account system in Malaysia for its government, yet here, in the ESB's own country, as a semi-State company, it could not come to some terms to ensure that it secured a contract as lucrative as the roll-out of broadband.  In the end, if the ESB made money from it, the dividend would come back to the State.  From my perspective, it was a win-win scenario.  The current proposal, costing up to &euro;3 billion, is a lose-lose scenario because Granahan McCourt will own all the infrastructure in 25 years and the State will not own anything.  We do not know the cost per individual or the cost of the subsidy.  I am lucky that I have privilege here, which is brilliant.  I have far more faith in the ESB to do a job on behalf of the State than I would have in American venture capitalists coming in to do it.  I do not know how Granahan McCourt will install the wires without working with the ESB or Eir.  It has no physical structure.  Why would the ESB walk away in September 2017, even when it is making substantial investments and making money all over the world?  That decision surprises me and I cannot understand it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019062600002#J00600","speaker":"1393"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561503600,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I cannot comment on the bids of Granahan McCourt or Eir.

As I said earlier, I am not suggesting that there was anything wrong in what Eir did.  It was perfectly entitled to do it but it had a dramatic impact on the potential revenues for the business.  That, with some other issues in the contract, meant that the shareholders of the ESB and Vodafone were no longer willing to continue to fund the team that was putting together the bid.

I thank the delegation as this has been a very clear-headed and lucid presentation that has gone a long way towards helping my understanding of the matter, and particularly the timelines.  It was a very good idea to give us the timelines in respect of the company's involvement with the national broadband plan.  There is a very clear message from the witnesses that it was two years ago and they are talking about the future.  It is a very unambiguous message.<\/p> <p>  Having said that, I might detain the witnesses a while longer to help my understanding of the engagement with the Department up to the point in September 2017 when SIRO withdrew from the process.  I am trying to imagine myself in the room where SIRO is engaging with the Department after the mapping exercise has been done and there is a revised intervention area.  How did it come about that the company decided it was out and finished with the process?  Is it because, as the witnesses stated earlier, the revenue reduction was such that it would just make it untenable?  Was there any profit or return on investment where it could be said that even with the 542,000 premises in the amber area, the company could still persevere with the process?  I may not be putting it across very clearly but what would it have taken for SIRO to have stayed in the game?  That is the kernel of my question.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Leary has stated \"it would also have led to a much bigger reduction in revenue and thus our overall potential target revenues were significantly reduced also\".  He also outlined the Mitchelstown example, which is fairly close to home for me, and the doughnut effect.  At what point did the company say \"that is it, we are gone\".  There was engagement and the witnesses have said it was a positive engagement with the Department.  The company had just seen 300,000 connections being taken up by another entity so what would it have made this commercially viable for the company?  I still cannot fully grapple that.  Personally, I found it a pity that SIRO pulled out because of its international reputation, which was mentioned earlier, and the ability to get projects done in a very seamless and quick fashion.

I will just make a few opening introductory comments.<\/p> <p>  The national oral health policy was approved by the Government in March 2019, so it is now Government policy.  The chief dental officer, Dr. Kavanagh, led the development of the policy over a period and will set out for members the ethos, principal features, key plans and actions in it.  The policy is quite wide-ranging and takes an intersectoral approach as well as being consistent with the primary care philosophy of prevention, treatment at the lowest level of complexity and recourse to specialist care where this is clinically appropriate.  This work is the culmination of a comprehensive programme of research, analysis and consultation over a number of years and, over time, we will update models of care and service delivery that have been with us for 25 years or more.<\/p> <p>  The policy is not only aligned with international models of good practice but with the ideals and approach in other healthcare policy areas, such as Sl&aacute;intecare and Healthy Ireland.  It is important to say that it does not seek to change all aspects of service delivery overnight, but it puts in place the framework for real and substantive change on a phased basis.

As Mr. Fergal Goodman said, it is a comprehensive and evidence-based policy informed by extensive research and consultation.  Its aim is to better facilitate oral health for everyone and to support continued professional development.  The programme is transformative, introducing and managing a series of changes over eight years.  The policy is aligned with other Government policies, including Sl&aacute;intecare, Healthy Ireland and First 5, which is a whole-of-Government strategy for babies, young children and families, as well as the national strategies on disability and mental health.  It conforms to the international policies of the WHO and the European Union.  The policy embraces the \"no child is left behind\" principle of First 5 and the education policies.<\/p> <p>  This is the first major oral health policy statement in 25 years and much has changed in Ireland in that period, including the standard of general and oral health, the materials and technology used in dentistry, and the types of services we aim to provide.  In developing the policy, we have ensured that it is supported by up-to-date information about the oral health of the population, as well as by appropriate international evidence.  A broad range of stakeholders was consulted, including those who use the services and those providing the care.<\/p> <p>  Our current oral health system is out of step with other Irish and international health services.  There are gaps remaining in routine dental care for the very young and the vulnerable, including people in residential care, people with disabilities and older people.  Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte reorients how care is provided in line with Sl&aacute;intecare so that most dental care is provided in people's own communities, as close as possible to where they live.  This is beneficial for service users and allows acute services to focus on more complex care.  What is described in Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte is not a demand-led service.  Instead, it enables the Irish public to access services and forge a relationship with their chosen dental practice; we call this their \"dental home\".<\/p> <p>  To support this universal primary care approach, a safety net system will identify those who do not or cannot attend their local dentist.  This safety net system is part of the surveillance system outlined in the policy and ensures that the most vulnerable children and adults, including those on lower incomes, will be supported and receive the same quality of service as the rest of the population.  The existing public dental service will be stronger.  A key service will be to identify, support and deliver care for vulnerable children and adults when it cannot be provided in the local dental practice.<\/p> <p>  The measures set out in the policy will provide professional opportunities for staff in areas such as health promotion, special care services and public health.<\/p> <p>  I will pick out some of the key policy strategies and proposals, which members have in front of them.  Water fluoridation is one key reason we have such good oral health in Ireland and will remain a cornerstone of oral health policy.  Health promotion programmes will be put in place for the whole population and to target the most vulnerable.  Most children and eligible adults will be treated in local dental practices and a package for children from birth until the age of 16 will, in a phased way, replace the existing schools programme.  It is the first time that those under the age of 6, teenagers and adults will have lifetime access to preventive treatment such as fissure sealants and fluoride varnishes, as well as access to dietary advice in dental practices.  The expansion of primary care is proposed from birth until old age, across the whole life course.  We have focused on improving access for vulnerable groups such as those on low incomes, rural dwellers and people with disabilities.  Enabling them to get to local dental practices is key.  As I mentioned, the safety net service is essential to ensure that their needs are addressed and they get comprehensive care.  We must not forget that we need advanced care and specialist care services, and that includes the concerns around general dental anaesthesia.  Monitoring systems will have to be put in place to identify people who are not taking up the services, overall dental needs and the policy's impact.  There must be a full review of dental undergraduate education, in tandem with career-long professional mentoring for dentists.<\/p> <p>  I will talk briefly about the development of the policy.  As mentioned, it was informed by oral healthcare professionals through a series of working groups and consultations.  We are indebted to the Oral Health Policy Academic Reference Group, and we drew expertise from Irish universities in this regard.  These experts assess current needs and how best to meet them.  In addition, we had an external international independent panel made up of leaders in different aspects of policy development.  From this, recommendations and research from the reference group were quality assured in line with international standards.  All research undertaken, including the additional facts study analysis, was robust, representative, ethically compliant and externally quality assured.<\/p> <p>  At the start of policy development in 2014, and again in 2016, more than 5,000 letters were sent from the Department of Health to the whole profession inviting all dental registrants to comment and engage in policy.  A stakeholder day was held, with more than 70 attendees from 16 representative organisations.  There was one-to-one engagement with dental practitioners in independent practice and with those in the public dental service.  Their views overall highlighted an appetite for change in oral healthcare services but emphasised the challenges of such a change.  The Dental Council of Ireland training bodies, including the RCSI and the Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, were also consulted and given a draft document.  These engagements informed the direction of policy in key aspects of service provision and training for professionals.<\/p> <p>  I have outlined the key findings from both the public and from dentists.  I will mention a few points arising from the public point of view.  The public indicated that the current system is complex and very difficult to navigate and they were worried about cost, particularly in relation to children's care.  Young children rarely attend the dentist before six years of age.  Of concern to us is that over the age of 55, there is a decline in quality of life, which sharply declines beyond 70 and into a person's later years.  Overall, all age groups and social classes perceived that their main access to care is via their general dental practice.  <\/p> <p>  Stakeholders and practitioners insisted that very early childhood care is needed and also want special care services for the vulnerable.  They expressed frustration with bureaucracy, barriers to accessing care for patients and an outdated State payment system.  There is a need for a greater emphasis on primary care in the profession to bring it forward.  Those in the public dental service emphasised the need for prevention and for opportunities to expand their skills.  The information from the consultations fundamentally changed the direction of a lot of our policies.  Leadership roles in primary care to refocus the profession and facilitate leadership from within it is a key action being called for by dentists.  The policy also includes very early intervention for children, to give them the best start, and the need for comprehensive support for the most vulnerable through specific support services within the reoriented PDS.<\/p> <p>  Along with the policy action, a career-long mentoring framework will be put in place, as exists for other professions such as social work and psychology.  Undergraduate and graduate education is the first priority within the policy, with an emphasis on training and primary care.  <\/p> <p>  The policy includes a review of dental technology and clinical dental technology training.  This was a key issue that arose from the public, regarding the needs of those in residential services, and from dentists, regarding the need to maintain a workforce in this direction in relation to dentures and prosthetics for those with total tooth loss.<\/p> <p>  The committee will be particularly interested in implementation, which is where all the action is.  We have shared with members an overview document showing 41 actions and the priority for each of those over the next eight years.  The implementation period is needed to commit actively to engagement on significant and complex issues.  First, we need to build a framework to support long-term sustainability, the education review, a mentoring framework and a focus on legislative issues.<\/p><p>The Department has already begun to discuss the priorities with key agencies and we are agreeing targets and timescales.  As an example, action 29 in the policy, which is a priority, is the national plan for amalgam phase-down on which we worked closely with our colleagues in the Department of Communication, Climate Action and the Environment and key stakeholders.  It is being finalised in line with Ireland&rsquo;s EU legislative obligations to publish on 1 July and submit to the EU in August.<\/p><p> I mentioned the full review of undergraduate training which, along with graduate mentoring programmes and upskilling for graduate dentists, are key immediate actions.  The Dental Council, through the Irish committee for specialist training in dentistry, will lead in developing the advanced centres of care framework for specialists.  We are convening in July to commence this work.<\/p><p> For the First 5 strategy, the Department of Children is working with the Department of Health to support the framework for the under sixes policy in programmes of health promotion and services.  We have already met the Clinical Dental Technicians Association and we have its support to assess dental technology training.<\/p><p> Water fluoridation remains and we continue to review it and we will link with the expert body on fluorides and health.<\/p><p> The HSE has two main service focuses.  Epidemiology data indicate that those in residential settings require urgent attention and support.  The reorientated public dental service and community oral health care services will identify their needs and put in place a treatment programme for those who cannot use primary care.  The second priority is that the very young, up to six years of age, receive packages of preventative and primary care.  This is in line with Healthy Ireland and the First 5 strategy.  It will also give the public dental service an opportunity to release capacity.<\/p><p> Implementation of a transformative policy such as Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte will present challenges.  All change is challenging.  However, those challenges will present opportunities for the staff in private practice and the public dental service.  It is important that implementation is owned by the profession while listening to the voice of the public.  To achieve these priorities, we need key leadership roles operationally and in dental schools.  Primary care, special care, advanced or specialist care delivery and public health leaders must be in place so that implementation is sustainable and placed where it belongs in the services.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman for this opportunity to outline the national policy.  We look forward to working with our colleagues in the HSE services, professionals and key stakeholders to implement this change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019062600002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Dympna Kavanagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I now call Professor Brian O'Connell from the oral health policy academic reference group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019062600002#E00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561503600,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I have been a practising dentist for 35 years.  I am a consultant in dentistry and dean of the dental school in Trinity College.  I am accompanied by my colleagues, Dr. Jacinta McLoughlin, a specialist in dental public health, and Dr. Alison Dougall, a consultant who treats patients with serious illnesses and disabilities.  We are here on behalf of the reference group whose chairman, Professor O'Mullane, has submitted a letter that addresses a number of specific points raised about the group&rsquo;s work.<\/p> <p>  The reference group was established to help provide the Department of Health with the best independent evidence that could be used to improve oral health in Ireland.  It is a broad group with a range of backgrounds and disciplines relevant to policy development.  Like all dental professionals, and indeed members of the public, we are acutely aware of the shortcomings of current dental services in Ireland.  There remains huge inequality in oral health, especially among vulnerable groups and those living in rural areas.  We see parents of children with disabilities who are often desperate to access appropriate care.  Far too many young children turn up at hospitals needing emergency extractions, and those who are frail, living with dementia or in residential care often find their oral health completely neglected.  The training pathways needed to sustain oral health services have not been developed or, in some cases, have been dismantled. <\/p> <p>  The committee should also know that most dental disease is preventable.  Dental decay and gum disease, which are the main reasons for tooth loss, pain and infection, are two of the most common diseases worldwide but preventing these diseases, and oral cancer, is possible to a large degree with simple primary care measures.<\/p> <p>  The reference group proposed principles that might frame an oral health policy.  Members will have seen some of these in the final Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte document.  There is the common risk factor approach, which recognises that some of the same factors are involved in oral and other diseases, so controlling these risk factors can have a big impact on health.  For example, high sugar intake is the main cause of tooth decay but is also implicated in obesity and type 2 diabetes.  Reducing sugar intake should, therefore, be the business of the whole primary health care team, including dentists.  Importantly, the provision of a service such as dental treatment must be surrounded by broader public health policies to make a real difference.  The life course approach means that individuals need access to different services throughout life and depending on their circumstances.  However, at all ages our population should have a home in a dental practice setting that is focused on prevention and empowering them to maintain their oral health and independence.  As part of Sl&aacute;intecare, oral health care must be available to all who need it, regardless of income, location and disability.  These are just a few examples of policy recommendations that have been included in Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte, which will be crucial to transform oral health in Ireland.  The principles are not only well established in Government policy, but are also contained in recommendations from internationally recognised professional bodies.<\/p> <p>  Those of us who want to provide appropriate care for patients know that an oral health policy will accomplish nothing without determined and sustained implementation.  Continuing with current services will not improve the oral health of the population and will exacerbate inequalities.  Available evidence is strongly supportive of change.  It is vital to build confidence in the public and in dental professionals that we will be supported in our roles.  Most of the population can be readily treated in a practice setting and a strong primary care system reduces the need for more complex interventions.  Nonetheless, primary care providers cannot be asked to take responsibility for patients unless they know there is access to backup and specialist care when needed, as outlined in the policy&rsquo;s advanced centres of care.  It is also essential that we monitor progress as we proceed, to make sure we are achieving the goals of the policy for all people.  The evaluation and research parts of the policy are critical to a successful outcome, as emphasised already in the Healthy Ireland framework.  All of these issues have been recognised in Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte and we welcome the publication of priority actions to be addressed in the coming years.<\/p> <p>  We would like to highlight the need to develop a workforce that is fit to deliver the best oral health care across disciplines to the greatest number of people, as stated clearly in Sl&aacute;intecare and described in the oral health policy.  Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte proposes a review of dental education and the development of primary care leadership throughout the dental schools and, I hope, the HSE to ensure that dentists will be central pillars of the primary health care team.  This may include extending education in a mentored environment to encompass broad community experience, inter-professional teamwork and general practice skills.  The oral health policy provides for ongoing access to retraining through a skills match programme, so the dental team can keep abreast of changes in the population, disease patterns and technology.  In order to support patients and practitioners, specialist and academic training must be put back on a firmer footing within the established medical model.  As the policy has stated, it is also time to look at the scope of practice of the whole dental team so the population has the greatest possible access to good quality care.<\/p> <p>  My colleagues and I have the privilege of working not only with students but all members of the dental team at all stages of their careers.  I assure the committee that in this country we have a talented and dedicated workforce whose skills are recognised everywhere.

I can certainly understand those concerns, as can most of us who work in the system, given that we do not always have a great track record of funding everything properly and ensuring that all parts of it work.  Ultimately, dentists, like any health professionals, want to deliver a service for the population but want to do so in a safe, sustainable way.  If they start to take care of a new group of patients such as children or people with disabilities, they need back-up.

I started work in general practice and moved to the equivalent of the public dental service, developing a special interest in the treatment of people with disabilities.  I undertook considerable training and now provide care for people with complex disabilities.  As well as perusing the evidence, we consulted extensively professionals working in the field and, along with our medical colleagues, people with disabilities.  I draw the committee's attention to an excellent document published in 2005 that brought together the viewpoints of people working in the field, such as people from the HSE and the National Disability Authority, who were all in agreement that the key to managing the problem for people with disabilities was mainstreaming their oral health.  There was wide agreement in that regard.<br\/><br\/>The availability of appropriate care is <i>ad hoc<\/i>.  People with disabilities are grossly underserved, they experience high levels of unmet need, along with reduced treatment options even when they are able to access care, and their outcomes are poorer.  A recent study from IDS-TILDA showed that people with intellectual disabilities who live into older age are twice as likely to have lost all their teeth.  More importantly, they are 12 times more likely not to wear dentures, not to mention bridges or crowns, to replace their teeth, ensure their dignity and allow them to chew a healthy diet.<br\/><br\/>There is agreement among the profession that such inequality is unjust, unfair and unnecessary.  Most people from vulnerable groups have needs that can be met with small, reasonable adjustments in primary care.  As was noted in the consultation, we must be mindful that when the public service fails to meet such people's needs, the fact that they have been affected by social inequality and had less access to education or well-paid jobs means that their ability to pay for alternatives will be greatly reduced.  From the literature, we know that only between 8% and 10% of people with disabilities require specialist care.  Where that care is required, however, it needs to be produced by well trained staff with access to adjuncts such as general anaesthesia and sedation and who are well informed on consent, ethics and working with teams in social care.  It is clear that people with disabilities want availability of care in mainstream services.<\/p><p>It is what they have asked for and there are great models to showcase this working very well.  However, what is required by people with disabilities, long-term conditions and frail older people is well-signposted pathways to services in a timely fashion as for many of these people, the only way they can receive basic care is with general anesthesia, sedation or experts.  The oral health policy and the consultation that we have gone through provides the structure and opportunity to address the frank inequalities that we see right from early intervention in childhood to frail older age.  For the first time targeted, preventive packages in primary care and establishment of these community-based services is really important.<\/p><p> Evidence shows that educating the general dental workforce and exposing them to diversity in their training gives them the skills and knowledge to manage most people with disabilities.  The training of the workforce, supported by specialists, is really important.  We cannot expect our primary care providers to accept people with complexities into their workforce without a very well structured framework and pathways to support them, for the few patients for whom it is beyond their scope.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019062600002#G01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Alison Dougall","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":156,"content":"<p>I apologise for being late - I was showing solidarity with workers on the picket line this morning and got caught in traffic - but I have had the opportunity to read over the submissions.<\/p> <p>  I am unclear about the matter of the Irish Dental Association.

Their considered view was that the association was not consulted, that there was no meaningful consultation, and they do not see their views or position reflected in any of the documentation.  I struggle to understand how we can have two people in for two different sessions who can have such completely divergent views of the same process.  Dr. Dougall calls what happened detailed consultation, while the Irish Dental Association is certainly not of that view.  There appears to have been some meetings but the Irish Dental Association says that it cannot see its views in the policy.  It is the body which represents the profession.  Maybe we will never get to the bottom of it but it is worth noting that it was very strong in its view that there had not been meaningful engagement.  We could detail all the meetings - we could have 100 meetings here and maybe it could be that I did not listen or the witnesses did not speak.  It is a difficulty and I hope that the partnership can be rebuilt.  The two views contradict and I do not know if we can square the circle.  In the absence of a time machine it cannot be fixed but it is important that the relationship is re-established.  I am not necessarily asking the witnesses to accept that the relationship has broken down or put words in their mouths but it is difficult for us as we have heard two divergent views of the same process.

If children have pain they attend our clinics and are dealt with by a highly skilled and well motivated staff who do a very good job in difficult circumstances.<\/p> <p>  Many people&rsquo;s first experience of dentistry is quite difficult.  It might come as a result of pain or trauma, possible loss of sleep or the onset of infection.  No one, if he or she has symptoms, is in the best of form when he or she turns up at a dental clinic.  The staff deal with that on a daily basis.   Since the start of this meeting, probably 300 children experiencing pain have walked into dental clinics and private dental practices.  There are in excess of 70,000 attendances for emergencies in the HSE service.  That is quite a large quantum of service.  We are very proud of the efforts our staff make to look after children.  Not many of us look forward to having dental treatment.  Clinical dentistry in young children requires a highly skilled and well motivated staff together with high standards of care, which is what we strive to provide.

Without putting too fine a point on it, I was correct and much of it was privatised.  At the time, I was told it would not be and it would enhance the service.  Of course, it did not.  Was there a cost-benefit analysis in terms of the investment in the public service building up from the 221 clinics, increasing staffing, delivering more through the public service versus purchasing from the private sector?  For example, we saw it happen with the home help service.  Directly employed home helps would provide the service for approximately &euro;13 to &euro;16 an hour.  Once one headed towards the private sector, one was knocking on the door of &euro;45 an hour, as well as losing control of the service and deskilling the public service.<\/p><p> It is not good that this would be lost.

I understand the Deputy&rsquo;s question and concern for the staff in place.  I was a principal dental surgeon when the last policy was launched and implemented.  Part of that was that the Department kindly offered us more dentist posts and it coincided with the introduction of dental hygienists.  We had great difficulty in County Meath filling those positions, however.  I had to go to Stockholm to recruit some dentists to fill those posts.<\/p> <p>  The problem is that, as currently set up, the HSE dental service is not attractive, particularly to new graduate dentists who would be young and enthusiastic.  Unlike in medicine, dentists graduate with a wide range of clinical skills.  In Dublin, they start treating patients doing irreversible procedures on patients in year two of a five-year programme.  They come out with an accomplished range of skills.  If one works in the salaried dental service, it does not allow one to use those skills.  In the past, there were more opportunities to use them.  When I was in the health board dental service, there were opportunities to treat adults.  For example, I did some of that kind of treatment in psychiatric hospitals.<\/p> <p>  Having extra positions does not necessarily solve the problem if the posts are not attractive.  Salary cuts, changes in the pension arrangements and so forth have an impact on the attractiveness.  The model of care needs to change.  This has been clearly outlined in the policy.

It took four separate phases to look at it.  The first was commissioned and given to University College Cork by the reference group to look at the cost-benefit analysis of the various services.  There was much international research on salaried services.  We looked at the Scandinavian models and at introducing different types of models.  They did not involve privatisation but public contracts in local communities.  It was found that salaried services were best suited to providing services to vulnerable and special care services.  For healthy patients in primary care, it was not as effective or efficient.  There are multiple international studies in that regard.  We looked at countries which were similar and there are theoretical constructs of it.  The Dutch and Icelandic models are more similar culturally to where we are sitting and we examined those models closely.<\/p> <p>  The second stream looked at all insurance models internationally and what was successful and otherwise.  It just did not look at the oral health outcomes of those models.  Oral health is influenced by many other issues such as social determinism, disease and water fluoridation, and not just by the service.  It looked at the uptake and the buy-in culturally from the countries involved.  Insurance models work well in Ireland.  We saw extremely good and fast outcomes from many of those models.<\/p> <p>  The final phase was done by the ESRI.  It started examining various types of models such as mixed-payment models.  This involved looking at a preventive package overlaid by a fee-for-item system and further overlaid by service level agreements.  The reason we went down that model was because it was familiar to the public and it understood it more.  The outcomes from such a model are good in a short period, particularly for a preventive-oriented scheme.  It is good for the type of oral health we are experiencing at present, whereby the vast majority of children from middle to high-income families have good oral health.  Then there is the smaller group of vulnerable persons.<\/p> <p>  We looked at the Medicaid model in America, whereby it increased access through practices.  It found that ironically inequalities did not get worse but were much better for the high-risk and low-income groups when they got in early.  The higher income groups did not tend to use it as much but it really benefitted lower income groups.<\/p> <p>  We undertook four separate phases because it is a significant change for us to undertake.

The search engine for scientific publications shows huge volumes of research on it.  The United States is one of the key countries.  Over 300 million people worldwide receive fluoridated water.  In the United States there is quite an amount of naturally occurring fluoride in water supplies.  In this country we reduced the level in the water supply in 2007 because on the basis of research carried out here it was considered that a reduced level would perhaps be better.  The range now is 0.6 to 0.8.  The maximum allowed in EU drinking water regulations is 1.5.  There is a very cautious approach being taken here.  In the United States in the past there was a maximum allowable concentration of four parts per million, which is considerably higher than the EU figure.  This is something that has been shown worldwide to be effective because everybody gets it.  People do not have to make any effort to get it, whereas in a programme which involves the application of a topical fluoride in some form or a varnish, or however it is put onto teeth, they have to come into the surgery.  Water fluoridation occurs for everybody.  That is why it is so beneficial.  It has had a huge beneficial impact on oral health in this country, not just for children but also for adults.  A whole generation has retained natural teeth, something that perhaps would not have happened in the past without water fluoridation.  It remains a cornerstone of policy because it is a key aspect of preventing one of the main dental diseases that afflicts people.  People do not look forward to going to the dentist, which is understandable.  The problem is claims can be made, but in the scientific world a very careful evaluation is made before talking about cause and effect.  People do not do this lightly.  They want to have lots of evidence to show a positive or negative effect.

The major change required is oral health has to become everybody's problem.  We have to integrate the mouth with the rest of the body and work with our medical colleagues, community nurses and midwives to nudge people at appropriate times.  This is really important in early childhood, but it is critical in older age, too.  We find that for the first time older people are retaining their teeth.  In the past they went into older age with dentures.  People make more medical appointments as they get older but fewer dental appointments, although their risks are higher because of medicine, poor eyesight, lack of dexterity and finances.  Pathfinder surveys examine how we can signpost people in order that they have really good levels of oral health as they age.  As one in five people over the age of 80 years will get dementia, we need to make sure the teams that are caring for people with dementia take oral health seriously because we have the technology to prevent and reverse disease if we catch it early.  Our problem is that people with dementia who have not received any care for perhaps eight or ten years present with advanced problems which at that point are very difficult to treat.  That is a real priority.  It is a new problem, but the nudges about which the Deputy talks mean redesigning the way we provide care.  For homeless populations, we need more drop-in centres; for older people, we need to make sure services are local because they are least likely to be able to travel.  Therefore, we need to make services accessible and affordable and design domiciliary care services in such a way that we can take teams into residential homes.  They do not need to be dentists; we can work with teams of hygienists who can effectively and economically reverse disease.  This is incredibly important and it is highlighted in the community services.  We need to work with the professions and our colleagues in other areas of medicine to design services to reach more people at risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019062600002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Alison Dougall"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561503600,"counter":202,"content":"<p>On the point made about water fluoridation, like Ireland, Israel had mandatory water fluoridation and it was pulled out.  It tried to replace it with toothpaste and other programmes outlined by Dr. McLoughlin.  For all those reasons, the level of decay has increased phenomenally.  The only area in Israel that has maintained its oral health rates is a place in which water is naturally fluoridated.  Now that water fluoridation has been taken away, it is impossible to put it back in.  It is really important that we protect water fluoridation as there are stark and dramatic outcomes, as we see in Israel.<\/p> <p>  The point made about the workforce is very important, especially because we have put in place the World Health Organization, WHO, safety net surveillance network.  On focusing on children only, the WHO is very clear that we must consider five year olds, 12 year olds, adolescents from 15 to 19 years of age and 35 to 45 year olds, the prime ages for childbearing, and then move to 60 and 70 year olds.  The overarching safety net monitoring and surveillance service has been recognised by the WHO since the early 2000s and all European countries are moving in this direction exactly for the reasons outlined by the Deputy to make sure people in the workforce are encouraged and formally nudged to tell them that their oral health is not okay, as they need to be signposted to the dentist and assured on where they are going.  <\/p> <p>  The view from other countries, particularly the Dutch models, is that there is much more flexibility when the message is sent to the profession in communities that dentists are providing care because they can afford to be more flexible, work on a Saturday, or late if they so chose because it is up to them to get their patients into the clinic.  A core part of oral health policy is to establish a dental home as early as possible because the first two years are crucial, not just for children but also their parents because the effect is twofold.  When they bring in their child, it nudges them.  There is a lot of evidence to support this.  We can be absolutely certain that certain socio-economic groups have access to services.  One of the key points in the policy is to say it is a universal approach, but it must be overlaid with a targeted approach.  That comes through in the oral health promotion programmes and services, but at no point do we say universal access stands on its own.  We are absolutely aware of the vulnerable and people with disabilities.  That is why we have put in place the WHO safety net surveillance network to ensure we can pick up those in the vulnerable groups.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019062600002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Dympna Kavanagh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561503600,"counter":203,"content":"<p>The safety of water fluoridation has been raised as an issue over and over again in every country.  I can understand this.  Most English speaking nations use water fluoridation to a greater or lesser extent.  I have examined this issue.  The WHO, the European Union, the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, and others have examined it in great detail and never been able to find any problem with its safety.  The Health Research Board commissioned a study a few years ago, examined every piece of evidence and could not find a problem with it.  Last year Public Health England recommended that more water fluoridation schemes be rolled out.  More people in England receive fluoridated water than in Ireland.<\/p><p>It is a smaller percentage of the population but there are big fluoridated communities in the UK.  <\/p><p> The Deputy is right about catching serious cases at earlier ages.  We spoke earlier about on-demand services and children turning up in pain and with infection.  Why are 70,000 children turning up in pain and why do 7,000 children have to go into hospital to have teeth extracted?  By the time they are seen, it is too late.  I agree with Dr. Green.  No parent wants his or her child's first time visiting a dentist to be because the child has a serious infection and needs to be bundled into hospital and put to sleep to have teeth removed.  Nobody wants that.  No organisation or dentist wants that.  This is why one of the key aspects of the policy, in line with all international recommendations, is to see children when their teeth first appear and start to give basic advice to them and their parents about looking after their teeth, diet, brushing and so on to ensure we do not have young children turning up in hospital needing extractions.  That is very important.  <\/p><p> At a later age, there is a growing problem with diabetes.  There is a well-known relationship between gum disease and diabetes.  The more one improves one, the more one improves the other.  Some of the health insurance companies in the US will pay for people to have as much gum treatment as they want if they are at risk of diabetes because the more a person improves his or her gum health, the better controlled his or her diabetes will be and it will stop people from going into hospital.  It also saves money.

While that might not translate to Ireland, there is certainly strong evidence to suggest that this information should come from several different sources.  Finland is another example of a country that changed its system.  The pharmacy is the first point of contact, which means that if person goes into a health service where the first point of contact happens to be a pharmacist, that pharmacist will guide him or her through the system.

The vast majority of those cases are identified at the point of referral and the point of assessment.  While those cases are prioritised within the current system, some of the surgery is dependent on the completion of growth in the jaws and that is not completed in most instances until the very late teens.  Therefore, the surgery will be planned at the end of the teens rather than at age 12 or 13 which is the optimal age for the majority of children to have orthodontics.  In a small number of cases, the planned approach will be that some orthodontic treatment is undertaken with a possible delay thereafter to allow growth to be completed followed by more intervention by the orthodontist and the surgeon working together.  There are a small number of such cases, but they are dealt with on a priority basis within the system.  However, they are in a parallel stream to most of the other cases where priority is determined according to the extent of malocclusion.  There is serious management of those cases, but inevitably some of those adolescents will be treated right through until their late teens or even early 20s because of the nature of their condition and the physical limitations on what can be achieved in the early to mid-teens.

It is important to say they hold their own among all of the European graduates.<\/p> <p>  However, what was clear, indeed, in our consultation that came back from the dentists, was that they want primary care at the heart of it and, as Professor O'Connell articulated, they want to have more exposure to practice and all those areas of managing one's own practice in primary care right through their graduate programme, and those who we asked were not necessarily convinced that what is being proposed in \"foundation training\", as it was then called, would rectify their problems.  In fact, the older graduates said that they were still having problems.  That is why we started to look at it moving more towards a mentoring programme, which, I suppose, is a super extension of that programme.<\/p> <p>  Let us focus on the specialist side of it because that is an important area.  The Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry, which is the formal recognised group over specialist training and part of the Dental Council, has welcomed this policy in writing and is very supportive of it.  We have already started working with the Dental Council and the Institut Sp&eacute;cialis&eacute; en Technologie D'Art Dentaire, ISTD, to put in place advanced centres of care.  That involves not only a name.  That involves credentialling, looking at the work and at the workforce we need at all the different levels.  Specialists in dentistry in Ireland, and, indeed, in Europe, are different from those in medicine in that they are independent practitioners.  That adds a different dimension to our workforce.  Unlike in medicine, it does not mean that one automatically jumps into consultancy.  We have this firm grade in between.  This is a piece of work and they are well placed to lead in it.  In fact, they have done a tremendous amount of work already to prepare for specialisation and for the advanced centres of care coming through.  When we talk about it being a five-year plan, this is a priority - education and training, mentoring, and then moving forward into the advanced centres of care and credentialling those.  This is a key piece of work with the Dental Council.  We have met already and the working group will start to get going in July on it.  We want to start commissioning, certainly early next year, a look at our undergraduate training in the first instance.  We have so much groundwork done on the specialisation.  There is great leadership there.  We hope that we are in a strong position to move them in parallel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019062600002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Dympna Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":235,"content":"<p>What of the issue of the foundation year?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019062600002#P00600","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561503600,"counter":236,"content":"<p>That is the mentoring scheme, which I identified.

When dentists graduate, they have an excellent set of skills that enables them to do a wide range of tasks.  There is no evidence that there is any difficulty with that.  If goes to the Dental Council and looks at who is appearing before its fitness to practice committee, complaints from the public or any metric, there is no problem with new graduates.  In fact, in many ways the way they practice may be better and safer than established practitioners.  What they do not have is the broadest experience of treating a wide range of patients about whom we have been talking here, for instance, people with disabilities, very young children and people living in residential care.  If we are looking at a so-called extended year or foundation training, we must look specifically for an Irish system as to the gap needed to be filled here.

One of the problems is that the State is giving significant funding to the universities and it is about a return to the State for that investment.

As the Senator rightly said, Irish graduates are registered.  It is important to note that many students in the dental schools come from other countries.  As part of an agreement with Canada, the Canadian authorities provide a substantial contribution to the education aspect.  When we talk about people graduating from Irish schools, we are not necessarily talking about Irish people.  Canadian graduates might want to go back to their homes in Canada.  People who came here for their education might want to go back to other areas.  There is a phenomenal degree of mobility in the European Union.  A sizeable majority of those who come here from other European states - I have the figures available - stay beyond five or seven years.  I think our policy on this point aims to give graduates more opportunities to acquire a breadth of skills from the time they graduate.  It is about having a mentored environment for them, not for one, two or three years, even if the work done in these years is of benefit, but for a much longer period.  It is about helping them to establish in practice in order that they can set up principalships in practice after five years.  This is all knowledge nobody is going to gain overnight.  It is important that we focus on the mentoring framework in the long term.  Many other professions have done it.  Ours tends to be very isolated.  This emerged clearly when we consulted dentists.  They told us that they felt isolated from their peers, particularly in rural environments.  That led to a fundamental change in how we were approaching education.  We realised something much more substantial than a one-year programme was needed.  My colleague, the chief dental officer in Britain, is very firm on the point that this is an NHS scheme, rather than an education scheme or an intern scheme.  I think it has been somewhat misrepresented.  She constantly berates me for the misrepresentation of the scheme.  The scheme in the United Kingdom is linked with an NHS practice and attached to that practice only.  If one is entering into private practice as a UK graduate, one enters into practice in the same way as every other European graduate.  The scheme is linked with the NHS system only.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019062600002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Dympna Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":246,"content":"<p>Do we have any information on primary care centres?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019062600002#Q00400","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561503600,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I will speak about them briefly from a policy perspective before handing over to my colleagues from the HSE.

Approximately 13,000 people require complex care at some time.  Access to services is <i>ad hoc<\/i>.  A large number of patients are particularly at risk.  A relatively small number of people are specifically trained to treat such patients, which is an issue.  Access to general anaesthesia is also <i>ad hoc<\/i>.  There are some pockets of brilliance and excellence, but in many other areas there is nothing.  Some people must travel a great distance to a dental hospital or across borders to access treatment.  The dental hospital is not an acute setting as it does not have general anaesthesia facilities.  General anaesthesia is provided throughout the country but it is severely limited and many people with disabilities have their treatment options severely limited by poor access to it.  For example, extraction-only services may be offered or, within the general anaesthesia setting, the patient is not offered root canal, even to save a front tooth.  It is well recognised that there are no well-defined care pathways and not enough people trained to provide the required care.  That needs to be addressed in the policy and there will undoubtedly be a need for more people to be trained in this area.<br\/><br\/>On training at undergraduate level, evidence has shown that we can train people in general practice to do the bulk of the work, but undergraduate is not the time to work on complex patients because students are honing their basic dental skills.  The mentoring of graduates following qualification is extremely important.  Special care dentistry is a specialty.  We offer three-year specialist training on an international basis.  Most Irish graduates travel overseas for training in this area because of its cost in Ireland.  Unlike orthodontics or periodontics, in regard to which people can thereafter go into general practice to earn a living, it is currently difficult to self-fund a expensive course of treatment.<br\/><br\/>On succession planning, I am a consultant but there is no formal recognition for a consultant training pathway to, for example, replace me when I retire in ten years.  The provision of training across the board in this area is a priority and it has been recognised as such.  It is possible to achieve very good levels of care for people with disabilities, as evidenced by the literature.  It will be a challenge, but we know it is possible and the evidence shows that the training is available in Ireland.  We have the methodology and curricula to train our undergraduates, postgraduates and practising dentists to give them the skills to prevent the need for extensive treatment.  We always seek to avoid general anaesthesia being necessary.  Prevention works very well for people with disabilities.  We need general anaesthesia to be available and people to be trained to provide sedation, which opens up bigger options of care than general anaesthesia, but we mainly wish to prevent the necessity of sedation or general anaesthesia by having good, well orientated preventative services in primary care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019062600002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Alison Dougall"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":264,"content":"<p>When RCSI representatives appeared before the committee last month they made the point that only two dental specialties are recognised by the Dental Council of Ireland, whereas 13 are recognised by the equivalent body in England.

In the UK in particular, there is a plethora of specialties.  There is much debate, particularly among my chief dental officer colleagues, about the merits of having multiple specialties in smaller countries such as ours with a population of 4.5 million.  A dentist practising in a specialist limited area needs a body of work to maintain his or her skills and that is a dilemma for us.  Many people first look to the practice in Scandinavian countries, where they have developed a concept of specialist generalist training and are moving away from limited specialties.  Although I do not wish to pre-empt what will be in the policy, practitioners could combine several specialties, which would be of particular benefit to us in respect of rural areas, which are a challenge for us.  It would be difficult for us to appoint a paediatric specialist, a special care specialist and several other specialists to such areas as there would be a shortage of applicants for such posts.<\/p> <p>  To come back to the policy, the advanced care centres provide credentials in this regard.  On a national level, we need a broad range of specialties available to us.  However, if we are looking into the community, we would have to consider that workforce planning in a certain way.  It is important that practitioners maintain their skills.  One of the important concerns raised in the consultation with dentists on the ground was that they are primary care dentists with a broad scope of practice, but feel squeezed by the specialties and auxiliaries coming in and want a clear definition of their scope of practice.  The view of the Dental Council of Ireland is that primary care covers all eventualities unless, as Dr. Dougall rightly pointed out, it is an advanced part of care and this network is required to provide it.  It is a mutual relationship.  We currently only have two specialties and are conforming to EU standards in that regard.  We recognise that more specialties are needed in key areas, but I am unsure whether having 13 specialties would be appropriate for us as we do not have a population of 78 million.  The four key pillars, involving primary care, special care, looking at public health and looking at the advanced centres, such as in the areas of restorative and, perhaps, periodontal care, are key in considering the needs of our communities.

If children have been waiting for five years for a routine case, they have been referred for a reason, even if it is a routine one.  If it gets worse over five years, the child could be 13 or 14 when he or she is referred and could be 19 before he or she is seen.  It seems outrageous.

The Dental Council of Ireland does not have the wherewithal to go into premises and inspect them.  Dr. Green alluded to the need for us to have high-quality standards in dental care.  The HSE service is exemplary in that regard.  It is important that for all premises and practices, the Dental Council of Ireland should be able to put in a programme of work whereby it can inspect practices.

Prevention is therefore of even more value for them.  That treatment risk could also include an assessment of their risks of being treated under general anaesthetic or sedation.  We would seek to avoid the worst possible treatment scenario, where someone is in a hospital for treatment for what is, as Professor O'Connell said, largely a preventable condition.  In transitioning to a revised system, the HSE's priorities would be to try to protect the strengths of the existing service, including a same-day or following day response for anyone who is in pain.

We have yet to reach the starting point for all of that, and there would need to be extensive consultation with prospective service providers, our own staff, the Department, and any other stakeholder which might be involved.

I thank Dr. Kavanagh.<\/p> <p>  I have two questions relating to specific areas.  My first, unsurprisingly enough, relates to my own constituency of Dublin Fingal.  Figures from replies to parliamentary questions show that of the 84,000 children who are on waiting lists, there are 4,450 in my own area who have been waiting longer than 52 weeks.  That is the number of children currently in fourth class with no guarantee that they will be offered a screening appointment.  That is clearly very worrying.  I happen to represent the constituency with the fastest-growing population in this State, and possibly even in Europe, so that should be enough.  I see parents in my advice clinics on a weekly basis who are concerned because their children's teeth are deteriorating and they are stuck on waiting lists.  The witnesses know the figures so I am not going to go through every single waiting list, but the list of children waiting for more than 52 weeks jumps out at me.  That is a year.  If someone is due a test in fourth class and they have to wait a year, one does not have to be a genius to figure out that they will not be in fourth class at the end of it.  What happens to these children?  According to the witnesses' own figures, it is highly unlikely they will get the screening.  I talk to their parents, so I know that, in many instances, the money is not there for them to go private.  Why should they have to, aside from the fact that their children are left waiting?  What are the likely outcomes of missing that important appointment for those children?  I presume it is important, otherwise it would not be on the schedule. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019062600002#V01200","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561503600,"counter":333,"content":"<p>Will I deal with the first part first?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019062600002#V01300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joe Green"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":334,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019062600002#V01400","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561503600,"counter":335,"content":"<p>The HSE sets priorities of trying to see children in second class, sixth class, and fourth class if possible.  There are a number of areas in the country where fourth class has not been reached due to capacity, as we discussed earlier.  The amount or increment of treatment that is often required at fourth class is much less if children have been seen in either first or second class.  Focusing on permanent teeth for the moment, if fissure sealants have been placed on the permanent teeth in either first or second class, by fourth class visits would hopefully concentrate more on looking for dental milestones such as the eruption of permanent teeth, occlusion, and reinforcing preventative measures such as dietary advice, advice to parents, tooth brushing, as well as reinforcing good dental attendance.  In the event that children are not seen in fourth class, the increment of decay that may have occurred between second class and fourth class would be the one that could not be treated at that time.  Where possible, those children are followed up on if resources allow, and they would then be seen in either fifth or sixth class, depending on the approach of their local area.  As I said, the outcome of treatment at first or second class is critical.

This is a very important piece of legislation and I thank committee members for their time and consideration.<\/p> <p>  I am joined by a number of colleagues: Ms Lorraine O&rsquo;Donoghue and Sinead O&rsquo;Gorman, who have been working hard on the rates Bill, from the local government finance section in the Department; Ms Sheila McMahon, who is here to cover the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act amendments; and Ms Patricia Curran and Mr. Paul Hogan, who are here to cover the planning amendments.  As requested, we have provided advance briefing on these Report Stage amendments to the committee.<\/p> <p>  Commercial rates are a critical source of funding for local authorities, accounting for &euro;1.51 billion, or 32%, of the &euro;4.67 billion expenditure budgeted in the sector in 2018.  The overall aim of this rates Bill is to modernise and improve the rates regime.  In this regard, the drafting process is complex and of necessity, requires significant ongoing consultation with key stakeholders, particularly local authorities and the valuation office.<\/p> <p>  I might just mention that in terms of important provisions not subject to amendment, the Bill provides for the introduction of rates alleviation - waiver - schemes by local authorities, subject to ministerial approval, which can support important policy objectives contained in local, economic, community and land use plans.<\/p><p>The Bill also includes important provisions for collection and enforcement by local authorities.<\/p><p> The Bill was passed on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il on 30 January, at which time a number of amendments were signalled for introduction on Committee Stage.  Report Stage is provisionally scheduled for 3 July.  Committee Stage consideration will take place immediately after this briefing session.  The Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, will be in attendance and it will present an opportunity to discuss important amendments such as those related to the Valuation Acts.  The changes are required to ensure the ongoing national revaluation programme will remain revenue neutral for the local authorities, taking account of the revaluation of utilities on a global basis and the impact of successful appeals to the Valuation Tribunal.  In that context, an amendment to allow the Commissioner of Valuation share the preliminary valuation of Irish Water with the local authorities is time critical to facilitate the calculations for 2020 budgets in local authorities.<\/p><p> A small number of important but mainly technical amendments were not ready for tabling on Committee Stage, but it is intended to introduce them on Report Stage.  There will be a number of further amendments relevant to the Bill.  Furthermore, amendments to the Planning and Development Acts, the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 and the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 are proposed.  Amendments to the rates regime are proposed to enhance notification procedures and provision for additions and amendments to the valuation list to be immediately effective for rating purposes, given that there is currently a delay.  A possible further amendment remains subject to drafting.  <\/p><p> An amendment to the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 is required to overcome a risk that might allow the definition of an \"owner of student accommodation\" to be construed in a manner that could circumvent the intention of the Act.  The amendment is required prior to the imminent planned commencement of the student accommodation provisions.  Technical amendments related to the timing of the commencement of the student accommodation provisions will also be required.  An amendment to the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 will be required to provide an alternative route for protected structures to qualify, further to substantial refurbishment works, for exemption from rent increase restrictions in rent pressure zones, RPZs, because they would be unlikely to qualify under the provisions recently enacted in the 2019 Act.  The objective is to eliminate any potential negative impact on the planned refurbishment of protected structures in the rental sector.<\/p><p> An amendment will be required to the Planning and Development Act 2000 to address transitional issues following the establishment of the Office of the Planning Regulator.  It is a time-critical amendment in the context of the ongoing development of regional spatial and economic strategies, RSESs, by regional assemblies.  A further minor technical amendment will be proposed to underpin the special provisions for Cork city and county councils to extend the period for review of their development plans to incorporate RSESs into their plans.  A possible amendment to the Local Government Act 1998 to reinsert a provision inadvertently deleted which empowers the Exchequer to pay into the Local Government Fund is no longer deemed to be required following further legal advice on the matter.<\/p><p> I thank the committee.  We look forward to the discussion.  We have provided some more detail in the briefing note on the proposed amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019062600002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Quinlan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":368,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Quinlan and our other guests for their attendance.  While I do not mean to criticise anyone, there is a certain degree of dissatisfaction among committee members.  Yet again, we have been notified of Report Stage amendments that we will not have a chance to scrutinise in committee.  I appreciate that the idea in Mr. Quinlan appearing before the committee is to fill in at least part of the gap, for which we are grateful, but the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, should hear loud and clear the view of the committee that it would have been much better if the amendments had been brought through the full and proper process of Committee and Report Stages.  Nevertheless, we have always been flexible as a committee and do not wish to stand in the way of important amendments.<\/p> <p>  I have concerns about two of the proposed Report Stage amendments and would like to hear more about them.  While the amendments related to student accommodation and rates seem to bebroadly sensible, my concern is with the protected structures and RPZs.  If I understand the problem correctly, it is that the building energy rating, BER, requirements included in the new definition of \"substantial refurbishment\" cause a difficulty in the case of pre-1963 properties because they are exempt from BER upgrades.  Would it not have made more sense to simply remove the provision of a new definition of \"substantial refurbishment\" from the criteria for pre-1963 properties to be eligible for substantial refurbishment?  Was this considered, or have I misunderstood the position?  Why is the solution to the problem a requirement to have been outside the rental market for 12 months rather than 24?<\/p> <p>  I also have a concern about the RSESs.  We will again give a significant power to the Minister.  Although I do not want to return to the debate, the purpose in creating a planning regulator was to shift the overconcentration of power from the hands of the Minister and the Department, to which the Mahon tribunal had rightly pointed.  In the case of the current RSES processes, however, the amendment would allow the Minister to issue a direction to the regional assemblies to take such specified measures as he or she might require for the plan.  That seems to be another significant shift in power towards the Minister and an undermining of the regional and local authorities.  What is Mr. Quinlan's response?  I am open to supporting both amendments on Report Stage, but I struggle with these two questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019062600002#B00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":369,"content":"<p>On global revaluations, the Valuation Office is carrying out the valuation of Irish Water and there have been some indications of how the valuation will be broken down for each local authority.  I have heard that population size might be used in calculating the figure.  I have also heard indications that, by coincidence, the valuation may end up being the same as the current total valuation of Irish Water.  That will be interesting if it turns out to be the case.  If the figure is divided by population, counties such as Wicklow will lose out significantly.  In fairness, Wicklow County Council rated all of its water infrastructure in its books, whereas I understand a number of councils did not rate any of their water infrastructure.  Is there a question mark over the current valuation of Irish Water, given that some councils did not carry out a valuation?  When the Valuation Office gives its valuation of Irish Water, who will decide how to apportion it and how will it be done?  If it is apportioned according to population size, what will happen to the likes of County Wicklow which will probably lose approximately &euro;1.6 million in commercial rates?

They apply to pre-1963 structures but it is just the protected structures within that and this has to do with a technical issue.  The BER system emanates from an EU directive and the regulations were made under the 1972 Act.  That means the regulations can only be applied as a requirement as opposed to an optional facility.  They cannot be used like that.  It turned out that the only way protected structures could qualify for the exemption would be either more than 25% of the property was refurbished or they met all three of the exemptions relating to adaptation for disabled people, an increase in the layout and an increase in the number of rooms.  Effectively, that would have meant it would have been very difficult for protected structures to quality under the grounds of the change in the substantial refurbishment works.  To provide an alternative way in which this subset of buildings in the rental sector could qualify, so that there would not be a deterrent effect on doing needed refurbishment work, this amendment is being introduced whereby if it is a case that there has not been a tenancy in the building for 12 months prior to the new tenancy that commences after the works, there will be an exemption from the application of the 4% rent increase restriction in the rent pressure zones, RPZs.  This is an alternative.  It will still be two years for every other building.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019062600002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Sheila McMahon"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":374,"content":"<p>Does the amendment only deal with protected structures rather than the generality of the pre-1963 structures?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019062600002#C00400","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561503600,"counter":375,"content":"<p>Yes.

In fact, the east and midlands regional strategy is due to be published on Friday.  The process is that well advanced and is almost complete.<\/p> <p>  The problem is that the legislation that we now have has made the involvement of the Minister in the process at this stage subject to the involvement of the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, from the outset in the process, which can never be achieved because we cannot turn the clock back.  This arises because this legislation was published in 2016 and enacted last year.  It was always envisaged that the OPR would be in place before the RSESs kicked off but the office was not in place and it did not happen like that.  They have travelled down the road and the regulator has come in pretty much three quarters of the way through all of the processes.  As I said, the legislation envisages the regulator being given notice, making submissions and being very clear about what the issues are and what his or her office wants to see done all the way through and then, on foot of that either happening or not happening, making a recommendation to the Minister at the very end for the Minister to act.  The Department, on behalf of the Minister, has been involved to date in line with legislation that was there until 3 April.  This amendment simply seeks to put a once-off interim arrangement in place for the current round of RSESs, all of which are at a slightly different stage, and simply enable the process, as it was prior to 3 April, to be concluded as it would have been.  However, there is one new addition, which enables the Minister to invite the regulator to issue an advisory report to him or her.  That is seen as something that would enable at least the advice of the regulator's office to be brought in to the current process.  It is a new provision but it gets us over the problem of the regulator not having been involved all of the way through and having things on the record that he said.  There is an issue about legal consistency where one cannot have someone coming in at the 11th hour raising new issues or whatever.  The ability to involve the regulator is the only new element, otherwise it is just putting the clock back to prior to 3 April.  The regulator's office is only recruiting staff now so the reality is there will not be a significant capacity there to undertake what was envisaged even if we could set the clock back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019062600002#C02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Hogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":391,"content":"<p>Why do it in the first place?

It may have been discussed earlier but I wish to outline the provisions of those amendments.  Section 10 is about notification procedures and the amendment will enhance the existing provisions of the section to ensure there is an obligation on ratepayers to register with the local authority and to notify it of any material changes in respect of rateable properties.  A difficulty in obtaining such information, for example, concerning a change of occupier or a change in the legal name of the business, has proven to be a barrier to the effective levying and collection of rates for many local authorities, placing a clear statutory obligation on the occupier-ratepayer and this amendment will mitigate that.<\/p><p>The amendment to section 4 relates to the making of the rate process and the provision for additions and amendments to the valuation lists and changes to occupation to be immediately effective for rating purposes.  Currently rates are levied on properties that exist on the valuation list on the date of the making of the local authority budget.  This means that additions of new properties or amendments to the valuation lists during the year are not effective for rates until the following financial year and the following budget year.  It is, therefore, proposed to amend section 4 to allow for additions and amendments to the valuation lists to become immediately effective for rating purposes.<\/p><p>A further amendment to section 4 provides that where a person becomes the occupier or enters into an agreement which entitles him or her to occupy the relevant property on a date after 1 January in any year, a local authority should charge that person a charge adjusted to reflect the remaining period of the year.  Currently the person in occupation on the date of the making of the rate is liable for the entire year.  This is an anomaly which the amendment seeks to address.  It is now proposed that the local authority should adjust the charge or demand issue to the person who was in occupation on 1 January or after 1 January where there were more than one previous occupier in that year, so that the charge for the full year is apportioned between the different occupiers during the year on a<i>pro rata<\/i>basis.  <\/p><p>The introduction of a rates compliant certificate will mean that if a ratepayer seeking a certain licence from a particular local authority, he or she may be required to demonstrate to that same authority that the rates bill has either been paid or is subject to a payment plan.  This measure is intended to facilitate a more joined up approach within individual local authorities without being overly burdensome and as a measure to encourage business to meet their rates obligations and to engage with local authorities.  Subject to the drafting being finalised this amendment will introduce the concept of this rates compliance certificate for the first time and can be kept under review in terms of its effectiveness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019062600002#J00700","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1561503600,"counter":514,"content":"<p>SECTION 1<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":515,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 1 and 15 are related and will be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019062600002#J00800","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":516,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p><blockquote>In page 5, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:<br \/><br \/>&ldquo; &ldquo;Act of 2015&rdquo; means the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015;&rdquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>Amendment No. 1 is a technical amendment and is included to cater for an amendment to section 20.  Section 20 is being expanded to include two separate references to the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015.<\/p><p> I will now turn to amendment No. 15.  Currently, rates are levied on properties on the valuation that exists on the date of the making of the local authority budget.  This means that the addition of new properties - this refers in part to what I said earlier - or amendments to the valuation list during the year are not effective for rates until the financial year following the making of the budget.  Amendment No. 15, as set out in the proposed expanded section 20, subsection (a), provides that additions and amendments to the valuation list become immediately effective for rating purposes.<\/p><p> As for the proposed sections 20(b) and 20(c), currently there are differences in the timeframes allowed to public utilities undertakings and other ratepayers as set out in the Valuation Act.  There are no objectively justifiable reasons that different or more generous time periods should be given to public utility companies, as opposed to private citizens or to citizens with businesses.  The current provisions in this regard appear to give rise to different treatment for different categories of ratepayers.  The proposed amendments to sections 53 and 54 address this and ensure an equitable and more efficient streamlined process for all ratepayers.<\/p><p> The proposed section 20(d) is about rate limitation orders, which was also discussed earlier.  It concerns section 56 of the Valuation Act and amends the formula on which rate limitation orders are based.  There are two elements to the formula.  First, the rate limitation order is introduced for local authorities following a revaluation process to ensure the revaluation is revenue neutral.  Revaluation results in a redistribution of commercial rates liability between ratepayers depending on the relative shift in the rental value of the properties in relation to one another.  In practice, however, local authorities lose out on income from successful appeals to the Valuation Tribunal, which means the revaluation exercise is not revenue neutral as intended.  To mitigate this, it is intended to amend the rate limitation order formula to allow for the inclusion of a factor that takes account of the level of appeals.  It is proposed to add this factor in order that the upper limit of rates income in the year following revaluation is raised slightly to take account of leakage on the appeal following revaluation.  The factor would be agreed annually by the Minister and by the Commissioner of Valuation.<\/p><p> The second part, which is a further amendment to the formula for calculating rates limitation orders, is also proposed.  As it is currently worded, section 56 has the unintended consequence of linking the standard revaluation programme, which is carried out on a cyclical basis, with the valuation cycle for global utility companies.  This has a particularly acute impact for any county or local authority undergoing a standard revaluation that coincides with a new valuation of a global utility.  It means that the mandatory rate limitation order will limit the rates income from that utility.  The global utilities are network based operators with a national presence and include telecommunications operators, ESB, EirGrid and Irish Rail.  Irish Water will become a global utility in the coming months and is currently being revalued for this purpose.  Authorities being revalued currently stand to lose out from any additional rates income from Irish Water at a potential cost of significant sums.  Included in the revaluation process at the moment are Fingal, Tipperary, Meath, Wicklow, Wexford, Louth, Cavan and Monaghan.  The addition of the second portion of the formula for the rates limitation order calculation will ensure the buoyancy achieved for new or revised global utility evaluations can be accounted for in the formula, which sets the upper limit for rates income in the following year.  In other words, it will accrue to the local authority and they will not have to balance it out with other existing ratepayers, and therefore will potentially see a rate reduction for some of the utility companies.  That is an unintended consequence of the current system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019062600002#J00900","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":518,"content":"<p>We had a fairly detailed conservation on amendment No. 15.

In order for the local authority to not lose out from losing those appeals and for the overall rates income to be revenue neutral, it means that somebody else will have to pay more.  Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify how that will operate and how it will impact on the local authority, given that many of the people who appeal the rate increase through a revaluation do not necessarily pay the rates until the appeal is concluded.  What happens if other people who did not get a rates increase then get hit with a rates increase in order to meet the revenue neutrality that is set out in this?

The idea behind the proposed section 20(d) is as the Deputy has said.  The legislation as currently worded would allow for that situation to occur every number of years where a revaluation of utilities coincides with a revaluation of X number of local authorities.  This would see any potential increase - or buoyancy - from revenue received in rates from the utilities offset against other existing rates received from existing businesses in their local area.  The main purpose of section 20(d), as proposed in amendment No. 15,  is to ensure that this loophole is covered off.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also referred to the appeals process and he makes a valid point.  Talk is ongoing between departmental officials and the Valuation Office to ensure staffing levels will be sufficient to allow for valuations to occur and for appeals to be heard in a timely fashion.  When the revaluation process was introduced originally, as everybody is aware, it was intended to be a revenue-neutral change and that any increases would be offset by decreases to other ratepayers in the local authority area.<\/p> <p>  On the length of time for appeals to be heard, members who deal with local authority members will know that when rates are agreed at budget meetings in the local authority, sometimes - even with the best of intentions by members and officials - if there are a number of appeals outstanding and if there are appeals that have been successful, it has led to a situation where the cost has not always been neutral with a resulting loss or reduction on the books of the local authority in terms of the potential income it thought it was going to accrue from commercial rates.<\/p><p>Part of amendment No. 15 is designed as an attempt to ensure that such revenue neutrality will occur into the future.  It does not fully occur at present but varies from local authority to local authority.  Amendment No. 15 refers to the change that will allow for another figure or factor to be used in respect of the volume of appeals and the difference between what was agreed by the local authority at budget time and what it can sometimes turn out to be.  The purpose of that particular section of the amendment is to ensure that this shortfall is as small as possible and may be fully eliminated.  I hope that answers some of what Deputy &Oacute; Broin has asked.<\/p><p> As to Deputy Casey's point, the process of valuation for Irish Water has not been completed yet.  Off the top of my head, Wicklow has significant water infrastructure, which serves a far greater region than Wicklow alone and that obviously would be a reason for Wicklow to have a greater commercial rate potential from Irish Water than most other local authorities.   <\/p><p> I fully agree with the Deputy, and it is his entitlement, to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage that Wicklow would see a commensurate benefit from that Irish Water revaluations process when it is completed.  As to whether it will be offset, there is a further job to be done in the local government section as to how the Local Government Fund is administered in future.  I believe everyone present has been a member of the local authority at some stage and understands the number of movable parts that currently exist in the local authority fund, many of which are grossly outdated at this stage.

An earlier definition of &quot;owner&quot; already exists in rating law exists in section 14 of the Local Government Act 1946 which defines the owner as the person for the time being entitled to occupy a vacant hereditament at the time of the making of the rate, which is old rates wordage.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 3 is another technical amendment and relates to deleting in page 6 line 34, &quot;Notice of&quot; and substituting &quot;A rates bill stating&quot;.  It is preferable to describe the notice that is being issued seeking payment of the rates as a rates bill.  The phrase, &quot;rates bill&quot; is the term already used in current rating legislation.  In Article 25 of the Local Government (Financial Procedures and Audit) Regulations 2014 &quot;rates bill&quot; is distinctive, self-explanatory and stands from out other statutory notices served by local authorities.  The number of rates bills that are issued also vastly exceeds any other statutory notice and are therefore worthy of a distinct title.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 4  is effectively the same amendment, which is to delete &quot;the notice&quot; and substitute &quot;the rates bill&quot; for exactly the same reasons that I have just outlined.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 5 is the same amendment, which is, in page 7, line 6, to delete &ldquo;A notice&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;A rates bill&rdquo;, with the very same explanation.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 6 proposes, on page 7, line 11, to delete &ldquo;in a prepaid registered letter&rdquo;.  The number of rates bills served by local authorities is considerable.  It is some 5,000 to 6,000 in the case of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown Council and multiples of this in the case of Dublin City Council.  In the event that a rates bill could not be served by ordinary post, the efficiency of the current rates recovery process would be affected to a major extent.  This would result in significant delay in the recovery of rates and the need for local authorities to apply further resources for the purpose of serving rates bills upon occupiers of rated properties who have refused to accept the service of a rates bill by registered post.<\/p><p>Amendment  No. 7 is also a technical amendment to allow for a rates bill to be addressed to the owner or occupier, if the name of the liable person is not known.  Addressing a rates bill to the owner or occupier is likely to arise in only exceptional circumstances, but the existing ability of a rating authority to address a rates bill to an owner or occupier, which is in Regulation No. 42 of SI 508 of 2002, which is superseded by Regulation 28 of SI 226 of 2014, should be retained in the new Local Government (Rates) Bill 2018, notwithstanding that it is not possible to issue legal proceedings for recovery of rates without identifying the name of the occupier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019062600002#L00800","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":532,"content":"<p>I oppose amendment No. 2.

The compelling case for this change is that, if an owner rents a premises to a person who runs a business in it and the latter decides to cease trading for whatever reason, rates legislation has always operated to the effect that the latter is the person on whom the liability falls.

The Minister of State well knows that the impact on a business of a revaluation and significant increase, a situation caused by the Valuation Office not having kept pace with the process in recent years, is massive and can be very detrimental to a small business.

There is not a Member of the House, be he or she in government or anywhere else, who does not get many queries from constituents on this issue, particularly in local authority areas that have undergone the revaluation process.  The Deputy is right to point out the number of appeals and the delays in same.  We have a responsibility to ensure that commercial rates bring &euro;1.4 billion into the local authority sector.  Were that figure adjusted downward significantly, it would have serious consequences for our local government system.<\/p> <p>  It is my intention in the autumn to deal specifically with the valuation side of this process.  As practitioners, we all know that rates and valuations are two sides of the same coin.  The Commissioner of Valuation operates independently of the Government and every elected politician, local and national.  That is important, as the job the commissioner must do should be completely independent of politics.  Equally, however, the Oireachtas has a responsibility to review from time to time the legislation underpinning the valuations process.  That is why I am determined to do so in the autumn of this year.  I will not use the word \"anomalies\", but there are a number of pinch points in certain sectors of the economy, particularly in small rural communities and villages where there is only a business or two that, in effect, can often act as a social service as much as commercial operations.<\/p><p>Other arms of Government - for example, the Minister, Deputy Ring's Department and the local government section - are constantly trying to do their utmost to improve the quality of life for people in these communities throughout the country and sometimes it can seem that commercial rate provisions do not have the same interests at heart, and they do not.  There is a conflict there.  The rating system is designed to ensure a level playing field or an even system is operated across the country in the way we collect commercial rates.  Equally, with respect not only to isolated rural areas but to some of the more deprived urban centres in towns and cities across the country where smaller business premises have closed in recent years, there is a desire, politically, across all sides for those local businesses to be retained and to ensure that valuation rules or anything around them would not be a contributory factor to the closure of such business.  In the autumn of this year it is very much my intention that we would bring forward legislation on valuations.<\/p><p> To answer specifically the amendment in the name of Deputy Darragh O'Brien proposed by Deputy Cassells, the Valuation Acts provide for the revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in value due to economic factors such as business turnover, differential movements in property values or other external factors and changes in the local business environment.  The Department has been informed that the general outcome of the revaluations conducted to date by the Valuation Office is that approximately 60% of ratepayers have had their liability reduced following a revaluation and 40% have had their liability increased, which is expected to be replicated elsewhere as the national programme advances.<\/p><p> With respect to reported cases where the rates liability has increased by multiples of the original bill, the Department has been informed that while such increases may have occurred in some isolated cases, increases of this level would be a rarity.  Possible reasons for significant increases where they occur would be that the valuation of some of these properties had not been revised to take account of improvement, extensions, etc., for some considerable time or where the valuations were historically low in comparison to the general level of valuations on the valuation list.<\/p><p> Additionally, some properties may have undergone extensive refurbishment and this was not reflected in the valuation immediately before the revaluation that is now in train.  It is not the purpose of a revaluation to increase the total amount of commercial rates collected by the local authorities.  Section 56 of the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015 provides that the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government having obtained the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is obliged to make an order directing a rating authority to limit the overall amount of income it could raise through rates in the year following a revaluation to the total amount of rates liable to be paid in the previous year, plus buoyancy arising from valuations determined in the year of a revaluation of newly constructed property and adjusted for inflation as measured by the consumer price index, CPI.<\/p><p> Rate limitation orders have been made in each local authority that has undergone a revaluation to date and further orders will be made in respect of future revaluations as they arise.  Ultimately, any undue or contrived delay in achieving up to date valuations in line with current property rental values would result in unfairness in the levelling of rates.  A proposal to phase in increases in valuations over a number of years would either see the shortfall in rates income being made up by other ratepayers in the form of higher rates bills or would be absorbed by the local authorities.  In light of that, it is not my intention to accept this amendment.  <\/p><p> We will have to examine in some detail the valuations system in the fall of this year.  There is already a review of some of the exemptions that currently exist under the Valuation Acts under way, to which I would have referred in a few of my responses to parliamentary questions.  We, as an Oireachtas, should ensure we have legislation in place to take on board that review.  I believe we can do that in the fall of this year.  It need not necessarily be major legislation but it could deal some of the issues Deputy Darragh O'Brien's amendment seeks to address, which is to avoid a situation where there can be severe increases on individuals.  Sometimes there can be a significant delay in the hearing of appeals and the process of revaluation is a little slower than we would like.  In that proposed legislation we should be able to address some of those concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019062600002#M02200","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":559,"content":"<p>I will briefly speak to the amendment.

While the Minister of State mentioned that properties could have had improvements carried out and extensions added, the critical factor is that a revaluation had not been carried out in Wicklow during the past 30 years.  The fundamental problem is that revaluations do not take place often enough.  I have been contacted by owners of several properties facing a 300% to 400% increase in their rates liability for no reason other than they are located on a street that has seen much improvement in that period while they have not made any improvements to their properties.  It is hard for a small business to take that hit and to be asked to do so in one year.  This amendment seeks to harmonise that liability over a period of time.  In the absence of the legislation the Minister of State proposes to the Valuation Office, a harmonisation measure such as that proposed in the amendment is required.  I speak from my experience in Wicklow when we had to harmonise the town council rate with the local authority rates and we had a similar situation with properties decreasing in value and other properties increasing in value.  Therefore, it is possible to harmonise rates over a period of time when we can examine the figure with which we are dealing at the end of the day.  I went into family businesses that were on their knees when they got their revaluations.  It is not acceptable to say there is nothing in place to assist small businesses to deal with the shock of the impact of a revaluation that is not of their own making.  This is the State&rsquo;s fault.  It does not have a proper revaluation system.  It was nearly 40 years since Wicklow had a revaluation carried out.  My business suffered a 100% increase as result of its revaluation.  We had not had a revaluation in more than 20 years.  We, as a party, will be pushing this amendment.

Meath had a revaluation this year, as had Wicklow, and Westmeath and Longford had revaluations last year.  I kept all the local newspapers from that period.  Individual businesses had significant increases and they were certainly not rarities.  If the Minister of State has been told they were rarities he has been wrongly advised.

I understand the Commissioner of Valuation engaged in a process with vintners groups whereby some of those difficulties were ironed out or an agreement was reached that was more acceptable to the vintners.  Following a number of requests to the Commissioner of Valuation in recent months, he indicated regarding the fuel retail sector that consultation and engagement were ongoing between the Valuation Office and the representative group of the fuel retail sector, the Irish Petrol Retailers Association, IPRA.  The commissioner has agreed to consider adjustments to the valuation scheme for service stations, including changes that would result in reductions in valuations based on detailed evidence to be provided by the IPRA.  That process is under way.<\/p> <p>  More broadly, the Valuation Office engages in ongoing consultation with other sectoral groups on the methodology used in the revaluation programme.  In that context, the commissioner has committed to fully examining any additional detailed information provided by sporting or equestrian bodies.  A number of Members of both Houses were made aware of issues among sporting and equestrian bodies caused by significant increases arising from the revaluation process.  The Commissioner of Valuation has indicated that in sectors where significant community and voluntary services are provided along with commercial activities, he is open to considering adjustments to the valuation scheme, including changes that would result in reductions in valuations based on detailed evidence to be provided by the sectoral representative bodies.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the Commissioner of Valuation's engagement with the vintners' representatives, service station representative groups and sporting bodies to try to iron out some of the significant issues that have emerged in the revaluation process.  I always felt that it was crazy that voluntary bodies were levied with commercial rates when certain exemptions from rates are provided under the valuation legislation for activities which, on the face of it, appear to be commercial in nature.  To return to my earlier point, that is the reason we will need legislation on valuation in the autumn.  The commissioner's engagement has the potential to deal with some of the issues raised in the amendment.<\/p> <p>  I reiterate that a full review of staffing is under way to identify additional numbers that may be needed to ensure the revaluation process is speeded up.  Deputy Casey is correct.  I do not know the exact figure for Wicklow but it could well be 30 or 40 years since the previous revaluation in the county.  The target is to try to have a revaluation process approximately every seven years.

I understand the motivation behind it, but the budgetary process that a local authority undergoes takes place in a tight time period.  It is also the case that, where local elected representatives are given a mandate to make decisions, they often complain - I receive such complaints - that their hands are tied too much on issues.  They have a free hand in how they operate and vote and in the decisions they take in the formation of budgets.<\/p><p>Under the legislation governing rates currently, a local authority may provide up to 100% relief on rates where a premises is vacant due to renovation, repairs or the owner being unable to find a tenant.  Outside the city councils of Dublin, Cork and Limerick, which historically had separate legal provisions enabling a refund of 50% on vacant properties, the practice has generally been for elected members to give 100% relief.  The introduction of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 gave discretion to the elected members of an authority to vary the rate refund levels applicable to individual areas within the authority's administrative area.  The lack of any charge on vacant premises may act as a disincentive for the property to be put to its best use.  Vacancy refunds also introduce a level of uncertainty regarding the revenue that a local authority can collect.<\/p><p>Section 8 provides that a local authority may provide for a temporary abatement for vacant properties subject to any maximum relief, which may be specified by the Minister, to ensure that all property owners other than those whose rates liability would be below the <i>de minimis <\/i>threshold may make some level of payment to the local authority.  The section allows the Minister to prescribe that the maximum level of relief can be further reduced by individual local authorities.  To incentivise the elected members, it is proposed that the revenue accruing from further reduction in the vacancy refund beyond this level would be added to the general allocations of the municipal districts in the local authorities.<\/p><p>A public consultation provision as envisaged by the amendment would be similar to the one in place in advance of the annual setting by a local authority of the local adjustment factor in respect of the LPT.  The public consultation on the LPT adjustment factor enhances the strength of the relationship between local authorities and local electorates.  I accept that public consultation during the development of a scheme for the abatement of rates on vacant properties can similarly strengthen the process, but the amendment as drafted inserts a new regulation-making power for the Minister under the proposed section 8(13).  Section 8(3) provides regulation-making power for the Minister for the purposes of this section and it would appear that this amendment would be more properly located in that subsection.  I am happy to accept the thinking behind the amendment, but it should be redrafted for insertion into section 8(3) on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019062600002#P00700","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":576,"content":"<p>Notwithstanding the Minister of State's comments, the amendment is eminently sensible.  There are pros and cons to an abatement decision.<\/p><p>One of the pros is the benefit to the local businesses or the ratepayers but one of the negatives is the potential loss of revenue to the local authority and the resultant impact.  Having a consultation process would allow some of those issues to be teased out.  When I was on South Dublin County Council we found a way to have an abatement, effectively, even though that was not what it was called.  We operated a kind of survey for small and medium-sized businesses and that worked well.  We found, however, that the level of take-up from small and medium-sized businesses was low.  It was difficult for us to get the injection of cash back out to those small and medium-sized enterprises.  If we had public consultation that might have increased the take-up in the first and second years.  It was not a great deal of money for some businesses but it was certainly better than nothing.  I am, therefore, minded to support this amendment or one from officials that might be better drafted.

It seeks to make regulations regarding an inability to pay clause for rateable premises.  In our earlier discussions the Minister of State spoke about the money being brought in from rates as amounting to &euro;1.5 billion.  That is funding 34% of the total local government budget.  It is a significant amount of money and that has increased by some 14% over the last decade alone.  I have consistently stated, in the Chamber and different committees, my fear that that money from rates is becoming a significant crutch for local authorities in how they source their funding.  In that context, every year the Minister requests the councils to show restraint regarding increases, apply that restraint and ensure that they are fair on businesses.  Some councils, however, in seeking to do imaginative works beyond the norm, will seek the only source of funding available and that is rates.  As a result some people are unable to pay the rates and this is at a time when we are trying to promote local businesses outside of the main city centres.  We have seen the impact on small towns and villages throughout Ireland.  Anyone canvassing during the local and European elections would have seen that major impact.  <\/p><p>The Minister of State mentioned earlier what the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, is trying to do.  The nuts and bolts of the situation, however, are that people do not have the cash to open their businesses because of debts and that is killing town centres.  Certain towns are doing well and powering along but there are also many that are not.  The imbalance and disparity between the bigger and the smaller ones is growing.  In that context, this inability to pay clause should be inserted into the Bill.  I pay tribute to directors of finances throughout the country who are trying, on an <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis, to work with premises experiencing difficulties.  There are councils, chief executives and directors of finance trying their best to ensure that those experiencing difficulties are given a fair shake.  We should put those efforts on a statutory footing and acknowledge the impact.  An inability to pay clause should be inserted into the Bill.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019062600002#Q01300","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":590,"content":"<p>I argue, in a sense, that the provisions in this legislation will allow for those discussions.  The inability to pay clause is, effectively, being inserted into the Bill, albeit by a different mechanism, to some extent where a ratepayer has entered into an agreed payment plan.  The provisions under section 11 of the Bill are based on the provisions of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which provide for the addition of interest to unpaid taxes to the Revenue Commissioners and in this respect aims to see rates treated on a similar basis.  This measure is proposed as a further incentive to promote compliance with the payment of rates.  There is no current legal provision for the imposition of a penalty for the late payment of rates.<\/p> <p>  The non-availability of a sanction, such as the charging of interest on late payments of rates, is regarded by rating authorities as a major weakness in rating law.  It is considered that the charging of interest on the late payments of rates would be an effective method of accelerating collection within the current year and improving cash flow.  The interest would accrue from 1 January of the following year and would only apply where a ratepayer refuses to enter into an agreed payment plan with the local authority.  As such the introduction of interest on unpaid rates is focussed on incentivising engagement with the local authority rather than increasing the income of local authorities.  <\/p> <p>  Local authorities have a long-standing record, as the Deputy has outlined, of working closely with businesses experiencing difficulty in the payment of commercial rates.  I reiterate that one of the main provisions in this legislation is that the penalty will only apply where people do not enter into that agreed payment plan with local authorities.  Generally speaking, local authority officials do use discretion with regard to genuine cases of people and businesses with an inability to pay.  I have reservations about the creation of a statutory position whereby an inability to pay is put on the books in the manner proposed by this particular amendment.  The current level of discretion should continue to be operated by the council officials.  That is particularly the case in respect of agreements reached with businesses that may be in difficulty but that have agreed a plan to pay their commercial rates over a period of time.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019062600002#Q01400","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":591,"content":"<p>The last few comments by the Minister of State give us the essence of this matter.  I agree that in many cases chief executives and directors of finance are showing that discretion around the country.  It is not always the case, however.  In my own county we have a chief executive who is a former head of finance and our head of finance works closely in that regard as well.  That works well but it is not the experience nationwide, however.  This process needs to be established on a formal footing.  That is because, outside of the greater Dublin area which is experiencing growth and doing well, there is whole different area that needs to be examined.  Putting this process on a statutory footing would focus the mind regarding the severe pressures that some people are under.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019062600002#Q01500","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":592,"content":"<p>Is the amendment being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019062600002#Q01600","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":593,"content":"<p>Yes, it is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019062600002#Q01700","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":594,"content":"<p>I will make two brief comments.  I have sympathy with the intent of the amendment but I do not support the mechanism by which this is being done.  We must keep in mind that any such exemption could potentially have a significant impact on the revenue coming into a local authority or, more important, it could have a significant impact on local authorities during an economic downturn for example.  Part of the difficulty with our rates system is that its value is that it gives local authorities a consistent source of revenue regardless of the economic cycle.  The difficulty is that that creates a challenge for businesses.<\/p> <p>  Nobody has yet found a way to marry those two things, though many people have tried.  I would prefer a mechanism whereby local authorities at particular times could use the abatement process to make democratic decisions about particular problems in particular sectors or locations and they can do that in the full knowledge of the revenue consequences for them.  I would prefer that they have some mechanism to do that.  It would then be possible, at least, to make those local decisions.  I would worry that, even with the best will in the world, if the Minister were to make such regulations it might not be possible to apply them sensibly in each local authority area.<\/p><p>I get the Deputy&rsquo;s intention but I do not think his amendment solves this particular problem.  During the depth of the recession, local rates officers and managers in a significant number of local authorities took pragmatic decisions to keep businesses alive.  They were in fact beaten up by some politicians in this House because rates collection levels fell significantly.  Deputy Cassells is correct, however, that this did not happen everywhere.  Anything which potentially reduces the revenue of a local authority without it having some control over it, particularly its elected members, is a matter we should caution against.

proposed: \"That the Title be the Title to the Bill.\"<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":621,"content":"<p>I am proposing to bring forward additional amendments through this Bill to the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 and Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019.  The changes relating to the recently enacted section 37 of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 are primarily technical but also to close off a potential means of circumventing the application of aspects of the 2004 Act, such as registration, dispute resolution and rent increase restrictions in rent pressure zones to student-specific accommodation occupied under licence.  Technical amendments are also proposed to clarify that the student-specific accommodation provisions and the provisions requiring annual registration can come into force separately.  The student-specific accommodation provisions are intended to commence in mid-July, prior to the late commencement of the provisions requiring annual registration that are expected to commence in the first quarter of 2020.  That explains the urgency to address this issue before the summer recess.<\/p><p>The 2019 Act also amended section 19 of the 2004 Act to specify the types of substantial refurbishment works warranting a higher rent level which could qualify for exemption from the rent increase restrictions that operate in rent pressure zones as protected structures are unable to qualify for exemptions on the basis of works to approving their building energy renting.  It is proposed to further amend section 19(5A) of the 2004 Act to allow the first rent set under the tenancy of the protected structure dwelling not rented in the previous 12 months to be the market rent.<\/p><p>It is also proposed to make a small technical amendment for consistency in the wording of section 3(1) of the 2004 Act by replacing &ldquo;include&rdquo; with &ldquo;applied to&rdquo;.<\/p><p>I also intend to bring forward amendments to the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2018 at the next Stage with amendment to section 31A and consequential amendments to sections 31AQ and 31AR of the regional spatial and economic strategies.  This is a time-critical amendment which arises in the context of the establishment of the new Office of the Planning Regulator on 23 April 2019.  Section 31A of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, provides for ministerial directions regarding regional spatial and economic strategies.  As currently enacted, section 31A provides only that the Minister can issue a direction on foot of a recommendation made to him or her by the Office of the Planning Regulator.  This cannot be satisfied in the three regional spatial and economic strategy processes currently under way, given that each commenced prior to the establishment of the Office of the Planning Regulator.  This amendment provides for transitional arrangements to ensure the Minister has a robust legal basis to issue a direction to a regional assembly, if necessary.  The proposed amendments will apply only in respect of the three current regional spatial and economic strategies which commenced prior to the establishment of the Office of the Planning Regulator.  Section 31A, and related sections 31AQ and 31AR, will remain valid in the cases of the regional spatial and economic strategies made in the future.<\/p><p>I also want to flag a further minor technical amendment that is proposed to section 11(1)(<i>b<\/i>) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 to 2018.  Section 11(1)(<i>a<\/i>) requires a planning authority to give notice of its intention to review its existing development plan not later than four years after it is made and to prepare a new development for its area.  Sections 11(1)(<i>aa<\/i>) and 11(1)(<i>ab<\/i>) allow for an alternate notification period for Cork City and County Councils whereby they may extend the notification period to review their existing development plan from four years to a maximum of five years by way of ministerial order.  This is to facilitate the significant workload and range of complex issues arising from the revisions to the local government arrangements in Cork.  However, the special provisions of Cork City and County Councils were not included in section 11(1)(<i>b<\/i>) for the purposes of enabling the incorporation of the national planning framework and the regional spatial economic strategy into the development plan.<\/p><p>For legal certainty, this technical amendment inserts the special provisions for Cork in paragraphs <i>(aa)<\/i>and <i>(ab)<\/i>and section 11, subsection (1)<i>(b)<\/i>(i), (ii) and (iii).  This ensures consistency in section 11(1)<i>(a)<\/i>and section 11(1)<i>(b)<\/i>provisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019062600002#R02700","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":623,"content":"<p>Are there any comments for the Minister of State?
