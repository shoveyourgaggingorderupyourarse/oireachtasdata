At yesterday's with committee meeting with Eir, it was stated that the UL academics who attended the previous meeting may have said that the standard of Eir's fibre cable was not of the same standard as the fibre that would be overlaid by the preferred bidder in the 300,000 premises exclusion zone.  The UL academics did not state that Eir's fibre was inferior to National Broadband Ireland, NBI's, fibre at any stage.<\/p><p>We will proceed with today's meeting on the national broadband plan and I welcome Mr. Denis O'Leary, head of strategy and innovation, and Mr. Michael Mahon, former national broadband plan, NBP, project manager, from the ESB to discuss the national broadband plan.<\/p><p>Before we begin I wish to draw attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.

There was a southern ring which covered most of south Leinster and much of south Munster.  That was a backhaul network, which basically means it was similar to a motorway network, and all the major retail companies Eir, Enet, Virgin and BT were customers of that network since 2003.<\/p> <p>  A diagram in the submission shows the lower voltage system - the 40,000 or 38,000 volt system.  We have approximately 700 stations all over the country.  One can take it that any town in Ireland with a population greater than 3,000 to 4,000 people has one of those stations.  Another diagram represents the medium voltage system - the 10,000 to 20,000 volt system, which ultimately brings electricity to every home in the country.  We have approximately 90,000 km of that network.<\/p> <p>  We had this idea that as well as being the provider of the backhaul network utilising the electricity network on a larger scale gave us greater commercial opportunities in the telecoms business.  We looked at it in a lot more detail in 2014 because the European Union had produced the digital agenda for Europe.  It was the first time that the whole issue of the replacement of the historical copper networks had been addressed in terms of a new type of high-speed broadband network and what would be required in the more modern economies to deliver both the uptake and the download speeds that both residential customers as well as commercial and industrial customers would work with into the future.  Ireland at that time was lagging behind the European average in terms of the take-up rates, the availability and the speeds available to customers in Ireland at that time.  We decided there was an opportunity there but we had to make a decision as a company as to what level we would get involved in this business.  On the one hand, we could simply lease out the electricity network to a telecoms operator while on the other we could do end to end and do the infrastructure, the wholesale, and the retail.<\/p> <p>  We discounted both of those extremes and landed in a position that we would become an infrastructure company through a joint venture with another telecoms company.  The reason was we did not have real experience in the mass telecoms market, nor did we know enough about telecoms pricing or about the telecoms industry, as such.  At that point, we went into a very extensive procurement process that lasted more than 12 months.  At the end of it, Vodafone was the preferred candidate and it joined up with ESB to form this new company called SIRO.  The structure of SIRO is that there is a joint venture agreement between the two main shareholders, ESB and Vodafone.  SIRO has a separate agreement with ESB Networks called the network access agreement which contain the terms and conditions by which SIRO must abide in order to access the electricity network to string the fibre on the network.<\/p> <p>  That company was set up in 2016 and is functioning at fairly optimum speed since mid-2016 or the start of 2017.  Since then it has passed nearly 250,000 homes with broadband network, or 242,000 homes to be exact.  We have connected more than 42,000 customers.  The target for this phase of the business plan for SIRO, being funded by both shareholders, is to pass 450,000 homes.  This represents an investment of not far off &euro;500 million in the telecoms infrastructure business in Ireland.  We were the first retailer to offer a 500 Mbps and a gigabit service to the residential sector.  We considered the company to be best in class in service delivery and there are nearly 14 retailers operating on the SIRO networks at this time.  It has been a tremendous success.<\/p> <p>  The phase one concentrated on the 50 towns outside the main cities, particularly outside Dublin.  Once that is completed, the shareholders will discuss the options for a phase two.  To date, the business has been very successful and has met the key metrics set in terms of a formal business plan.<\/p> <p>  There was then talk of a national broadband plan.  I have provided a diagram of Ireland and members can see the comparators.  What is in blue in the diagram is what is not in the intervention area.  The areas and premises in the intervention area are coloured light brown and orange.  Those 757,000 homes are in the two coloured areas.<\/p><p>The different colours represent the fact that initially there were to be two lots.  If we compare SIRO's challenge with the challenge of developing and rolling out a national broadband plan, SIRO's plan was to cover 450,000 homes, while the national broadband plan, NBP, was to cover 757,000 homes.  SIRO intended to roll out about 1,300 km of fibre, while the NBP plan, based on our technical design, would have required nearly 77,000 km of fibre.  That is an extraordinary structural, engineering and project management challenge.  The amount underground was minuscule in the NBP.  The reason for the State putting a national broadband plan in place was that it would not be commercial for any of the key operators to go into these rural locations and roll out fibre in the hope the customer take-up and revenue from it would generate an adequate return from the investment over 20 or 25 years.  Some stimulus was needed.  To do it in the way we were going to do the technical design would have involved very close to 600 mini-exchanges throughout the country.  They would have been based in our 38Kv sub-stations and medium voltage sub-stations.  That was the level of network design required to ensure the required broadband speeds set down by the Department in the tender documents could be met for every single household on the island.  That would have required an extensive amount of fibre in the intervention area.  <\/p><p> SIRO was formed in 2014.  From mid-2014 to 2015 there was a lot of discussion with the Department on the strategy and mapping for the NBP.  Much of it was about technical issues, the number of houses and the accuracy of the mapping in the intervention area.  In mid-2015 there was a draft strategy and in December 2015 the Department published the revised strategy and the updated map and commenced the procurement process.  At the time most of the emphasis was on the technical and mapping side and not much on the commercial contract.  In quarters 1 and 2 of 2016 we prepared a detailed pre-qualification submission to show that we had the financial support of our parents and the ability to build, operate and manage large-scale networks.<\/p><p> In June 2016 the Department pre-qualified the bidders and progressed to the formal procurement process.  That was the first time we got sight of the commercial contract and its conditions.  In December 2016 the Department advised bidders that there could be 300,000 premises removed from the contract owing to a commitment by Eir that it would do these premises on a commercial basis and that there would be no need for any subvention or State funding for them.  That had an impact on the business case on which we had been working from a technical point of view and from the point of view of the potential revenues that could have been generated from the original subvention area to what would be a revised subvention area, minus the 300,000 homes.  Nevertheless, we asked for additional time from the Department to redo the technical design because we had to go back and start from scratch.  I can explain later the impact of the 300,000 figure on the business case.  As we progressed, following the withdrawal of the 300,000 premises and with certain challenges in the construct of the commercial contract associated with the NBP, we met the Department on several occasions.  In September 2017, following more urgent meetings, we asked it specifically to consider certain requests that would have made the possibility of presenting a commercial business case less challenging than it was.  While it did move on some issues and tried to help us on others, at the end it was not enough.  Following two years of fairly intensive involvement by a not insignificant number of staff and outside help in the ESB, a decision was taken by both shareholders in SIRO that it would not fit with what they had hoped for and in September 2017 we advised the Department that we were formally withdrawing from the process.<\/p><p> The commercial challenges associated with a significant infrastructural job such as a national broadband plan can be broken down into four parts.  Above the line are the costs, the cost to build the network.  It is very extensive.  I was reminded at the start by one of the guys working on the project that the length of fibre required to serve all homes in rural Ireland, 80,000 km, is roughly twice around the world, but it is a one-off cost that has to be managed.  The second part is the day to day cost of managing that level of telecommunications equipment, managing the maintenance of the equipment, all fault repairs, the information technology, IT, systems and the billing systems.  To match it, there is the amount of revenue from each customer and, most critically, the number of customers who will connect to the system.  There was a point when the number of customers was in the region of 800,000 when we would have been quite positive about the business, but when the 300,000 premises were removed, it had a very serious impact on the potential and projected revenues over the ten, 20 or 30 years of the project.  That is what made it really challenging.  <\/p><p> The key issues that forced SIRO and its shareholders to withdraw from the NBP process approximately two years ago were the removal of the 300,000 premises, the risk apportionment within the structure of the contract, the financial viability of the contract simply owing to the risk apportionment within it, issues with the use of alternate networks, an issue we can discuss, and the rebalancing risk.  When we entered the project in 2015, we entered with high expectations and in very good faith.  We put together a really good team of people to get into a level of detail on the project by which many at senior level in the ESB and Vodafone were astounded.  Mr. Mahon and his team did that work.  The reduction of the intervention area by 300,000 premises had a material impact on the project.  Throughout 2017 we were really challenged as a business to make a business plan that would meet the financial criteria set by both shareholders.  In quarter 3, following significant engagement with the Department, we were left with no choice but to withdraw from the NBP.  The ESB has since moved on.  It has been two years since anybody in the ESB or Vodafone has worked on the national broadband plan.  It is amazing what happens within two years.  In the ESB our focus is on delivery of our Brighter Future strategy in working with and supporting the Government in the implementation of its recently announced climate action plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019062600002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis O'Leary","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Leary.

We have a connection and probably a piece of equipment in most fields throughout the country.  Eir has a similar national infrastructure except that it is predominantly along the roadside.  Fibre can be run on the ESB electricity infrastructure.  Before we signed the joint venture with SIRO and allowed it to roll out fibre on the ESB infrastructure, we carried out intensive testing on the fibre network at our main test centre in Portlaoise.  We also built test facilities in different parts of the country and tested the network under the most extreme conditions in the context of storm loading, wind loading and ice loading.  We then developed a set of criteria and standards that would have to apply and would be applied by the local ESB networks management team to any company that wanted to run fibre on the ESB infrastructure, namely, SIRO.  We are confident about the ability of the electricity infrastructure to hold the fibre network if the standards are applied without any risk to the key purpose of the electricity infrastructure, which is the delivery of a reliable supply of electricity to all customers.  The latter is the one thing we would not want to undermine in any way.  We have done that work and are confident about it.  It is not easy running fibre on the electricity network because there is energy on the infrastructure.  In the vast majority of cases, the network must be disconnected and earthed before any work can be allowed in order to string the fibre.  It can be done and it is possible to do it if due regard is had to the electricity infrastructure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019062600002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis O'Leary"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Is it correct that if repair work were being done on the broadband fibre, there might have to be an electricity outage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019062600002#E00500","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561503600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Not necessarily but it might have to happen.

He is well aware of what Eir has stated about it being cumbersome, complex and difficult.  Let us go back two years to when Mr. O'Leary was in the thick of it.  If he was asked, in a relatively simplistic way, to say how he would deliver high-speed broadband - commensurate with what he was doing in the SIRO areas - to the 540,000 homes, would he have done it in the same way as that proposed in the context of the NBP process?<\/p><p>Yesterday, Eir told us that it has connected 300,000 homes to high-speed broadband in what it refers to as the 300k intervention area.

There is a significant focus on decarbonising the energy sector and on the electrification of transport and heat.  We find ourselves at the centre of the key deliverables that have to be managed in the State over the next 20 to 30 years.

Members of the public are entitled to know exactly what was going on behind the scenes.  There is a feeling that there was some sort of preference for the Granahan McCourt approach.  It was so influential that it persuaded the Government to potentially award it a contract when it does not own any fibre or a single pole.  That is extraordinary.  We have a semi-State company with a proven track record which has accounts in every house in Ireland.  It would be simple to extend the accounting system to fibre.  It would be within ESB's ability to do that.  When I was in the Department of Industry and Commerce, I was in Kuala Lumpur with ESB International.  The ESB went to Malaysia and the Middle East and secured fantastic contracts, employing over 750 people who were top technicians.  I was very impressed by the ESB's work there.  It implemented an account system in Malaysia for its government, yet here, in the ESB's own country, as a semi-State company, it could not come to some terms to ensure that it secured a contract as lucrative as the roll-out of broadband.  In the end, if the ESB made money from it, the dividend would come back to the State.  From my perspective, it was a win-win scenario.  The current proposal, costing up to &euro;3 billion, is a lose-lose scenario because Granahan McCourt will own all the infrastructure in 25 years and the State will not own anything.  We do not know the cost per individual or the cost of the subsidy.  I am lucky that I have privilege here, which is brilliant.  I have far more faith in the ESB to do a job on behalf of the State than I would have in American venture capitalists coming in to do it.  I do not know how Granahan McCourt will install the wires without working with the ESB or Eir.  It has no physical structure.  Why would the ESB walk away in September 2017, even when it is making substantial investments and making money all over the world?  That decision surprises me and I cannot understand it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019062600002#J00600","speaker":"1393"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561503600,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I cannot comment on the bids of Granahan McCourt or Eir.

As I said earlier, I am not suggesting that there was anything wrong in what Eir did.  It was perfectly entitled to do it but it had a dramatic impact on the potential revenues for the business.  That, with some other issues in the contract, meant that the shareholders of the ESB and Vodafone were no longer willing to continue to fund the team that was putting together the bid.

I thank the delegation as this has been a very clear-headed and lucid presentation that has gone a long way towards helping my understanding of the matter, and particularly the timelines.  It was a very good idea to give us the timelines in respect of the company's involvement with the national broadband plan.  There is a very clear message from the witnesses that it was two years ago and they are talking about the future.  It is a very unambiguous message.<\/p> <p>  Having said that, I might detain the witnesses a while longer to help my understanding of the engagement with the Department up to the point in September 2017 when SIRO withdrew from the process.  I am trying to imagine myself in the room where SIRO is engaging with the Department after the mapping exercise has been done and there is a revised intervention area.  How did it come about that the company decided it was out and finished with the process?  Is it because, as the witnesses stated earlier, the revenue reduction was such that it would just make it untenable?  Was there any profit or return on investment where it could be said that even with the 542,000 premises in the amber area, the company could still persevere with the process?  I may not be putting it across very clearly but what would it have taken for SIRO to have stayed in the game?  That is the kernel of my question.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Leary has stated \"it would also have led to a much bigger reduction in revenue and thus our overall potential target revenues were significantly reduced also\".  He also outlined the Mitchelstown example, which is fairly close to home for me, and the doughnut effect.  At what point did the company say \"that is it, we are gone\".  There was engagement and the witnesses have said it was a positive engagement with the Department.  The company had just seen 300,000 connections being taken up by another entity so what would it have made this commercially viable for the company?  I still cannot fully grapple that.  Personally, I found it a pity that SIRO pulled out because of its international reputation, which was mentioned earlier, and the ability to get projects done in a very seamless and quick fashion.

Congress was asked to address the committee on the subject of Brexit and its implications in October 2017.  In my concluding remarks on that occasion, I said:<\/p><blockquote>In the world after Brexit, Ireland's foreign policy in Europe will have to undergo a re-appraisal.  Our traditional ally among the large countries will be gone and the Franco- German axis will probably be revived.  Where will Ireland sit in this new scheme of things?  Where will our allies be?<\/blockquote> <p>To misquote the 1916 Proclamation, we might have to find new gallant allies in Europe.  While I hope to address the issues raised above today, I must say first a brief word for the guidance of the committee about how trade unions structure their international work.<br\/><br\/>Traditionally, the ICTU avoided international associations until Ireland joined the EEC in 1973 and we joined the European Trade Union Confederation.  The big players in the ETUC are Germany's DGB, an informal alliance of Scandinavian unions, and the Italian unions, where the three confederations representing Christian, communist and socialist tendencies work together.  The French, with five major trade union centres, punch below their weight for that reason.  Another big player is the British TUC.  It is noticeable when one visits Brussels now that the influence of the British TUC is ebbing away even though the UK continues to be a member state.  In a new development last September, the German group of unions, the DGB, hosted a meeting in Berlin on governance within the eurozone area.  This is an echo of the increased level of Franco-German debate on a eurozone budget.  The TUC and the Scandinavian unions were not represented at that meeting.  I cannot see that meeting having taken place before the Brexit debate took off.  The issue of alternative alliances seems to be already decided, at least according to the <i>Financial Times <\/i>and <i>The Economist<\/i>.  We have joined what is termed the &quot;Hanseatic league&quot;, a loose alliance of the Netherlands, the Scandinavians and the Baltic states.  Some of these countries in turn have more enduring alliances.  Holland, Belgium and Luxemburg have worked together since before the Treaty of Rome as the alliance of Benelux countries.  Deep institutional ties exist between all the Scandinavian countries through the Nordic Union.  According to the <i>Financial Times<\/i>in November 7 2017:<\/p><blockquote>While the [Hanseatic league] countries are far from united on all EU policy issues, they share a common outlook on many economic questions, favouring dynamic competition on the single market, and stressing the need for national budgetary responsibility within the eurozone.<\/blockquote> <p>Europe is a half-way house between domestic and foreign policy.  Ireland has a radically different foreign policy from the policy positions of some other member states, including on neutrality and, to an extent, Palestine, whereas internal EU matters are really just extensions of domestic matters and are handled by the line Departments through the permanent representation in Brussels.  We work with the ETUC on lobbying matters and, through that body, on statutory committees on social dialogue, on migrant workers and vocational training.  The social policy area is one in which Brexit may cause significant change.  Up to now when discussing European proposals with Irish civil servants we would be told &quot;this proposal won't progress as the British will veto it&quot;.  That response is now obsolete.  A case in point was the process that preceded the adoption of the information and consultation directive in the mid-1990s when Ireland and the UK argued for unanimity as opposed to qualified majority voting in an attempt to veto the measure, which, thankfully, did not prevail.  Some of the new alliances we make will be custom built.  An example is France which will be our strong ally on CAP but far from an ally on the question of corporation tax.  What relationship do we want with the Visegrad group of central European countries given the number of their citizens who now live in our country?  This group has traditionally taken a very hostile attitude to progress in workers' conditions and labour law.  A case in point is a recent spat between France and Germany on the one hand and the Eastern countries on the other.  France and Germany decided to apply their minimum wage laws to trucks passing through their territory, for example travelling from Hungary to Spain.  The Commission launched infringement procedures against them.  Bizarrely, Ireland joined with the Eastern countries, Spain and Portugal in supporting the Commission's action.  How this builds our influence with France and Germany is beyond me.  The decision making process in Ireland to support this stance also remains a mystery.  This is an illustration of how things which happen in Europe are really not matters of foreign policy but of domestic policy.  However, it could have foreign policy implications in that putting a foot wrong on one issue could affect something else.<br\/><br\/>In the century since the foundation of the State, Ireland's foreign policy has fallen into two phases.  Up to the mid-1950s, it was all about regulating our relationship with Britain and protesting about partition.  This reached its high point in 1949 when Se&aacute;n MacBride offered to abandon neutrality and join NATO in exchange for an end to partition.  From the late 1950s, the emphasis moved towards Europe in tandem with Britain's move in the same direction.  We are now heading into a third phase at a time of increasing uncertainty in world politics.  As a focal scor, I notice the latest utterance from Boris Johnson is that the application of external tariffs by the EU would be the equivalent of the continental blockade of the Napoleonic wars.  I leave my remarks on that happy note.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019062600002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter Rigney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561503600,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for another opportunity to set out the views and concerns of business to the joint committee as it undertakes its work on alliance building within the European Union.  IBEC is the country's largest business organisation and represents members at national, European and international level.  Over recent years, we have been working intensely at a national and European level to support member companies as they manage the ongoing uncertainty of Brexit disruption.  More recently, we have also been working to highlight business priorities during the recent European Parliament elections as well as in the context of the election of the new Presidents of European Council and Commission and the appointment of the new college of Commissioners.  Unsurprisingly, Brexit remains a top concern.  The failure of the UK Government to ratify the withdrawal agreement has left business with the complex task and enormous cost of managing the uncertainty of shifting Brexit deadlines.  Millions of euro have already been spent putting in place, and in many cases activating, costly contingency plans.  The divisive and ongoing polarisation of the UK political debate has increased the likelihood of a no-deal outcome, driving up the cost of contingency planning further.  For the record, business fully supports the terms of the withdrawal agreement, which comprehensively address the key challenges that arise in the exit process.  From the perspective of business, customs and regulatory alignment across the island of Ireland is vital to avoid the return of a hard border, safeguard the all-island economy and protect the Good Friday Agreement.  The unique challenges facing Ireland and Irish business in the Brexit process have required us to invest enormous energy in strengthening our links and co-operation with other EU and international business groups over recent years.  It is vital that our partners in Europe fully understand the specific economic and political challenges Brexit presents to Irish business and support an outcome that comprehensively addresses them.<\/p> <p>  IBEC has had a permanent office and staff in Brussels since the 1970s and the organisation is a member of BusinessEurope, the leading advocate for growth and competitiveness at EU level.  The group brings together business federations from 35 countries and IBEC actively participates on its council of presidents, executive committee and numerous policy committees and working groups.  IBEC is also the Irish member of Business at OECD, which is based in Paris, and the International Employers Organisation, which is based in Geneva.  In addition to these horizontal business organisations, IBEC's numerous trade associations are affiliated to their respective sector associations at EU level.<\/p><p>An audit of our activities shows that over 60 of our staff are involved in approximately 200 committees and working groups in more than 65 organisations.  That is a significant commitment of time, effort and finance to building alliances across Europe. <\/p><p> Given the challenges on the horizon, we have stepped up significantly our engagement with strategic business partners in recent years.  We have travelled across Europe to meet our business partners in their cities, including Berlin, Paris, the Hague, Vienna, Prague, Copenhagen, Tallinn, Helsinki, Athens and others where Ireland does business.  The breadth and depth of our ongoing work make us among the top business federation lobbyists at EU level, alongside the key German business groups.  All of this means that IBEC has a truly unique capacity to ensure Irish concerns are understood and shape common EU-wide positions.  This has been the case when it comes to Brexit, with IBEC ensuring Irish concerns are reflected clearly and strongly in EU-wide business positions, but it is an issue that goes far beyond Brexit.  IBEC has set out in detail its priorities in the context of the future of Europe and the direction of a post-Brexit European Union.  Of course, a European Union without the United Kingdom will be very different.  Ireland and the other remaining EU member states must seize the opportunity to reinvigorate their commitment to a stronger, more prosperous European Union which will further develop the Single Market, the digital economy, international trade and enshrine pro-jobs and pro-growth conditions and a real commitment to innovation at the very heart of EU decision-making.  We are working with our partners across Europe to make this happen. <\/p><p> In its work IBEC also focuses on global issues and connections that are so important to an open globalised economy like Ireland.  In recent years IBEC delegations have visited Washington DC, New York and elsewhere to strengthen its engagement with US businesses and their representative organisations such as the US Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers and the US Council of International Business.  IBEC has also welcomed leaders from these organisations to Dublin to meet Irish business leaders.  A key part of investment and trade in Ireland is the strong relationship between not only Ireland and the United States but also the European Union and the United States.  This is something to which we continue to be committed, even in a challenging global environment.<\/p><p> Key international challenges have intensified the work of IBEC in forging strong alliances with its partners in Europe and further afield.  This is work it carries out typically in close co-operation with the Government and Ireland's international embassy network across the world which is second to none.  Of course, there is more to do.  IBEC intends to further strengthen its engagement with liked-minded EU and International business groups as we face the challenges ahead.<\/p><p> I thank the Vice Chairman and members for their attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019062600002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Pat Ivory","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":115,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Ivory and call on Mr. Miley from the Irish Universities Association to contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019062600002#C00200","speaker":"1393"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561503600,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for giving me the opportunity to address the committee.  We have submitted our opening statement.  I propose to touch on some of the points made in it, rather than going through it in detail.<\/p> <p>  There is a broad range of alliances across the European Union in which Irish universities are involved.  The best known are the Erasmus+ programme and the Horizon programme on the research side.  I want to reflect on both programmes, as well as speaking about the post-Brexit scenario and the broader alliance building undertaken across Europe.<\/p> <p>  The Erasmus programme has been running since 1987.  Close to 500,000 students have crossed borders in Europe to participate in the programme during the years.  In the Irish context approximately 90,000 students and staff have travelled to one of 32 countries during that time.  During the same period approximately 115,000 learners have come to Ireland, cementing Ireland's reputation as a high quality study destination, as well as laying key foundations in forging working relationships with future leaders.  As I am sure members are aware. there are many prominent political leaders across Europe who were Erasmus programme participants in Ireland in the past.<\/p> <p>  The overall impact of international students in Ireland is worth noting.  Recently we published an independent report produced by Indecon economic consultants, a copy of which has been sent to all Members of the Oireachtas.  In it Indecon shows that international students who include those who participate in the Erasmus programme are worth an aggregate &euro;387 million a year in export earnings to the economy.  It has become a very significant economic driver for the economy, apart from the intrinsic education value that comes from it.  It is worth noting that European Commission data show that 40% or more of Erasmus trainees are offered a position by the company in which they train.  In addition, the unemployment rate among young graduates who participated in the Erasmus programme is 23% lower than that among their non-mobile peers.  The value of international travel, both inward and outward, is unquestionable.<\/p> <p>  The outgoing European Parliament confirmed that funds for the next Erasmus programme should be tripled to allow more young people take part in the different learning mobility schemes.  Obviously, it will be subject to the next European Parliament agreeing the fine print of the proposal, but it is an indication of the ambition for the programme.  <\/p> <p>  For the IUA, the emphasis is not just on the numbers who travel but also on who travels.  In particular, there is and will be emphasis in the next Erasmus programme on broadening access to it.  Major success has been generated in Irish universities in broadening access across social strata.  Currently, in Irish universities one out of four new entrants is coming through dedicated special access programmes, either through HEAR, higher education access route, that targets socio-economic disadvantage or DARE, disability access route to education, or other special access programmes.  These students are under-represented when it comes to participation in the international Erasmus programme.  We propose that the Government prioritise and incentivise in order that more of these access students can participate in and avail of the Erasmus programme.<\/p> <p>  It is worth noting that the Minister of State with responsibility for higher education, Deputy Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor, who launched the report, Enhancing Mobility for Access Students Ireland, called for national targets to be introduced for the mobility of non-traditional students such as mature students, student with disabilities and so on.  We strongly support her in that regard.  The IUA launched a charter for Irish universities last year in which the seven universities represented by the IUA committed to enabling 20% of students to undertake study or a placement abroad.  That would represent a significant increase.  We also wish to increase the number of international students to 15% of the total student population.  The successes of the Erasmus programme and the benefits to both the economy and the students were recognised and we should focus on expanding them.<\/p> <p>  I move to research and innovation, or the Horizon agenda.  As members are probably aware, the first Horizon programme, FP7, ran from 2007 to 2013.  The Irish drawdown from the programme was &euro;625 million.  The current programme will run out next year.  The target drawdown is &euro;1.2 billion.  The drawdown is just over &euro;700 million, but there is an upward trend.<\/p><p>The seven universities we represent have drawn down 55% of that drawdown of &euro;700 million.  The crucial emphasis needs to be on the next Horizon Europe programme which will run from 2021 to 2027.  We think it will present significant opportunities for Irish industry and the third level sector in this country.  We emphasise that our capacity to draw down more EU funding cannot be optimised unless more funding is provided from domestic budgets.  In our budget submission we are asking for an additional &euro;50 million in domestic money to be provided each year.  This money should be targeted specifically at investigator-led research.  A number of our best scientists are not getting any funding from the Government.  This is inhibiting their capacity to draw down EU funding.  If one does not have other sources of funding, one cannot qualify for Horizon Europe funding.  The provision of domestic funding is a particularly important priority for the economy as we seek to build our innovation capacity for the future.<\/p><p> As other speakers outlined, Brexit presents challenges and opportunities in all sectors.  The third level sector is no different.  There is a long-standing positive relationship between Irish and UK universities.  The United Kingdom is our biggest partner in this sector.  That is to be expected, given that it is our closest neighbour.  Almost 10,000 Irish students are studying in the United Kingdom.  Their terms and conditions, including their fees, have been guaranteed in the short to medium term as a result of the work of the Irish and British Governments.  There are real opportunities and substantial risks, depending on the outcome of Brexit.  One such risk will arise if the fee structure is changed substantially on either side of the relationship.  As Deputy Durkan will be aware, the 10,000-strong Irish student body in the United Kingdom is almost as large as the total enrolment at Maynooth University.  An intolerable strain will be placed on the third level system which is already under pressure if it has to absorb some of these 10,000 students.  In the post-Brexit scenario we are emphasising the strengthening of our existing ties with other European partners, while continuing to manage our relationship with our closest neighbour.  Regardless of Brexit, it is of great importance for our system that our relationship with our UK partners be maintained.<\/p><p> On broader alliance building, it is worth noting that the results of the European universities initiative were announced a couple of hours ago.  Members of the joint committee will recall that President Macron inspired this initiative which seeks to build formal alliances among universities across borders.  Approximately 20 consortia have been announced as successful bidders under the initiative.  I am pleased to inform the committee that two Irish universities - Dublin City University and Trinity College Dublin, both of which are members of our association - have succeeded in winning funding under the programme as part of their respective alliances.  Between &euro;5 million and &euro;6 million is being provided for each alliance as part of the pilot phase of the programme.  If the programme which comes specifically under the Erasmus programme is successful, it is intended that the alliances will be strengthened and that more will be built in the future.  This links with what I said about the future of Horizon Europe and the Erasmus programme.  It is a significant achievement for two Irish universities to be included in the first phase.<\/p><p> Ireland could take a lead in European co-operation in the areas of higher education, research and innovation.  The building of alliances is not limited to governments and parliamentary relationships.  As I have shown, universities have a pivotal role to play.  If we are engage effectively with our European partners in a way that will enable us to realise our ambitions, the gap in State funding for higher education must be addressed.  In the last decade the amount of money provided in direct State grants across the system - all third level institutions, not just universities - has decreased from approximately &euro;9,000 per student to just over &euro;5,000 per student.  We need an investment programme to begin to close that gap and ensure the system will be in a position to avail of the alliance opportunities that will arise in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019062600002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Miley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I commend the work being done by ICTU, IBEC and Mr. Miley's organisation.  The work they are doing with our permanent staff in Brussels is absolutely vital.  This is a major change.  The influence of the unions, business representatives and universities as they work together on behalf of Ireland is very important.  They receive excellent co-operation from the permanent representatives in Brussels.<\/p> <p>  A delegation from the committee has just returned from a COSAC meeting in Romania.  I mention this to bring the delegates up to speed on the Erasmus programme.  An amendment proposed at the meeting would have affected the future expansion of the programme.  Many of the members of this committee are keen to ensure it will not be confined to university graduates.  Like many others, my daughter has availed of the Erasmus programme which embraces all 28 countries.  Erasmus and the Common Agricultural Policy are two of the best programmes to have been introduced by the European Union.  I understands Britain intends to pay to remain in the Erasmus programme in the short term.  It has been proposed that the programme be expanded to allow apprentices from here to travel elsewhere in Europe to learn new technologies in areas such as wind energy and solar panels.  The amendment proposed yesterday would have meant that governments would be responsible for the expansion of the Erasmus programme.  We did not agree with that amendment.  My colleagues went back and said Erasmus must continue to be an EU programme and funded as an EU programme.  It has been mentioned that 500,000 people have participated in it since 1987, which is an enormous number.  When I was on an aeroplane yesterday, I spoke to a young doctor who had studied in Bari in Italy.  That is an example of the comings and goings under this exchange programme.  Many permanent unions and families have been formed from it.  It has been suggested to me that it would be worthwhile for somebody to research this aspect of the programme.  Perhaps the delegates have already carried out in-depth research into the effect it has had on all of Europe.  Nothing has brought it closer.  It is regrettable that the influence of students from the United Kingdom who have studied under the Erasmus programme in the past was not enough to change the minds of the people of the United Kingdom when they voted on Brexit.  I am certain that those who participated in the programme voted to remain.<\/p> <p>  I thank the delegates for their efforts and worthwhile contribution to building links between organisations throughout Europe.  I know from my experience at the Council of Ministers that representatives of the Government and Irish organisations have a large degree of influence in the European Union - our influence is above our weight - because of our style of contacts.  Long may that continue.  We will miss the United Kingdom when it leaves the European Union because it has been our ally at European level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019062600002#D00200","speaker":"1393"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":119,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests.  I congratulate and thank them for the constructive work they have done in their respective capacities during the years to meet the challenges in modern Europe.  We have all contributed to this debate and hope it will be successful, but it will not be easy.  There are new challenges and opportunities.  We must presume to take full advantage of every opportunity that comes our way because there may not be one to go back and revisit this issue again.  As the Vice Chairman said, the committee was represented at the recent COSAC meeting in Bucharest.  It is ironic that the debate there could have been anticipated.  There was a long debate on maximising employment and investment opportunities through the mediums of education and technology.<\/p><p>It was an interesting debate which went on for some time.  It is something in which my colleague has taken a particular interest.  As each day passes, new opportunities arise through education and technology.  If we focus and zoom in on these areas and avail of the opportunities that arise, we will create what we need in the future, namely, further opportunities for an expanding population.  We live in a different world from 20 years ago.  The people of Europe are a moving population; they go to where the jobs are to be found, whatever that may be.  It is very good from our perspective.  It is what generations of Irish people have done.  The jobs happened to be in the United States, the United Kingdom, elsewhere in Europe and across the globe in countries such as New Zealand and Australia.  It is great that we have arrived at a point where people want to come here to make a contribution to the economy and use their skills in technology to assist us in our quest to increase employment.<br\/><br\/>The alliances referred to are hugely important.  Corporate alliances are also important and must be made to the benefit of one side or the other.  We must remember that diverse opinions are emerging across Europe on what democracy and co-operation are about and where we are likely to be in the next 50 or 60 years.  The best thing we can do is look back over the last 50 or 60 years and at the progress made from when Europe was in ashes to when it was built to be a really strong and uniform entity.  I think back to the time when Ireland's income <i>per capita<\/i>was a fraction of that in other European countries and the United States.  It is now on a par with most.  Even in the depths of the recession, we kept in touch with it, from which there is much to be learned.  We have progressed a great deal.<br\/><br\/>I have not referred to the challenges that worry me the most.  Damage has been done to the cohesion of markets across Europe.  That is evident in the UK car industry, for instance.  There are announcements daily.  We seem to take it that they were inevitable - they were - but they are happening in anticipation of Brexit.  What worries me most is that the architects of the new Europe and particularly Brexit did not foresee these issues arising.  Nigel Farage spent 20 years undermining the European Union and when he had achieved the result for which he was looking, he disappeared into the background because he had nothing more to say.  Now he wants to come forward again to do something else.  Worse still, many of our colleagues in the United Kingdom did not seem to know what was plan B.  Exiting the European Union was one thing - allegedly it was to gain freedom, although from what I am not certain - but there has been considerable damage done across Europe.  I hope we are not returning to an earlier era as ultra-nationalism has begun to re-emerge.  It would be a disaster if that were to happen.  In recent days there have been various exchanges across Europe, as well as with our colleagues in the United Kingdom who are still at a meeting, although they did not expect to be.  They are nice guys who have made valid submissions in pleading their case.  There was no plan B, but now we are being told that it will be all right on the day, that it will be perfect and that there is no need to worry at all.  If there was no plan B, it is unlikely that there is a plan C or a plan D either.  It worries me that there could be serious consequences.  <br\/><br\/>We should not forget that the Good Friday Agreement has been a very important part of Anglo-Irish relations in recent years.  It followed a 30 year guerilla war during which the most atrocious events took place on the island of Ireland.  It now appears to be at risk.  What is the value of a modern agreement if everyone does not stand over it?  That is especially the case when it comes to an emotive agreement of that nature.  We have heard people ask what the problem is at the Border?  There are other places all over the world where there are borders.  There are, but there are few borders - they include those in the Balkans - where people are very careful not to offend the sensitivites of others and for very good reason.  The Irish position has held very well so far and has been well supported by our European colleagues.  We should recognise this and owe it to them.  However, it is also in the interests of the European Union to do so as it is not only about Ireland but also the European Union itself.  Will the European Union that we recognise and in which people have lived in peace in recent years prevail or be undermined?  Will the Good Friday Agreement prevail?  Some of the things that have been said undermine it to a great extent.  Some say they cannot change their views and that we must change ours, but that is the oldest negotiating trick in the book.  We are not the ones who opted to leave.  We did not ask to leave the European Union.  We believe we have a contribution to make to it and are doing so, even as a small country.  I strongly believe each country, whether large or small, has a contribution to make on the European platform.  It all depends on what we bring to the table.  We can either bring positivity or negativity, each of which has consequences.  There is a slogan which refers to bringing Europe closer to the people, but we must bring them closer to it, something altogether different, and maximise the extent to which people across all nations, big and small, recognise that they are European and wish to contribute to that ideal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019062600002#D00300","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":121,"content":"<p>I will address each group individually.  I welcome Dr. Rigney.  It is always good to meet someone from the ICTU which is looking after the workers of this country.<\/p> <p>  Every time I hear the word \"neutrality\" used, I challenge its use.  Ireland is not neutral, never has been and probably never will be.  If it was truly neutral, members of the Defence Forces would not have been denied a pay rise in the past six weeks.  On pay, I have had discussions with people at what I refer to as both ends of the economy.  I welcome Dr. Rigney's views on the risk that the tech industry in Ireland is slowly pricing itself out of the European market.  Large IT companies have to pay salaries in excess of &euro;100,000 to attract people with the competencies necessary to run their organisations.  They then have to spend money on accommodation for these employees in which to live.  I refer to it as buying accommodation blocks and so on.  Senior people in the sector with whom I have had conversations believe it is only a matter of time before companies exit Ireland.  They are footloose and have very little hard capital invested in the country.  They have plenty of intellectual capital, but as we know,it is highly mobile and can move at any time.  IBEC might confirm that 40% of the world's soft balance sheets are in Dublin.<\/p><p>All we need is one serious shock to any one of those companies for it to leave as fast as it came.  The only company in the IT industry that is likely to be stuck here is Intel because it has made serious capital investment on the ground.  I am interested in hearing the views of the witnesses on that issue.  I am also interested in their views on the costs of labour.  We know the costs of labour at one end but there are hundreds of workers at the other end outside hospitals all over the country today.  Is it the case that there is now a them and an us in the labour market?  If there is, I would be interested in any recommendations Mr. Rigney has in that regard in light of our future in Europe.  That is key for me.  We will have enough on our plates without dividing the workforce.  I am interested in Mr. Rigney's views on that.<br\/><br\/>It is good to meet Mr. Ivory and his colleague, Mr. Dillon, again.  We are meeting on the same subject, so I hope they will forgive me if some of my questions are in the same area because it is important that they are put on the record of this committee.  On the issue of the Border, the day before yesterday I addressed the meeting of the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs, COSAC, in Bucharest on the issue of Brexit.  In my contribution I laid out a number of priorities, the first of which was ensuring that the Single Market not be compromised under any circumstances.  From the European perspective, the Single Market is the first priority for all of us.  After that we are into such things as the Good Friday Agreement and all that comes with it.  This also cannot be compromised.  The movement of people across the Border cannot be compromised.  We could go on listing issues on which there can be no compromise and the difficulties we have with responsibilities for national infrastructure being shared, with some institutions north of the Border and some south.  I am deeply concerned that the Government has not, to date, set out its solution to the Border problem in the event of a no-deal scenario.  I am interested in IBEC's position on that.  <br\/><br\/>The last time I met Mr. Ivory we spoke about the stop-start nature of efforts with respect to Brexit.  If I am not mistaken, Mr. Dillon outlined the cost to industry of building inventory to prepare for a shock exit, after which it was told that an extension had been agreed so there was no need to keep that inventory and it could be let go.  He spoke about the cost of borrowing money to fund that inventory which, ultimately, represents a cost to the business.  There is some suggestion in discussions at COSAC and various other fora that the wider European movement may offer the UK another extension to allow it to get its house in order.  If I am not mistaken, when we last met, Mr. Dillion said the impact of this would be a serious cost to business and that this process cannot be allowed to continue stopping and starting again.  People in business need to know where they stand so that they can build solutions.  <br\/><br\/>I have two further points to make to Mr. Ivory.  Have we quantified the number of companies in Ireland that could accommodate direct sea access for the supply of goods to Ireland or the delivery of goods to the wider European market?  We are told that we can expect 9 km tailbacks of trucks at our ports.  Have we looked at the possibility of getting non-perishable goods across the seabridge and at the cost thereof?  Is it prohibitively expensive or can it be built in?<br\/><br\/>Much of what Mr. Ivory had to say related to the United States and our relationships with various companies in that country.  Why are we not looking east?  The Iranians would welcome an Irish Embassy.  We would have 80 million people to service in Iran and a wider community of 400 million could be serviced through it.  Despite this, we will not open an embassy in the country.  Why are we not doing so?  Does IBEC have an opinion on this matter?<br\/><br\/>I will move on to the third level sector.  I thank Mr. Miley for coming in.  I believe this is the first time we have met at this committee.  There was a discussion at the COSAC meeting about education driving the Single Market.  I was particularly interested by the presentation made by the president of one of the universities in Bucharest.  This presentation related to a number of issues this president saw as critical for the future.  We tend to talk about an information economy which would be driven by IT and IT solutions.  I have some reservations about concentrating excessively on that.  I would like to see equal concentration on areas such as apprenticeships.  Mr. Rigney may also like to address that issue.  One of the things that limits the ability to co-operate throughout Europe is the lack of a standard basis on which to recognise qualifications, if the witnesses follow my drift.  A BSc should have the same value regardless of where it is acquired.  There was some discussion on the issue of microcredits and about how they may be used in life-long learning to allow people to build a credible set of qualifications to allow mobility within the workforce or to allow the reskilling or upskilling of those in redundant professions or professions that will soon be redundant so that they can move on and become active citizens in the new emerging economies.  <br\/><br\/>On the issue of progression, which is in the same area as microcredits and the recognition of prior learning, one of the things I have never been able to understand is that Irish students in the further education sector can transfer to English universities with full recognition of the two years spent on their diploma course yet they cannot do so in Irish universities.  In many cases the national universities will not accept such candidates on any basis other than that of a leaving certificate student through the CAO system.  That is limiting the ability of second-chance learners, as I myself was, to move from one sector to another.  I had to move to an English university to attain a qualification.  I could not do so directly in an Irish one.  That bothers me.<br\/><br\/>My colleague, the Chairman, spoke about funding for Erasmus and Erasmus+.  With a tightening European budget, there is definitely an effort to make local governments fund more of these programmes to avoid disenfranchising those students who would avail of them.  There is limited money in Europe so attempts are being made to get national governments to pay.  That is a retrograde step.  I would be interested in anything Mr. Miley has to say on the matter.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the funding of universities, a little while ago I adverted to the fact that 40% of the world's soft balance sheets are in Dublin.  Despite this, I am not sure that there is any PhD programme in the country specifically in the area of cybersecurity.  There is no umbrella body dealing with cybersecurity in the country.  We are very fortunate in that the companies that have set up here have invested heavily in their own cybersecurity, but the State has not taken responsibility for cybersecurity <i>per se<\/i>.  From the universities' point of view, is there a case to be made for a cybersecurity organisation to be set up, perhaps under the Department of the Taoiseach, to provide a significant amount of funding not only for Irish students in Irish universities, but for Irish students in collaborative programmes right across Europe?  It must be remembered that, as far as cybersecurity is concerned, we are always two steps behind the criminals.  I am really concerned about the weakness of the economy to any significant attack in the future.<br\/><br\/>I will leave it at that.  I appreciate that I have asked a lot of questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019062600002#E00200","speaker":"1390","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":123,"content":"<p>There may be a lot of questions but there are many of them which it may not be possible to answer.

Most colleagues we meet from the Executive are aware of our situation, but they have difficulties too.

This is a new phase in Irish foreign policy and probably the biggest wrench since we decided, some time in the mid-1950s, to go into the EEC.  There are big challenges.  In fairness, the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has seen us well; it has proved its worth.  As an outsider, there was a downgrading of the status of the Department up to the time of the Brexit decision and then it was rapidly ramped-up again.  It has done us proud to get us to the situation we are in.  The one worry I have is this.  There is an understanding in Brussels of our situation but there is a growing sense of tiredness with Britain; it is almost as though people are asking why they are still there.

I will take the questions on the make-up of the European Union and its future challenges.  We took some encouragement from the European parliamentary elections, which resulted in a more fragmented European Parliament but without a dramatic swing to either the far right or the far left.  Even though the European People's Party, of which Fine Gael is a member, has lost an overall majority in the parliament, it is still the largest block.  The SND also has a significant number of seats; the new group, Renew Europe, of which President Macron's En Marche party is part, is also a significant block; and the Greens are a significant block, having made gains here in Ireland, with two MEPs elected, and in other member states.  We are encouraged by the fact that the fear of a big swing to the nationalism of the past did not materialise.  We can all work towards a good next five years for the EU and its institutions.<\/p> <p>  Senator Craughwell raised the issue of high-tech industry.  Clearly, there are challenges for Ireland and we have to face up to those.  The world is changing and developing, with a lot of focus on how new industries will be taxed in the future.  It has always been IBEC's position that unilateral action by member states of the Union should not be tolerated and that the right way to do this is through an international tax agreement between all the players involved.  The place to do that is the OECD.  Through its affiliation with business, IBEC has participated significantly in the OECD's work on international tax questions.  A second wave of new international tax rules is being worked on and we expect that progress will be made and those rules will be published in 2020.  We have told the European Union, through the Commission and our business partners in different member states, that we should act together on this rather than have piecemeal, unilateral moves, which will lead to a suboptimal outcome for everybody.  We are deeply involved in that work.  The director general of business at the OECD was in Ireland for the international energy conference.  I met him on Monday night and he was in IBEC yesterday, where we talked more about this important element of the OECD work on international tax rules.<\/p> <p>  We also need to ensure that we have the right skills sets in Ireland to make sure that companies find it attractive to remain here, regardless of what happens in the international tax scene.  A key part of that is having the right skills, and we are 100% supportive of increasing investment in third level education in Ireland.  We have been working with Mr. Jim Miley and his team to raise awareness of the need to invest in our universities and their infrastructure, as we do in other elements of the education system.  We also have a campaign on infrastructure investment, and I will pass over to Mr. Arnold Dillon, who will comment on that.<\/p> <p>  The issue of the Border was raised.  The Single Market cannot be compromised, and we have worked on this with our European business partners.  Over the weekend, on the third anniversary of the Brexit decision, we were very happy to see the German business group state publicly that it still fully supports the withdrawal agreement.  The chief executive of our counterparts in Germany fully supports the withdrawal agreement, the backstop and the need to ensure that the Single Market is not compromised.  That gives us not only support but responsibility; Ireland has to ensure that it plays its part in the European protection of the Single Market.<\/p> <p>  The backstop is about much more than the Single Market.  It is also about the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process.  This morning, we had a meeting in IBEC with the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Helen McEntee.<\/p><p>One of the things that we were very encouraged by was the way she answered a question asked by one of our members.  She said that the funding for the PEACE programme is going to be extended, which is welcome.  The Good Friday Agreement and peace on the island of Ireland are vitally important to the citizens and businesses, and not only the people who do business with the UK.  Our position on the Border is clear.  We feel that the withdrawal agreement should be accepted and we should have a transition period.  If we reach a no-deal outcome then we will need to re-examine the area, particularly the transition that business will need because we do not believe that the authorities, business or State agencies in Ireland or across Europe will be fully prepared for the catastrophic impact of a no-deal exit.<\/p><p> We met representatives of Make UK, which is the largest manufacturing representative body in the UK and was formerly known as the Engineering Employers Federation.  Yesterday, we met its representatives in IBEC and talked about the very significant challenges that their members are facing.  We are working with them to try to make sure that we can help them as much as possible and also because our membership has such a deep integration and involvement in the UK market, and in UK manufacturing for the food and drink area and the pharma medtech area.  Later I shall discuss the relationship with the US but my colleague, Mr. Dillon, will now comment on campaigns and their funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019062600002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Pat Ivory","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561503600,"counter":130,"content":"<p>The question asked was whether the activity that we are involved in is fully recognised by our members.  The answer is an emphatic \"Yes\".  Our membership base is incredibly plugged in to the risks associated with Brexit and has been since the moment a referendum was mooted in the UK, which was long before the referendum took place.  It is something that IBEC has sought to reflect over the course of our work over the last couple of years.  Due to that support and recognition by our membership base we have been in a position to significantly resource that sort of work and reorientate our activity accordingly.  IBEC has four active headline policy campaign.  Two of the campaigns focus on the domestic agenda in terms of the future of work and the quality of life.  The remaining two campaigns focus on Brexit and the future of the EU, and on our international reputation.

I shall address a couple of the questions and my colleague will pick up on a couple of the other questions because he is best placed to do so.<\/p> <p>  Senator Craughwell asked about the information economy and the need for an increased emphasis on apprenticeships.  We wholeheartedly agree with such an approach and welcome the apprenticeship initiative taken by the Government over the last one to two years.  We think that a lot more needs to be done.  We would broaden the initiative beyond apprenticeships to include work placement and collaboration with industry and enterprise, which is an agenda that we very much share with IBEC.  In that regard, the human capital initiative that the Government announced in last year's budget, and the first tranche will be allocated in next year's budget, is &euro;300 million over five years and &euro;60 million each year starting in 2020.  We have been in discussions with the Department of Education and Skills about the initiative.  We emphasised that the fund should not just be about the number of placements, apprenticeships or students but bring about system change in third level, particularly how we, as third level providers, can innovate in the delivery of our courses and have greater agility in terms of how we engage with enterprise.  We have shared some of our ideas on that with the Department.  We hope that the higher education institutes fund would be structured in a way that allows us to work together to progress that agenda.  Therefore, we are very much in agreement with the Senator's view on that.    <\/p> <p>  I shall leave it to my colleague to respond to the question on the recognition of qualifications and progression.  I shall address the other issue raised by the Senator.  I refer to the funding and push by certain forces in the EU to have a greater proportion of Erasmus funding borne by domestic governments.  We would be in agreement that that should be strongly resisted.  Erasmus is a European fund, which has been very successful, and should remain so.  Any moves in that direction need to be resisted and we  hope our view can be carried across European interests.  I shall revert back to the point I made earlier about the overall funding for the system.  It is described here, and maybe I described it as such, as an investment in universities or third level but that is not what this is about.  This is about investing in our future.  A current Minister has referred to young people as our \"oil reserve\".  Perhaps in these green days talking about an \"oil reserve\" has become somewhat of a dirty term.  However, it is an interesting metaphor because oil reserves are not a whole lot of use unless one invests quite a lot of money to harness them, bring them to the surface and then use them to benefit the economy.  Ireland does not have natural resources when compared with almost any of our European competitors.  Our economy is now largely built on the oil reserve that is our people.  The only way we can keep our competitive edge is if we invest in those people to harness that reserve for the future.  This is not about campuses, universities, lecturers and courses.  It is actually about the future of our economy.  European funds can carry us so far.  The following is particularly relevant to research funding.  If there is more money for the Horizon Europe 2021 to 2027 programme, and it looks like there is, our capacity to compete for that money is only as good as how much we invest ourselves because it is a matching funding equation, and it is important that we invest more in same. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019062600002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Miley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561503600,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I shall pick up on a couple of those issues, as requested.  Ireland is seen as a very good example across Europe in terms of the recognition of academic qualifications.  Students who move around in other countries, as correctly identified by the Senator, face challenges when they return home.  I mean in terms of having been abroad for a semester or a year and the recognition of their modules or whatever they bring back with them.  That is not the case for Irish higher education institutions.  We have good systems in place but, even more importantly, we have very good systems for recognising foreign qualifications when people come to Ireland either for the purposes of work or further study.  We are an attractive destination for both purposes, as the Senator noted.<\/p> <p>  Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, is the quality and quality assurance agency and national agency.  It maintains an excellent database on foreign qualifications.  What they translate to on the Irish framework of qualifications and what they can most readily be compared with in terms of a qualification delivered by an Irish education institution whether that is further or higher education, a university, an institute of technology, etc.  That example in Europe is admired by many countries.  QQI is often solicited to talk about the issue and how to manage the situation.  The Senator is right in saying that we sometimes have a problem in this country in terms of transfer and progression from further education to higher education, particularly from further education into the university world.<\/p><p>It is something of a double-edged sword because universities have quotas set aside for further education applicants but we have great trouble filling them.  We are undertaking major work that is being led by the Irish Universities Association but with representatives from all the universities and in close consultation with SOLAS and the Department of Education and Skills.  The aim is to try to remove many of the barriers that we have built up over the years.  They make it too complicated and bureaucratic for further education award holders to progress easily and transparently to the university sector.  This work is under way.  We expect to see the results in several years' time.  In the meantime, we still have places that we would like to fill.  The process is rather difficult.<\/p><p> Reference was made to the need for greater flexibility in the delivery of reskilling and upskilling and the use of micro-credentials in particular.  This is something we have been asking the Department of Education and Skills to consider as part of the human capital initiative.  We hope to achieve our goal of using the additional investment or new money coming in through the employers' contribution to the national training fund to enable us to deliver or leverage our existing higher education provision in more flexible ways for people who need it.  If this arises in a smaller way through micro-credentials, more flexible learning, part-time learning, etc., then it is a win-win situation for everyone involved.<\/p><p> Deputy Durkan mentioned some of the challenges facing European democracy.  We have ample evidence of it.  The Deputy was in Romania in recent days and will have seen the demographic support around populism throughout Europe, from Romania to the United Kingdom to our country.  Unfortunately, we know the demographics relating to that.  However, those who are part of the younger and more educated demographic are far more likely to be pro-European, engaged citizens and progressive in terms of democratic involvement and so on.  This is one of the positive societal outcomes of investing in education at every level.  We have seen the role it plays.  We have seen the role of our young people in driving the economy, innovation, social change and healthy societies.  That is why we need to invest in the future for Ireland.<\/p><p> We have considerable support from our colleagues throughout Europe.  One point mentioned was the possibility of a no-deal Brexit and the risks.  While we have sorted out, at least in the short term and medium term, the mobility of staff and students across these islands - north, south, east and west - a disorderly Brexit would result in the United Kingdom crashing out of eligibility for European research funding.  UK researchers are the biggest players and they are our biggest partners in research output.  Not only are they Ireland's biggest partners but they happen to be the biggest and most important partners of many European countries, especially the smaller ones.  This is an opportunity for Ireland as a small country, but one with an active and developing research and innovation scene on the industry side and on the higher education side.  We could team up with some of the other countries looking for new partners.  We have made some suggestions in our written submission to the committee about countries we see as useful when it comes to strengthening links in future.  That is set out in the submission.  We would be happy to work with the committee if it is receiving delegations or if members are visiting and would like the Irish Universities Association to brief them in advance on whatever they think would be useful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019062600002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Lewis Purser","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I thank our guests for attending.

I will just make a few opening introductory comments.<\/p> <p>  The national oral health policy was approved by the Government in March 2019, so it is now Government policy.  The chief dental officer, Dr. Kavanagh, led the development of the policy over a period and will set out for members the ethos, principal features, key plans and actions in it.  The policy is quite wide-ranging and takes an intersectoral approach as well as being consistent with the primary care philosophy of prevention, treatment at the lowest level of complexity and recourse to specialist care where this is clinically appropriate.  This work is the culmination of a comprehensive programme of research, analysis and consultation over a number of years and, over time, we will update models of care and service delivery that have been with us for 25 years or more.<\/p> <p>  The policy is not only aligned with international models of good practice but with the ideals and approach in other healthcare policy areas, such as Sl&aacute;intecare and Healthy Ireland.  It is important to say that it does not seek to change all aspects of service delivery overnight, but it puts in place the framework for real and substantive change on a phased basis.

As Mr. Fergal Goodman said, it is a comprehensive and evidence-based policy informed by extensive research and consultation.  Its aim is to better facilitate oral health for everyone and to support continued professional development.  The programme is transformative, introducing and managing a series of changes over eight years.  The policy is aligned with other Government policies, including Sl&aacute;intecare, Healthy Ireland and First 5, which is a whole-of-Government strategy for babies, young children and families, as well as the national strategies on disability and mental health.  It conforms to the international policies of the WHO and the European Union.  The policy embraces the \"no child is left behind\" principle of First 5 and the education policies.<\/p> <p>  This is the first major oral health policy statement in 25 years and much has changed in Ireland in that period, including the standard of general and oral health, the materials and technology used in dentistry, and the types of services we aim to provide.  In developing the policy, we have ensured that it is supported by up-to-date information about the oral health of the population, as well as by appropriate international evidence.  A broad range of stakeholders was consulted, including those who use the services and those providing the care.<\/p> <p>  Our current oral health system is out of step with other Irish and international health services.  There are gaps remaining in routine dental care for the very young and the vulnerable, including people in residential care, people with disabilities and older people.  Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte reorients how care is provided in line with Sl&aacute;intecare so that most dental care is provided in people's own communities, as close as possible to where they live.  This is beneficial for service users and allows acute services to focus on more complex care.  What is described in Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte is not a demand-led service.  Instead, it enables the Irish public to access services and forge a relationship with their chosen dental practice; we call this their \"dental home\".<\/p> <p>  To support this universal primary care approach, a safety net system will identify those who do not or cannot attend their local dentist.  This safety net system is part of the surveillance system outlined in the policy and ensures that the most vulnerable children and adults, including those on lower incomes, will be supported and receive the same quality of service as the rest of the population.  The existing public dental service will be stronger.  A key service will be to identify, support and deliver care for vulnerable children and adults when it cannot be provided in the local dental practice.<\/p> <p>  The measures set out in the policy will provide professional opportunities for staff in areas such as health promotion, special care services and public health.<\/p> <p>  I will pick out some of the key policy strategies and proposals, which members have in front of them.  Water fluoridation is one key reason we have such good oral health in Ireland and will remain a cornerstone of oral health policy.  Health promotion programmes will be put in place for the whole population and to target the most vulnerable.  Most children and eligible adults will be treated in local dental practices and a package for children from birth until the age of 16 will, in a phased way, replace the existing schools programme.  It is the first time that those under the age of 6, teenagers and adults will have lifetime access to preventive treatment such as fissure sealants and fluoride varnishes, as well as access to dietary advice in dental practices.  The expansion of primary care is proposed from birth until old age, across the whole life course.  We have focused on improving access for vulnerable groups such as those on low incomes, rural dwellers and people with disabilities.  Enabling them to get to local dental practices is key.  As I mentioned, the safety net service is essential to ensure that their needs are addressed and they get comprehensive care.  We must not forget that we need advanced care and specialist care services, and that includes the concerns around general dental anaesthesia.  Monitoring systems will have to be put in place to identify people who are not taking up the services, overall dental needs and the policy's impact.  There must be a full review of dental undergraduate education, in tandem with career-long professional mentoring for dentists.<\/p> <p>  I will talk briefly about the development of the policy.  As mentioned, it was informed by oral healthcare professionals through a series of working groups and consultations.  We are indebted to the Oral Health Policy Academic Reference Group, and we drew expertise from Irish universities in this regard.  These experts assess current needs and how best to meet them.  In addition, we had an external international independent panel made up of leaders in different aspects of policy development.  From this, recommendations and research from the reference group were quality assured in line with international standards.  All research undertaken, including the additional facts study analysis, was robust, representative, ethically compliant and externally quality assured.<\/p> <p>  At the start of policy development in 2014, and again in 2016, more than 5,000 letters were sent from the Department of Health to the whole profession inviting all dental registrants to comment and engage in policy.  A stakeholder day was held, with more than 70 attendees from 16 representative organisations.  There was one-to-one engagement with dental practitioners in independent practice and with those in the public dental service.  Their views overall highlighted an appetite for change in oral healthcare services but emphasised the challenges of such a change.  The Dental Council of Ireland training bodies, including the RCSI and the Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, were also consulted and given a draft document.  These engagements informed the direction of policy in key aspects of service provision and training for professionals.<\/p> <p>  I have outlined the key findings from both the public and from dentists.  I will mention a few points arising from the public point of view.  The public indicated that the current system is complex and very difficult to navigate and they were worried about cost, particularly in relation to children's care.  Young children rarely attend the dentist before six years of age.  Of concern to us is that over the age of 55, there is a decline in quality of life, which sharply declines beyond 70 and into a person's later years.  Overall, all age groups and social classes perceived that their main access to care is via their general dental practice.  <\/p> <p>  Stakeholders and practitioners insisted that very early childhood care is needed and also want special care services for the vulnerable.  They expressed frustration with bureaucracy, barriers to accessing care for patients and an outdated State payment system.  There is a need for a greater emphasis on primary care in the profession to bring it forward.  Those in the public dental service emphasised the need for prevention and for opportunities to expand their skills.  The information from the consultations fundamentally changed the direction of a lot of our policies.  Leadership roles in primary care to refocus the profession and facilitate leadership from within it is a key action being called for by dentists.  The policy also includes very early intervention for children, to give them the best start, and the need for comprehensive support for the most vulnerable through specific support services within the reoriented PDS.<\/p> <p>  Along with the policy action, a career-long mentoring framework will be put in place, as exists for other professions such as social work and psychology.  Undergraduate and graduate education is the first priority within the policy, with an emphasis on training and primary care.  <\/p> <p>  The policy includes a review of dental technology and clinical dental technology training.  This was a key issue that arose from the public, regarding the needs of those in residential services, and from dentists, regarding the need to maintain a workforce in this direction in relation to dentures and prosthetics for those with total tooth loss.<\/p> <p>  The committee will be particularly interested in implementation, which is where all the action is.  We have shared with members an overview document showing 41 actions and the priority for each of those over the next eight years.  The implementation period is needed to commit actively to engagement on significant and complex issues.  First, we need to build a framework to support long-term sustainability, the education review, a mentoring framework and a focus on legislative issues.<\/p><p>The Department has already begun to discuss the priorities with key agencies and we are agreeing targets and timescales.  As an example, action 29 in the policy, which is a priority, is the national plan for amalgam phase-down on which we worked closely with our colleagues in the Department of Communication, Climate Action and the Environment and key stakeholders.  It is being finalised in line with Ireland&rsquo;s EU legislative obligations to publish on 1 July and submit to the EU in August.<\/p><p> I mentioned the full review of undergraduate training which, along with graduate mentoring programmes and upskilling for graduate dentists, are key immediate actions.  The Dental Council, through the Irish committee for specialist training in dentistry, will lead in developing the advanced centres of care framework for specialists.  We are convening in July to commence this work.<\/p><p> For the First 5 strategy, the Department of Children is working with the Department of Health to support the framework for the under sixes policy in programmes of health promotion and services.  We have already met the Clinical Dental Technicians Association and we have its support to assess dental technology training.<\/p><p> Water fluoridation remains and we continue to review it and we will link with the expert body on fluorides and health.<\/p><p> The HSE has two main service focuses.  Epidemiology data indicate that those in residential settings require urgent attention and support.  The reorientated public dental service and community oral health care services will identify their needs and put in place a treatment programme for those who cannot use primary care.  The second priority is that the very young, up to six years of age, receive packages of preventative and primary care.  This is in line with Healthy Ireland and the First 5 strategy.  It will also give the public dental service an opportunity to release capacity.<\/p><p> Implementation of a transformative policy such as Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte will present challenges.  All change is challenging.  However, those challenges will present opportunities for the staff in private practice and the public dental service.  It is important that implementation is owned by the profession while listening to the voice of the public.  To achieve these priorities, we need key leadership roles operationally and in dental schools.  Primary care, special care, advanced or specialist care delivery and public health leaders must be in place so that implementation is sustainable and placed where it belongs in the services.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman for this opportunity to outline the national policy.  We look forward to working with our colleagues in the HSE services, professionals and key stakeholders to implement this change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019062600002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Dympna Kavanagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I now call Professor Brian O'Connell from the oral health policy academic reference group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019062600002#E00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561503600,"counter":146,"content":"<p>I have been a practising dentist for 35 years.  I am a consultant in dentistry and dean of the dental school in Trinity College.  I am accompanied by my colleagues, Dr. Jacinta McLoughlin, a specialist in dental public health, and Dr. Alison Dougall, a consultant who treats patients with serious illnesses and disabilities.  We are here on behalf of the reference group whose chairman, Professor O'Mullane, has submitted a letter that addresses a number of specific points raised about the group&rsquo;s work.<\/p> <p>  The reference group was established to help provide the Department of Health with the best independent evidence that could be used to improve oral health in Ireland.  It is a broad group with a range of backgrounds and disciplines relevant to policy development.  Like all dental professionals, and indeed members of the public, we are acutely aware of the shortcomings of current dental services in Ireland.  There remains huge inequality in oral health, especially among vulnerable groups and those living in rural areas.  We see parents of children with disabilities who are often desperate to access appropriate care.  Far too many young children turn up at hospitals needing emergency extractions, and those who are frail, living with dementia or in residential care often find their oral health completely neglected.  The training pathways needed to sustain oral health services have not been developed or, in some cases, have been dismantled. <\/p> <p>  The committee should also know that most dental disease is preventable.  Dental decay and gum disease, which are the main reasons for tooth loss, pain and infection, are two of the most common diseases worldwide but preventing these diseases, and oral cancer, is possible to a large degree with simple primary care measures.<\/p> <p>  The reference group proposed principles that might frame an oral health policy.  Members will have seen some of these in the final Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte document.  There is the common risk factor approach, which recognises that some of the same factors are involved in oral and other diseases, so controlling these risk factors can have a big impact on health.  For example, high sugar intake is the main cause of tooth decay but is also implicated in obesity and type 2 diabetes.  Reducing sugar intake should, therefore, be the business of the whole primary health care team, including dentists.  Importantly, the provision of a service such as dental treatment must be surrounded by broader public health policies to make a real difference.  The life course approach means that individuals need access to different services throughout life and depending on their circumstances.  However, at all ages our population should have a home in a dental practice setting that is focused on prevention and empowering them to maintain their oral health and independence.  As part of Sl&aacute;intecare, oral health care must be available to all who need it, regardless of income, location and disability.  These are just a few examples of policy recommendations that have been included in Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte, which will be crucial to transform oral health in Ireland.  The principles are not only well established in Government policy, but are also contained in recommendations from internationally recognised professional bodies.<\/p> <p>  Those of us who want to provide appropriate care for patients know that an oral health policy will accomplish nothing without determined and sustained implementation.  Continuing with current services will not improve the oral health of the population and will exacerbate inequalities.  Available evidence is strongly supportive of change.  It is vital to build confidence in the public and in dental professionals that we will be supported in our roles.  Most of the population can be readily treated in a practice setting and a strong primary care system reduces the need for more complex interventions.  Nonetheless, primary care providers cannot be asked to take responsibility for patients unless they know there is access to backup and specialist care when needed, as outlined in the policy&rsquo;s advanced centres of care.  It is also essential that we monitor progress as we proceed, to make sure we are achieving the goals of the policy for all people.  The evaluation and research parts of the policy are critical to a successful outcome, as emphasised already in the Healthy Ireland framework.  All of these issues have been recognised in Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte and we welcome the publication of priority actions to be addressed in the coming years.<\/p> <p>  We would like to highlight the need to develop a workforce that is fit to deliver the best oral health care across disciplines to the greatest number of people, as stated clearly in Sl&aacute;intecare and described in the oral health policy.  Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte proposes a review of dental education and the development of primary care leadership throughout the dental schools and, I hope, the HSE to ensure that dentists will be central pillars of the primary health care team.  This may include extending education in a mentored environment to encompass broad community experience, inter-professional teamwork and general practice skills.  The oral health policy provides for ongoing access to retraining through a skills match programme, so the dental team can keep abreast of changes in the population, disease patterns and technology.  In order to support patients and practitioners, specialist and academic training must be put back on a firmer footing within the established medical model.  As the policy has stated, it is also time to look at the scope of practice of the whole dental team so the population has the greatest possible access to good quality care.<\/p> <p>  My colleagues and I have the privilege of working not only with students but all members of the dental team at all stages of their careers.  I assure the committee that in this country we have a talented and dedicated workforce whose skills are recognised everywhere.

I can certainly understand those concerns, as can most of us who work in the system, given that we do not always have a great track record of funding everything properly and ensuring that all parts of it work.  Ultimately, dentists, like any health professionals, want to deliver a service for the population but want to do so in a safe, sustainable way.  If they start to take care of a new group of patients such as children or people with disabilities, they need back-up.  If it is 4.30 p.m. on a Friday and somebody appears at a surgery with a problem, there needs to be someone who can be called and who can see the patient if it is an emergency.<\/p> <p>  Those are the main kinds of concerns that underpin much of what I have heard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019062600002#G01000","nonspeaker":"Professor Brian O'Connell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561503600,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I am a special care dentist.  I started work in general practice and moved to the equivalent of the public dental service, developing a special interest in the treatment of people with disabilities.  I undertook considerable training and now provide care for people with complex disabilities.  As well as perusing the evidence, we consulted extensively professionals working in the field and, along with our medical colleagues, people with disabilities.  I draw the committee's attention to an excellent document published in 2005 that brought together the viewpoints of people working in the field, such as people from the HSE and the National Disability Authority, who were all in agreement that the key to managing the problem for people with disabilities was mainstreaming their oral health.  There was wide agreement in that regard.<br\/><br\/>The availability of appropriate care is <i>ad hoc<\/i>.  People with disabilities are grossly underserved, they experience high levels of unmet need, along with reduced treatment options even when they are able to access care, and their outcomes are poorer.  A recent study from IDS-TILDA showed that people with intellectual disabilities who live into older age are twice as likely to have lost all their teeth.  More importantly, they are 12 times more likely not to wear dentures, not to mention bridges or crowns, to replace their teeth, ensure their dignity and allow them to chew a healthy diet.<br\/><br\/>There is agreement among the profession that such inequality is unjust, unfair and unnecessary.  Most people from vulnerable groups have needs that can be met with small, reasonable adjustments in primary care.  As was noted in the consultation, we must be mindful that when the public service fails to meet such people's needs, the fact that they have been affected by social inequality and had less access to education or well-paid jobs means that their ability to pay for alternatives will be greatly reduced.  From the literature, we know that only between 8% and 10% of people with disabilities require specialist care.  Where that care is required, however, it needs to be produced by well trained staff with access to adjuncts such as general anaesthesia and sedation and who are well informed on consent, ethics and working with teams in social care.  It is clear that people with disabilities want availability of care in mainstream services.<\/p><p>It is what they have asked for and there are great models to showcase this working very well.  However, what is required by people with disabilities, long-term conditions and frail older people is well-signposted pathways to services in a timely fashion as for many of these people, the only way they can receive basic care is with general anesthesia, sedation or experts.  The oral health policy and the consultation that we have gone through provides the structure and opportunity to address the frank inequalities that we see right from early intervention in childhood to frail older age.  For the first time targeted, preventive packages in primary care and establishment of these community-based services is really important.<\/p><p> Evidence shows that educating the general dental workforce and exposing them to diversity in their training gives them the skills and knowledge to manage most people with disabilities.  The training of the workforce, supported by specialists, is really important.  We cannot expect our primary care providers to accept people with complexities into their workforce without a very well structured framework and pathways to support them, for the few patients for whom it is beyond their scope.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019062600002#G01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Alison Dougall","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":185,"content":"<p>I apologise for being late - I was showing solidarity with workers on the picket line this morning and got caught in traffic - but I have had the opportunity to read over the submissions.<\/p> <p>  I am unclear about the matter of the Irish Dental Association.  Its representatives appeared before the committee and were very clear.  Their considered view was that the association was not consulted, that there was no meaningful consultation, and they do not see their views or position reflected in any of the documentation.  I struggle to understand how we can have two people in for two different sessions who can have such completely divergent views of the same process.  Dr. Dougall calls what happened detailed consultation, while the Irish Dental Association is certainly not of that view.  There appears to have been some meetings but the Irish Dental Association says that it cannot see its views in the policy.  It is the body which represents the profession.  Maybe we will never get to the bottom of it but it is worth noting that it was very strong in its view that there had not been meaningful engagement.  We could detail all the meetings - we could have 100 meetings here and maybe it could be that I did not listen or the witnesses did not speak.  It is a difficulty and I hope that the partnership can be rebuilt.  The two views contradict and I do not know if we can square the circle.  In the absence of a time machine it cannot be fixed but it is important that the relationship is re-established.  I am not necessarily asking the witnesses to accept that the relationship has broken down or put words in their mouths but it is difficult for us as we have heard two divergent views of the same process.

If children have pain they attend our clinics and are dealt with by a highly skilled and well motivated staff who do a very good job in difficult circumstances.<\/p> <p>  Many people&rsquo;s first experience of dentistry is quite difficult.  It might come as a result of pain or trauma, possible loss of sleep or the onset of infection.  No one, if he or she has symptoms, is in the best of form when he or she turns up at a dental clinic.  The staff deal with that on a daily basis.   Since the start of this meeting, probably 300 children experiencing pain have walked into dental clinics and private dental practices.  There are in excess of 70,000 attendances for emergencies in the HSE service.  That is quite a large quantum of service.  We are very proud of the efforts our staff make to look after children.  Not many of us look forward to having dental treatment.  Clinical dentistry in young children requires a highly skilled and well motivated staff together with high standards of care, which is what we strive to provide.

Without putting too fine a point on it, I was correct and much of it was privatised.  At the time, I was told it would not be and it would enhance the service.  Of course, it did not.  Was there a cost-benefit analysis in terms of the investment in the public service building up from the 221 clinics, increasing staffing, delivering more through the public service versus purchasing from the private sector?  For example, we saw it happen with the home help service.  Directly employed home helps would provide the service for approximately &euro;13 to &euro;16 an hour.  Once one headed towards the private sector, one was knocking on the door of &euro;45 an hour, as well as losing control of the service and deskilling the public service.<\/p><p> It is not good that this would be lost.

I understand the Deputy&rsquo;s question and concern for the staff in place.  I was a principal dental surgeon when the last policy was launched and implemented.  Part of that was that the Department kindly offered us more dentist posts and it coincided with the introduction of dental hygienists.  We had great difficulty in County Meath filling those positions, however.  I had to go to Stockholm to recruit some dentists to fill those posts.<\/p> <p>  The problem is that, as currently set up, the HSE dental service is not attractive, particularly to new graduate dentists who would be young and enthusiastic.  Unlike in medicine, dentists graduate with a wide range of clinical skills.  In Dublin, they start treating patients doing irreversible procedures on patients in year two of a five-year programme.  They come out with an accomplished range of skills.  If one works in the salaried dental service, it does not allow one to use those skills.  In the past, there were more opportunities to use them.  When I was in the health board dental service, there were opportunities to treat adults.  For example, I did some of that kind of treatment in psychiatric hospitals.<\/p> <p>  Having extra positions does not necessarily solve the problem if the posts are not attractive.  Salary cuts, changes in the pension arrangements and so forth have an impact on the attractiveness.  The model of care needs to change.  This has been clearly outlined in the policy.

It took four separate phases to look at it.  The first was commissioned and given to University College Cork by the reference group to look at the cost-benefit analysis of the various services.  There was much international research on salaried services.  We looked at the Scandinavian models and at introducing different types of models.  They did not involve privatisation but public contracts in local communities.  It was found that salaried services were best suited to providing services to vulnerable and special care services.  For healthy patients in primary care, it was not as effective or efficient.  There are multiple international studies in that regard.  We looked at countries which were similar and there are theoretical constructs of it.  The Dutch and Icelandic models are more similar culturally to where we are sitting and we examined those models closely.<\/p> <p>  The second stream looked at all insurance models internationally and what was successful and otherwise.  It just did not look at the oral health outcomes of those models.  Oral health is influenced by many other issues such as social determinism, disease and water fluoridation, and not just by the service.  It looked at the uptake and the buy-in culturally from the countries involved.  Insurance models work well in Ireland.  We saw extremely good and fast outcomes from many of those models.<\/p> <p>  The final phase was done by the ESRI.  It started examining various types of models such as mixed-payment models.  This involved looking at a preventive package overlaid by a fee-for-item system and further overlaid by service level agreements.  The reason we went down that model was because it was familiar to the public and it understood it more.  The outcomes from such a model are good in a short period, particularly for a preventive-oriented scheme.  It is good for the type of oral health we are experiencing at present, whereby the vast majority of children from middle to high-income families have good oral health.  Then there is the smaller group of vulnerable persons.<\/p> <p>  We looked at the Medicaid model in America, whereby it increased access through practices.  It found that ironically inequalities did not get worse but were much better for the high-risk and low-income groups when they got in early.  The higher income groups did not tend to use it as much but it really benefitted lower income groups.<\/p> <p>  We undertook four separate phases because it is a significant change for us to undertake.

The search engine for scientific publications shows huge volumes of research on it.  The United States is one of the key countries.  Over 300 million people worldwide receive fluoridated water.  In the United States there is quite an amount of naturally occurring fluoride in water supplies.  In this country we reduced the level in the water supply in 2007 because on the basis of research carried out here it was considered that a reduced level would perhaps be better.  The range now is 0.6 to 0.8.  The maximum allowed in EU drinking water regulations is 1.5.  There is a very cautious approach being taken here.  In the United States in the past there was a maximum allowable concentration of four parts per million, which is considerably higher than the EU figure.  This is something that has been shown worldwide to be effective because everybody gets it.  People do not have to make any effort to get it, whereas in a programme which involves the application of a topical fluoride in some form or a varnish, or however it is put onto teeth, they have to come into the surgery.  Water fluoridation occurs for everybody.  That is why it is so beneficial.  It has had a huge beneficial impact on oral health in this country, not just for children but also for adults.  A whole generation has retained natural teeth, something that perhaps would not have happened in the past without water fluoridation.  It remains a cornerstone of policy because it is a key aspect of preventing one of the main dental diseases that afflicts people.  People do not look forward to going to the dentist, which is understandable.  The problem is claims can be made, but in the scientific world a very careful evaluation is made before talking about cause and effect.  People do not do this lightly.

The major change required is oral health has to become everybody's problem.  We have to integrate the mouth with the rest of the body and work with our medical colleagues, community nurses and midwives to nudge people at appropriate times.  This is really important in early childhood, but it is critical in older age, too.  We find that for the first time older people are retaining their teeth.  In the past they went into older age with dentures.  People make more medical appointments as they get older but fewer dental appointments, although their risks are higher because of medicine, poor eyesight, lack of dexterity and finances.  Pathfinder surveys examine how we can signpost people in order that they have really good levels of oral health as they age.  As one in five people over the age of 80 years will get dementia, we need to make sure the teams that are caring for people with dementia take oral health seriously because we have the technology to prevent and reverse disease if we catch it early.  Our problem is that people with dementia who have not received any care for perhaps eight or ten years present with advanced problems which at that point are very difficult to treat.  That is a real priority.  It is a new problem, but the nudges about which the Deputy talks mean redesigning the way we provide care.  For homeless populations, we need more drop-in centres; for older people, we need to make sure services are local because they are least likely to be able to travel.  Therefore, we need to make services accessible and affordable and design domiciliary care services in such a way that we can take teams into residential homes.  They do not need to be dentists; we can work with teams of hygienists who can effectively and economically reverse disease.  This is incredibly important and it is highlighted in the community services.  We need to work with the professions and our colleagues in other areas of medicine to design services to reach more people at risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019062600002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Alison Dougall"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561503600,"counter":231,"content":"<p>On the point made about water fluoridation, like Ireland, Israel had mandatory water fluoridation and it was pulled out.  It tried to replace it with toothpaste and other programmes outlined by Dr. McLoughlin.  For all those reasons, the level of decay has increased phenomenally.  The only area in Israel that has maintained its oral health rates is a place in which water is naturally fluoridated.  Now that water fluoridation has been taken away, it is impossible to put it back in.  It is really important that we protect water fluoridation as there are stark and dramatic outcomes, as we see in Israel.<\/p> <p>  The point made about the workforce is very important, especially because we have put in place the World Health Organization, WHO, safety net surveillance network.  On focusing on children only, the WHO is very clear that we must consider five year olds, 12 year olds, adolescents from 15 to 19 years of age and 35 to 45 year olds, the prime ages for childbearing, and then move to 60 and 70 year olds.  The overarching safety net monitoring and surveillance service has been recognised by the WHO since the early 2000s and all European countries are moving in this direction exactly for the reasons outlined by the Deputy to make sure people in the workforce are encouraged and formally nudged to tell them that their oral health is not okay, as they need to be signposted to the dentist and assured on where they are going.  <\/p> <p>  The view from other countries, particularly the Dutch models, is that there is much more flexibility when the message is sent to the profession in communities that dentists are providing care because they can afford to be more flexible, work on a Saturday, or late if they so chose because it is up to them to get their patients into the clinic.  A core part of oral health policy is to establish a dental home as early as possible because the first two years are crucial, not just for children but also their parents because the effect is twofold.  When they bring in their child, it nudges them.  There is a lot of evidence to support this.  We can be absolutely certain that certain socio-economic groups have access to services.  One of the key points in the policy is to say it is a universal approach, but it must be overlaid with a targeted approach.  That comes through in the oral health promotion programmes and services, but at no point do we say universal access stands on its own.  We are absolutely aware of the vulnerable and people with disabilities.  That is why we have put in place the WHO safety net surveillance network to ensure we can pick up those in the vulnerable groups.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019062600002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Dympna Kavanagh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561503600,"counter":232,"content":"<p>The safety of water fluoridation has been raised as an issue over and over again in every country.  I can understand this.  Most English speaking nations use water fluoridation to a greater or lesser extent.  I have examined this issue.  The WHO, the European Union, the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, and others have examined it in great detail and never been able to find any problem with its safety.  The Health Research Board commissioned a study a few years ago, examined every piece of evidence and could not find a problem with it.  Last year Public Health England recommended that more water fluoridation schemes be rolled out.  More people in England receive fluoridated water than in Ireland.<\/p><p>It is a smaller percentage of the population but there are big fluoridated communities in the UK.  <\/p><p> The Deputy is right about catching serious cases at earlier ages.  We spoke earlier about on-demand services and children turning up in pain and with infection.  Why are 70,000 children turning up in pain and why do 7,000 children have to go into hospital to have teeth extracted?  By the time they are seen, it is too late.  I agree with Dr. Green.  No parent wants his or her child's first time visiting a dentist to be because the child has a serious infection and needs to be bundled into hospital and put to sleep to have teeth removed.  Nobody wants that.  No organisation or dentist wants that.  This is why one of the key aspects of the policy, in line with all international recommendations, is to see children when their teeth first appear and start to give basic advice to them and their parents about looking after their teeth, diet, brushing and so on to ensure we do not have young children turning up in hospital needing extractions.  That is very important.  <\/p><p> At a later age, there is a growing problem with diabetes.  There is a well-known relationship between gum disease and diabetes.  The more one improves one, the more one improves the other.  Some of the health insurance companies in the US will pay for people to have as much gum treatment as they want if they are at risk of diabetes because the more a person improves his or her gum health, the better controlled his or her diabetes will be and it will stop people from going into hospital.  It also saves money.

There is considerable evidence from the British and Canadian systems on the advantages and the fact that people, particularly in Great Britain, regard the pharmacy as the best place to receive their oral healthcare advice.  While that might not translate to Ireland, there is certainly strong evidence to suggest that this information should come from several different sources.  Finland is another example of a country that changed its system.  The pharmacy is the first point of contact, which means that if person goes into a health service where the first point of contact happens to be a pharmacist, that pharmacist will guide him or her through the system.

These are known as orthomatic cases where the orthodontists works in conjunction oral with maxillofacial surgeons.  The vast majority of those cases are identified at the point of referral and the point of assessment.  While those cases are prioritised within the current system, some of the surgery is dependent on the completion of growth in the jaws and that is not completed in most instances until the very late teens.  Therefore, the surgery will be planned at the end of the teens rather than at age 12 or 13 which is the optimal age for the majority of children to have orthodontics.  In a small number of cases, the planned approach will be that some orthodontic treatment is undertaken with a possible delay thereafter to allow growth to be completed followed by more intervention by the orthodontist and the surgeon working together.  There are a small number of such cases, but they are dealt with on a priority basis within the system.  However, they are in a parallel stream to most of the other cases where priority is determined according to the extent of malocclusion.  There is serious management of those cases, but inevitably some of those adolescents will be treated right through until their late teens or even early 20s because of the nature of their condition and the physical limitations on what can be achieved in the early to mid-teens.

It is important to say they hold their own among all of the European graduates.<\/p> <p>  However, what was clear, indeed, in our consultation that came back from the dentists, was that they want primary care at the heart of it and, as Professor O'Connell articulated, they want to have more exposure to practice and all those areas of managing one's own practice in primary care right through their graduate programme, and those who we asked were not necessarily convinced that what is being proposed in \"foundation training\", as it was then called, would rectify their problems.  In fact, the older graduates said that they were still having problems.  That is why we started to look at it moving more towards a mentoring programme, which, I suppose, is a super extension of that programme.<\/p> <p>  Let us focus on the specialist side of it because that is an important area.  The Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry, which is the formal recognised group over specialist training and part of the Dental Council, has welcomed this policy in writing and is very supportive of it.

That involves not only a name.  That involves credentialling, looking at the work and at the workforce we need at all the different levels.

Unlike in medicine, it does not mean that one automatically jumps into consultancy.  We have this firm grade in between.  This is a piece of work and they are well placed to lead in it.  In fact, they have done a tremendous amount of work already to prepare for specialisation and for the advanced centres of care coming through.  When we talk about it being a five-year plan, this is a priority - education and training, mentoring, and then moving forward into the advanced centres of care and credentialling those.  This is a key piece of work with the Dental Council.  We have met already and the working group will start to get going in July on it.  We want to start commissioning, certainly early next year, a look at our undergraduate training in the first instance.  We have so much groundwork done on the specialisation.  There is great leadership there.

When dentists graduate, they have an excellent set of skills that enables them to do a wide range of tasks.  There is no evidence that there is any difficulty with that.  If goes to the Dental Council and looks at who is appearing before its fitness to practice committee, complaints from the public or any metric, there is no problem with new graduates.  In fact, in many ways the way they practice may be better and safer than established practitioners.  What they do not have is the broadest experience of treating a wide range of patients about whom we have been talking here, for instance, people with disabilities, very young children and people living in residential care.  If we are looking at a so-called extended year or foundation training, we must look specifically for an Irish system as to the gap needed to be filled here.

As the Senator rightly said, Irish graduates are registered.  It is important to note that many students in the dental schools come from other countries.  As part of an agreement with Canada, the Canadian authorities provide a substantial contribution to the education aspect.  When we talk about people graduating from Irish schools, we are not necessarily talking about Irish people.  Canadian graduates might want to go back to their homes in Canada.  People who came here for their education might want to go back to other areas.  There is a phenomenal degree of mobility in the European Union.  A sizeable majority of those who come here from other European states - I have the figures available - stay beyond five or seven years.  I think our policy on this point aims to give graduates more opportunities to acquire a breadth of skills from the time they graduate.  It is about having a mentored environment for them, not for one, two or three years, even if the work done in these years is of benefit, but for a much longer period.  It is about helping them to establish in practice in order that they can set up principalships in practice after five years.  This is all knowledge nobody is going to gain overnight.  It is important that we focus on the mentoring framework in the long term.  Many other professions have done it.  Ours tends to be very isolated.  This emerged clearly when we consulted dentists.  They told us that they felt isolated from their peers, particularly in rural environments.  That led to a fundamental change in how we were approaching education.  We realised something much more substantial than a one-year programme was needed.  My colleague, the chief dental officer in Britain, is very firm on the point that this is an NHS scheme, rather than an education scheme or an intern scheme.  I think it has been somewhat misrepresented.  She constantly berates me for the misrepresentation of the scheme.  The scheme in the United Kingdom is linked with an NHS practice and attached to that practice only.  If one is entering into private practice as a UK graduate, one enters into practice in the same way as every other European graduate.  The scheme is linked with the NHS system only.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019062600002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Dympna Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":275,"content":"<p>Do we have any information on primary care centres?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019062600002#Q00400","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561503600,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I will speak about them briefly from a policy perspective before handing over to my colleagues from the HSE.

Approximately 13,000 people require complex care at some time.  Access to services is <i>ad hoc<\/i>.  A large number of patients are particularly at risk.  A relatively small number of people are specifically trained to treat such patients, which is an issue.  Access to general anaesthesia is also <i>ad hoc<\/i>.  There are some pockets of brilliance and excellence, but in many other areas there is nothing.  Some people must travel a great distance to a dental hospital or across borders to access treatment.  The dental hospital is not an acute setting as it does not have general anaesthesia facilities.  General anaesthesia is provided throughout the country but it is severely limited and many people with disabilities have their treatment options severely limited by poor access to it.  For example, extraction-only services may be offered or, within the general anaesthesia setting, the patient is not offered root canal, even to save a front tooth.  It is well recognised that there are no well-defined care pathways and not enough people trained to provide the required care.  That needs to be addressed in the policy and there will undoubtedly be a need for more people to be trained in this area.<br\/><br\/>On training at undergraduate level, evidence has shown that we can train people in general practice to do the bulk of the work, but undergraduate is not the time to work on complex patients because students are honing their basic dental skills.  The mentoring of graduates following qualification is extremely important.  Special care dentistry is a specialty.  We offer three-year specialist training on an international basis.  Most Irish graduates travel overseas for training in this area because of its cost in Ireland.  Unlike orthodontics or periodontics, in regard to which people can thereafter go into general practice to earn a living, it is currently difficult to self-fund a expensive course of treatment.<br\/><br\/>On succession planning, I am a consultant but there is no formal recognition for a consultant training pathway to, for example, replace me when I retire in ten years.  The provision of training across the board in this area is a priority and it has been recognised as such.  It is possible to achieve very good levels of care for people with disabilities, as evidenced by the literature.  It will be a challenge, but we know it is possible and the evidence shows that the training is available in Ireland.  We have the methodology and curricula to train our undergraduates, postgraduates and practising dentists to give them the skills to prevent the need for extensive treatment.  We always seek to avoid general anaesthesia being necessary.  Prevention works very well for people with disabilities.  We need general anaesthesia to be available and people to be trained to provide sedation, which opens up bigger options of care than general anaesthesia, but we mainly wish to prevent the necessity of sedation or general anaesthesia by having good, well orientated preventative services in primary care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019062600002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Alison Dougall"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":293,"content":"<p>When RCSI representatives appeared before the committee last month they made the point that only two dental specialties are recognised by the Dental Council of Ireland, whereas 13 are recognised by the equivalent body in England.

In the UK in particular, there is a plethora of specialties.  There is much debate, particularly among my chief dental officer colleagues, about the merits of having multiple specialties in smaller countries such as ours with a population of 4.5 million.  A dentist practising in a specialist limited area needs a body of work to maintain his or her skills and that is a dilemma for us.  Many people first look to the practice in Scandinavian countries, where they have developed a concept of specialist generalist training and are moving away from limited specialties.  Although I do not wish to pre-empt what will be in the policy, practitioners could combine several specialties, which would be of particular benefit to us in respect of rural areas, which are a challenge for us.  It would be difficult for us to appoint a paediatric specialist, a special care specialist and several other specialists to such areas as there would be a shortage of applicants for such posts.<\/p> <p>  To come back to the policy, the advanced care centres provide credentials in this regard.  On a national level, we need a broad range of specialties available to us.  However, if we are looking into the community, we would have to consider that workforce planning in a certain way.  It is important that practitioners maintain their skills.  One of the important concerns raised in the consultation with dentists on the ground was that they are primary care dentists with a broad scope of practice, but feel squeezed by the specialties and auxiliaries coming in and want a clear definition of their scope of practice.  The view of the Dental Council of Ireland is that primary care covers all eventualities unless, as Dr. Dougall rightly pointed out, it is an advanced part of care and this network is required to provide it.  It is a mutual relationship.  We currently only have two specialties and are conforming to EU standards in that regard.  We recognise that more specialties are needed in key areas, but I am unsure whether having 13 specialties would be appropriate for us as we do not have a population of 78 million.  The four key pillars, involving primary care, special care, looking at public health and looking at the advanced centres, such as in the areas of restorative and, perhaps, periodontal care, are key in considering the needs of our communities.

Prevention is therefore of even more value for them.  That treatment risk could also include an assessment of their risks of being treated under general anaesthetic or sedation.  We would seek to avoid the worst possible treatment scenario, where someone is in a hospital for treatment for what is, as Professor O'Connell said, largely a preventable condition.  In transitioning to a revised system, the HSE's priorities would be to try to protect the strengths of the existing service, including a same-day or following day response for anyone who is in pain.  If the HSE service were involved, we would strive to continue to provide that.  That would be our plan, and it would be an upfront requirement in any contracted situation.  However, that might not be the easiest thing to put in place.  We have yet to reach the starting point for all of that, and there would need to be extensive consultation with prospective service providers, our own staff, the Department, and any other stakeholder which might be involved.

I thank Dr. Kavanagh.<\/p> <p>  I have two questions relating to specific areas.  My first, unsurprisingly enough, relates to my own constituency of Dublin Fingal.  Figures from replies to parliamentary questions show that of the 84,000 children who are on waiting lists, there are 4,450 in my own area who have been waiting longer than 52 weeks.  That is the number of children currently in fourth class with no guarantee that they will be offered a screening appointment.  That is clearly very worrying.  I happen to represent the constituency with the fastest-growing population in this State, and possibly even in Europe, so that should be enough.  I see parents in my advice clinics on a weekly basis who are concerned because their children's teeth are deteriorating and they are stuck on waiting lists.  The witnesses know the figures so I am not going to go through every single waiting list, but the list of children waiting for more than 52 weeks jumps out at me.  That is a year.  If someone is due a test in fourth class and they have to wait a year, one does not have to be a genius to figure out that they will not be in fourth class at the end of it.  What happens to these children?  According to the witnesses' own figures, it is highly unlikely they will get the screening.  I talk to their parents, so I know that, in many instances, the money is not there for them to go private.  Why should they have to, aside from the fact that their children are left waiting?  What are the likely outcomes of missing that important appointment for those children?  I presume it is important, otherwise it would not be on the schedule. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019062600002#V01200","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561503600,"counter":362,"content":"<p>Will I deal with the first part first?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019062600002#V01300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joe Green"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":363,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019062600002#V01400","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561503600,"counter":364,"content":"<p>The HSE sets priorities of trying to see children in second class, sixth class, and fourth class if possible.  There are a number of areas in the country where fourth class has not been reached due to capacity, as we discussed earlier.  The amount or increment of treatment that is often required at fourth class is much less if children have been seen in either first or second class.  Focusing on permanent teeth for the moment, if fissure sealants have been placed on the permanent teeth in either first or second class, by fourth class visits would hopefully concentrate more on looking for dental milestones such as the eruption of permanent teeth, occlusion, and reinforcing preventative measures such as dietary advice, advice to parents, tooth brushing, as well as reinforcing good dental attendance.  In the event that children are not seen in fourth class, the increment of decay that may have occurred between second class and fourth class would be the one that could not be treated at that time.  Where possible, those children are followed up on if resources allow, and they would then be seen in either fifth or sixth class, depending on the approach of their local area.  As I said, the outcome of treatment at first or second class is critical.  If those children had been seen, a lot of preventative treatments would have been put in place, and that can help.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019062600002#V01500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joe Green"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Green.

This is a very important piece of legislation and I thank committee members for their time and consideration.<\/p> <p>  I am joined by a number of colleagues: Ms Lorraine O&rsquo;Donoghue and Sinead O&rsquo;Gorman, who have been working hard on the rates Bill, from the local government finance section in the Department; Ms Sheila McMahon, who is here to cover the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act amendments; and Ms Patricia Curran and Mr. Paul Hogan, who are here to cover the planning amendments.  As requested, we have provided advance briefing on these Report Stage amendments to the committee.<\/p> <p>  Commercial rates are a critical source of funding for local authorities, accounting for &euro;1.51 billion, or 32%, of the &euro;4.67 billion expenditure budgeted in the sector in 2018.  The overall aim of this rates Bill is to modernise and improve the rates regime.  In this regard, the drafting process is complex and of necessity, requires significant ongoing consultation with key stakeholders, particularly local authorities and the valuation office.<\/p> <p>  I might just mention that in terms of important provisions not subject to amendment, the Bill provides for the introduction of rates alleviation - waiver - schemes by local authorities, subject to ministerial approval, which can support important policy objectives contained in local, economic, community and land use plans.<\/p><p>The Bill also includes important provisions for collection and enforcement by local authorities.<\/p><p> The Bill was passed on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il on 30 January, at which time a number of amendments were signalled for introduction on Committee Stage.  Report Stage is provisionally scheduled for 3 July.  Committee Stage consideration will take place immediately after this briefing session.  The Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, will be in attendance and it will present an opportunity to discuss important amendments such as those related to the Valuation Acts.  The changes are required to ensure the ongoing national revaluation programme will remain revenue neutral for the local authorities, taking account of the revaluation of utilities on a global basis and the impact of successful appeals to the Valuation Tribunal.  In that context, an amendment to allow the Commissioner of Valuation share the preliminary valuation of Irish Water with the local authorities is time critical to facilitate the calculations for 2020 budgets in local authorities.<\/p><p> A small number of important but mainly technical amendments were not ready for tabling on Committee Stage, but it is intended to introduce them on Report Stage.  There will be a number of further amendments relevant to the Bill.  Furthermore, amendments to the Planning and Development Acts, the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 and the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 are proposed.  Amendments to the rates regime are proposed to enhance notification procedures and provision for additions and amendments to the valuation list to be immediately effective for rating purposes, given that there is currently a delay.  A possible further amendment remains subject to drafting.  <\/p><p> An amendment to the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 is required to overcome a risk that might allow the definition of an \"owner of student accommodation\" to be construed in a manner that could circumvent the intention of the Act.  The amendment is required prior to the imminent planned commencement of the student accommodation provisions.  Technical amendments related to the timing of the commencement of the student accommodation provisions will also be required.  An amendment to the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 will be required to provide an alternative route for protected structures to qualify, further to substantial refurbishment works, for exemption from rent increase restrictions in rent pressure zones, RPZs, because they would be unlikely to qualify under the provisions recently enacted in the 2019 Act.  The objective is to eliminate any potential negative impact on the planned refurbishment of protected structures in the rental sector.<\/p><p> An amendment will be required to the Planning and Development Act 2000 to address transitional issues following the establishment of the Office of the Planning Regulator.  It is a time-critical amendment in the context of the ongoing development of regional spatial and economic strategies, RSESs, by regional assemblies.  A further minor technical amendment will be proposed to underpin the special provisions for Cork city and county councils to extend the period for review of their development plans to incorporate RSESs into their plans.  A possible amendment to the Local Government Act 1998 to reinsert a provision inadvertently deleted which empowers the Exchequer to pay into the Local Government Fund is no longer deemed to be required following further legal advice on the matter.<\/p><p> I thank the committee.  We look forward to the discussion.  We have provided some more detail in the briefing note on the proposed amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019062600002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Quinlan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":397,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Quinlan and our other guests for their attendance.  While I do not mean to criticise anyone, there is a certain degree of dissatisfaction among committee members.  Yet again, we have been notified of Report Stage amendments that we will not have a chance to scrutinise in committee.  I appreciate that the idea in Mr. Quinlan appearing before the committee is to fill in at least part of the gap, for which we are grateful, but the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, should hear loud and clear the view of the committee that it would have been much better if the amendments had been brought through the full and proper process of Committee and Report Stages.  Nevertheless, we have always been flexible as a committee and do not wish to stand in the way of important amendments.<\/p> <p>  I have concerns about two of the proposed Report Stage amendments and would like to hear more about them.  While the amendments related to student accommodation and rates seem to bebroadly sensible, my concern is with the protected structures and RPZs.  If I understand the problem correctly, it is that the building energy rating, BER, requirements included in the new definition of \"substantial refurbishment\" cause a difficulty in the case of pre-1963 properties because they are exempt from BER upgrades.  Would it not have made more sense to simply remove the provision of a new definition of \"substantial refurbishment\" from the criteria for pre-1963 properties to be eligible for substantial refurbishment?  Was this considered, or have I misunderstood the position?  Why is the solution to the problem a requirement to have been outside the rental market for 12 months rather than 24?<\/p> <p>  I also have a concern about the RSESs.  We will again give a significant power to the Minister.  Although I do not want to return to the debate, the purpose in creating a planning regulator was to shift the overconcentration of power from the hands of the Minister and the Department, to which the Mahon tribunal had rightly pointed.  In the case of the current RSES processes, however, the amendment would allow the Minister to issue a direction to the regional assemblies to take such specified measures as he or she might require for the plan.  That seems to be another significant shift in power towards the Minister and an undermining of the regional and local authorities.  What is Mr. Quinlan's response?  I am open to supporting both amendments on Report Stage, but I struggle with these two questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019062600002#B00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":398,"content":"<p>On global revaluations, the Valuation Office is carrying out the valuation of Irish Water and there have been some indications of how the valuation will be broken down for each local authority.  I have heard that population size might be used in calculating the figure.  I have also heard indications that, by coincidence, the valuation may end up being the same as the current total valuation of Irish Water.  That will be interesting if it turns out to be the case.  If the figure is divided by population, counties such as Wicklow will lose out significantly.  In fairness, Wicklow County Council rated all of its water infrastructure in its books, whereas I understand a number of councils did not rate any of their water infrastructure.  Is there a question mark over the current valuation of Irish Water, given that some councils did not carry out a valuation?  When the Valuation Office gives its valuation of Irish Water, who will decide how to apportion it and how will it be done?  If it is apportioned according to population size, what will happen to the likes of County Wicklow which will probably lose approximately &euro;1.6 million in commercial rates?

They apply to pre-1963 structures but it is just the protected structures within that and this has to do with a technical issue.  The BER system emanates from an EU directive and the regulations were made under the 1972 Act.  That means the regulations can only be applied as a requirement as opposed to an optional facility.  They cannot be used like that.  It turned out that the only way protected structures could qualify for the exemption would be either more than 25% of the property was refurbished or they met all three of the exemptions relating to adaptation for disabled people, an increase in the layout and an increase in the number of rooms.  Effectively, that would have meant it would have been very difficult for protected structures to quality under the grounds of the change in the substantial refurbishment works.  To provide an alternative way in which this subset of buildings in the rental sector could qualify, so that there would not be a deterrent effect on doing needed refurbishment work, this amendment is being introduced whereby if it is a case that there has not been a tenancy in the building for 12 months prior to the new tenancy that commences after the works, there will be an exemption from the application of the 4% rent increase restriction in the rent pressure zones, RPZs.  This is an alternative.  It will still be two years for every other building.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019062600002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Sheila McMahon"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":403,"content":"<p>Does the amendment only deal with protected structures rather than the generality of the pre-1963 structures?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019062600002#C00400","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561503600,"counter":404,"content":"<p>Yes.

Up until 3 April of this year what is envisaged is a power that the Minister has always had.  Up until now the Department, on behalf of the Minister, has been fully engaged in all three regional spatial strategy processes.  All three processes are well advanced.  In fact, the east and midlands regional strategy is due to be published on Friday.  The process is that well advanced and is almost complete.<\/p> <p>  The problem is that the legislation that we now have has made the involvement of the Minister in the process at this stage subject to the involvement of the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, from the outset in the process, which can never be achieved because we cannot turn the clock back.  This arises because this legislation was published in 2016 and enacted last year.  It was always envisaged that the OPR would be in place before the RSESs kicked off but the office was not in place and it did not happen like that.  They have travelled down the road and the regulator has come in pretty much three quarters of the way through all of the processes.  As I said, the legislation envisages the regulator being given notice, making submissions and being very clear about what the issues are and what his or her office wants to see done all the way through and then, on foot of that either happening or not happening, making a recommendation to the Minister at the very end for the Minister to act.  The Department, on behalf of the Minister, has been involved to date in line with legislation that was there until 3 April.  This amendment simply seeks to put a once-off interim arrangement in place for the current round of RSESs, all of which are at a slightly different stage, and simply enable the process, as it was prior to 3 April, to be concluded as it would have been.  However, there is one new addition, which enables the Minister to invite the regulator to issue an advisory report to him or her.  That is seen as something that would enable at least the advice of the regulator's office to be brought in to the current process.  It is a new provision but it gets us over the problem of the regulator not having been involved all of the way through and having things on the record that he said.  There is an issue about legal consistency where one cannot have someone coming in at the 11th hour raising new issues or whatever.  The ability to involve the regulator is the only new element, otherwise it is just putting the clock back to prior to 3 April.  The regulator's office is only recruiting staff now so the reality is there will not be a significant capacity there to undertake what was envisaged even if we could set the clock back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019062600002#C02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Hogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":420,"content":"<p>Why do it in the first place?

It may have been discussed earlier but I wish to outline the provisions of those amendments.  Section 10 is about notification procedures and the amendment will enhance the existing provisions of the section to ensure there is an obligation on ratepayers to register with the local authority and to notify it of any material changes in respect of rateable properties.  A difficulty in obtaining such information, for example, concerning a change of occupier or a change in the legal name of the business, has proven to be a barrier to the effective levying and collection of rates for many local authorities, placing a clear statutory obligation on the occupier-ratepayer and this amendment will mitigate that.<\/p><p>The amendment to section 4 relates to the making of the rate process and the provision for additions and amendments to the valuation lists and changes to occupation to be immediately effective for rating purposes.  Currently rates are levied on properties that exist on the valuation list on the date of the making of the local authority budget.  This means that additions of new properties or amendments to the valuation lists during the year are not effective for rates until the following financial year and the following budget year.  It is, therefore, proposed to amend section 4 to allow for additions and amendments to the valuation lists to become immediately effective for rating purposes.<\/p><p>A further amendment to section 4 provides that where a person becomes the occupier or enters into an agreement which entitles him or her to occupy the relevant property on a date after 1 January in any year, a local authority should charge that person a charge adjusted to reflect the remaining period of the year.  Currently the person in occupation on the date of the making of the rate is liable for the entire year.  This is an anomaly which the amendment seeks to address.  It is now proposed that the local authority should adjust the charge or demand issue to the person who was in occupation on 1 January or after 1 January where there were more than one previous occupier in that year, so that the charge for the full year is apportioned between the different occupiers during the year on a<i>pro rata<\/i>basis.  <\/p><p>The introduction of a rates compliant certificate will mean that if a ratepayer seeking a certain licence from a particular local authority, he or she may be required to demonstrate to that same authority that the rates bill has either been paid or is subject to a payment plan.  This measure is intended to facilitate a more joined up approach within individual local authorities without being overly burdensome and as a measure to encourage business to meet their rates obligations and to engage with local authorities.  Subject to the drafting being finalised this amendment will introduce the concept of this rates compliance certificate for the first time and can be kept under review in terms of its effectiveness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019062600002#J00700","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1561503600,"counter":543,"content":"<p>SECTION 1<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":544,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 1 and 15 are related and will be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019062600002#J00800","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":545,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p><blockquote>In page 5, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:<br \/><br \/>&ldquo; &ldquo;Act of 2015&rdquo; means the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015;&rdquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>Amendment No. 1 is a technical amendment and is included to cater for an amendment to section 20.  Section 20 is being expanded to include two separate references to the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015.<\/p><p> I will now turn to amendment No. 15.  Currently, rates are levied on properties on the valuation that exists on the date of the making of the local authority budget.  This means that the addition of new properties - this refers in part to what I said earlier - or amendments to the valuation list during the year are not effective for rates until the financial year following the making of the budget.  Amendment No. 15, as set out in the proposed expanded section 20, subsection (a), provides that additions and amendments to the valuation list become immediately effective for rating purposes.<\/p><p> As for the proposed sections 20(b) and 20(c), currently there are differences in the timeframes allowed to public utilities undertakings and other ratepayers as set out in the Valuation Act.  There are no objectively justifiable reasons that different or more generous time periods should be given to public utility companies, as opposed to private citizens or to citizens with businesses.  The current provisions in this regard appear to give rise to different treatment for different categories of ratepayers.  The proposed amendments to sections 53 and 54 address this and ensure an equitable and more efficient streamlined process for all ratepayers.<\/p><p> The proposed section 20(d) is about rate limitation orders, which was also discussed earlier.  It concerns section 56 of the Valuation Act and amends the formula on which rate limitation orders are based.  There are two elements to the formula.  First, the rate limitation order is introduced for local authorities following a revaluation process to ensure the revaluation is revenue neutral.  Revaluation results in a redistribution of commercial rates liability between ratepayers depending on the relative shift in the rental value of the properties in relation to one another.  In practice, however, local authorities lose out on income from successful appeals to the Valuation Tribunal, which means the revaluation exercise is not revenue neutral as intended.  To mitigate this, it is intended to amend the rate limitation order formula to allow for the inclusion of a factor that takes account of the level of appeals.  It is proposed to add this factor in order that the upper limit of rates income in the year following revaluation is raised slightly to take account of leakage on the appeal following revaluation.  The factor would be agreed annually by the Minister and by the Commissioner of Valuation.<\/p><p> The second part, which is a further amendment to the formula for calculating rates limitation orders, is also proposed.  As it is currently worded, section 56 has the unintended consequence of linking the standard revaluation programme, which is carried out on a cyclical basis, with the valuation cycle for global utility companies.  This has a particularly acute impact for any county or local authority undergoing a standard revaluation that coincides with a new valuation of a global utility.  It means that the mandatory rate limitation order will limit the rates income from that utility.  The global utilities are network based operators with a national presence and include telecommunications operators, ESB, EirGrid and Irish Rail.  Irish Water will become a global utility in the coming months and is currently being revalued for this purpose.  Authorities being revalued currently stand to lose out from any additional rates income from Irish Water at a potential cost of significant sums.  Included in the revaluation process at the moment are Fingal, Tipperary, Meath, Wicklow, Wexford, Louth, Cavan and Monaghan.  The addition of the second portion of the formula for the rates limitation order calculation will ensure the buoyancy achieved for new or revised global utility evaluations can be accounted for in the formula, which sets the upper limit for rates income in the following year.  In other words, it will accrue to the local authority and they will not have to balance it out with other existing ratepayers, and therefore will potentially see a rate reduction for some of the utility companies.  That is an unintended consequence of the current system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019062600002#J00900","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":547,"content":"<p>We had a fairly detailed conservation on amendment No. 15.

In order for the local authority to not lose out from losing those appeals and for the overall rates income to be revenue neutral, it means that somebody else will have to pay more.  Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify how that will operate and how it will impact on the local authority, given that many of the people who appeal the rate increase through a revaluation do not necessarily pay the rates until the appeal is concluded.  What happens if other people who did not get a rates increase then get hit with a rates increase in order to meet the revenue neutrality that is set out in this?

The idea behind the proposed section 20(d) is as the Deputy has said.  The legislation as currently worded would allow for that situation to occur every number of years where a revaluation of utilities coincides with a revaluation of X number of local authorities.  This would see any potential increase - or buoyancy - from revenue received in rates from the utilities offset against other existing rates received from existing businesses in their local area.  The main purpose of section 20(d), as proposed in amendment No. 15,  is to ensure that this loophole is covered off.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also referred to the appeals process and he makes a valid point.  Talk is ongoing between departmental officials and the Valuation Office to ensure staffing levels will be sufficient to allow for valuations to occur and for appeals to be heard in a timely fashion.  When the revaluation process was introduced originally, as everybody is aware, it was intended to be a revenue-neutral change and that any increases would be offset by decreases to other ratepayers in the local authority area.<\/p> <p>  On the length of time for appeals to be heard, members who deal with local authority members will know that when rates are agreed at budget meetings in the local authority, sometimes - even with the best of intentions by members and officials - if there are a number of appeals outstanding and if there are appeals that have been successful, it has led to a situation where the cost has not always been neutral with a resulting loss or reduction on the books of the local authority in terms of the potential income it thought it was going to accrue from commercial rates.<\/p><p>Part of amendment No. 15 is designed as an attempt to ensure that such revenue neutrality will occur into the future.  It does not fully occur at present but varies from local authority to local authority.  Amendment No. 15 refers to the change that will allow for another figure or factor to be used in respect of the volume of appeals and the difference between what was agreed by the local authority at budget time and what it can sometimes turn out to be.  The purpose of that particular section of the amendment is to ensure that this shortfall is as small as possible and may be fully eliminated.  I hope that answers some of what Deputy &Oacute; Broin has asked.<\/p><p> As to Deputy Casey's point, the process of valuation for Irish Water has not been completed yet.  Off the top of my head, Wicklow has significant water infrastructure, which serves a far greater region than Wicklow alone and that obviously would be a reason for Wicklow to have a greater commercial rate potential from Irish Water than most other local authorities.   <\/p><p> I fully agree with the Deputy, and it is his entitlement, to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage that Wicklow would see a commensurate benefit from that Irish Water revaluations process when it is completed.  As to whether it will be offset, there is a further job to be done in the local government section as to how the Local Government Fund is administered in future.  I believe everyone present has been a member of the local authority at some stage and understands the number of movable parts that currently exist in the local authority fund, many of which are grossly outdated at this stage.  We need a more simplified, streamlined method of allocating local authority funding that is more easily explicable to the public.  That might well mean that a situation like the Deputy has outlined as to some of the buoyancy that is obtained from utility companies in the future would be distributed in a different manner.  I do not want to pre-empt whatever the ultimate outcome would be by completely agreeing with Deputy Casey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019062600002#K00600","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1561503600,"counter":555,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1561503600,"counter":556,"content":"<p>Section 1, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1561503600,"counter":557,"content":"<p>Sections 2 and 3 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1561503600,"counter":558,"content":"<p>SECTION 4<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":559,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 2 to 7, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019062600002#L00700","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":560,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 2:<\/p><blockquote>In page 6, line 32, to delete &ldquo;who owns&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;who is for the time being entitled to occupy&rdquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>Amendment No. 2 is again a technical amendment to amend the definition of &quot;owner&quot; to link it with the established definition in rating practice.  An earlier definition of &quot;owner&quot; already exists in rating law exists in section 14 of the Local Government Act 1946 which defines the owner as the person for the time being entitled to occupy a vacant hereditament at the time of the making of the rate, which is old rates wordage.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 3 is another technical amendment and relates to deleting in page 6 line 34, &quot;Notice of&quot; and substituting &quot;A rates bill stating&quot;.  It is preferable to describe the notice that is being issued seeking payment of the rates as a rates bill.  The phrase, &quot;rates bill&quot; is the term already used in current rating legislation.  In Article 25 of the Local Government (Financial Procedures and Audit) Regulations 2014 &quot;rates bill&quot; is distinctive, self-explanatory and stands from out other statutory notices served by local authorities.  The number of rates bills that are issued also vastly exceeds any other statutory notice and are therefore worthy of a distinct title.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 4  is effectively the same amendment, which is to delete &quot;the notice&quot; and substitute &quot;the rates bill&quot; for exactly the same reasons that I have just outlined.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 5 is the same amendment, which is, in page 7, line 6, to delete &ldquo;A notice&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;A rates bill&rdquo;, with the very same explanation.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 6 proposes, on page 7, line 11, to delete &ldquo;in a prepaid registered letter&rdquo;.  The number of rates bills served by local authorities is considerable.  It is some 5,000 to 6,000 in the case of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown Council and multiples of this in the case of Dublin City Council.  In the event that a rates bill could not be served by ordinary post, the efficiency of the current rates recovery process would be affected to a major extent.  This would result in significant delay in the recovery of rates and the need for local authorities to apply further resources for the purpose of serving rates bills upon occupiers of rated properties who have refused to accept the service of a rates bill by registered post.<\/p><p>Amendment  No. 7 is also a technical amendment to allow for a rates bill to be addressed to the owner or occupier, if the name of the liable person is not known.

The compelling case for this change is that, if an owner rents a premises to a person who runs a business in it and the latter decides to cease trading for whatever reason, rates legislation has always operated to the effect that the latter is the person on whom the liability falls.

The Minister of State well knows that the impact on a business of a revaluation and significant increase, a situation caused by the Valuation Office not having kept pace with the process in recent years, is massive and can be very detrimental to a small business.  The thrust of this amendment allows for the staggered payment of rates so that a business is allowed to meet a significant increase over a period of time instead of being hit with it in one go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019062600002#M02100","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":586,"content":"<p>Deputy Cassells is right.  There is not a Member of the House, be he or she in government or anywhere else, who does not get many queries from constituents on this issue, particularly in local authority areas that have undergone the revaluation process.  The Deputy is right to point out the number of appeals and the delays in same.  We have a responsibility to ensure that commercial rates bring &euro;1.4 billion into the local authority sector.  Were that figure adjusted downward significantly, it would have serious consequences for our local government system.<\/p> <p>  It is my intention in the autumn to deal specifically with the valuation side of this process.  As practitioners, we all know that rates and valuations are two sides of the same coin.  The Commissioner of Valuation operates independently of the Government and every elected politician, local and national.  That is important, as the job the commissioner must do should be completely independent of politics.  Equally, however, the Oireachtas has a responsibility to review from time to time the legislation underpinning the valuations process.  That is why I am determined to do so in the autumn of this year.  I will not use the word \"anomalies\", but there are a number of pinch points in certain sectors of the economy, particularly in small rural communities and villages where there is only a business or two that, in effect, can often act as a social service as much as commercial operations.<\/p><p>Other arms of Government - for example, the Minister, Deputy Ring's Department and the local government section - are constantly trying to do their utmost to improve the quality of life for people in these communities throughout the country and sometimes it can seem that commercial rate provisions do not have the same interests at heart, and they do not.  There is a conflict there.  The rating system is designed to ensure a level playing field or an even system is operated across the country in the way we collect commercial rates.  Equally, with respect not only to isolated rural areas but to some of the more deprived urban centres in towns and cities across the country where smaller business premises have closed in recent years, there is a desire, politically, across all sides for those local businesses to be retained and to ensure that valuation rules or anything around them would not be a contributory factor to the closure of such business.  In the autumn of this year it is very much my intention that we would bring forward legislation on valuations.<\/p><p> To answer specifically the amendment in the name of Deputy Darragh O'Brien proposed by Deputy Cassells, the Valuation Acts provide for the revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in value due to economic factors such as business turnover, differential movements in property values or other external factors and changes in the local business environment.  The Department has been informed that the general outcome of the revaluations conducted to date by the Valuation Office is that approximately 60% of ratepayers have had their liability reduced following a revaluation and 40% have had their liability increased, which is expected to be replicated elsewhere as the national programme advances.<\/p><p> With respect to reported cases where the rates liability has increased by multiples of the original bill, the Department has been informed that while such increases may have occurred in some isolated cases, increases of this level would be a rarity.  Possible reasons for significant increases where they occur would be that the valuation of some of these properties had not been revised to take account of improvement, extensions, etc., for some considerable time or where the valuations were historically low in comparison to the general level of valuations on the valuation list.<\/p><p> Additionally, some properties may have undergone extensive refurbishment and this was not reflected in the valuation immediately before the revaluation that is now in train.  It is not the purpose of a revaluation to increase the total amount of commercial rates collected by the local authorities.  Section 56 of the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015 provides that the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government having obtained the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is obliged to make an order directing a rating authority to limit the overall amount of income it could raise through rates in the year following a revaluation to the total amount of rates liable to be paid in the previous year, plus buoyancy arising from valuations determined in the year of a revaluation of newly constructed property and adjusted for inflation as measured by the consumer price index, CPI.<\/p><p> Rate limitation orders have been made in each local authority that has undergone a revaluation to date and further orders will be made in respect of future revaluations as they arise.  Ultimately, any undue or contrived delay in achieving up to date valuations in line with current property rental values would result in unfairness in the levelling of rates.  A proposal to phase in increases in valuations over a number of years would either see the shortfall in rates income being made up by other ratepayers in the form of higher rates bills or would be absorbed by the local authorities.  In light of that, it is not my intention to accept this amendment.  <\/p><p> We will have to examine in some detail the valuations system in the fall of this year.  There is already a review of some of the exemptions that currently exist under the Valuation Acts under way, to which I would have referred in a few of my responses to parliamentary questions.  We, as an Oireachtas, should ensure we have legislation in place to take on board that review.  I believe we can do that in the fall of this year.  It need not necessarily be major legislation but it could deal some of the issues Deputy Darragh O'Brien's amendment seeks to address, which is to avoid a situation where there can be severe increases on individuals.  Sometimes there can be a significant delay in the hearing of appeals and the process of revaluation is a little slower than we would like.  In that proposed legislation we should be able to address some of those concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019062600002#M02200","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":588,"content":"<p>I will briefly speak to the amendment.

While the Minister of State mentioned that properties could have had improvements carried out and extensions added, the critical factor is that a revaluation had not been carried out in Wicklow during the past 30 years.  The fundamental problem is that revaluations do not take place often enough.  I have been contacted by owners of several properties facing a 300% to 400% increase in their rates liability for no reason other than they are located on a street that has seen much improvement in that period while they have not made any improvements to their properties.  It is hard for a small business to take that hit and to be asked to do so in one year.  This amendment seeks to harmonise that liability over a period of time.  In the absence of the legislation the Minister of State proposes to the Valuation Office, a harmonisation measure such as that proposed in the amendment is required.  I speak from my experience in Wicklow when we had to harmonise the town council rate with the local authority rates and we had a similar situation with properties decreasing in value and other properties increasing in value.  Therefore, it is possible to harmonise rates over a period of time when we can examine the figure with which we are dealing at the end of the day.  I went into family businesses that were on their knees when they got their revaluations.  It is not acceptable to say there is nothing in place to assist small businesses to deal with the shock of the impact of a revaluation that is not of their own making.  This is the State&rsquo;s fault.  It does not have a proper revaluation system.  It was nearly 40 years since Wicklow had a revaluation carried out.  My business suffered a 100% increase as result of its revaluation.  We had not had a revaluation in more than 20 years.  We, as a party, will be pushing this amendment.

Meath had a revaluation this year, as had Wicklow, and Westmeath and Longford had revaluations last year.  I kept all the local newspapers from that period.  Individual businesses had significant increases and they were certainly not rarities.  If the Minister of State has been told they were rarities he has been wrongly advised.  Certain businesses such as public houses and so forth were hit with multiple increases which have the potential to close those businesses.  That is what this amendment seeks to address.  People want to pay the charges being levied on them but the issue the way they can do so.  The Minister of State admitted in his response to me that a phasing arrangement should be examined.

I understand the Commissioner of Valuation engaged in a process with vintners groups whereby some of those difficulties were ironed out or an agreement was reached that was more acceptable to the vintners.  Following a number of requests to the Commissioner of Valuation in recent months, he indicated regarding the fuel retail sector that consultation and engagement were ongoing between the Valuation Office and the representative group of the fuel retail sector, the Irish Petrol Retailers Association, IPRA.  The commissioner has agreed to consider adjustments to the valuation scheme for service stations, including changes that would result in reductions in valuations based on detailed evidence to be provided by the IPRA.  That process is under way.<\/p> <p>  More broadly, the Valuation Office engages in ongoing consultation with other sectoral groups on the methodology used in the revaluation programme.  In that context, the commissioner has committed to fully examining any additional detailed information provided by sporting or equestrian bodies.  A number of Members of both Houses were made aware of issues among sporting and equestrian bodies caused by significant increases arising from the revaluation process.  The Commissioner of Valuation has indicated that in sectors where significant community and voluntary services are provided along with commercial activities, he is open to considering adjustments to the valuation scheme, including changes that would result in reductions in valuations based on detailed evidence to be provided by the sectoral representative bodies.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the Commissioner of Valuation's engagement with the vintners' representatives, service station representative groups and sporting bodies to try to iron out some of the significant issues that have emerged in the revaluation process.  I always felt that it was crazy that voluntary bodies were levied with commercial rates when certain exemptions from rates are provided under the valuation legislation for activities which, on the face of it, appear to be commercial in nature.  To return to my earlier point, that is the reason we will need legislation on valuation in the autumn.  The commissioner's engagement has the potential to deal with some of the issues raised in the amendment.<\/p> <p>  I reiterate that a full review of staffing is under way to identify additional numbers that may be needed to ensure the revaluation process is speeded up.  Deputy Casey is correct.  I do not know the exact figure for Wicklow but it could well be 30 or 40 years since the previous revaluation in the county.  The target is to try to have a revaluation process approximately every seven years.  That would avoid the emergence of significant spikes in rates, such as those with which every Member of the Oireachtas has been presented.  In light of that, I am not in a position to accept the amendment, although I accept many of the issues that gave rise to it.  Some of these matters are being addressed, while others will be addressed in legislation in the autumn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019062600002#O00200","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"vote","time":1561503600,"counter":594,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 2; N\u00edl, 2.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p><\/p><p>Amendment declared .<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019062600002#O00500","aye":["1357","1218"],"nay":["1246","1265"],"abs":[]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1561503600,"counter":595,"content":"<p>Staon: Deputies Mick Barry and Eoin &Oacute; Broin.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":596,"content":"<p>Standing Order 97(1) negatives a question when there is an equality of votes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019062600002#O00700","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1561503600,"counter":597,"content":"<p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1561503600,"counter":598,"content":"<p>Section 5 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1561503600,"counter":599,"content":"<p>Sections 6 and 7 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1561503600,"counter":600,"content":"<p>SECTION 8<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":601,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 9:<\/p><blockquote>In page 9, line 35, to delete &ldquo;therefor&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;at a reasonable rent therefor&rdquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>This technical amendment adds &quot;at a reasonable rent&quot; to the definition of &quot;vacant property&quot; in this section.

I understand the motivation behind it, but the budgetary process that a local authority undergoes takes place in a tight time period.  It is also the case that, where local elected representatives are given a mandate to make decisions, they often complain - I receive such complaints - that their hands are tied too much on issues.  They have a free hand in how they operate and vote and in the decisions they take in the formation of budgets.<\/p><p>Under the legislation governing rates currently, a local authority may provide up to 100% relief on rates where a premises is vacant due to renovation, repairs or the owner being unable to find a tenant.  Outside the city councils of Dublin, Cork and Limerick, which historically had separate legal provisions enabling a refund of 50% on vacant properties, the practice has generally been for elected members to give 100% relief.  The introduction of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 gave discretion to the elected members of an authority to vary the rate refund levels applicable to individual areas within the authority's administrative area.  The lack of any charge on vacant premises may act as a disincentive for the property to be put to its best use.  Vacancy refunds also introduce a level of uncertainty regarding the revenue that a local authority can collect.<\/p><p>Section 8 provides that a local authority may provide for a temporary abatement for vacant properties subject to any maximum relief, which may be specified by the Minister, to ensure that all property owners other than those whose rates liability would be below the <i>de minimis <\/i>threshold may make some level of payment to the local authority.  The section allows the Minister to prescribe that the maximum level of relief can be further reduced by individual local authorities.  To incentivise the elected members, it is proposed that the revenue accruing from further reduction in the vacancy refund beyond this level would be added to the general allocations of the municipal districts in the local authorities.<\/p><p>A public consultation provision as envisaged by the amendment would be similar to the one in place in advance of the annual setting by a local authority of the local adjustment factor in respect of the LPT.  The public consultation on the LPT adjustment factor enhances the strength of the relationship between local authorities and local electorates.  I accept that public consultation during the development of a scheme for the abatement of rates on vacant properties can similarly strengthen the process, but the amendment as drafted inserts a new regulation-making power for the Minister under the proposed section 8(13).  Section 8(3) provides regulation-making power for the Minister for the purposes of this section and it would appear that this amendment would be more properly located in that subsection.  I am happy to accept the thinking behind the amendment, but it should be redrafted for insertion into section 8(3) on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019062600002#P00700","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":605,"content":"<p>Notwithstanding the Minister of State's comments, the amendment is eminently sensible.  There are pros and cons to an abatement decision.<\/p><p>One of the pros is the benefit to the local businesses or the ratepayers but one of the negatives is the potential loss of revenue to the local authority and the resultant impact.  Having a consultation process would allow some of those issues to be teased out.  When I was on South Dublin County Council we found a way to have an abatement, effectively, even though that was not what it was called.  We operated a kind of survey for small and medium-sized businesses and that worked well.  We found, however, that the level of take-up from small and medium-sized businesses was low.  It was difficult for us to get the injection of cash back out to those small and medium-sized enterprises.  If we had public consultation that might have increased the take-up in the first and second years.  It was not a great deal of money for some businesses but it was certainly better than nothing.  I am, therefore, minded to support this amendment or one from officials that might be better drafted.  The principle is a good one.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019062600002#P00800","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":607,"content":"<p>The Minister of State accepts the thrust of what we are trying to do.

It seeks to make regulations regarding an inability to pay clause for rateable premises.  In our earlier discussions the Minister of State spoke about the money being brought in from rates as amounting to &euro;1.5 billion.  That is funding 34% of the total local government budget.  It is a significant amount of money and that has increased by some 14% over the last decade alone.  I have consistently stated, in the Chamber and different committees, my fear that that money from rates is becoming a significant crutch for local authorities in how they source their funding.  In that context, every year the Minister requests the councils to show restraint regarding increases, apply that restraint and ensure that they are fair on businesses.  Some councils, however, in seeking to do imaginative works beyond the norm, will seek the only source of funding available and that is rates.  As a result some people are unable to pay the rates and this is at a time when we are trying to promote local businesses outside of the main city centres.  We have seen the impact on small towns and villages throughout Ireland.  Anyone canvassing during the local and European elections would have seen that major impact.  <\/p><p>The Minister of State mentioned earlier what the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, is trying to do.  The nuts and bolts of the situation, however, are that people do not have the cash to open their businesses because of debts and that is killing town centres.  Certain towns are doing well and powering along but there are also many that are not.  The imbalance and disparity between the bigger and the smaller ones is growing.  In that context, this inability to pay clause should be inserted into the Bill.  I pay tribute to directors of finances throughout the country who are trying, on an <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis, to work with premises experiencing difficulties.  There are councils, chief executives and directors of finance trying their best to ensure that those experiencing difficulties are given a fair shake.  We should put those efforts on a statutory footing and acknowledge the impact.  An inability to pay clause should be inserted into the Bill.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019062600002#Q01300","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":619,"content":"<p>I argue, in a sense, that the provisions in this legislation will allow for those discussions.  The inability to pay clause is, effectively, being inserted into the Bill, albeit by a different mechanism, to some extent where a ratepayer has entered into an agreed payment plan.  The provisions under section 11 of the Bill are based on the provisions of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which provide for the addition of interest to unpaid taxes to the Revenue Commissioners and in this respect aims to see rates treated on a similar basis.  This measure is proposed as a further incentive to promote compliance with the payment of rates.  There is no current legal provision for the imposition of a penalty for the late payment of rates.<\/p> <p>  The non-availability of a sanction, such as the charging of interest on late payments of rates, is regarded by rating authorities as a major weakness in rating law.  It is considered that the charging of interest on the late payments of rates would be an effective method of accelerating collection within the current year and improving cash flow.  The interest would accrue from 1 January of the following year and would only apply where a ratepayer refuses to enter into an agreed payment plan with the local authority.  As such the introduction of interest on unpaid rates is focussed on incentivising engagement with the local authority rather than increasing the income of local authorities.  <\/p> <p>  Local authorities have a long-standing record, as the Deputy has outlined, of working closely with businesses experiencing difficulty in the payment of commercial rates.  I reiterate that one of the main provisions in this legislation is that the penalty will only apply where people do not enter into that agreed payment plan with local authorities.  Generally speaking, local authority officials do use discretion with regard to genuine cases of people and businesses with an inability to pay.  I have reservations about the creation of a statutory position whereby an inability to pay is put on the books in the manner proposed by this particular amendment.  The current level of discretion should continue to be operated by the council officials.  That is particularly the case in respect of agreements reached with businesses that may be in difficulty but that have agreed a plan to pay their commercial rates over a period of time.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019062600002#Q01400","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":620,"content":"<p>The last few comments by the Minister of State give us the essence of this matter.  I agree that in many cases chief executives and directors of finance are showing that discretion around the country.  It is not always the case, however.  In my own county we have a chief executive who is a former head of finance and our head of finance works closely in that regard as well.  That works well but it is not the experience nationwide, however.  This process needs to be established on a formal footing.  That is because, outside of the greater Dublin area which is experiencing growth and doing well, there is whole different area that needs to be examined.  Putting this process on a statutory footing would focus the mind regarding the severe pressures that some people are under.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019062600002#Q01500","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":621,"content":"<p>Is the amendment being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019062600002#Q01600","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":622,"content":"<p>Yes, it is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019062600002#Q01700","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":623,"content":"<p>I will make two brief comments.  I have sympathy with the intent of the amendment but I do not support the mechanism by which this is being done.  We must keep in mind that any such exemption could potentially have a significant impact on the revenue coming into a local authority or, more important, it could have a significant impact on local authorities during an economic downturn for example.  Part of the difficulty with our rates system is that its value is that it gives local authorities a consistent source of revenue regardless of the economic cycle.  The difficulty is that that creates a challenge for businesses.<\/p> <p>  Nobody has yet found a way to marry those two things, though many people have tried.  I would prefer a mechanism whereby local authorities at particular times could use the abatement process to make democratic decisions about particular problems in particular sectors or locations and they can do that in the full knowledge of the revenue consequences for them.  I would prefer that they have some mechanism to do that.  It would then be possible, at least, to make those local decisions.  I would worry that, even with the best will in the world, if the Minister were to make such regulations it might not be possible to apply them sensibly in each local authority area.<\/p><p>I get the Deputy&rsquo;s intention but I do not think his amendment solves this particular problem.  During the depth of the recession, local rates officers and managers in a significant number of local authorities took pragmatic decisions to keep businesses alive.  They were in fact beaten up by some politicians in this House because rates collection levels fell significantly.  Deputy Cassells is correct, however, that this did not happen everywhere.  Anything which potentially reduces the revenue of a local authority without it having some control over it, particularly its elected members, is a matter we should caution against.

the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 and Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019.  The changes relating to the recently enacted section 37 of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 are primarily technical but also to close off a potential means of circumventing the application of aspects of the 2004 Act, such as registration, dispute resolution and rent increase restrictions in rent pressure zones to student-specific accommodation occupied under licence.  Technical amendments are also proposed to clarify that the student-specific accommodation provisions and the provisions requiring annual registration can come into force separately.  The student-specific accommodation provisions are intended to commence in mid-July, prior to the late commencement of the provisions requiring annual registration that are expected to commence in the first quarter of 2020.  That explains the urgency to address this issue before the summer recess.<\/p><p>The 2019 Act also amended section 19 of the 2004 Act to specify the types of substantial refurbishment works warranting a higher rent level which could qualify for exemption from the rent increase restrictions that operate in rent pressure zones as protected structures are unable to qualify for exemptions on the basis of works to approving their building energy renting.  It is proposed to further amend section 19(5A) of the 2004 Act to allow the first rent set under the tenancy of the protected structure dwelling not rented in the previous 12 months to be the market rent.<\/p><p>It is also proposed to make a small technical amendment for consistency in the wording of section 3(1) of the 2004 Act by replacing &ldquo;include&rdquo; with &ldquo;applied to&rdquo;.<\/p><p>I also intend to bring forward amendments to the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2018 at the next Stage with amendment to section 31A and consequential amendments to sections 31AQ and 31AR of the regional spatial and economic strategies.  This is a time-critical amendment which arises in the context of the establishment of the new Office of the Planning Regulator on 23 April 2019.  Section 31A of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, provides for ministerial directions regarding regional spatial and economic strategies.  As currently enacted, section 31A provides only that the Minister can issue a direction on foot of a recommendation made to him or her by the Office of the Planning Regulator.  This cannot be satisfied in the three regional spatial and economic strategy processes currently under way, given that each commenced prior to the establishment of the Office of the Planning Regulator.  This amendment provides for transitional arrangements to ensure the Minister has a robust legal basis to issue a direction to a regional assembly, if necessary.  The proposed amendments will apply only in respect of the three current regional spatial and economic strategies which commenced prior to the establishment of the Office of the Planning Regulator.  Section 31A, and related sections 31AQ and 31AR, will remain valid in the cases of the regional spatial and economic strategies made in the future.<\/p><p>I also want to flag a further minor technical amendment that is proposed to section 11(1)(<i>b<\/i>) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 to 2018.  Section 11(1)(<i>a<\/i>) requires a planning authority to give notice of its intention to review its existing development plan not later than four years after it is made and to prepare a new development for its area.  Sections 11(1)(<i>aa<\/i>) and 11(1)(<i>ab<\/i>) allow for an alternate notification period for Cork City and County Councils whereby they may extend the notification period to review their existing development plan from four years to a maximum of five years by way of ministerial order.  This is to facilitate the significant workload and range of complex issues arising from the revisions to the local government arrangements in Cork.  However, the special provisions of Cork City and County Councils were not included in section 11(1)(<i>b<\/i>) for the purposes of enabling the incorporation of the national planning framework and the regional spatial economic strategy into the development plan.<\/p><p>For legal certainty, this technical amendment inserts the special provisions for Cork in paragraphs <i>(aa)<\/i>and <i>(ab)<\/i>and section 11, subsection (1)<i>(b)<\/i>(i), (ii) and (iii).  This ensures consistency in section 11(1)<i>(a)<\/i>and section 11(1)<i>(b)<\/i>provisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019062600002#R02700","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":652,"content":"<p>Are there any comments for the Minister of State?

Since our last appearance before it in February, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has continued to implement the Government's plan, A Policing Service for the Future, as well as delivering on our core mission to keep the people of Ireland safe.  Keeping people safe is a guiding principle on which we base our strategic and operational decisions.  My vision for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is very much a victim-centred police service which protects the most vulnerable and provides a consistently high standard of service, all set within a human rights framework.<\/p><p>A Policing Service for the Future is the foundation for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in delivering on that vision.  For the communities we serve, I emphasis because I do not get to say it enough that it will mean more garda&iacute; on the front line and increased visibility; a more responsive policing service suited to local needs; garda&iacute; equipped with modern technology to prevent and tackle crime; a human-rights based approach to policing; and strengthened national security.  For our own people, Garda members and staff, it will mean tools and supports, including a new operational uniform and mobile technology to keep the public and members safe, to include, from yesterday's announcement, the introduction of body-worn video and enhanced automatic number plate recognition, ANPR, and CCTV systems; greater training and welfare supports; a transparent and manifestly fair promotion and appointment system for specialisms; and Government agencies working with us to address deep-seated societal problems.<\/p><p> A Policing Service for the Future is a multi-annual project, but nearly six months into its implementation we and, more importantly, the public are already seeing some of the benefits.  So far this year, we have introduced the following changes: the roll-out of computer-aided dispatch and regional control rooms; the roll-out of our investigation management system has commenced; over 100 garda&iacute; have moved into front-line duties from administrative-type roles; over 350 Garda staff have joined the organisation; and 100 new Garda Reserve members have been recruited and are close to finishing their training programme.  This builds on considerable progress made in 2018 in important areas such as Garda visibility, civilianisation or workforce modernisation and supervision.  Last year over 1,000 people joined An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, bringing diverse experience and skills.  That figure included 800 garda&iacute;.  A total of 250 garda&iacute; moved into front-line operational duties from administrative roles, while there was the introduction of divisional protective service units to assist in the investigation of crimes, particularly against the vulnerable, such as domestic abuse, serious sexual assault and human trafficking.  In addition, in late 2018 and into early 2019, there were almost 500 promotions to sergeant and inspector level which have greatly boosted our supervisory capacity, as well as allowing movement within the organisation for those who are ambitious.  This increase in our supervisory capacity has had a dramatic impact on operational delivery.  This was a key concern in the internal cultural audit of staff to ensure we had sufficient managers to ensure the delivery of a professional service to communities through managing, guiding, supporting and mentoring garda&iacute;.  <\/p><p> It is clear from successive Garda public attitudes surveys that the public have a high level of satisfaction with the service we provide for local communities.  People also generally have a low level of fear of crime in their local area and, at 90% in our latest survey, a high level of trust in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We do not take this for granted, but there are many other police services across the world which would love to have similar results in an attitude survey.  However, we can always improve and a priority of A Policing Service for the Future is to further strengthen the connection we have with communities.  This will be done primarily through our divisional policing model which will bring policing even closer to communities.  It will do this by delegating greater autonomy and authority to chief superintendents and superintendents to make decisions on how they use their resources to deal with the issues of most concern in their local command areas.  At the same time, it frees up these same officers, chief superintendents and superintendents, from administrative tasks and allows them to concentrate more on local delivery of the policing service.  In addition, it will see the introduction of community policing teams that will focus on identifying the problems for local communities and how they, as teams working with other agencies, can put solutions, I hope for the long term, in place.  In designing this, we have taken careful note of the committee's recent report of March 2019 on the subject of community policing and rural crime.  It will also see additional garda&iacute; on the front line by replacing Garda staff in administrative roles; improved support for investigations; and a more streamlined administration system.  We have been piloting these divisional policing models in Galway, Mayo, Cork and DMR south central.  So far, reports are good, but these are pilot schemes that have been designed to identify where further improvements can be made.<\/p><p> As stated by the Commission on the Future of Policing, human rights must be central in how we deliver policing.  It provides a tried and tested framework for how we can collectively approach operational dilemmas and use our coercive powers in a manner which promotes public confidence.  In implementation of A Policing Service for the Future we have set up a human rights unit, re-established our strategic human rights advisory council and employed an independent human rights expert, while further individuals will be employed to support the human rights unit.  Being a human rights compliant organisation will ultimately depend on our behaviour as a collective and the manner in which we deliver our policing service.  Every Garda member and member of staff has an obligation in that regard.  Individual responsibility can ensure a high level of organisational compliance.  Human rights are not an optional extra.  They are the foundation for delivering a policing service that will have the respect and confidence of the community.  They need to be front and centre in all of our policing considerations and at the core of our decision-making.<\/p><p> A key recommendation from the Commission on the Future of Policing was that policing and public safety very often required a multi-agency approach and were not the sole responsibility of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Issues such as drug crime, repeat offending and mental health can only be meaningfully dealt with through a multi-agency response.  This joined-up approach provides significant opportunities to provide an improved, more holistic service for communities and particularly the vulnerable.  It is an approach that will help to reduce crime, including violent crime and quality of life-type crime, both of which have a significant impact on individuals and communities.  It will also free-up time for garda&iacute; to progress community policing initiatives, be more proactive and less reactive and prevent crime from happening in the first instance.  I look forward to continuing to work with Departments and State agencies to deliver these changes and ask for the committee's support in that regard.  While these changes are ongoing, every day our personnel continue to make a positive difference to the lives and safety of the people.  We do this by preventing and tackling a wide range of crimes, maintaining national security, protecting the vulnerable and ensuring public safety.  As I said, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is going through a time of significant change.  It will be change for the better in the policing service we provide.  Some changes have been delivered, some will be delivered by year end and some will take several years to deliver.  However, I am certain the changes will ensure the provision of an improved policing and security service for the people through our strong bond with the communities we serve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019062600002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":667,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner.

I refer to the number of ATM robberies that are taking place, the amount of smuggling that is going on and the amount of other crime that such activity is funding.

I want to talk about Majella Moynihan.  My colleague, Deputy O'Callaghan, mentioned her case but I want to expand further on it.  What happened to Ms Moynihan in 1984 exposed the distressing reality of what life was like for women in Ireland not long ago.  It is heartening to hear that the Commissioner feels that it would not happen within his organisation now.  I know that he and the Minister for Justice and Equality have met Majella Moynihan.  There are outstanding issues which I would like to discuss.  I come from a Garda family and I have the height of respect for the Garda and the important work its members do.  I was sick to the pit of my stomach when I listened to Ms Moynihan's interview on radio.  It was distressing.  Ms Moynihan was a vulnerable young woman.  She grew up in care.  It was heartbreaking to listen to her talk about being accepted into Templemore and how it was the start of a bright new future for her.<\/p><p>She felt liberated from her upbringing, having lost her mother at a very young age.  Instead of having a bright future, she experienced the most horrible abuse.  She was interrogated and faced dismissal for having a baby outside marriage.  She was forced to give that baby up and she regrets that deeply.  She was treated like a scarlet woman by her colleagues when she returned to work after having given up a very much wanted baby.  Ms Moynihan was told by an assistant Garda commissioner in 1989 that her career would go nowhere because of her history.  Very distressingly, she attempted suicide on five occasions and had to retire from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on grounds of ill health.  There are still some serious questions outstanding.  I would like to ask Mr. Harris some of them.  Ms Moynihan was given a redacted version of her personnel file in 2017 and she was told that the unredacted version was either lost or destroyed.  Was that file destroyed or is it lost?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019062600002#E01300","speaker":"1376","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561503600,"counter":698,"content":"<p>I met Ms Moynihan and her solicitor last week.

At the first meeting he attended, which I also attended, one of the issues I raised was the quality of notifications after the use of Tasers and related incidents.  I understand from reports today that it is going to be an automatic process, or something like that.  I acknowledge this is positive.  I do not really need a response on this but I just ask Mr. Harris to keep an eye on it.  He might respond to my next question, if he wishes.<\/p> <p>  At various committee meetings with Garda Commissioners, a variety of issues have arisen, including Garda reform and penalty points.  Quite clearly, the biggest issue facing the Garda, and one of the biggest facing our society today, is that of serious and organised crime.  I acknowledge that much of what the Garda has achieved in recent times has been very commendable.  It has exhibited great courage and has evolved great resourcefulness but organised crime is still a major issue.  There is considerable concern, not just in Drogheda, where issues arose in the past few days.  There have been six gangland murders since the start of the year.  Significant issues arose in Longford.  I recognise that the Garda is doing all it can but it seems it is still very much stretched.  There has been a response regarding Coolock and Drogheda but in both cases, and in most stations, the station numbers were down by comparison with a few years previously.  From 2014, Coolock station has had 14 fewer full-time garda&iacute; since 2011.  It is not just my assessment.  The GRA and AGSI have stated the Garda is behind other police forces in terms of numbers, equipment and resources.  Ireland's ratio of police to civilians is well below the European average.  Is the Commissioner confident he will reach the target of 15,000 sworn members?  Does he not believe the organisation should aim a bit higher, taking into account the significant shortfall in community policing?  Could it aim for 16,000, or more?  If not, what resources are required?  I understand it is difficult for a Commissioner always to state publicly what is needed from the Minister or Oireachtas.  What does An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na need to tackle this scourge?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019062600002#F01400","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561503600,"counter":711,"content":"<p>There are a couple of aspects to that.  With regard to resources overall in the Dublin metropolitan region, DMR, they are stretched.  Even at the last passing-out parade, almost 130 from the class went to various stations in the DMR.  In part, the DMR is the area with the most churn.  It feeds the national units also.  It suffers owing to proximity with the national units.  It is just a particular characteristic of it.  We recognise, however, that the rural regions are pretty strong and that their numbers are up to where they were in 2011.  We have to increase the DMR number to its previous strength also.<\/p><p>On serious and organised crime, we have a good and well-oiled response when these matters flare up.  At all times, proactive operations are ongoing.  The Deputy will have seen that not a week goes by without us having a significant success in the recovery of firearms or the recovery of large amounts of drugs.  That gives a scale of the drug business in Ireland.<\/p><p> Beyond that, I refer to the use of our resources as we build up our numbers to 15,000.  We will get to that figure.  It will take us until the end of 2021 to be realistic about how many people we can recruit over that period along with the cessations we will have.  We need to look to what technology can do in increasing our efficiency and our effectiveness, and that is why we are pleased to see the introduction of measures such as body-worn video.  It often takes the heat out of incidents on the street in the first place.  It can help with resolving complaints, it can provide good evidence for court proceedings, and it can speed up criminal justice procedures.<\/p><p> On the use of automatic number plate recognition, ANPR, it can be a really effective tool for us because much of the crime we see involves vehicles which are ringer vehicles.  They are stolen vehicles which give the identity of a legitimate vehicle and they are then used for crime for a period of six or seven weeks.  That will give us a good insight into that as well as the movement of travelling criminals throughout our road network.  We welcome that but there is an investment in both body-worn video and ANPR.<\/p><p> We also have processes of our own ongoing.  The investigation management system is being brought in, which will provide us with a far greater insight as investigations are ongoing.  We can then join up accounts and investigations and we can have a cross-district and a cross-division response to the criminality of certain groups.  That is difficult at the moment when we have such a paper-based process.  That digitisation will make a difference and it will free us up from some of our bureaucracy and paper-bound administration.<\/p><p> There is a lot happening in the growth of the organisation and in the systems within the organisation.  The Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland talks to both of those matters.  It is not just about our strength but how we use that strength, and it is not just the capacity of the organisation but the capability that we wish to unlock within that.  Digitisation is part of that.  The new divisional structure is the second part of that in freeing up our people from administration, freeing up our police commanders for police work and making our garda&iacute; more responsive to local community needs.<\/p><p> It is an exciting time and a time of huge endeavour.  There is much to be optimistic about.  At the same time, when it comes to recruitment we are pretty much at saturation point in the amount of new staff we can bring in.  We have brought in a lot of recruits who are now probationers and are working their way through probation.  The additional supervision has been important in receiving them into the organisation and making sure they have the proper mentoring and training, but 800 recruits per annum is the maximum we can run at in our training capacity and in the capacity of the divisions to receive them.  There are many positives but the Deputy is right that we can always ask for more.  However, I would want to see these reforms and the digitisation start to get traction before I would say we need to bounce up, as it were, to 16,000 members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019062600002#F01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":713,"content":"<p>I take that on board.

She was arrested for a second time in September 2018.  Ultimately, this case collapsed.  She was sick insofar as any of the documentation of the reports that have been in the media suggest.  It seems very heavy handed and excessive.  Will the Commissioner comment on the case?

It is also directed on general behaviour and a sense of fairness and impartiality in members and staff going about their duties.  I would say, as Commissioner, that I have a responsibility to make sure that the service we provide is one which the people can trust.  They must know that the members and staff of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are individuals of integrity and honesty in their behaviour.  That is not a function of GSOC.  It is a function of leadership on my part and on the part of everybody of supervisory responsibility in the organisation.  We must set the standards required.<\/p> <p>  Deterrence and prevention are better than detection.  There are particular areas on which we can provide advice, and anti-corruption would do that.

There is a visibility issue when the armed support unit withdraws from certain areas and that puts people in those communities under pressure and stress.  The planned expansion is very welcome.<\/p> <p>  Another linked issue is the epidemic of drugs and the connected gangland consequences.  Is the Commissioner satisfied with the number of drugs units that we have?  There seems to be a deficit in parts of Dublin and units are having to spill over between areas and districts.  What are the Commissioner's plans to expand the drugs units?  There is clearly a major drugs problem.  Deputy O'Callaghan mentioned earlier that many people do not at first connect their own behaviour with the spraying of bullets around the city.  That is a major issue and probably goes beyond the remit of the Commissioner.  These are probably people who are criticising the lack of Garda visibility and the severity of the gangland situation.  At the same time these are people who indulge in ongoing drug use.  That is the hypocrisy and contradiction that we have but that is aside from the responsibility of the Commissioner. <\/p> <p>  Regarding the drugs issue, there has been a massive increase in the consumption of drugs.

I also refer to the middle tier and we have seen how the \"Uberisation\" of drugs has put drug dealing in a different space.  What is the technological response from the Garda?

Such a severe crime problem requires a full organisational response and it gets that.  We have to put pressure on the local markets and the intermediate market regarding the movement of significant amounts of drugs and on international trafficking.  There definitely are different layers involved.  There is a national and international layer, which sees good co-operation with our partners in law enforcement throughout the world.  At the national level, our national units and the local drug units do terrific work in chasing down dealers and making major seizures of drugs.<\/p> <p>  The performance in quarter one in 2019 compared to that in 2018, however, shows a 16% uplift in the number of controlled drugs offences.  By and large, though, that is the result of proactive work by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in making seizures ranging in size from small single amounts of drugs for single use right up to big seizures.  As I stated earlier, hardly a week goes by when we do not have a major seizure of drugs, money or some of the weapons associated with such offences.  We are very conscious of this almost \"Uberisation\", or whatever expression we want to use, of the delivery of drugs, especially in the context of the night-time economy and the specific operations we can put in place to address that.  I refer to surveillance but also other preventative operations as well.

This is about information, understanding and analysis of that information and driving lessons from that, which gives us information to start proactive investigations.

This is do with basic management systems.  That is sometimes people's only criticism, albeit a small one, but it is their story of their interaction with the Garda.

It has now come to the end of that phase and we aim to deploy 2,000 mobile phones before the end of the year.  We have looked at a number of technologies, the various elements of which I alluded to previously, which will streamline and improve both the quality and speed of information our people have on the ground so they can access real-time information at the point in time they need it most.  We have developed a number of mechanisms for them to commence prosecutions at the side of the road as opposed to bringing them back to the station.  The process will now be technical and mobile as opposed to the current system, which is paper-based and relies on garda&iacute; coming back to the station.  Some 2,000 mobile phones will be deployed between now and the end of the year.<\/p> <p>  Response times are dependent on a call-aided dispatch, CAD, system, which we did not previously have across the entire country.  However, we have recently introduced it to deal with emergency calls for services and we now have it in every Garda region, including Cork, Waterford, Galway, and Dublin.  That system gives us the ability to provide a response time for any calls for service that are recorded and come in through the emergency call answering service, ECAS.  It is slightly more developed in the Dublin metropolitan region, DMR, and we look at our response times there.  Calls are classified into four categories: emergency, priority one, priority two, and priority three.  In accordance with our policing plan, we have targets and we want a commitment that we will respond to all emergency calls and priority one calls within a 15-minute timeline.  We measure that and look at it quarterly, or more frequently if necessary.<\/p> <p>  As the CAD system develops and is extended nationally, we will have more information available to us in that area.  The CAD system is an important development because we now have an electronic record of all calls coming into us, as well as response times, and the link to the response to the community.  In time, we can begin to provide information on how many calls to the service we receive, how many of them are related to crimes or non-crimes, and our response times.  That kind of information enables us to make more intelligent and effective use of the resources we have.  From a preventative perspective, we can deploy resources in advance of calls, but we can also use it to create a roster and ensure we have people in the right places at the right times.  Many opportunities will come out as that information becomes more comprehensive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019062600002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Twomey"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":759,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses and Deputy Chambers.

These figures were obtained by my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, from the Minister for Justice and Equality and they are extraordinarily high.  I will give the Commissioner some of them as they appear before me in a reply from the Minister very recently.  It states that under Operation Thor, there were 10,024 arrests between 2 November 2015 and 7 May 2019.  This represents an average of eight arrests every day over the past three and a half years, or one arrest every three hours.  I am sure Deputy Munster would like to see similar statistics for her own constituency.  There have also been 11,554 charges brought under the operation to date for a range of offences including burglary, handling of stolen property, possession of firearms and drug offences.  According to Garda statistics, there have been 34,461 searches, 96,997 intelligence reports and over 356,000 patrols over the same period.  Garda figures further show that there have been almost 300,000 checkpoints since the operation started, which is an average of approximately 158 every day.  What is the Commissioner's view on that?

I am based in Limerick and will be going to the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  I am basing my questions on policing reform.  Chapter 9, page 33, of the report of the commission deals specifically with redeployment from non-core duties.  I wrote to the Commissioner on 8 May about a particular issue.  There is a new courthouse on Mulgrave Street in Limerick which was opened in March 2018.  However, one of the by-products was that up to 22 front-line garda&iacute; were deployed to the courthouse for security duties.  The report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland considers the issue of non-core police duties in chapter 9 which reads: <\/p><blockquote>We believe that there should be no further delay and that action should be taken immediately [...] given the serious pressure on the deployment of visible garda resources on the front line of policing [...] We therefore recommend that all these non-core duties should now be reassigned to other agencies.  This should be one of the first priorities in the implementation of the recommendations in this report.<\/blockquote> <p>If the Commissioner looks at the implementation element, on page 30 of the report, it considers reassignment from non-core duties in the context of a review in quarter one of this year to identify non-core duties and then, in quarters three and four, in the context of a review of court security.  It also mentions that the prison escorts review group is to develop recommendations in the first three quarters of this year to be implemented in quarter four.  I know that there was a value for money review of prison escorts.  I see the issue of security within the new courthouse on Mulgrave Street in Limerick as more straightforward.  The Criminal Courts of Justice were opened in Dublin in 2010 near Heuston Station and G4S, a private security firm, provides security.  Obviously, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is needed for specific duties that are required to be performed within the courts, but they do not require the deployment of up to 22 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  G4S also carries out the majority of security duties in the Four Courts.  There are two private, well recognised security firms.  I am asking the Commissioner for his view on the issue.  Is a review process under way?  It would make an enormous difference in Limerick.  As the Commissioner probably knows, we have a history.  We received extra garda&iacute; in 2007 and 2008.  It was extremely successful, but things are still bubbling away beneath the surface, yet the number of garda&iacute; in Limerick has reduced during the years.  I do not expect all 22 garda&iacute; to be redeployed to front-line duties, but, if some were freed from security duties in the courthouse, it would mean an extra 13, 14 or 15 garda&iacute; on the streets of Limerick.  That is what the public and the business community in the city centre and the wider area are looking for.  The Commissioner might give me his view.  We speak about extra garda&iacute; which we need, but it is also about making the most efficient use of garda&iacute; for front-line duties in the spirit of the report of the Committee on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  I await the Commissioner's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019062600002#O00400","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561503600,"counter":826,"content":"<p>I can give a response now, but I think I should also provide a longer written explanation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019062600002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":827,"content":"<p>I have taken the opportunity to ask because the Commissioner is before the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019062600002#O00600","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561503600,"counter":828,"content":"<p>I agree wholeheartedly with the Senator.

I very much welcome the Commissioner's pronouncement in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I have one final point.  I return to chapter 17 of the report of the Committee on the Future of Policing in Ireland on page 61.  It considers the district policing model comprising 96 districts and 570 police stations.  It reads:  \"We believe that decisions on the ideal numbers of either districts or stations should be made by the Garda Commissioner\".  I raise the matter in that context.<\/p> <p>  While I represent Limerick city, I live in Castletroy.  It is a large suburb, one of the biggest, if not the biggest, in Munster.  We have a university on our doorstep.  The area has a total population of approximately 15,000 which is swelled by 15,000 students.  There are also about 18 organisations which employ approximately 4,000 people.  That gives a total of approximately 34,000 people and the population of the area is expected to increase to 45,000.  Ballincollig is a similar area in Cork.  It is one of the divisional policing model pilot areas and has a population of 18,000.  Castletroy is quite a distance from Limerick city and strategically located and exposed alongside the motorway which has resulted in burglaries in recent times.  I am asking the Commissioner for his view on new Garda stations in specific areas.  Can a case be made in that regard?  Obviously, policing initiatives and garda&iacute; on the beat are key elements, but certainly in the area in which I live we have a strong, if not a unique, argument in favour of the need for a new Garda station.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019062600002#O01400","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561503600,"counter":836,"content":"<p>Undoubtedly, with population growth and the anticipated growth in housing and commerce outside traditional areas in the next five to ten years, there is no doubt that there will be a case for the opening of additional stations, but at present we have enough working parts without my picking at it.

I was told that the current accommodation at Coolock Garda station, which is the district's headquarters, requires development and it is a priority at this time, rather than commencing the prolonged process of building a new Garda station in the Clongriffin area.  The Commissioner is very well aware of the horrific killings that have occurred in Darndale and Coolock.  He is also aware of the demand for more garda&iacute; in Coolock.  The demand for a new Garda station in the Clongriffin area is connected with that.  Since the shootings and the escalation in the feud, the Department of Justice and Equality said that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is in talks with Dublin City Council to secure land for a new Garda station in Clongriffin.

The latest attacks in recent days have again heightened the sense of fear for the community in Drogheda.  There was another shooting last Thursday carried out in broad daylight in a densely populated area.  Young children who were out playing were forced to run for cover.  Within hours of that incident, two homes were petrol-bombed in retaliation.  Last night another home was petrol-bombed.  I acknowledge the Garda has been making arrests in recent weeks but after a lull for a while, a real anguish and fear is setting back in.  People are looking for 24-hour surveillance on the key figures involved in the feud to curtail their movements and monitor them.  They need to be tailed morning, noon and night.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge the Garda has made arrests in recent weeks and that the special response units are there.  In most cases where there is a shooting or a petrol bomb, from the Garda's point of view - this could well be affected by resources - it is always reactive and never preventive.  If such 24-hour surveillance had been in place last Thursday, the residents in the area might have been spared the horror and fear of criminals attempting to assassinate one another on people's doorsteps.  We need the resources to be supplied to provide that 24-hour surveillance.  When I raised this with the Taoiseach today, he said that the buck stopped with the Commissioner and that it is an operational matter.  I thought it was very apt that he was appearing before the committee tonight.<\/p> <p>  It is very serious and is not subsiding.  The fear is that the worst is yet to come.  They seem to be acting with impunity.  People cannot see anything happening on the ground.  Given the length of time this has been going on, it is just pure luck that an innocent passer-by has not been killed.  There was an attack outside a shop in a residential area where the perpetrators stood in the middle of the road and opened fire, again in broad daylight.  There was no fear that they would be apprehended or were being tailed.  They were quite confident that they could escape and make their way out of town.  As it was 4 p.m., they were not worried about traffic or anything.  That shows their attitude and brazen nature.<\/p> <p>  Given how long this has been going on, will the Commissioner allocate additional resources?  I know there are about 60 between the two.  Given all I have said will the Commissioner give a commitment to allocate resources for 24-hour surveillance, which would send a clear message that they will be monitored morning, noon and night, and that regardless of where they go, the Garda will be on their tail.

We have broken down this type of crime gang previously, and in terms of this response to enforcement and the pressure we put on, we have to be persistent.  This situation is protracted.  It is difficult to see what the quick fix will be but we are in this for the long haul.  I am very happy to correspond with the Deputy to give her an assurance about our ongoing commitment to dealing with this issue.  We have spent a lot of time and resources on it but also a lot of thought as to how we can unpick this and also reassure the local community.  We have given an additional 15 garda&iacute; to the area.  That is on top of the additional national resources being deployed in the area to offer reassurance.  Together with the investigative effort, there is a visible and a covert element of which people will not be aware.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019062600002#R00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":874,"content":"<p>When the new joint policing committee is up and running in Limerick, I will get the members to extend an invitation to the Commissioner to attend.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019062600002#R00600","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561503600,"counter":875,"content":"<p>Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019062600002#R00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":876,"content":"<p>Is Deputy Munster happy with the answers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019062600002#R00800","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":877,"content":"<p>I am for now but-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019062600002#R00900","speaker":"1333"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":878,"content":"<p>The Commissioner has indicated he is happy to speak to the Deputy privately at the end of the meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019062600002#R01000","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":879,"content":"<p>Yes.

As the Minister indicated, the two reports are complementary and sit well side by side.<\/p> <p>  I want to make a couple of points.  I noted the Commissioner spoke about the Border region, and others have made their pitch regarding their respective areas.  I am also a Border resident and representative.  In terms of the future deployment of resources and given what I can only describe as the ever-growing incidence of drug related anti-social behaviour within my community - I am speaking of Monaghan - which is increasingly becoming a feature of headlines in our local print and broadcast media and was not part of the story of our community in previous years, I ask the Commissioner to take note and be cognisant of that.  I very much welcome and endorse the decision the Commissioner has taken in respect of deployment in areas of particular need, but I am hoping that in his reference to further deployment of newly qualified sworn members he would take on board that there is a particular need.  I am highlighting the Monaghan situation to him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019062600002#R01600","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561503600,"counter":885,"content":"<p>If it can be of reassurance, even prior to my arrival there was a recognition of the particular issues in respect of policing in the Border area.

As we approach Brexit, and we do not know yet what Brexit we are getting, we are also very conscious of reassurance for the community that lives close to the Border and the fear there might be of, in effect, raids taking place back and forth across the Border and the criminality engaged in that.<\/p> <p>  Over the past 18 months, there has been an emphasis on building up resources in what we call that northern region with members passing out of Templemore but also with establishing armed support units and enhancing our roads policing.  That is ongoing.  It has not been as dramatic as 25 new garda&iacute; per district, as we did in the last passing out parade, but there has been a build-up of resources, and that will continue.

On Tuesday, 26 March 2019, at approximately 8.30 a.m. a man in his night attire believing his life was in danger jumped from an upstairs window onto the street below in an attempt to get away from heavily armed black clad individuals who had their faces covered and who had just broken through a number of doors and into the bedroom where he slept.  He did not know that they were members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This happened in Dublin Street in my home town of Monaghan.  I put salient questions regarding this incident to the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, on 9 April.  He stated in reply that the deployment of specialist units, including the ERU is \"solely the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner and his management team\".<\/p> <p>  I appreciate very well the restrictions that apply regarding commenting on a matter that within a very short time, hours only on that day I believe, was referred to, and is now being addressed by, GSOC.  There has been virtually a close down of any public commentary.  There was a limited response from the press office to a local newspaper inquiry at the time that shed no light, and perhaps no light can be shed, because of the nature of the investigation by GSOC.  Could the Commissioner comment on the sort of incidents where deployment of the ERU might be appropriate?  In this instance, whatever the facts regarding the 26 March deployment in Monaghan town, a sleeping man, who has so-called subsidiary protection in this State, was, out of fear for his life, forced to take drastic action that resulted in serious injury, including a broken leg and serious back injuries.  Has An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na taken any post-discharge interest in this man's circumstances?  He is now unable to work or drive, has very limited mobility and is obliged to wear a whole of torso metal lined vest.  He has no medical card.  He is an Afghan native.  He has no capacity to earn and thereby provide for himself.  When his partner is at work he has no one to turn to for the help he needs in carrying out his normal bodily functions.  He cannot go to the toilet on his own and he cannot provide even something to eat for himself.  I can only repeat what was said but it is a serious matter and that is why I raise it with the Commissioner, realising and understanding that there may be very little he can say at this point, but the man states that on identifying him on the street, one garda said to the other, \"Wrong man\".  I do not know anything of that morning's Garda operation and who was or was not the so-called right man but whatever the truth of all, which has yet to reveal itself, will the garda&iacute;, if they have not already done so, contact this man and seek to assist him in coping with his now very changed physical and emotional state, which is a direct consequence of the events that unfolded that morning and that dominated local media reports over that week?<\/p> <p>  This is a big issue.  I do not question that there are situations where the ERU, or whatever unit was involved in this incident, needs to be deployed.  Given that this was an innocent person and all that I have said regarding his circumstances now is there any sense of responsibility or a duty to see how he is coping?  He has no family, no one to turn to, and his partner is also a non-national.  I can only reflect what I am told.  I cannot confirm it.  I ask the Commissioner to take on board what I have said.  It is a very serious matter, if indeed this is an innocent person.  I can only take him at his word.  It is not my job to establish that but for a significant number of people in our community there is real concern about this case.  What can the Commissioner say to me about it? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019062600002#S00300","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561503600,"counter":892,"content":"<p>I would like to see more of the detail.

Today, we look forward to hearing from the Minister in the first update on progress made by his Department toward the full implementation of those recommendations.<\/p><p>I invite the Minister to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019062600002#B01300","speaker":"1278"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":917,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to report on the implementation of the committee&rsquo;s recommendations in its report, Accessibility of Public Transport for People with Disabilities.  It is important to me that this report, informed in particular by the experiences shared by those with lived experience of disability, is not left to gather dust.  The spotlight given to, along with the momentum created by, the committee&rsquo;s hearings and launch of the report in November last to address the gaps that continue to exist in public transport for people with disabilities must not be lost but rather built on.<\/p> <p>  Funding is being provided by the National Transport Authority for the development by the National Council for the Blind Ireland, NCBI, of a national transport training centre which will provide training and familiarisation across all public transport modes.  This will be a state-of-the-art indoor accessible transport training centre which will empower people with access needs when preparing for and during their journey using public transport.  The NCBI developed the proposals for the construction of this centre, which will be the world&rsquo;s largest and most extensive training centre, supporting not only individual and group training opportunities but additionally supporting user and design testing, increasing public awareness and informing standardisation and consistency in public transport accessibility.<\/p> <p>  The primary goal of the training centre is to provide short-term comprehensive instruction designed to teach people with disabilities how to travel safely and independently using public transportation.  Full-size replicas of bus, train and tram vehicles will be used to familiarise users with how to safely and confidently use these modes every day.  Examples of road junction crossings and on-street pedestrian facilities will also be available.<\/p> <p>  Training will also extend to transport agency staff and other key stakeholders.  The NCBI expects to be in a position to announce the location of this exciting new training facility by the end of July.  It is expected that the development work on the centre will be completed during next year.<\/p><p> The report&rsquo;s recommendations cover a wide range of measures aimed at improving access to public transport by people with disabilities.  There are many actors in the public transport sector who have a role to play in delivering on that.  I want to ensure that this first six-month update to the committee covers not just those recommendations that come within my remit as Minister with responsibility for policy and overall funding for public transport, but also those for which the public transport companies under the aegis of my Department have the lead role in addressing.  Accordingly, my Department received updates from the National Transport Authority, NTA, Bus &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus, Irish Rail and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, on their consideration of the recommendations appropriate to them and the steps being taken to address them.<\/p><p> Of the 16 main recommendations in the report, 13 in whole or in part come within the remit of my Department, the NTA or the transport operators or both.  Work is under way on these recommendations, including new infrastructure which is being built to accessibility standards as part of the normal design.  This includes key major public transport projects under the national development plan, NDP.  For example, the specification being developed for the new DART fleet under the NDP will include accessibility requirements as a key element.  The intention is that the tender scoring will award higher scores to carriage providers which provide the best platform interface solution.  There is increased funding for the retrofit programme to address infrastructural legacy issues with a trebling of funding to 2021.<\/p><p> In rural and regional areas, the NTA aims to deliver 20 new wheelchair lift-accessible bus stops this year.  The NTA is introducing new floor coaches on regional commuter routes which will facilitate access on to these services without pre-booking.  Over 900 grant applications have been received in the first five months of 2019 under the grant scheme to increase the number of wheelchair-accessible vehicles in the taxi fleet.  Over 90% of those applications have received provisional grant offers from the NTA.  The NTA is developing a centralised customer contact centre, which will address issues covered by recommendations Nos. 4 and 7 of the committee&rsquo;s report.  The NTA has set up a working group to plan for the implementation of the JAM, just-a-minute, card scheme.  The NTA will be publishing draft proposals for public consultation in respect of the accessibility requirements for licensed bus and coach services in the third quarter of this year.<\/p><p> My role relates to policy and overall funding for public transport.  The committee in recommendations Nos. 1 and 2 of its report calls on the Government to adequately fund and provide a clear policy plan to move towards full accessibility on all public transport, as well as ensuring the requirements of people with disabilities are a core feature of all public transport planning, funding and development.  I will set out the policy framework in place for accessible public transport and the funding underpinning that policy.<\/p><p> The Government ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, in March of last year.  It includes social and economic rights in areas such as education, healthcare, employment and transport.  States which ratify the convention commit themselves to delivering civil and political rights to people with disabilities, as well as to the progressive realisation of social and economic rights, including in the area of transport.  This is the approach adopted in Ireland on public transport.  Sitting beneath the UNCRPD is a range of whole-of-Government national strategies and programmes to advance the implementation of the convention&rsquo;s provisions.  From a public transport accessibility perspective, the two key strategies are the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021 and the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities 2015-2024.<\/p><p> The national disability inclusion strategy sets the overall framework for the equal participation of people with disabilities in society.  It is, therefore, the primary instrument to achieve the progressive realisation of the aims of the UNCRPD.  The strategy contains six actions aimed at improving access to public transport for people with disabilities.  It is a living document and the process to begin a mid-term review of it will be the primary focus of the strategy&rsquo;s steering group meeting tomorrow.  My colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for disability issues, Deputy Finian McGrath, who chairs the steering group, has rightly said it is vitally important that the review examines how the strategy aligns with the articles of the UNCRPD.  My Department will be actively engaging with the mid-term review process.<\/p><p> The comprehensive employment strategy sets out a ten-year approach to ensuring people with disabilities, who are able to and want to work, are supported and enabled to do so.  The strategy covers a range of employment drivers, including transport.  The current action plan under the strategy contains 13 public transport specific actions, implementation for which the NTA has the lead role.  A new action plan to cover the period 2019 to 2021 is currently being finalised by the comprehensive employment strategy implementation group, of which my Department is a member.  It is due for publication by the Department of Justice and Equality shortly.  The new action plan will again provide for a significant number of public transport actions.<\/p><p> The Department&rsquo;s high-level policy goal for accessible public transport is embodied in the concept of transport access for all.  This policy is based on the provisions of the UNCRPD, the Disability Act 2005 and the national strategies to which I have referred.<\/p><p> Transport access for all is the title of the Department's sectoral plan under the Disability Act and is premised on the principle of universal access to public transport, which does not distinguish between people with disabilities and other passengers.  It promotes the concept of mainstreaming and states that accessibility must be an integral part of all policymaking and transport planning.  It also promotes the provision of transport services in order that wherever possible, the needs of people with disabilities are met within mainstream services and facilities.  This cascading policy framework provides the basis on which we move towards full accessibility on all public transport as soon as practicably possible.<\/p><p> Implementation of actions emanating from this policy framework is monitored by my Department&rsquo;s accessibility consultative committee, which meets quarterly.  Updates on the actions are published on my Department&rsquo;s website.<\/p><p> In line with the commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government to a review of public transport policy, I will be announcing shortly the commencement of a public consultation process as part of the review.  The purpose of the public consultation will be to give stakeholders the opportunity to feed into the Department&rsquo;s policy review in order that all contributions are fully considered in shaping the development of a public transport policy statement.  I urge the committee and all those who have an interest in how our public transport is delivered to make submissions when the public consultation opens.<\/p><p> In light of today&rsquo;s discussion, I would especially like to hear from those in the disability community on policy around accessible public transport and what they see as the priorities to improve public transport accessibility for people with disabilities, as well as any international best practice examples which could be applied in an Irish context.<\/p><p> Investment in public transport will be accelerated under the NDP to support the development of an integrated, accessible and sustainable national public transport system.  Up to &euro;8.6 billion of capital investment has been committed up to 2027 for key public transport projects.  Several new major public transport programmes are planned under the NDP, including BusConnects for cities, MetroLink, priority elements of the DART expansion programme and sustainable transport projects including cycling and walking.<\/p><p> In line with recommendations in the committee&rsquo;s report, as with all new and recently developed public transport projects, these programmes will be fully accessible as part of the normal design.  However, the progressive realisation of the rights of people with disabilities under the UNCRPD requires us to continue to address our legacy public transport infrastructure.  There are real challenges to doing this.  The committee&rsquo;s report acknowledges that achieving a fully accessible public transport system will require resources, including time and monetary investment.  It was in recognition of the need for an increase in funding to address legacy infrastructure that I sought and secured a trebling of the funding provided for the accessibility retrofit programme as part of the four-year capital envelope for public transport announced in budget 2018.  Almost &euro;28 million is being made available, through the NTA, for accessibility upgrades for existing older infrastructure in the four-year period to 2021.<\/p><p>Funding under the programme in 2019 is &euro;7 million, up from &euro;4 million last year, and this level of investment will be maintained in 2020.  There will be an increase to almost &euro;10 million in 2021.  There will also be a continued investment programme under the national development plan, NDP, to fund retrofitting of older existing public transport facilities to enhance accessibility.<\/p><p> While funding is central to providing accessible public transport infrastructure, to achieve full accessibility on all public transport requires a whole of journey approach and the active engagement of all the key stakeholders.  The committee recognises the importance of the whole of journey approach in its report and makes recommendations on same.  It involves not only the physical infrastructure but also measures such as ticketing and information systems, travel assistance schemes, disability awareness training for staff, and contact and complaints handling systems.<\/p><p> Crucially, it requires the early and ongoing involvement of people with lived experience of disabilities and their representative organisations in the planning and design of public transport infrastructure and services.  In my role as Minister, I decided that no public transport company in my Department would in future function without a minimum of one board member with personal knowledge and experience of the needs and difficulties of people with disabilities using public transport.  As members are aware, I have appointed such directors to the boards of CI&Eacute;, Bus &Eacute;ireann, Irish Rail, Dublin Bus and the National Transport Authority, NTA.  These new directors can play and are playing a vital role in assisting the public transport companies to make practical and informed decisions on how best to make their infrastructure and services more accessible for people with disabilities.<\/p><p> The individual transport operators, both public and private, the NTA and local authorities, given their respective roles and responsibilities, must each play their part in delivering an accessible public transport system.  This requires co-ordination and a joined-up approach.  The NTA, with its functional responsibility for promoting the development of an integrated, accessible public transport network, has a key role to play.<\/p><p> A critical development in this regard is the new position of transport accessibility manager in the NTA.  This will be a key position as the various public transport projects under the NDP are rolled out to ensure that accessibility is built into all new services and facilities from the design stage.  The role and responsibilities of the post include establishing a formal engagement process with key disability representative organisations to ensure that the needs of those with a disability are considered in all major improvement plans, co-ordinating the accessibility programmes of transport operators, reviewing and auditing accessibility plans of transport operators, advising on the development of transport operator training programmes, and co-ordinating the access officers across all public transport operators.  I am pleased to be able to announce that this is not just an aspiration and that the successful applicant for the position of transport accessibility manager took up duty in the NTA on Monday of this week.<\/p><p> I have sought to take actions that will have a meaningful effect on the lives of people with disabilities, including increasing funding for accessibility programmes, giving a voice at the highest level of decision-making to those with lived experience of disability, and ensuring that my Department has an active accessibility consultative committee to ensure that accessibility actions are monitored and advanced.  There are some positive things happening, but I am fully aware that much more still needs to be done and always will.  My Department will be working closely with the NTA&rsquo;s newly appointed transport accessibility manager to progress the accessibility agenda, including the recommendations of the committee&rsquo;s report.  I look forward to reporting to the committee at future six monthly updates on further developments on its report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019062600002#B01400","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":920,"content":"<p>It is when we see the fruits of this work on the ground that we will see that progress has been made.

I thank the stakeholders who engaged with the committee.  The witnesses appeared before the committee and they clearly and starkly articulated their experiences with disadvantage, exclusion and unequal treatment.  I have only noticed it myself in recent years, and it is a much different experience, but it is only when one has a young child with a pram on public transport that one realises how difficult it is for people with disabilities to access public transport.  That is just an aside.<\/p> <p>  The Minister is asking people to make submissions for the public consultation which is open.  I welcome the fact that the investment in public transport will be accelerated under the national development plan.  I also welcome the fact that the Minister said that, in future, no public transport company in the Department will function without a minimum of one board member who has knowledge and experience of the needs of people with disabilities.  I am delighted that the Minister has appointed such directors to the boards of CI&Eacute;, Bus &Eacute;ireann, Irish Rail, Dublin Bus and the NTA because these directors can play a vital role in how to best deal with accessibility to infrastructure for people with disabilities.<\/p> <p>  The Minister also said he is pleased to announce that the successful applicant for the position of transport accessibility manager took up duty in the NTA on Monday of this week.

Without appearing to flatter him or any other members of the committee too much, the role played by the committee is very helpful in increasing public awareness and in making others, including me, accountable for what is happening.  The members are responsible for the fact that there has been a giant step forward, not just in funding but in public awareness and in the need to disability-proof public transport decisions in all their aspects.<\/p> <p>  The Senator referred to the board members whom I appointed.  That is proving to be successful.  I see a greater awareness among the operating companies of all the difficulties people with disabilities have while travelling.  It puts pressure on the board members themselves to ensure these steps are taken on every occasion.  They are responding to it well and the actions we have seen show they are responding well to it.<\/p><p> On the transport accessibility manager, the newly appointed person started on Monday.  That is a really important appointment.  It is not just important for what he or she does but because it recognises the importance this issue is now taking in the firmament of transport and how everything will have to pass muster with the transport accessibility manager.  I can outline a fair summary of what he or she can do.  The role is to establish a formal engagement process with key disability representative groups, to ensure that the needs of those with a disability are considered in all of the major improvement plans proposed by the NTA, which is a pretty wide brief and to me, it means that the job is to disability-proof all major decisions and improvement plans, to develop an improvement plan for existing services in consultation with key disability representative groups and identify priorities within that plan, to assist in the development of the authority's accessibility capital programme and ensure that accessibility is to the forefront of all new transport infrastructure and to monitor the delivery of improvements in the accessibility of public transport services and infrastructure.  It is also to act as an internal spokesman within the NTA for the customer who has a disability and to monitor progress on actions under the Department's sectoral plan entitled Transport Access for All, the comprehensive employment strategy and the national disability inclusion strategy, which I said in my opening speech were the key strategies.  Moreover, progress on those actions and that of the Department must be reported on by the transport accessibility manager.  In addition, the role is to co-ordinate the accessibility programmes that are under way by transport operators for improving accessibility to public transport and to review and audit accessibility plans of transport operators contracted by the authority.  As a result, the manager will look after the interest of the authority and follow through on various accessibility issues that have been contracted by the NTA.  The manager's role also is to assist in the development of the appropriate policy and strategy to improve the accessibility features provided by licensed public bus transport operators; to facilitate the early involvement of relevant stakeholders in the next-generation ticketing programme; to advise on the development of transport operator training programmes; to draft and update accessibility policies for public transport customers; to ensure that a high standard universal access training is provided to the authority's employees; to undertake research in the area of public transport accessibility, particularly in the tools that are being developed to improve accessibility; to co-ordinate the access officers across all public transport service operators and to establish a contact system and complaints handling system for users of public transport who have a disability.  In other words, the new transport accessibility manager will have a role in relaying and receiving the complaints of all those who feel they have been badly treated or omitted, whose cases have not been heard or whose difficulties have not been acknowledged.  The role also is to establish a contact complaints system; to ensure that the authority's Transport for Ireland website conforms with the official accessibility guidelines and that any official published information supplied by the authority is available in accessible formats; and finally, to promote the improvements in accessible services to customers and key stakeholders.  Those are the kind of duties and responsibilities that have been spelled out to the transport accessibility manager but the appointment is more than that.  It is also a great link and recognition of the importance of this issue to public transport.  It should be acknowledged that the NTA has seriously bought in to the need for a position of this sort and for the need to progress it fast and accelerate it.<\/p><p> I have been asked about bus stops.  I have got the details here but I am afraid that I do not know them off by heart.  The NTA has set a target of 86 wheelchair-accessible bus stops in 43 towns, each with a population of over 5,000 with one stop in each direction.  That is 50% of main towns with a wheelchair bus stop with one in each direction by the end of 2021.  The NTA is liaising with a number of local authorities nationwide, including Sligo, Clare, Cork, Wexford, Cavan, Limerick, Offaly and Meath to develop designs and agree accessible bus stop locations and scope of works.  Surveys and designs are being developed for wheelchair-accessible stops at Ballyshannon and Sligo bus stations, which will be of interest to members.  There are some logistical issues that impact on the upgrading of bus stops in regional, rural locations.  In particular, most rural bus stops or towns do not have a footpath that spans 3 m.  That is one of the difficulties that we have encountered nationwide but we are trying to overcome.<\/p><p> The final issue is the central customer centre, which is meant to provide a more efficient and integrated contact with customers and the public.  The centre will provide information on a more integrated basis than is possible at present.  It will utilise the various available communication channels and includes the phone, email, live chat and social media.  As part of the programme to enhance availability, the NTA will produce transport information in a variety of formats.  The scheme is customer driven and a proposal is currently being developed that will enable the provision of information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019062600002#D00500","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":925,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his update.  Even if one only looked back 20 years one would see that progress has been made.  However, he is right that an awful lot still needs to be done.  We must not go backwards either.  I mean that when a new fleet is being purchased, it must be of the optimum standard.  It is welcome that the specification is being developed for the DART fleet.  I understood that that fleet was already on order.  There was a big announcement of an order and I would have presumed that the specification would have been done in advance of an order being placed.  Experience with the national children's hospital, for example, tells us that one must nail down the details or one will end up with add-ons and things like that.  I am sure that the situation is exactly the same with transport.  When is the fleet due to be delivered?  I am sure it will arrive on an incremental basis rather than all at the one time because there is a degree of commissioning that is needed with trains.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019062600002#E00200","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":926,"content":"<p>What fleet is the Deputy talking about?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019062600002#E00300","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":927,"content":"<p>The DART fleet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019062600002#E00400","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":928,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019062600002#E00500","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":929,"content":"<p>Earlier the Minister mentioned that this is \"the best platform interface solution\".

Was the specification done in advance of the order being placed?  Was the specification provided within that or how has this worked?  What exactly is the Minister talking about?  What will we physically see that will be different, better and will provide for people with disabilities?  I appreciate that there is a range of disabilities, ranging from visual impairment, wheelchair usage and so on.<\/p> <p>  The Minister gave us a rundown on bus stops.  I presume that local authorities will be aware of the desire to provide access that is as wide as possible and that where new bus stops are provided that access is thought about at that time.  Often, and I know from being a member of a local authority, the location of a bus stop is an afterthought.  Has guidance been provided to local authorities?  If so, it would mean that local authorities would not have to redo this work in the future.  I urge that bus stops have a suitable amount of space in terms of the width of the footpath or the pull in bay.  A bus stop may not be located in the optimum location or whatever but I urge that consideration is given to this in advance.  Is that type of work done by the Department or the NTA?  Who is responsible for providing guidance to local authorities in this instance?<\/p> <p>  I have spoken to the Minister about wheelchair-accessible vehicles before.  I had a look at where the vehicles are located and discovered that some counties do not even have one wheelchair-accessible vehicle.  There are a lot of these vehicles in Dublin but very few in places like Tipperary.<\/p><p>I know that it is down to individuals who make an application, but at the time I asked whether there would be positive discrimination if areas were not provided for sufficiently if there was an inadequate amount of money available.  Will the Minister address that issue?  It is welcome that the NTA has an accessibility manager with this expertise.  If there is not somebody embedded in an organisation whose daily job is to watch out and takes ownership of issues, I do not think they will get the attention they need.  That is welcome.  It would be useful for the committee to invite the person concerned to come before it, perhaps in six months time, to find out what the experience has been.  We could receive very good feedback in that regard.<\/p><p> A criticism we have heard during the hearings and which I hear constantly concerns accessibility.  Dublin Bus has vehicles with low floors and there have been serious improvements during the years, but I repeatedly receive complaints from people who are told at a bus stop that the space is being used and that they will have to wait for the next bus.  Success invites people to use the service, but at the same time space may not be provided to the extent that it is needed.  Therefore, there might be a need to look at existing standards.  It is certainly an issue that comes up enough to suggest that while success is encouraging people to use the service, there is a question as to whether they can be accommodated.<\/p><p> It is welcome that a lot more money will be provided for the retrofit programme. Even if he cannot do so today, will the Minister outline how it is being done?  What is the priority?  Is it based on usage or the particular vehicle used?  It would be useful to hear how the Minister is going about it in order that we can have some understanding of what we might see in reality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019062600002#E00600","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":931,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked about the tender process for the DART fleet.

I gave Mr. Delaney the imprimatur and he did great work.  The Vice Chairman is very gracious in specifically mentioning him.  Many of people with disabilities and the associated organisations rowed in behind it and put considerable effort in.<\/p> <p>  This does not take one iota from the accelerated progress that has been made and the further progress to be made.  Public transport is a daily grind and frustration for people with disabilities, as the Minister has frequently acknowledged.  We keep talking about progress, which is excellent.  It does not take from the fact that people regularly have problems.  I note that and I am delighted that we have reached this stage and this report has been published.<\/p> <p>  The Minister mentioned that 13 of the 16 recommendations are his.  As Minister, he is taking leadership in ensuring the other three things are kept moving.  That is very important and I acknowledge it does not always happen across Departments.  There is also a complementary leadership role for this committee.  We have our blue bible and we have a way of monitoring every six months.  Working in parallel, the Minister, the Department and the committee can keep the focus on this.  It is human nature that as other issues come up, the ones that were there the previous week slip back.  It is important not to let this slip irrespective of other challenges and issues that arise with transport or Government policies, etc.<\/p> <p>  Many of the necessary processes have now been put in place.  Before starting to build, the site needs to be cleaned and the foundations laid.  People might say that nothing is happening.  These are things that are happening.  The pipework is going in place.  It is not sexy work but it is necessary.<\/p><p>That is really important and it gives us the foundations but we must start ticking off things on a six-monthly basis so we keep ourselves stretched in making progress.  The Minister said there would not be any pressure to reduce funding, and if there is, he would resist it.  I thank him for saying that and I have no doubt that it will be his attitude to the matter.<\/p><p> Senator Feighan spoke about the process being an eye-opener and about listening to people with disabilities.  The more that people with disabilities are seen out and about in ordinary places doing ordinary things, the more movement there will be on the objective of people with disabilities having full lives.  That person can be on a bus going somewhere but it is more than just the journey; it is also a statement to the rest of the people on the bus and other people that Ireland is intent on ensuring people with disabilities can be out and about.  It is a very important cultural shift in the work.  It is more than just delivering seats etc. and I stress this important element.<\/p><p> The Minister stated that the NTA has seriously bought into this process when referring to the accessibility manager post.  I underline a possible risk that could be avoided.  There is the risk that the accessibility manager could become the person responsible in the NTA for what happens or does not happen.  If there is an accessibility issue, the officer might become the person to talk to.  I invite the Minister to accept that the responsibility should be with the board, the chairman and the chief executive.  If they have a problem with the accessibility manager not doing the work, it is an issue they have to solve.  I have seen it time and again that an organisation might have somebody dealing with accessibility issues and this leads everyone else to wash their hands of those matters.  The person will have a critical role but the buck should stop with the people who run the NTA.<\/p><p> I still have confidence issues with the NTA and I certainly hope there has been a change.  We have seen a fiasco in how BusConnects dealt with - or rather did not deal with - accessibility needs for people with disabilities.  Go-Ahead buses were bought, delivered and painted before Ms Elaine Howley at a national disability inclusion strategy meeting asked to look at them.  The viewing was sorted out over a weekend but they had been painted the wrong colour and all the money had been spent.  This is what happened in the past year or two.  Our first encounter with the Minister was during the bus strike, when reassurances were given there would be no diminution in services on the routes where Bus &Eacute;ireann buses were being removed.  I am not letting go of those recent issues and disabled people - never mind me - need to see the changes in how that organisation operates.  Through the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009, the authority has had the capacity to put conditions on private operators going on public service routes but it has not used it.<\/p><p> Let us move on.  The Minister mentioned the increased funding for a retrofitting programme but we will want to see the expected outcomes for that.  We will want to see how it will work out over next six or 12 months.  What is the expectation of the Minister for the funding going into that?  There was mention of grant applications for wheelchair-accessible vehicles and the taxi fleet.  It is over 20 years ago, when I worked with the Irish Wheelchair Association, that some of the taxi trade unions came to us to seek support for their campaign to get VAT and vehicle registration tax removed from taxis if they are made wheelchair-accessible.  My reaction was to ask why someone would buy a pup and then ask it to perform.  Disabled people have told me they are basically given the two fingers by taxis at certain times.  These are empty wheelchair-accessible taxis.  Smacht must be put on that kind of behaviour.  Disabled people have paid for it but they are being given the two fingers by drivers at times.  If concessions are given upfront, we must make sure to get value for our buck.  With technology the way it is, there should never be a case where a number of taxis are not available that are wheelchair-accessible.  There all sorts of ways of co-ordinating them.<\/p><p> The national disability inclusion strategy was launched in July 2017 at Croke Park and, in fairness, the Minister attended.  I do not have great confidence in that strategy having the horsepower, to use that term, to progress the work to implement the convention and disability strategy.  It is a strategy spanning the four years from 2017 to 2020 but it was not launched until July 2017.  There was a commitment to a mid-term review and the Minister has confirmed, with information he clearly got elsewhere, that there is a process to begin a mid-term review.  This is halfway through the third of four years.  This commitment did not have &euro;20 million attached to it but it was a commitment for a number of public servants in Departments led by the Department of Justice and Equality to do a review by the middle of the four-year period, which would have been the end of last year.

It is a very fair point and we should bear in mind the obstacles and difficulties that disabled people have to endure.  They can be difficult to relate to unless they are repeated again and again, ensuring that the people who make decisions are aware of them.  Whatever we achieve in trying to make transport accessibility equal for everybody, there will always be difficulties for people in wheelchairs and they will never have the same carefree attitude to travelling as others without disabilities.  I take the Senator's point in that respect.<\/p> <p>  Senator Dolan mentioned the accountability of many of the bodies relevant to the strategy and the complementary role of this committee.  It is fair to say the committee has played a very important role and it is a very good exercise in parliamentary accountability.  Senator Dolan, Deputies Catherine Murphy, O'Keeffe and O'Dowd and everybody else involved with this exercise should set this as a template.  It is difficult to fit in but it is a good idea that something as important as this should be reported on by a Minister every six months.<\/p><p>It is also good for the officials.  It is good for Deputies and means that the gaps in areas where we would not want to have them are exposed every six months until they are closed.  Whereas I think this is a good report and a big step change in the attitude to disabilities, there are things that still have to be done.  They are in front of us.  The good things are fantastic and tremendously important and I am not claiming any credit for them.  Senator Dolan should take the credit.  The Chairman referred to Ciar&aacute;n Delaney.  He is a phenomenal and relentless advocate for people with disabilities.  The idea that we do this every six months is useful.  It is a template for others and a useful parliamentary exercise.  <\/p><p> The Senator is right about the problem associated with the livery.  As far as I know, it was remedied.  It should not have happened.  It emphasises the fact that sometimes people do not think in a sympathetic way or are not as knowledgeable as they should be.  It was changed because the disability groups were loud and had voices to express the difficulties encountered owing to an oversight by the National Transport Authority.  I understand the Senator does not think it has bought into it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019062600002#H00400","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561503600,"counter":983,"content":"<p>Perhaps it has, but I still do not have confidence.

It is mainly up to the NTA, but on the whole I see real progress.  Deputy Catherine Murphy has been good enough to say things are better now than they were 20 years ago.  Many of us were probably slow to realise the importance of this issue or allocate funding to deal with it.  When I see the acceleration in funding, I am surprised and somewhat shocked by how small it was before.  I only woke up to how tiny it was when I became Minister.  It is due to lots of lobbying and parties, including the Senator, the committee, the NTA and the Minister of State with special responsibility for people with disabilities, Deputy Finian McGrath.  It is happening and can be nothing but good.  We know that semi-State bodies are slow to move.  What has happened is that they have moved to a point that probably could not have been envisaged 15, 20 or even ten years ago.  The NTA will manage the retrofit programme.  I will get details of projects and outcomes from it.  I have said the figure is &euro;28 million, broken down into sums of &euro;4 million, &euro;7 million, &euro;7 million and &euro;10 million.  The three main grant areas are taxis, railway stations and bus stops.  <\/p> <p>  I was interested in what the Senator had to say about the national disability insurance scheme, NDIS.

The NTA is moving towards a public consultation process on the matter, with a view to coming forward with proposals which will go some of the way towards remedying the problem.

It enables both to state what is happening in dealing with the transport article in the convention.  It is a great device to have.  There is an Oireachtas disability group, while several disability organisations have met all of the Secretaries General and some of the Minister's colleagues recently.  That is another way to spread responsibility for the work on various issues that fall beyond one Department.  I compliment the Minister on putting folk with disabilities and lived experience on several boards.  It is an initiative taken in his Department that could be sweetly followed by a host of other Departments.  Fair play to him for doing so.  The people with disabilities on those boards act as a conscience, a reminder to them that they are supposed to be providing a service for everybody.  It is an important cultural element.  <\/p> <p>  On point No.2, planning and decision-making, I understand the NTA is using a UN standard for accessibility in the acquisition of fleet vehicles which does not take into account powered wheelchairs.<\/p><p>The kind of powered, as opposed to push, wheelchairs that are available now are very different to what were available in the past.  Many people can only get to the bus today because they have a powered wheelchair.  If the bus is unable to accommodate that wheelchair, that may be an issue.  I understand there is a European standard, EN 17161:2019, for accessibility for powered wheelchairs on buses.<\/p><p> As for priority seating in rail, I am getting reports and information that able-bodied people are reserving priority seating, which was and is intended for people who have mobility impairments.  That seems a bit odd.  How is that happening?  Maybe that can be checked with Irish Rail.<\/p><p> I am glad to hear about the progress with the JAM card.<\/p><p> On orientation and wayfinding for people with visual impairments, I understand that Irish Rail has conducted a review of its signage and way guidance system and that it fully engaged with the disabled community in that regard.  Funding, however, is a significant barrier to progressing this on a national basis.  Can the Minister give a commitment on this matter or make a comment on how it can be sorted out?  If funding is needed for it, will it be made available?  It is a critical issue for people with visual impairments.<\/p><p> I refer to travel costs.  The NTA is still permitting the charging of &euro;5 per journey for people with disabilities to reserve seats on intercity services.  These are people who have free travel.  My understanding is that it is in breach of an EU regulation, which specifically states that people with disabilities should not pay a surcharge.  That is something that needs to be looked at.<\/p><p> I have already mentioned the accessible taxi issue.<\/p><p> The 15th recommendation pertains to accountability.  Has the NTA developed key performance indicators, KPIs, for the headings contained in this report?  Does it have a template set out for how it will move on and measure progress?

However, as moving poles may not be possible due to the structural design of the bus, the NTA is not in a position to promise that it will be possible to make changes.  It will, however, examine whether it is possible.<\/p> <p>  On the KPIs, the National Disability Authority is developing high-level indicators to monitor the accessibility of public transport and whether public transport service providers are compliant with the NDA's code of practice on the accessibility of public services and information provided by public bodies.
