Lessons are obviously being learned in respect of the national children's hospital and the broadband plan.  As we discussed at our last meeting, there was a lot of commentary on the correspondence between Mr. Watt and the Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  That is fine.  He set out very real concerns regarding that project.  In the letter he cited that part of his concerns represented a learning from the national children's hospital.  Can we write to Mr. Watt asking if any similar correspondence was had, if any similar concerns were raised, or if any similar exchange of views occurred in respect of the national children's hospital?  That is one element of this issue at which we have not looked.  I know we had Mr. Watt before the committee.  He was reluctant to get into the matter of the national children's hospital - he was here dealing with the broader issue of procurement in respect of all of the big projects - but we now know that he put in writing very serious concerns in respect of the national broadband plan.  There may well also have been correspondence on this matter, although it may not have been as stark as that regarding the national broadband plan.

We will discuss this in further detail when we meet with the hospital board, the HSE and the Department of Health.

It says:<\/p><blockquote>This review was conducted over a nine-week period and involved the deployment of a highly experienced international PwC team comprising capital project and infrastructure specialists, required detailed examination of over 2,000 NCH project documents, more than 40 in-depth interviews with 52 members of the NCH project team and the development of a comprehensive and detailed PwC report.<br \/><br \/>This review was of a fundamentally different nature and scale to the high-level advice provided by PwC and others to the HSE in November 2018.  We do not see any conflict of interest arising from PwC&rsquo;s involvement in the provision of high-level advice to the HSE in November and its role in carrying out the review of cost escalation in 2019.  Indeed, we believe that the work conducted was highly complementary, given the technical nature of the skills and experience required.<\/blockquote><p>I am just putting that on the record.  It would be unfair to the people who I may have criticised the last day.

The first is that this was never about individuals.  I am not aware of what comments the Chairman made but any concerns that were raised, from recollection, were more about the process and conflicts of interest.  The letter itself says that the Department does not see any conflict of interest arising from PwC's involvement in the service of the so-called high-level advice it gave.  It then says there is no conflict between that and its role in carrying out a review into cost escalation.  Underneath that, when it expands on what PwC was doing, it states that it was giving advice on the guaranteed maximum price report, or, to use its own words, \"high-level advice\".  There seems to be a lack of understanding, at best, as to what constitutes a conflict of interest.  A conflict of interest can arise if there is a perception of a conflict of interest, so if we are going to do an independent report it has to be completely at arm's length.  I would imagine there should be no involvement in the project itself.  PwC does work for the HSE and the Department of Health, but given that it had a high-level role at some point in the process, that should have precluded it from independently examining the process.  That is a clear conflict as far as I am concerned.  I will take this up with the Department, but I do not think the Department can write to the committee with any seriousness and say that it does not see any conflict of interest.  Anybody who understands conflicts of interest would see that it is a glaringly obvious one, and should not have been allowed to happen.  We have been saying time and again that there are a small number of these companies doing the rounds, getting all these jobs, giving advice on the one hand and then doing so-called independent reviews on the other, and it is not good for accountability, or for getting answers to the questions people want answered.  While I have to say the PwC report was a good one and very much reflected what as in the Mazar's report in that it was not hugely different, I still think it is a conflict of interest.  I do not accept the response from the Accounting Officer, but we will take that up with him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019051600002#C00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1557993600,"counter":52,"content":"<p>We will take it up during the course of that meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019051600002#C00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1557993600,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I have no difficulty with what the Chairman said at the last meeting because I joined him, as many did at that meeting, in agreeing with it.  At the end of the day, we cannot have the contestants judging the beauty pageant.  There is effective admission here that the same few personnel were involved.  However, what worries me even more is that the Secretary General does not see a conflict of interest, so God knows what is going on in other capital projects throughout the country if that is the case.  PwC is a stand-up company with a global reputation that does excellent work, as does KPMG and so on.  There are only a limited number of companies between the two canals in Dublin but we seem to have a peculiar dedication to solely using them.  PwC was involved with high-level input.  What is high-level input?  The fact that it gave high-level input means it cannot review it.  It is called an independent review, but that was not independent.  Maybe everybody did the best possible job they could, but it is compromised, and its credibility is affected.  One of the best Secretaries General, to my mind, in terms of his candid answers here from time to time, is compromising his good name by saying that he does not see a conflict of interest in this, in effect.<\/p> <p>  The other thing I would say is that there is much a lot of woolly language and high-level expertise from health construction people, but who are they?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019051600002#C00400","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1557993600,"counter":54,"content":"<p>We will ask.

Deputy MacSharry made the point that the thought process in engaging companies should be of serious concern, and in any report we issue, we should be making that point as firmly as possible to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to the advice it gives other Departments in these kinds of conflicts.  It is almost like we are being made eejits of with this kind of response.  That is the way I feel about it.

I do not know what words I used but I certainly stand over whatever I said.  This document shows that PwC was engaged in November 2018 in relation to this.  It has been employed by contract since January 2019 in relation to general work but it was given this specific piece of work in November 2018.  The document states that in November PwC was appointed as one of a number of organisations and that there is no separate, documented advice from any of the external parties involved.  I happened to hear the Chairman's interview today and I think he said that PwC was only involved for a few days, but that is subject to clarification.  It was paid &euro;21,477, plus VAT, for a couple of days' work, and that is again subject to clarification.  That external advice, of which there is no documentation, along with the other external advice, was used to justify the step of going forward.  As there was no way of going back, they had to go forward, so they called in all of the expert advice to go forward with no documented evidence.  Fast-forward to January, and we commission PwC again to do an even more extensive review.  Significantly, the Chairman and I both commented at the time on the conclusion.  It was asked to give recommendations and findings but its conclusion was that there was no choice but to go ahead.  It was only copper-fastening what apparently - because one has to be very careful now, apparently - was already decided in November 2018, or that is how it looks to anyone listening, and to us trying to struggle through all this documentation.<\/p> <p>  Interestingly, it is not mentioned on the list of reports so we will be going back to that as well.

There was no declaration here.  I read the PwC report and it does not say anywhere that it provided high-level advice at an earlier stage in this project.  It was not said.  We had discussions at both this committee and the Joint Committee on Health and questions were asked about whether there was a conflict of interest.  It was only later on, when the report was published, that we got the letter from Mr. Mitchell that stated there was a relationship between the company and the HSE.  We found it out by accident, really.  My point is that conflicts of interest arise, and they can be managed, but this was not managed or declared at any point before or during the process.  It was only afterwards by accident, and by the good work of this committee, that we found out that there was a relationship there.  I think it is a slam dunk in terms of it being a clear conflict of interest and the fact that it was not even managed by the company, the Department, or the HSE, is even worse.<\/p><p>It is problematic that this letter justifies it and states that there was no conflict of interest.  If the Comptroller and Auditor General was doing a look-back on this he would look for correspondence from all sides.  He can speak for himself but I imagine he would not accept this.

I have put it on the record and people can judge it accordingly.  I am not drawing conclusions.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 2155, from the Comptroller and Auditor General, Seamus McCarthy, dated 9 May, providing an update to the committee regarding the submission by public bodies of draft financial statements for audit by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The first job of the Committee of Public Accounts is to review the financial statements of the approximately 300 public bodies audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We can only do that if they submit financial statements.  The primary requirement of a board in any organisation is to produce financial statements within a reasonable time period.  If they are not able to do that, I would question what else might not be working properly in the system.  When we took over a couple of years ago, the percentage of financial statements which had been submitted within a three-year period year stood at about 40%.  We have been following this issue relentlessly and we had the education and training boards, ETBs, before us when only one of 17 had submitted its accounts on time.  We have issued several reports and the committee took the unprecedented step of authorising me to write to the chair and secretary of every organisation reminding them of their obligations.  Over the past couple of years we have seen a vast improvement, with it going up to 70% and then over 80%.  I am happy to report that, up to the end of April, over 92% of the roughly 300 organisations audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General had submitted their draft accounts for audit.  There remain 24 which have not done so.  With the consent of the committee, I will write to the chairperson and chief executive of each of the 24 organisations tomorrow, reminding them of their obligation to get their accounts in straight away.  We are making outstanding progress in getting the financial statements because I realised a few years ago that the statements we were getting were four years old.  That was a waste of everybody's time and it showed a lack of governance in the organisations in question.<\/p> <p>  I will read out the names of the organisations which had not submitted their accounts by the end of April.  A number are directly from the Department of Finance.  The sundry moneys deposit account has a turnover of &euro;149 million.  The hepatitis C special account has a turnover of &euro;26 million, and the hepatitis C reparation account has a turnover of &euro;4 million.  The local loans fund normally has a turnover of &euro;280,000 and the Credit Union Restructuring Board, now in wind-down, has also not submitted accounts.  The environment fund, which is directly from the Department, has a turnover of &euro;44 million each year but has not submitted accounts and the fisheries harbour accounts in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has a turnover of &euro;6 million but has not submitted accounts.<\/p> <p>  In the education sector, the following colleges have not submitted accounts: University College Cork; Dublin City University; Dublin Institute of Technology, although that body is in a wind-down situation; the State Examinations Commission; Letterkenny Institute of Technology; St. Angela's College in Sligo; St. Patrick's College of Education, which is a residual account following amalgamation; and the Church of Ireland College of Education, also a residual account and in wind-down mode.  Some of the universities will make the fair point that they have external auditors and have to go through that process before it comes to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  They will say they have a double audit and I acknowledge that but the accounts are several months late.<\/p> <p>  The accounts in the HSE fund are: the private patients accounts of &euro;72 million; the National Treatment Purchase Fund; the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council; the hepatitis C insurance scheme; and two accounts with minor activity, namely, the long-stay repayment scheme special account and the long-stay repayment scheme donation account.  Finally, there are three State bodies which had not submitted accounts by the end of April, namely, the Legal Aid Board, Irish Water Safety and the Discovery Programme - Centre for Archaeology and Innovation.  We will write to the Accounting Officer in the Department of Finance and the relevant Government Departments and directly to the chairmen and chief executives of the organisations in question.  I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General for keeping on top of this.  If nothing else, we will make sure there is corporate governance at board and Accounting Officer level in all these organisations.  We are nearly there.<\/p> <p>  No. 2156 is from the Minister of State at the Department on Education and Skills with responsibility for training, skills, innovation and research and development, Deputy John Halligan, dated 18 April advising the committee of the recent launch of Ireland's national intellectual property protocol 2019 - a framework for a successful research, commercialisation and accompanying research guide.  I welcome the development, which will have a bearing on the commercialisation of all forms of intellectual property and I am pleased that there is a requirement for State research funding organisations and a State innovation funding agency to apply the policy and framework in the national intellectual property protocol, consistent across all programmes of funding.  The committee will continue to monitor this topic closely, especially in relation to the third level institutions.  We will note and publish this.<\/p> <p>   The next item is No. 2157 from John McKeown, Secretary General, Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, dated 9 May, providing information requested on foot of an inquiry regarding the use of precedential test cases by the Social Welfare Appeals Office to determine issues in respect of employment, self employment or bogus self employment.  We will note and publish this and forward the response to the correspondents who raised the issue.  No. 2158 is also from John McKeown, Secretary General, Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, dated 10 May, providing further information regarding the JobPath programme in response to our queries.  The Department is currently reviewing its contract of public employment services with a view to continuing to provide resource services to those who need support.  We will note and publish this.<\/p> <p>  The next item is correspondence is from private individuals and other correspondence.  No. 2153 was received from an individual dated 5 May relating to the national broadband plan.  The correspondent raised value for money issues that may feed in to our consideration of broadband matters.  We note this.  No. 2154 is from an individual, dated 6 May, relating to negative environmental impacts of broadband roll-out, which we will also note.  No. 2154 is from Deputy Cullinane and relates to the committee's consideration of the broadband issues.  We are awaiting documentation on broadband matters and I propose to note the item for the moment and return to it when we get the information we have requested.  The next item on the agenda is statements of accounts received since the last meeting.<\/p> <p>  I did not read out correspondence No. 2159 from the Tax Appeals Commission.  We had asked for a two-monthly update on its ten largest cases, which amounted to approximately &euro;700 million in March.  Some had been settled and there were different issues so we wrote back for an update.  The update will require clarification and we will write to the commission immediately.  It does not give exact estimates as to do so might prejudice the outcome of a hearing but it gives various bands.  It states that, as of 16 May, three cases are before the commission where the corporation tax to be determined is in excess of &euro;100 million each.<\/p><p>It goes on to state that in three further cases the amount to be determined is estimated at between &euro;50 million and &euro;100 million and in three other corporation tax cases the amount to be determined is between &euro;30 million and &euro;50 million.  There is one case in respect of an environmental levy where the amount in question is between &euro;30 million and &euro;50 million.  Interestingly, the schedule identifies an overall total of &euro;2.571 billion.  I do not know what that figure means.  Is it the quantum of cases with the Tax Appeals Commission?  On the last occasion we dealt with the commission, that figure was approximately &euro;1.7 billion.  If there has been a dramatic increase in the quantum of cases in value terms before the Tax Appeals Commission, we need that clarified.  I am not sure what is the figure at the bottom of its chart.  It does not state what the figure represents.  I am guessing.  If I am wrong, I need that clarified.  In addition, the commission should explain why the volume of cases on its desk has gone from what we understood to be &euro;1.7 billion to &euro;2.5 billion in a very short time.  I acknowledge that it must deal with the appeals, but it must have some observation on that increase.  We will write to the commission on that issue because it is a matter we have been following due to the quantum and volume of cases before the Tax Appeals Commission.  It appeared before the committee and there were many issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019051600002#D00400","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557993600,"counter":69,"content":"<p>There are also two court cases.

In advance of this meeting I circulated an update on developments since.<\/p><p>As is well known, the Government approved the construction investment to allow phase B, the above-ground works of the hospital, to be instructed in December.  At the same time the Government approved the commissioning of an independent review of the escalation in cost of the capital project.  The purpose of the review was to examine in detail the contributory factors to the cost escalation and associated responsibilities in order that any potential weakness would be identified and comprehensively resolved in the interests of the successful completion of the project and the effective management of public funds.  The terms of reference also required the review to identify and address major residual risks, as well as control and oversight issues.  It also was required to develop recommendations which may identify any areas of potential cost savings or reductions, which are consistent with the applicable contractual undertakings and the delivery of the project.  The report of the review was presented to the Government on 9 April last and published on the same day.<\/p><p> The PwC report is the result of an intensive and extensive body of work carried out by a team of experts over a period of nine weeks.  The PwC team was composed of a number of international capital project and infrastructural specialists, including chartered engineers, quantity surveyors, chartered accountants, commercial specialists, data analysts and healthcare experts with extensive experience in the review of complex capital projects and programmes.  In publishing the review, the Government requested that an implementation plan be prepared and submitted to the Government for its consideration.  Extensive work has been undertaken between the Departments of Health, Public Expenditure and Reform and the Taoiseach, the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, NPHDB, Children's Health Ireland, CHI, and the HSE.  The Minister for Health updated the Government on this work earlier this week and it is envisaged that the draft implementation plan will be considered by the Government shortly.  The PwC report accepted that the two-stage procurement process used to award the contract for construction of the new children's hospital is a widely used approach and can deliver significant benefits.  It also identified failures that occurred in the set-up, planning and budgeting stages for the project, and in the implementation of the two-stage process.  It warns that the guaranteed maximum price, GMP, established through the process does not provide a contractual ceiling on cost and significant residual risks remain.  A primary focus of the development board must be on managing this risk and preventing further cost increases.<\/p><p> The report synthesised the findings of the review into a set of 11 recommendations.  The first nine are specific to this project, and identify steps to be taken by all stakeholders in this project relating to project delivery, control, and assurance.  This ranges from a review of the scope and responsibilities of the advisory firms that constitute the design team to reflect their roles in the performance monitoring of contractors, to strengthening the capacity and capability of the development board executive and to putting in place a scrutiny process that includes all levels of the governance structure to review all proposals that are focused on reducing the GMP.  The remaining two recommendations relate to the management of other public sector spending on major capital infrastructure projects more generally, and therefore are a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Government noted the report's findings and requested the Ministers for Health and for Public Expenditure and Reform to revert with a proposed implementation plan for these nine recommendations.  The implementation plan will set out for each of the 11 recommendations the actions taken to date and the further actions proposed, together with timelines.  The implementation plan is being developed on a collaborative basis by key stakeholders and will be brought to the Government shortly for consideration, following which it is expected it will be published.  The implementation plan will address the deficiencies identified in the report, including developing and implementing, where necessary, more robust project control and project assurance plans appropriate for a project of this national importance throughout the remaining construction programme.<\/p><p> The development board is fully committed to implementing the recommendations, as are the Department, the HSE and Children's Health Ireland.  As the chair of the board will outline, he has established and leads a sub-committee of the board to ensure full implementation of the recommendations relevant to it.  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board has already taken a number of important steps to strengthen its project control systems, capacity and capability.  Work is under way to improve reporting standards and introduce revised working arrangements with the design team.  Consideration will need to be given to the report's warning of potential loss of corporate knowledge.  It is appropriate that the focus is on maintaining corporate knowledge and expertise and on strengthening the project by building further capacity and capability.  In that context, the committee may be aware in relation to the executive of the NPHDB, that the project director of the development board, who holds the statutory function of chief officer, announced his resignation in March, effective from early June.  Given the scale and complexity of the project and the challenges associated with both roles in this current phase of the project, the NPHDB decided that the roles should be divided.  Following receipt of sanction by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of the remuneration rate for the chief officer post, the job campaign was advertised by the Public Appointments Service last week.  Discussions are ongoing with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the terms and conditions for the recruitment of the project director post.<\/p><p> The PwC report's findings did not identify that the existing governance structures above the NPHDB contributed to the cost escalation.  The review was satisfied that these structures did not impede the flow of information in relation to the cost escalation but did find that the terms of reference and composition of the children's hospital project and programme steering group and board meant that their collective ability to provide challenge to the role of the NPHDB was limited, and accordingly recommends a review of these matters.  Such changes will form part of the implementation plan to be approved by the Government.<\/p><p> The project is now in the major construction phase.  Above-ground works at the St. James's site are progressing well with the structural frame, walls, slabs and columns now above ground level in most advanced areas.  Basement excavation and piling are now substantially complete.  The mechanical and electrical fit-out of the basement plant areas will commence in this quarter.  Construction work on the new children's hospital will be completed in the third quarter of 2022.  This will be followed by a period of commissioning and the hospital will open in 2023.<\/p><p> Work at the outpatient department, OPD, urgent care centre at Connolly is on target for handover to CHI this month followed by equipment installation and operational commissioning.  In fact, as the chair of the board will update us, the handover of the Connolly facility has taken place this week.  The delivery of services at the Connolly centre will be provided on a phased basis from the end of July 2019.  Decant works at Tallaght University Hospital are now complete and the new cr&egrave;che, changing facility and offices are open.  Construction work on the Tallaght paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre started last month and it is due to open next year.<\/p><p> Extensive engagement has taken place with the Oireachtas health committee and the Committee of Public Accounts on how the cost escalation came about and its reporting.  PwC reviewed more than 2,000 project documents, records and data.  The report documents what happened and the timeline of reporting.  I believe the review's findings on the reporting of the cost escalation are consistent with previous information provided to the Oireachtas, including this committee, and the documentation published by the Department and others.  The scale of the review, and the consequent robustness and comprehensiveness of the recommendations mean that the benefit of the review is of very considerable additional significance.<\/p><p> When we met the committee at the end of January, the Chairman impressed upon the witnesses the importance of the work required to complete the project and that the learning from the PwC should be used to inform the quality of that work.  We now have very detailed recommendations regarding the enhancement of control processes across the design team and the development board.  The board of the new development board has accepted these recommendations and implementation is under way.  PwC also quite correctly identifies that the nature of the project, which has now entered the major construction phase, will change as we approach the opening of the main hospital at St. James's.  The commissioning and bringing into operation of a project at this scale requires co-ordinated delivery of the building, equipment, technology, staff and clinical and non-clinical operations.  There is a very good working relationship between the development board and CHI.  This will be enhanced further with the support of the HSE and the Department and in line with the recommendations set out in the PwC report, for the benefit of the successful delivery of this major investment in children's health services.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and I am happy to address any queries<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019051600002#F01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557993600,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Breslin.

I am joined by Mr. Paul Quinn, board member of the development board, Mr. Jim Farragher, its finance officer, and Dr. Emma Curtis, who is the medical director of the development board.<\/p> <p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board was appointed in August 2013 to design, build, and equip a new children's hospital.<\/p><p>A planning application was lodged in August 2015 and An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted planning permission in April 2016 for the new children&rsquo;s hospital, the paediatric outpatients and urgent care centres at Connolly and Tallaght hospitals and related developments, including the Children&rsquo;s Research and Innovation Centre and a family accommodation unit adjacent to the new children&rsquo;s hospital.<\/p><p> The expenditure as at 31 December 2017 was &euro;67.2 million.  There is some more detail in the document which I will not read out if that is okay.  Also we have the draft unaudited expenditure as of 31 December 2018 and a date for Comptroller and Auditor General to audit these accounts has been set for late June 2019.  The expenditure in 2018 is &euro;129 million.<\/p><p> In December 2018 following the completion of the second stage of the two-stage procurement process, the final cost of the design, build and equipment programme for which the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, NPHDB, is responsible is now at &euro;1.433 billion, which is &euro;450 million more than advised to Government in April 2017.  Some &euro;319 million of the additional cost relates to construction costs, and the balance of &euro;131 million, which includes &euro;50 million in VAT, relates to costs associated with staff, construction-design consultants, planning, design team fees, risk and contingency.  Previously we included detail on the seven construction cost drivers in the briefing document sent to the committee for its review in January 2019.  A PwC review on the escalation of costs was commissioned by the HSE in January 2019 and the findings of the review were published on 9 April.<\/p><p> As discussed with the committee in January 2019, once the board became aware of the significant additional costs emerging, the board set in place a review of alternative options.  Contractually, the NPHDB did not have to proceed with the second stage - which is phase B above ground - construction works, and a number of options were considered and carefully evaluated.  The outcome of the options evaluated was a recommendation by the development board, accepted by the HSE, the Department of Health and Government, to proceed with the instruction of phase B works as it offered the best solution commercially and ensured the completion of the children&rsquo;s hospital in the shortest timeframe.<\/p><p> Since our last appearance before the committee in January 2019, the then chair, Tom Costello, resigned from the role and I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the contribution and personal commitment made by him.  Shortly after, I was pleased to be appointed to the role as chair of the NPHDB and I appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health to ratify my position as chair.  In March 2019, the project director, John Pollock decided that as the two-stage procurement process was finalised and approved, and the project has now moved into the final construction phase, it was an appropriate time for him to leave the project.<\/p><p> To this end and as per one of the recommendations from the recently published PwC report on cost escalation \"to strengthen the capacity of the NPH Executive\", we have recently advertised through the Public Appointments Service for a chief officer and we hope to interview for this role within the coming weeks.<\/p><p> As indicated, since our last appearance a PwC review on the cost escalation of the project has also taken place and recommendations have been made in this regard.  The board of the NPHDB has reviewed the report, acknowledged and noted the issues raised and the recommendations set out in the PwC report, and is developing an implementation plan against this.<\/p><p> Prior to the publication of the PwC report the board had identified and commenced implementing a number of key project changes, for example: strengthening the executive with separate chief officer and project director roles; establishing commissioning and project controls work streams within the NPHDB; key risks as a standing item at board meetings; agreed procurement strategy with stakeholders in relation to equipping the main children&rsquo;s hospital; and putting in place performance-based indicators with core design team members.  In addition, the NPHDB will continue to work with all stakeholders involved in this important project and will do all that is within its power to support the implementation of the PwC recommendations.<\/p><p> The paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre at Connolly hospital is complete and earlier this week was handed over to Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland for it to commence the commissioning and transitioning of staff.  Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland will operate the service and the centre is due to open in July 2019.<\/p><p> Decant works at Tallaght University Hospital are now complete, and the new cr&egrave;che, changing facility and offices are open.  Construction work on the 4,600 m2 paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre started last month and is due to open in 2020.<\/p><p> Construction work on the new children&rsquo;s hospital on a shared campus with St. James&rsquo;s is progressing well with the structural frame, walls, slabs and columns now above ground level in most advanced areas.  Basement excavation and piling are now substantially complete.  The mechanical and electrical fit-out of the basement plant areas is due to commence shortly.  Project costs incurred to end of March 2019, including construction costs were &euro;314 million.<\/p><p> Construction work on the new children&rsquo;s hospital is scheduled to be completed in quarter 3 2022.

Because of what has happened, I think we are going to have a lot of concentration on construction.  However, knowing what I know about projects, although this is a health project of a bigger scale, the biggest piece for the successful delivery of the benefits of the project is the handover and bringing the project into operation.  This includes commissioning phase, which the development board will be doing, but also the staffing, the introduction of the technology, the organisational culture and how it is all put in place in the new hospital.

I also welcome Mr. Gerry Kiely, head of the European Commission representation in Ireland.  On behalf of our Parliament, I wish everyone a warm welcome to Ireland.  We are proud members of the European Union and welcome the recent decision by EU leaders to put action on climate change at the top of the Union's agenda for the next five years.  While past performance on climate action across our political parties has not been strong, we are working hard to change that.  Climate change has arguably never been higher on the political agenda in Ireland than it is today.  Just a few weeks ago, Ireland became the second country in the world to declare a biodiversity and climate emergency, sending a strong message that the Oireachtas is taking these interlinked global challenges seriously.  However, it is vital that we go further than a political declaration.  We need decisive action.<\/p> <p>  A recently published report by this committee sets out more than 40 priority recommendations for the Government and State agencies.  It addresses actions across all relevant sectors and proposes a new governance framework for climate policy that will pave the way for more transformational changes in individual sectors.  The Government is now poised to set out its climate action roadmap, with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton's all-of-Government plan due to come before us in the coming weeks.  It will build on our report and set out practical actions to support Ireland in playing its part in addressing the global challenge of climate change fairly.  The committee will be responsible for scrutinising that all-of-Government plan and we will hold Ministers and public officials to account for its delivery.<\/p> <p>  Until the end of this year, we will continue our work examining climate policy in Ireland and driving actions that contribute to Ireland's national energy and climate plan, which is due to go to the European Commission in December.  We hope to have an extension of our mandate to become a permanent committee so that we would hold the Government to account on an ongoing basis.  I would like to see our political parties continue to work together, which we have done well until now, on charting a course to stronger action on climate change in Ireland.  With continued cross-party support and much work across the Government and all sections of our economy and society, we can get Ireland back on track and keep us there to meet our international climate change obligations.  We look forward to hearing from the witnesses regarding the strategy for Europe to become the world's first major economy to go climate neutral by 2050.<\/p> <p>  I invite Mr. Petriccione to make his opening address, which we will be happy to hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019051600002#A00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557961200,"counter":1337,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for her kind introduction.  I am happy to be before the committee to give evidence on the European Commission's proposals on a climate neutral Europe by 2050.<\/p><p>I will not elaborate on the impact of climate change.  It would be superfluous to do so in front of this committee.  Suffice it to say that our concerns continue to increase.  The science has not only been very clear, as in the IPCC report last year on the impact of global warming of 1.5&deg;C, but every additional item of scientific information confirms that the situation is perhaps even more difficult than we had envisaged.  The urgency is evident.  As members have pointed out, we consider the circumstances in Ireland with some concern and look forward to the new national plan to have a clear view on where Ireland intends to redress certain shortcomings.<\/p><p> This is not a surprise or a unique set of circumstances in Europe.  The transformation required is massive.  It will tax the way we all think in policymaking in Europe.  There are shortcomings across the European Union.  They differ and are rooted in different national realities but this is the time for all of us to work together to correct them.<\/p><p> Reference was made to the national energy and climate plan Ireland has presented in draft form.  The Commission will issue recommendations for all the plans by the end of June.  The objective of the Commission is not to sit in judgment on the national plans but to point out where more work is required, encourage the exchange of best practice among member states, flag best practice that other member states could study and imitate, and arrive at a better picture at the end of this year in terms of the national plans and their overall coherence.  We do not expect the plans to be perfect.  There is a lot of work required in Europe.  In certain areas, it is clear that the national legislative and regulatory work will not happen in the space of a few months.  This is the start of a process of continuous dialogue between member states and European institutions to improve our policies towards 2030.<\/p><p> We all know the policies we have adopted in legislation for 2030 in themselves will not help us to do our part in reaching the goals of the Paris Agreement but they are, contrary to the views of some, profoundly transformative.  If they are implemented in full and correctly, they will be capable of changing the way we address the problem and of teaching us how to continue to accelerate our policymaking towards the objective of climate neutrality.<\/p><p> One of the reasons the Commission has wanted to propose climate neutrality as an objective is that we need an endpoint that is sufficiently ambitious to meet our objectives so as to guide us in the further development of our policies after 2030.  At present, however, it is only a proposal by the Commission.  A criticism we receive very often is that we are not very explicit about how the policies will be developed after 2030.  I will try to give members some indication.  The important point is that we now have strong political endorsement at European level.  The formal endorsement ought to come from the Heads of State and Government in the European Council.  We have advocated and tried to facilitate by supplying information and explanations.  It has to be based on deep and strong national debates.  We need to have an endorsement of the objective at institutional level but with sufficiently deep roots such that we can examine its implementation over what is an unusually long planning or policy period.  Thirty years is not a period we normally operate under.<\/p><p> Having said all this, let me give the members a very brief description of what is in the strategy.  First, it is based on a very thorough scientific and economic analysis and the best science we collect.  We have seen recently confirmation of the soundness of that approach in the similar report that the British Committee on Climate Change has produced.  In many ways, it confirms our analysis and, in other ways, takes it further.  We would welcome more work of that nature in member states and elsewhere.  We need to continue to deepen the analysis.<\/p><p> We have analysed eight scenarios.  They are not predictions or representations of what the Commission believes Europe will look like in 2050.  These scenarios are meant to expose a range of possibilities or options to allow readers to form a judgment on the feasibility of certain policy choices, their implications and what is required to realise them.  Five of the scenarios would result in a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of about 80%.  They are based on what we call single technologies.  One takes one main technology and makes a number of assumptions to push it as far as one can.  With regard to electrification, let us electrify everything we can think of.  Let us replace fossil fuels with decarbonised fuels by using the same architecture we have in terms of power generation and distribution.  None of the scenarios, under these conditions, is capable of achieving the desired objectives.  It is only when one starts combining technologies and creating a more complex system that resembles the complexity of our current economy that one approaches and finally meets the objective of net zero emissions by 2050.  Of the two scenarios that describe this, one incorporates a strong analysis of behavioural change, extrapolating from trends we see in our society today.  The other scenario introduces a substantial, but still complementary and not mainstream, element of carbon capture.  Our analysis nowadays is that carbon capture cannot be the ultimate solution, which would enable us to decarbonise society without changing anything else.  There will, however, be applications where carbon capture is likely to prove indispensable if we want to have a total reduction in emissions.<\/p><p> On the basis of these scenarios, the Commission has made a political choice to propose to member states to endorse the objective of carbon neutrality.  We have chosen the term to capture a number of the terms that are in common usage in this debate.  As is well known in Ireland, there is a real issue concerning emissions in the agriculture and land use sector.  European agriculture is one of the core policies of European Union.  We are aware that decarbonising and eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector, at least in the foreseeable future, is likely to be impossible.  We have to manage that.  I refer also to the notion of net zero, building on the fact that our land sector nowadays has a good carbon balance.  Our carbon sink is effective and we ought to maintain, enhance and nurture it over time.  One of its functions will be to compensate for emissions outside the agriculture sector, which may prove impossible.  I am thinking, for instance, of the most difficult area, namely, aviation.  All the scenarios, forecasts and projections are based on the preventative assumption that we have the technology to meet the objective.  We are not relying on new inventions and we are not relying on future and unproven technologies.  Granted, some of these technologies have not been tested at scale.  They have been tested in pilot projects, however, and are known to work.<\/p><p>It is not clear how much of a scale is needed to make some of them commercially viable.  It is already clear that some of them would benefit from further research and refinement.  I am thinking of batteries, for instance, with storage of electricity being one of the bottlenecks we have identified.  The fact remains that this is a prudential analysis based on technologies that we have and that we can use and improve without having to adopt a revolutionary approach or without having to hope that our scientists will produce a miracle solution.<\/p><p> The other important aspect is that this is as much a strategy for economic development as for climate action.  Our assumption has always been that any strategy which did not guarantee the continuing prosperity of European society and economy had very little chance to be politically acceptable, even for a purpose as important as climate change.  We have concentrated on developing a strategy which concentrates as much on prosperity.<\/p><p> The existing situation is not satisfactory.  We have an economy which is still doing reasonably well but has many fragilities, and our competitiveness is under pressure from competitors abroad.  We are losing the technological lead and must spend important capital to modernise our industrial fabric.  Our energy supply continues to be outside our control with serious implications on energy security and independence.  We have tried to develop a strategy which addresses these issues as well as climate change and we believe that this strategy is capable of doing that.  This is an investment strategy.<\/p><p> One of the difficulties is that much of the necessary investment is front-loaded over the next ten to 15 years.  That will be a challenge.  At the same time, there is an enormous appetite in the private sector for finding ways to deploy capital in this direction.  One of the priorities, in the view of the Commission, is to concentrate on ways to facilitate and incentivise the employment of private capital in this direction.  We see this, essentially, as an investment challenge as opposed to a cost issue.  The cost is the impact of climate change and these are investments to avoid those costs.<\/p><p> I am happy to answer any questions that the committee has.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019051600002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mauro Petriccione","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557961200,"counter":1340,"content":"<p>I omitted earlier to read out matters to do with privilege.

I thank them for being here and for their presentation which is welcome, considering the state of our preparedness to address climate change.  We all recognise that we are well behind in addressing it.  The Citizens' Assembly has given us in the Oireachtas food for thought by encouraging us to prepare a report which we have just published.  It is now for the Government to set out an action plan for addressing climate change, and that is welcome.<\/p> <p> I noted, within the presentation, something that is often missed in the climate change debate, which is the economic opportunity of the potential developments.  That is often lost.  Climate change, and the actions that flow from that, have only negative connotations in the minds of some.  There is also a positive side to it.  That said, we must also address, as the committee did in its report, the necessity to have a just transition for those sectors of the economy that will be negatively affected by the behavioural change that is necessary to address climate change.  I hope the Commission will be mindful of that and support member states that will have particular difficulties in addressing that.<\/p> <p>  My question is about the consistency of the EU's climate strategy and specifically the targets of the Paris Agreement objectives.  Would our guests comment on the recent European Parliament resolution that the EU's 2030 target must be increased by 55% to get to net zero by 2050?  I believe that is based on hard evidence but not every member state has signed up to that, including Ireland.  We must get serious and not only talk about it.  Any of the model trajectories for achieving the targets by 2050 suggest that the sooner we start, the easier it will be and the less impact there will be annually.  It obviously makes sense to bite the bullet now rather than later.

The committee recently presented its climate action report to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the D&aacute;il.  We were very conscious of a just transition for our peat industry when we were considering that report and yet our Government has had to commit to not using peat for energy generation after 2028.  We have three power stations, two of which are based in Edenderry and Shannonbridge in County Offaly, which I represent.

Mr. Petriccione has spoken about building the bio-economy and natural carbon sinks.

Co-operation on a European level to protect the planet and reduce global warming through climate action is very important.  The proposal our guests are putting forward seems to put sustainable development goals on the same level as industrial competitiveness.  That needs to be examined.  I agree with Mr. Petriccione that, while it may seem burdensome that we must reduce emissions and change habits, it presents opportunities for different types of economics and industries.  That is the big change we must make and Mr. Petriccione might comment on that.<\/p><p> My other question relates to our failure.  I was a Member of the previous D&aacute;il which legislated five years ago for climate action.  I expressed concerns at that time that we did not have sectoral targets or marked milestones or staging posts for reaching achievable, measurable target by stages.  The concern is that we have drifted into our current position as a result of that.  Will the witness comment on that?  How important is it to have set carbon budgets?<\/p><p> My last question is about just transition.  Like Deputy Corcoran Kennedy, I live in a part of the country where peat extraction for horticulture, domestic fuel and fuel to generate energy will be phased out.  It is accepted that this must happen.  However, it has already created much unemployment in County Laois, where I live.  Some of it is caused by the phasing out of horticultural peat.  Where previously there were up to 300 people working there during the summer, now there are three or four.  Some type of package of matching funding is needed to assist Bord na M&oacute;na, in particular.  Bord na M&oacute;na is a semi-State company and it is trying to move from the brown extraction industry, the extraction of peat, to regenerating biodiversity and renewable energy.  It is trying to move from brown to green and it needs help to do that.  It needs approximately &euro;50 million, to quote the figure it has mentioned.  Will the witness comment on that?  We believe it would help the Irish economy, which has come through a difficult stage following the economic crash.  We are beginning to emerge from that but this would help a part of Ireland, the midlands, where the income per head of population is much lower than it is in the Dublin region.  We are anxious to create more balanced development, and it is a goal of the European Union not to have regions lagging behind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019051600002#C00800","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557961200,"counter":1348,"content":"<p>I thank the members for the questions.  I will start with just transition, the common thread among the questions.  First, I return to the issue that our current economic model is being challenged in any event by a number of mega trends.  Climate change is perhaps the most urgent because of its disruptive nature on our entire planet and society, but if we limit ourselves to our economic fabric, digitisation, automation, artificial intelligence, the development of three dimensional, 3D, printing and the competitive rise of other economies in the world are all imposing pressure and, by and large, and I am not saying this is a precise view, the sectors and areas that are under pressure are always the same.  The question of just transition grafts itself onto the bigger issue of accompanying the changes in our economy in a fair and equitable manner.  There are some instruments in Europe at European and national levels.  We have made good use of them but we could always do with more and better.  I do not wish to sing the praises of the policies we have and claim they are sufficient to resolve the problem.  The only claim I am making is that this is an additional facet and adds pressure to areas, sectors and people which are already under pressure and towards whom we already have an obligation to act and solve the problem.  That might facilitate the issue in some ways because we can use some of the instruments we already have.<\/p> <p>  The second point is that one of the issues with which we have traditionally struggled has been what the transition should be towards.  The problem has often been not so much finding the resources to ease the exit of workers from a certain sector in a certain area but to provide them with viable, long-term, stable and sustainable alternatives.  It has often been not so much what we do in the immediate term but what we should do it for in the longer term.  The economic development we see as a consequence of the climate transformation is at least capable of facilitating this, although I am not offering certainties here.<\/p> <p>  On the question of how to convert workers in areas of traditional agricultural production that need to adapt or in the peatland the two Deputies mentioned, one of the assumptions we made in our analysis is that a very important component of the transition will have to be development of the use of biomass.  To be usable for a climate transition, biomass must be accompanied by technology such as carbon sequestration, but we must also think of where the biomass comes from.  We do not wish to import massive deforestation from abroad or to alter our carbon sink, but if one looks at our analysis, there is plenty of space in Europe by improving agricultural practices, improving forest management practices, converting what is currently economically marginal agricultural land to the production of biomass and bringing back into production some of the land that was set aside in the past to reduce our agricultural surpluses.<\/p> <p>  There are objective reasons to believe that, well-managed, we could double our production of biomass and make that into a very important component of the transformation.  That will happen, by and large, in many of these challenged rural areas.  The instruments for a transition are available under the Common Agricultural Policy, the Cohesion Fund and the European Social Fund.  I will not pretend that these funds alone are sufficient to solve all the problems of this type that we will have in Europe, but members of the committee know that Ireland has been an important and effective user of these funds and that they can be used to very good purpose.  They can be matched by national funds.  If planned, this is one of the instruments we can use to ease the transition.<\/p> <p>  On the question of peat as a fuel, the Deputy's question also poses a longer-term challenge.  Aside from the climate transition, that production is only there because it is subsidised.  We all know that at some point in the longer term the pressure to stop the subsidisation will grow.  In any event we need to find alternatives to ease transition.  A similar problem arises with coal production in a number of member states.  Some member states have already implemented measures.  I have in mind the Spanish Government and the measure it has taken to ease the exit from coal in terms of closing the publicly owned mines.  That has been accompanied by an important social package, supported by national and European resources.  The situation is more difficult for other member states such as Poland and Germany.  Other countries such as Slovakia are also exiting coal through the same or similar mechanisms of support.<\/p> <p>  To summarise, just transition is essential.<\/p><p>A transition which is perceived as being unjust or as adding unduly to pressure that people in some sectors or areas already feel has very little chance of succeeding and receiving political support.  We do have the instruments to accompany those transitions.  The climate transition does not in itself create the problem of transition alone.  It is a problem we already have and which we already need to solve.  It might direct us towards a longer-term, more viable and more sustainable solution than might otherwise be the case.  We do not see it as an easy challenge; we see it as a very serious issue that is inevitable with or without the climate transition.  <\/p><p> On economic opportunities, it is very difficult to express without falling into one extreme or the other, but it is a climate action strategy.  Its objective is to stop climate change, first by enabling Europe to do its part and second, by Europe offering a successful model for others to follow to solve a global problem.  Since this requires a deep transformation of the economy, we think it is impossible to affect this transformation by stopping segments of our economy.  By definition, the only viable climate strategy is one that transforms our economy into an equally functioning economy but one that is decarbonised and clean.  When I refer to the counterfactual, which I know reasonably well having spent 30 years of my career in trade policy, the kind of economy that we are trying to describe in the long-term strategy is one that is probably going to be more advantageous to us and a better economy than the one we have today, which is not to be taken for granted.  Maintaining our economy today will be very expensive in the next years and decades.  That money could be wasted because climate change and the lack of resilience of this economic model could destroy all the efforts we would make in maintaining it.  <\/p><p> On the European Parliament's resolution, there is a debate on the nature of the trajectory between now and 2050.  If one thinks in terms of linear development, then yes, the minus 40% to which we have committed and the minus 45% which we will achieve on the basis of our current legislation, if properly implemented, is not sufficient.  It needs to go in the region of minus 55%.  On the other hand - and I am sure the committee has had plenty of experience on this - policy developments are rarely linear over the long term.  They are much more likely to be based on a progression where policies are started as one can and further developed and accelerated.  If one looks at European climate policy, which we started only after 1990, between 1990 and 2017 we reduced our emission by 22% while increasing our GDP by 58%.  The 2030 legislation will bring us to reducing emissions by another 23% in 13 years, between 2018 and 2030.  That means basically doubling the rate of change.  That will not be sufficient but it shows that one can accelerate a policy change and in fact, there are arguments to say that if we had tried in 1990 to set the kind of target that would bring us in a linear fashion to where we are today, we would have failed.  The Commission's perspective is from a pragmatic policy approach.  The 2030 legislation is what it is.  It is what could meet the consensus among member states and the European Parliament.  It is already transformative.  Take the example of passenger cars: a 37% reduction between now and 2030 is capable - I have no guarantee that it will do so - of triggering a transformation that will make further standards unnecessary because if manufacturers are pushed to put sufficient numbers of electric models on the roads at prices comparable to combustion vehicles, the market is ready to absorb it.  This involves us doing our part in financing the necessary infrastructure for charging, for instance.  If that does not happen and those standards are not sufficient, we will have to legislate new and stricter standards for post 2030.  The Parliament resolution is based on one assumption, which is that policy is developed exclusively in a linear fashion.  That is certainly not true.  Whether linear development or a progression is the best is an open question - there is a debate on that - but it is certainly not true that policies can only be done in a linear fashion.<\/p><p> Finally, the issue of sectoral targets is another debate.  Our judgment has been that sectoral targets at European level are very unlikely to be the basis for a consensus and that it would have been very difficult to operate them effectively at European level.  That does not mean that they cannot be set and operated at national level.  Some member states have experimented with that, some more successfully than others.  There is no perfect, or even good recipe, on sectoral targets.  In the same spirit, with the effort-sharing decision and now the effort-sharing regulation, we have experimented with a combination of a European-wide target and national targets.  The one thing I would add is that at European level - and several member states, including Ireland now, have made the same choice - it has been decided that planning is the tool to translate overall mandatory targets into specific policies and measures.  Hence the governance regulation and the obligation for all member states to equip themselves with a national energy and climate plan.  Some member states have gone further.  One reason I am looking forward to seeing the Irish Government's whole-of-government approach, as announced, is because from the description, it could go further in its precision and reach over the plans in the governance regulation.  My own country has successfully experimented with allocating the national targets on a regional basis and involving the regional institutions, governments and parliaments in the planning.  It has worked extremely well for the 2020 targets and it is repeating the experiment for the 2030 target.  For us, what is important is that as a member state, we have created a European framework that encourages better planning.  We see that there is a take-up of this by member states which often goes further than the minimum European standard.  We think that is a very good thing and that it will be a very useful instrument for the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019051600002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mauro Petriccione","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557961200,"counter":1350,"content":"<p>I will move onto our next round of speakers.

It has dragged the Council forward and I commend the Commission on how it has done that.  However, now we have to act.<\/p> <p>  The Irish plan, which we will see in June, is critical for us.  This committee has looked at this matter in detail over the last year.  We cannot be exact but we will have a gap of approximately 100 million tonnes from our 2030 target.  The national development plan, which was approved last June, had no climate assessment done in respect of it at all.<\/p><p>The modelling done since shows that it might only bring us one third of the way in which we might need to go to meet our 2030 target, let alone a target of a net zero by 2050.  It does not think that way.  In transport, our emissions are projected to rise even if we get 500,000 electric vehicles, as has been expressed.  Our transport policy goes completely against the one the Commission set out in point No. 3 of its seven points.  We are continuing to follow a sprawled transport model.  We have 51 major national roads and motorway programmes under construction and in planning.  We do not have a single public transport project at the same stage.  Our commuting distances are lengthening.  The emissions projections from that do not relate to just the transport sector but the construction of services infrastructure to service this sprawled model that we are following.  Similarly, with regard to heat, we have a target in our national development plan to have 45,000 houses a year retrofitted and upgraded to a building energy rating, BER, of B1 or higher.  Last year, we did 1,000 houses at most.  We are a minute fraction of the way towards achieving this.  Even though the national development plan has projects that would give emissions reductions, the truth is that they are not being delivered in reality.  The chances of that changing within two years at the starting point of this new strategy are minimal.<\/p><p> We have potential for carbon sequestration and storage in forestry.  There is widespread public opposition to the nature of forestry in Ireland at present.  The short rotation, single crop, monocultural forestry model has reached the end of the road with regard to public acceptance and we do not have an alternative forestry plan in place.<\/p><p> Also with regard to heat, we had an interesting session in this room yesterday where the key people working in the retrofitting industry acknowledged that we have no apprenticeships ready to do the work.  The Department responsible for that is doing nothing about it.  We cannot get the workers here today to start the energy efficiency work that we need to do.  The entire range of things that we need to do are not happening.  That 100 million tonne gap might be an optimistic forecast of where we are.<\/p><p> The Government and Civil Service are working diligently and there is greatly increased political interest in this subject, so we will try to do our best.  What adjustment mechanisms does the Commission intend to plan if it sees a plan come to it in June which does not have realistic measures to close that gap?  Ireland is committing to a 30% target as part of the EU's overall effort, which feeds into Europe's commitment in the Paris Agreement.  If a country clearly is not closing that gap, especially in the non-emissions trading system sector, where our problems are most acute, what adjustment mechanisms does the Commission intend to apply?  How will that work in the six months to the end of December, when one would expect this plan to be signed off on?  Critically, in a country where we have a minority Government and the Parliament has real voting power, with this committee being a good example of how we can work well together as a Parliament, what access mechanisms will there be for members of this committee to the Commission with regard to this process?  What I like about the governance mechanisms the Commission has written for this process is that it is not a centralised top-down approach but encourages consultation, transparency and involvement.<\/p><p> As committee members with a real interest in this issue and a certain expertise, having worked on this in detail for the last year, what is our involvement in the Commission's process with the Government?  Will the Commission be open to engagement with parliamentary committees or parliamentarians in this process of checking, testing and revising?  There is no doubt that it will not finish by December.  It is a plan which will evolve as we learn.  What is the Commission's capability to connect with parliamentary systems in this evolving process?<\/p><p> I have a technical question.  I like that the Commission's approach has been trying to move away from everyone working individually but recognises that one has to look to one's neighbours to meet this challenge.  We are required to ask what we could do to meet our needs by using interconnection rather than every country going alone.  We have difficult circumstances in that regard because we do not know the position of the United Kingdom.  It will have European Parliament elections next week and one does not know for how long those MEPs will sit.  There are two critical aspects for us in this transition.  We are ambitious to become one of the leading countries in running a renewable electricity system, with 70% of our electricity coming from variable power supply.  As an isolated synchronous grid, that is quite a challenge.  To meet it, we have to have a further integrated connection, not just with France but also with the United Kingdom.  How do we write our plan with that uncertainty?  My preference is that we continue to see the United Kingdom, in effect, as a member of the single electricity market and do not freeze it out of this process.  It is in all of our interests, including the continental countries, to have the UK as a balancing partner.<\/p><p> With regard to gas security, we have one field, which will diminish over the lifetime of this plan.  We will be completely dependent on the UK gas interconnection.  I believe we should depend on that.  I do not believe that we should introduce liquefied natural gas, since additional gas infrastructure would be a stranded asset.  What assurances can the Commission give us, considering Brexit, with regard to gas security?  What plans is the Commission making to ensure gas security in a difficult political world?<\/p><p> Mr. Petriccione rightly made the point that we are dealing with very complex systems with a more integrated response.  We declared a climate emergency two weeks ago, which is a very important statement by this Parliament.  It was also a declaration of a biodiversity emergency.  It is vital that, whatever we do with regard to climate, we integrate the need to restore our natural systems in the responses that we make.  I am interested to know how the Commission sees that working.  I am concerned with some of the mention Mr. Petriccione made about the increase in biomass production.  That may have significant consequences for biodiversity on our island.  I say that because he mentioned marginal wetlands potentially being used for production of biomass.  Those wetlands are vital as a carbon storage space and for the protection of biodiversity.  We have seen in Northern Ireland, part of our island, that incentives for biomass production and anaerobic digestion have led to substantial expansion of pig and poultry production.  There are significant knock-on consequences from some biomass solutions that may be turned to.  How do the witnesses stitch biodiversity protection into climate action within a plan?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019051600002#E00300","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557961200,"counter":1353,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Petriccione for his contribution, about which he already has been asked very detailed questions.

At what point will the Commission react?  Will it be at 2030 or earlier?  Mr. Petriccione used an example of the roll-out of electric vehicles.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the long-term strategy and its legal status, I am not certain how the Commission can force member states to comply with it.  Will the witnesses address that further?  We are very slow to respond even when there is a way to force us but if there is no way to force us, I do not know how we will ever respond at all.<\/p> <p>  Will the witnesses address the 1.5&deg;C goal and reduction targets?  Now is the time to react on that.  The Commission is saying that if the strategy is successful, it will not achieve that but will show that it can be achieved.  Surely it needs to aim to achieve that now to be effective in making that happen, especially with the reduction in stranded assets that could happen if the target was set now rather than waiting to 2050.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the use of fossil fuels in the EU's strategy, how does the Commission view the ongoing use of fossil fuels?<\/p><p>There cannot be a transition fuel.

Air pollution is a problem in Europe.  There have been 800,000 deaths as a result of it, as well as incidences of respiratory tract diseases, infections and conditions such as asthma.

Is it feasible to provide low-cost loans to enable people to retrofit?  In the Government plan, there were only 1,000 loans and many more rejections.  People on the threshold had no incentive to retrofit and they do not have the means as they are living in borderline poverty.  Would the EU play a part?  Our guests were presented with eight long-term strategic options, two of which seemed achievable for the 1.5&deg;C scenario.

There is full respect for institutional relations and we will not interact with national parliaments in a way that diminishes the prerogative of national governments or interferes with the constitutional process in member states.  It is not our role or mandate - that is anathema to us.  We are talking about debate, information and analysis.  Our job is to provide the whole of Europe with the best analysis, the best options and the best solutions we can devise.  By definition, that includes, indeed prioritises, institutional actors in member states.  We have neither the resources nor the role to regularly contact national parliaments directly.  Nevertheless, the door of the Commission is open to any citizen who wants to communicate with us and, especially, to people's representatives.  If this committee, or individual Members of the Irish Parliament, wish to continue this exchange, our doors are open, directly, in person or by electronic means.  Our representations in member states are there to facilitate this exchange and we will do the best we can in this respect.  I always tell people that I will answer their questions.  If they want a fast answer, they should ask an urgent question but the resources of the Commission are what they are, while my Directorate-General has just 200 people to run the Europe-wide climate policy.  To the despair of my staff, I spend 80% of my time having this kind of discussion.  If there is anything missing from this conversation we will be very happy to provide it.<\/p> <p>  A question that was asked by many members was on house renovation.  We see energy efficiency as a key to energy transformation.  It has emerged, from the overall view of the national energy and climate plans for member states, that current plans and policies for energy efficiency are insufficient to reach the 32.5% target for 2030, let alone to be scaled up towards 2050, when we foresee a reduction of energy consumption by approximately 50% as necessary to achieve our objectives.  That is a fact; it is not a statement that is meant to scare anybody.<\/p><p>The recommendation on the national plans which the Commission will issue in June identifies this as an area for priority action.  We need to develop more and better ideas and better plans, measures and policies on energy efficiency.  Building for innovation is crucial in that regard.  Regulations for new buildings can always improve, but in our view they are more or less adequate.  Renovation of existing buildings is a real issue.  It is also the great reservoir of energy gains.  The major stumbling block in that area is financing.  It is not so much the cost of financing; we can always subsidise interest rates.  Doing so is not very expensive.  However, many individual homeowners, small enterprises running small clusters of business for residential or commercial rental purposes and local authorities managing social housing simply do not have a credit rating that enables them to borrow.  Moreover, a publicly-financed mechanism cannot provide the necessary scale.  By and large, this transformation cannot be paid for entirely out of the public purse.  It is beyond our capability.<\/p><p> Having said that, we have strong evidence that there is massive interest in the private sector in contributing to this.  There is capital in Europe in search of gainful employment.  The issue concerns the measures to be taken.  How do we bridge the gap between the availability of finance, the risk factor and the uses to which we want to direct it?  It is possible but not easy.  I have one practical example.  We are, through the LIFE programme, financing a pilot project whereby the Commission will allocate a reasonable amount of funding to act as collateral for commercial loans.  Over five years, this will amount to almost &euro;150 million.  It is beginning to work.  It is not a subsidy to the bank or the owner.  These are commercial loans, but the existence of public money as collateral lowers the risk profile of the borrowers and enables the commercial bank to make a loan it would otherwise find too risky.  We have been struggling with this project because commercial banks are not used to it.  They are not used to evaluating projects of this kind because they have considered them too risky.  As such, they do not usually even look at them.  Together with the European Investment Bank, we have had to invest money in programmes helping participating commercial banks to train staff to assess these loans quite apart from the question of the financial risk.  They assess whether the borrower is trustworthy and carry out the rest of the commercial operations.  It is now beginning to work.  We must decide whether this project is worth completing and replicating or whether we should do something else.<\/p><p> One point we must put squarely on the table is that there should be collective work between European institutions, member states and the financial sector to devise mechanisms to bridge the gap between bringing about the climate transition and the availability of private capital, which is largely unemployed in Europe.  One of the natural but unpleasant effects of the tightening of our credit system after the financial crash is that we have made our banking system much more risk-averse than before.  As the members know, when we talk about appreciation of risk it is easy to swing in the opposite direction.  We need a correction in that regard.  There is appetite for that in the financial sector and work on it is afoot.  It is not a simple issue but it is fundamental.  Apart from energy efficiency, the side benefits of housing renovation in public health and quality of life are potentially enormous.  There is a huge amount of real estate capital in Europe that could benefit.  That is without even mentioning the situation in eastern Europe, where much of the housing stock dates from the Soviet era.  Members can imagine the quality of that housing stock.<\/p><p> One of the members stated something that was spot on.  Current plans are not the right type of thinking.  The Commission maintains that this transformation requires a qualitative change in the way we think.  Emissions reductions are no longer enough.  Such reductions need to be capable of being scaled up towards zero.  Not all policies are equally good in that respect.  We need policies that are capable of transforming our economic model in a sustainable and potentially indefinite manner.  They have to fit with other mega-trends.  We cannot think of clean mobility and electric cars separately to the trend towards automated cars.  This requires a radical change in the way we think.  The way our world is developing will force that change on us regardless of whether we like it.  We see the energy transformation and the climate transformation as one of the opportunities to take control of that process rather than being victims of it.  We are not pretending it is easy; this is a generational challenge.  We are going to be challenged regardless of what we do, so we might as well try to drive the process rather than be driven by it and possibly driven against a wall.<\/p><p> A member mentioned that the forestry model is not acceptable.  That is true in many ways.  That is why we are not proposing a European forestry model.  Many of these policies can only be devised at local level.  Our biggest policy is the Common Agricultural Policy, yet Irish representatives know better than many others how local that policy actually operates.  Let us consider mobility.  Other than in a small country, and I am not sure that Ireland qualifies as a small country for these purposes, mobility cannot be solved at a national level, let alone at European level.  National governments can facilitate the transition, create infrastructure, help finance it and create the framework.  They can create the compulsion to reduce CO2.  However, mobility must be solved at the local level.  It must be solved by local public transport, intra-urban and inter-urban transport and alternatives to individual mobility in the form of the car, such as the explosion of shared vehicles, electric bikes and scooters.  In Brussels, five companies started offering electric scooters in the space of six months.  Local authorities are becoming increasingly annoyed because these things are scattered all over the streets.  They are now thinking of regulating the parking of electric scooters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019051600002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mauro Petriccione","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557961200,"counter":1360,"content":"<p>It is the same here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019051600002#H00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557961200,"counter":1361,"content":"<p>That happened in six months.  I refer to the spatial distribution of territory.  It is very clear that, perhaps unwittingly, we have encouraged commuting to an extent which has become unhealthy for many of our cities and urban areas.  What can we do about this?  It is not going to be solved at national level.  It is going to be solved at the local and regional levels.<\/p> <p>  I refer to energy production.  We will not replace the current totally centralised production model and totally diffused consumption model with a clean model which is otherwise identical.<\/p><p>We are not going to move to a total diffusion of energy production, but we must move towards a more balanced model of energy production.  We will continue to have large production facilities, but will also have point-to-point production and consumption.  That will also happen at a local level.  When I meet mayors or regional administrators, recurring questions are what policies can we put in place and what support can we receive for local renewables, which is not the same as the mass renewable project we used to consider.  If a forestry model is acceptable to Ireland, it is Ireland's choice.  The Common Agricultural Policy is capable of supporting it, but it needs to be greened significantly.  We have thus far tried to do this, but what we have done is not sufficient.  The legal instruments are already in place in the regulation, not least in what the Commission has proposed in the new multi-annual framework for the period 2021 to 2027, inclusive, but it will also require much more co-operation among member states with the institutions and farmers to develop new and better models.  It is not a uniquely Irish problem; it is found almost throughout Europe.  We need to find a way to have better agricultural practices, better management of commercial forests and better preservation of primary forest cover, which, at least in certain parts of Europe, remains sizeable.<\/p><p> I may have misspoken earlier, but I was referring to economically marginal agricultural land, that is, land which is cultivated with food and commercial crops.  In some parts of Europe the economic yield from that cultivation is marginal.  Converting that land to be used for biomass could be a rational proposition for farmers.

Again, we do not suggest everybody must convert every metre of available land not used for something better to be used for biomass.  All member states will not be able to use biomass as a significant source of power.  When we speak about biomass, we do not speak exclusively about what grows in the land.  We must move away from crop-based biofuels.  The Commission has proposed the phasing out of the eligibility of the fuel quality directive and, fortunately, the Council and the Parliament have agreed with us.  The situation is confused, but, ultimately, we must move towards second and third generation biofuels.  We do not suggest a mechanical transfer of land from one use to another, but it is clear that if we want to achieve climate neutrality, we need to use more biomass that must be sustainable and not wreak havoc on the environment.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Eamon Ryan asked about the links between biodiversity and climate action.  They are very close.  One can, if one so wishes, create a climate policy at the expense of environmental conservation, in the same way there can be an energy security policy at the expense of the climate, but that is not the point.  We are trying to maintain a coherent consistency.  I do not claim that we have achieved it or that we are infallible, but I am sure that whenever we fail to ensure coherence, it will be pointed out to us in no uncertain terms.  Frankly, that does not worry us in the slightest; on the contrary, we consider it crucial.<\/p> <p>  I spend a fair amount of my time co-operating with my colleagues in charge of the environment and trying to ensure coherency.  Sooner rather than later, we will see the draft environmental action plan which will include a concrete example of an attempt to make explicit the coherence between climate policy and our other environmental policies, including that on air quality.  Thus far, the largest contributor to reducing emissions from transport in urban areas has been air quality legislation, but, unfortunately, it does not automatically translate.  From an emissions point of view, as we saw following the diesel scandal, while petrol cars respect air quality standards more easily than diesel cars, they also increase emissions.  As a result of the diesel scandal in 2017, road transport emissions reached a peak.  Fortunately, it was a transitory phenomenon and emissions are reducing again, but it made us worried.  Policy coherence is essential, but we should not be paralysed and do nothing while we continuously seek coherence.  It is a continuous process.<\/p> <p>  I will try to group my answers to the questions asked about the planning process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019051600002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mauro Petriccione"},{"type":"speech","time":1557961200,"counter":1365,"content":"<p>I must catch a train.

There is the short-term issue of governance regulation and the broader issue of a plan.  As far as governance regulation is concerned, on the face of it, it is a one-off exercise.  Drafts have been produced, more or less on time.  We are reviewing them and will issue a set of recommendations by the end of June.  We do not intend to sit in judgment on the Mercedes plan.  We will not issue a recommendation that will pass judgment on the quality of the plan or anything else.  The recommendation will identify what we see as a lack of clarity on how policies will be implemented and financed because, in some cases, they are simply not clear.  A policy may be stated and announced but short on detail.  We will also point out to member states whether the policy the plan announces appears to be capable, on the basis of the information provided, of fulfilling the objectives of mandatory European legislation.  In a number of cases that will not be the case and we will point it out supported by facts, given that the analysis will be factual.  We will point to areas where the plans could benefit from clearer explanations, better analysis and explanations, and we will flag what we consider to be particularly effective examples of ways to address issues in a plan in order that member states will have access to a coherent analysis of how they can improve the plans.  The objective is to have better plans at the end of the year and the discussions we have had in the Council working group have been unusually constructive in that respect.<\/p> <p>  There is a realisation that it is a common problem, that no member state has a monopoly of wisdom and that issues are complicated and need to be addressed everywhere.  There is a considerable desire for a common analysis to learn from one another and examine best practice.  We are keen to encourage that process.  We hope and trust that afterwards it will encourage a permanent move towards better planning in the climate field.  We have seen a number of examples that comfort us in that regard.  I mentioned my country and the fact that the allocation of targets at a regional level was being replicated in the 2030 targets.  We have seen the Irish plan.<\/p><p>The committee knows as well as I what are the shortcomings of the policy.  It is a very robust, accurate and honest analysis of the position.  There is a good standard of quality in terms of preparing or writing a plan and we would like member states to move towards that standard rather than away from it.  We hope and trust this can be continued over time.  We will find an informal way to improve it.<\/p><p> Interconnections are absolutely necessary.  There is a reluctance from the Commission to speculate about Brexit but to be honest I wish I had an answer to this and many other questions we all have about what will happen with Brexit.  It is very clear that the long-term interests of Europe and particularly Ireland, in many ways, are with co-operation with the United Kingdom that is as close as possible in the future.  I am afraid crystal balls are not part of the standard kit for Commission officials.<\/p><p> There was mention of review clauses for post 2030 etc.  We will have the instruments to react earlier.  Even without any instruments, the Commission has power of initiative and we will keep the situation constantly under control.  If something happens that proves the current legislation is inadequate, the Commission has the power to propose new legislation on the spot.  We have taken care to build into all the legislation approved with a 2030 horizon monetary reporting verification mechanisms of various kinds.  There are review clauses everywhere, usually in the time brackets to 2022 and 2025.  It depends on the legislation and it varies.  Many reports from the Commission will come at least during those years and we may do it more often if circumstances justify it.  At least in that period there will be many mid-term reports by the Commission on the basis of which action may be taken to modify the legislation.  At the latest, for legislation that must enter into force as of 2031, the process would have to start by 2026, or for a simpler piece of legislation, by 2027.  We have an obligation to carry out impact assessments and public consultations and the approval process by Council and the European Parliament is often very lengthy.  At the latest, by 2026 members will begin to see the shape of legislation to come.<\/p><p> There was a question on the legal state of the strategy.  As it is a policy, it does not have the legal status of legislation.  At the same time, I draw the attention of members to the fact that the entire 2030 legislative programme is based on one conclusion of the European Council in 2014.  I go back to what I said earlier in that the key is how deep is the consensus around the Council conclusion.  We are trying to help national authorities to carry out a more informed domestic debate.  Our assumption is that this will produce an endorsement by the European Council that will have much greater depth than it normally has and afford much greater durability and ability to influence.  On that basis of such an endorsement, the Commission will certainly take a number of initiatives.  I am not in a position to prejudge today what will happen, especially as there will be a new Commission and its identity is not even known yet.  I am certain that a number of decisions will be taken, with some in the very short term.  These include allocation of research funds and choice of research projects.  That is mandated in the legislation now before the European Parliament and the Council.  Those choices will have to be made.  If the European Council endorses the objective of climate neutrality, I do not see how any Commission could ignore that in deciding the research priorities of the next few years.  There is the question of infrastructure and interconnection, whether that is electric or taking in new pipelines, and I do not see how such decisions can be taken under InvestEU, the Connecting Europe Facility or the Cohesion Fund, without making abstraction from an endorsement by the European Council of the objective of climate neutrality by 2050.  Those conclusions have a deep impact on legislation and policy making at the European level, irrespective of the formal legal status.  So far, the 2014 conclusions have produced a massive legislative programme, with perhaps 16 pieces of legislation over four years.  It is pretty exceptional by European standards.<\/p><p> There was the question of what is next in the transition from fossil fuels to alternatives.  A fossil fuel is a fossil fuel is a fossil fuel.  If we are to talk about a climate-neutral society, we cannot afford to have the word \"fossil\" in our final energy mix.  What does that mean in practical terms?  We have an issue and must decide on the future of gas, for example.  If natural gas remains a source of carbon, it can only be a transition technology.  It is far from impossible that natural gas could remain a permanent part of the energy mix if carbon capture technologies are developed further and employed.  The Norwegians have started to propose that natural gas should be used as the main source for producing clean hydrogen, with the resulting carbon being stored in the caves where the gas came from.  If that technology can be made commercially viable, it is certainly something we would welcome and support in any way we can.  At this stage, we do not know.  It would be helpful if member states could help in placing responsibility on the gas industry to decide what it wants to be.  Does it want to be a transitional tool or a permanent solution?  Will it invest in carbon capture technology and address public concerns, whether justified or not, as even the perception needs to be addressed?  The industry can help to reassure the public and it is in its hands.  We cannot do it for them.<\/p><p> I will not get into detail but there was a point on migration, urbanisation and public health.  It is very clear that unchecked climate change will make all that worse and it already has.  The link between climate change and migration has already been proven.  Migration is happening that was spurred on by climate change.  It is an additional reason the world we have today is one which climate change is making unsafe in more ways than one.  We know that and we must continue to communicate that, explain it and use it as part of the rationale for action that should happen faster than it otherwise would.<\/p><p> Looking at the world's situation, it is not as bad as it sometimes looks.  I will start with the biggest problem, the United States.  In the United States, this Administration is intent on becoming the champion of climate scepticism.<\/p><p>At the same time, there is a very large movement within the United States that continues to move in the opposite direction.  At the level of state government, where it is very much a bipartisan issue, we have seen Democratic and Republican Governors continue to be strong advocates of strong climate policies.  As for industry, US industry is global.  It is as concerned about where Europe is going as where the United States is going.  Large multinationals, in particular, have horizons of 20, 30 or 40 years.  They see where things are going.  They realise their own lack of resilience to climate change will put them in jeopardy.  They see their business models crumbling.  What we see in the United States is a pause.  It is unwelcome and dangerous, but it is a pause.  Even China, the largest emitter in the world, is developing a long-term strategy.  There is very intensive co-operation between our economic modellers.  We have supported China in setting up an emissions trading scheme.  It has experimented with seven models in seven provinces.  This is a typical mode of operation for the Chinese Government which has now chosen to launch a national scheme based on the European model.  We have been co-operating with it for years, offering it technical assistance and support for the scheme, and we are intensifying that co-operation.  It will be a hard slog for the Chinese to make it work as we have seen the difficulties we have had.  However, the Chinese are determined to make it work.  Some 70% of China's energy generation is still thermal, mostly from coal.  At the same time, China invests more in renewable energies than everybody else in the world combined.  The Chinese have a very large development problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019051600002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mauro Petriccione","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557961200,"counter":1370,"content":"<p>Does China still use nuclear energy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019051600002#L00200","speaker":"1439"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557961200,"counter":1371,"content":"<p>It still has some nuclear plants.  It will continue to use nuclear energy but so will some of our member states.  As the Senator may have seen, we project that approximately 15% of our energy supply will come from nuclear energy generation in 2050.  That is not a prediction or suggestion but an extrapolation of current choices made by member states regarding energy mix.  If those choices change in one way or another, that projection will have to change, but that is what we have modelled on the basis of what we know today.<\/p> <p>  Japan will come up with a long-term strategy in June.  It will be very similar to ours, although it will not be as ambitious.  This is a global problem which we are not going to solve.  By 2030 we will be irrelevant in reducing emissions because we will produce less than 2% of world emissions.  However, we are absolutely crucial in offering the model for how to do it.  If nobody offers that model, it will not happen and there is nobody else who is even prepared to try, let alone to succeed.  We have a unique combination of factors in Europe.  The pressure from people for immediate and urgent action is enormous and constant.  It is everywhere and, as members will have seen in their communities, it cuts across preferences in the different parts of the political spectrum.  I am conscious that there may be some exceptions, but, by and large, that is the situation in Europe.  It is not the situation anywhere else.  The United States is a profoundly divided society in terms of politics, social model and belief in climate change.  We have the technology.  We have to invest massively in the renovation and modernisation of the economy.  We may just as well invest in a model of the economy which is cleaner, safer and can be imitated by others.  As I said at the beginning, we do not see any different model that is capable of succeeding.  A model that does not combine a clean economy with prosperity is very unlikely to receive the required support.  In many ways, we are fortunate that we do not have to make a choice in that respect because there is none.  <\/p> <p>  I apologise to the Chair for taking so long.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019051600002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mauro Petriccione"},{"type":"speech","time":1557961200,"counter":1372,"content":"<p>Mr. Petriccione's comments were very good, informative and helpful in our work.

This is a unique record, of which we can all be very proud.  Defence Forces' personnel have served in peace support missions all over the world, including in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and South America, completing more than 68,000 tours of duty.  This commitment to international peacekeeping is a very practical expression of the values we hold dear as a nation and our commitment to the United Nations and multilateralism.  There are some 670 Defence Forces' personnel, of whom approximately 5% are female, serving overseas in nine missions around the world.  Ireland has a battalion, comprising some 460 troops, with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL.  We also have a company with the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, mission on the Golan Heights, with other significant postings in the Middle East, Africa and the Balkans.  For these Irish men and women, service with the United Nations is rightly regarded as noble and important.<\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s main commitments during 2017 and 2018 were to UNIFIL and the UNDOF mission on the Golan Heights.  The UNIFIL mission was Ireland&rsquo;s largest overseas deployment during 2017 and 2018.  From June 2012 to November 2018 Irish troops served as part of a joint Irish-Finnish Battalion with UNIFIL.  From 2015 a number of Estonian personnel were deployed as part of the Finnish contingent.  Owing to other national commitments, Finland and Estonia withdrew from the Irish-Finnish battalion with UNIFIL in November 2018.  As an interim measure, an additional contingent of approximately 106 Defence Forces' personnel was deployed to the UNIFIL mission to cover the backfilling of the Finnish contingent for a 12-month period.  Ireland assumed the full duties and responsibilities of the Irish battalion in November 2018 and will continue in this role up to November 2019.<\/p><p>It has recently been agreed that a contingent of Polish armed forces and a contribution from Hungarian forces will join our UNIFIL contingent from November 2019 as part of a joint battalion.  In 2018, for the first time, two Maltese personnel deployed to UNIFIL as part of the Irish battalion.  The Defence Forces have had an ongoing relationship with the armed forces of Malta since 2009, providing both cadet and officer training.  To date, 38 Maltese cadets have completed their training in the Defence Forces training centre.  Partnership with other states committed to UN peacekeeping has become an increasing element of our overseas peacekeeping operations.  Working with other such states is critical to overcoming the new and ever emerging challenges we face.<\/p><p>My last visit to UNIFIL was in March.  With my Secretary General and the Deputy Chief of Staff Operations, I saw at first hand the commitment of Defence Forces' personnel to the UNIFIL mission.  I was impressed by the strong relationship forged between our personnel and the local communities in which they served.  Liaison with the local population and the provision of support and humanitarian assistance is one of the hallmarks of Ireland&rsquo;s approach to involvement in peace support operations.  This is something I was proud to highlight in my address to the UN peacekeeping conference in New York later that month, when I spoke about the necessity of all peacekeepers being trained to engage proactively with the local population, including women, and to deliver more effective peacekeeping operations on the ground.<\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s second largest overseas deployment in 2017 and 2018 was to UNDOF on the Golan Heights.  The Defence Forces' contribution to UNDOF comprised approximately 136 personnel in this period.<\/p><p>Since its establishment in 1974, UNDOF has been a successful mission in supporting the efforts of the international community on the Golan Heights and in the Middle East region.  In March 2018 the UNDOF headquarters returned to Camp Faouar on the Syrian side of the area of separation and the then Chief of Staff of UNDOF, Colonel Michael Dawson, together with seven other members of the Defence Forces, moved with the headquarters.  The main Irish contingent, comprising a force reserve company of 130 personnel, completed their relocation to Camp Faouar in September 2018.  The security situation in UNDOF's area of operations is reviewed continually by the United Nations and the Defence Forces.  The continued presence of the UNDOF mission remains an important element in ensuring stability on the Golan Heights and in the Middle East region and is supported and welcomed by Syria and Israel.<\/p><p> Ireland continued to contribute military observers and staff to various United Nations missions such as the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation, UNTSO, throughout 2017 and 2018.  In addition, a small number of Defence Forces' officers continue to serve with MINURSO, the UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara, and MONUSCO, the UN stabilisation mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo.<\/p><p> The United Nations has come to rely increasingly on regional organisations, including the African Union, the European Union and NATO, to provide forces to implement and support UN Security Council resolutions.  In 2017 and 2018 the Defence Forces were deployed on a number of such UN mandated missions.<\/p><p> Ireland has participated in the EU training mission in Mali, EUTM Mali, since it was launched in 2013.  At present, 20 Irish Defence Forces' personnel are deployed to EUTM Mali.  I was delighted to visit the mission in January, with the Taoiseach, the Secretary General and the Chief of Staff.  The objective of the mission is to improve the capacity of the Malian armed forces to maintain security in Mali and restore the authority of the Malian Government and the territorial integrity of the Malian state.<\/p><p> In July 2017 Government and D&aacute;il approval was secured for the deployment of a Naval Service vessel as part of the EU naval mission Operation Sophia.  Participation in Operation Sophia represented the first involvement by the Naval Service in a multilateral security operation under a UN mandate.  In February 2018 the Government approved a further Naval Service contribution to Operation Sophia.  It involved a total of two Naval Service vessels deployed consecutively during the year from April to October 2018.  In addition, five members of the Defence Forces were deployed in the operation headquarters over the course of 2018.  The objectives of Operation Sophia have been not only to disrupt the activities of smugglers and traffickers but also to prevent loss of life at sea and reduce the suffering and exploitation of migrants by countering and challenging the criminal organisations engaged in such activities.<\/p><p> Other UN mandated missions in which Defence Forces personnel were deployed in 2017 or 2018 and are still serving are the EU-led mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina, EUFOR, and the NATO-led international security presence in Kosovo, KFOR.<\/p><p> The year 2018 was particularly significant for United Nations peacekeeping.  The United Nations celebrated the 70th anniversary of UN peacekeeping operations and Ireland marked its own significant milestones as a long-standing contributor to UN peacekeeping.  In March 2018 my visit to Irish troops in Lebanon coincided with the official UN commemorations in Naqoura to mark the 40th anniversary of the UNIFIL mission's establishment.  It was an occasion on which to pay tribute to the tens of thousands of UN peacekeepers who had served together with local communities for peace and security in south Lebanon.<\/p><p> Separately, in June 2018, I hosted an official State ceremony in Dublin Castle which was attended by President Michael D. Higgins and the Taoiseach to mark the 60th anniversary of Irish involvement in UN peacekeeping operations.  The Government was also very proud to mark this significant anniversary internationally, when we hosted a ceremony at UN headquarters in New York in July 2018.  The ceremony allowed us to recognise the contribution of Irish men and women from the Defence Forces, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the wider public service to international peacekeeping.  In addition, in December 2018 the 60th anniversary of Ireland's deployment with the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization, UNTSO, was marked with a commemorative ceremony held in UNTSO headquarters in Jerusalem.<\/p><p> Participation in peace support missions comes at a personal cost for individuals who must be away from families and friends for extended periods of time.  I commend Defence Forces' personnel for their commitment and dedication to overseas service, without which Ireland&rsquo;s strong tradition of peacekeeping under the auspices of the United Nations would not be possible.  Our ability to protect the health and safety of our personnel is of paramount concern when considering participation in any mission.  Ongoing threat assessments are carried out in mission areas and we continually review personal equipment and force protection assets to ensure Defence Forces' personnel are appropriately equipped to fulfil their roles.  The safety of our peacekeepers is of the utmost importance.<\/p><p> Ireland&rsquo;s contribution, on aggregate, to overseas missions of 1,639 personnel, or 18% of Defence Forces' strength, in 2017 and 1,696 personnel, or 19%, in 2018 is a significant contribution in the context of the overall strength of the Defence Force and the resources available for defence.  I assure the committee that the Government is committed to ensuring the Defence Forces will continue to contribute in a meaningful way to overseas operations.  I commend the motion to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2019051600002#A00600","speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557961200,"counter":1384,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

Was there a reason for this?  <\/p> <p>  I have a question about missing contributions not mentioned by the Minister of State.  Earlier this year, in reply to a parliamentary question, he said one member of the Defence Forces was on secondment to the UN Office of Military Affairs in New York.  This is not mentioned in the report.  He also stated that as part of Ireland's participation in Partnership for Peace, a member of the Defence Forces was serving in the role of gender adviser to NATO's Secretary General's special representative on women, peace and security, but this is not mentioned in the report.

We have had the argument about it being the wrong operation.  Operation Pontus was the more humanitarian one.  The Minister of State mentioned two vessels being used in 2018 and only one in 2017.  This has to do with the changes made.  How many personnel were on board the vessels?  In overall terms, approximately 620 soldiers or Naval Service' personnel are on duty overseas with the United Nations.  They are very laudable duties which bring a lot of respect to the country through the work the personnel have done during the years.  I am trying to figure out whether more Irish personnel were deployed overseas than are included in the figure of 600.  A question came up previously and I cannot remember whether it was answered.  It is about whether there is a maximum number of Defence Forces' personnel who can be serving overseas at a given time, given the size of the Defence Forces.<\/p><p>I have been told in the past, although I never got any confirmation, that there was a certain percentage that could be reached but not exceeded.<\/p><p> We have seen the chaos during changes of personnel when one detachment was coming back from and another going to Syria.  Will the Minister of State assure us that when we come back for the report on 2019, all of that chaos for families who are waiting for people, and chaos for soldiers waiting to be deployed or to come back, will not happen again, not just in the Golan Heights but also in Lebanon or for other deployments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2019051600002#B00300","speaker":"1305","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557961200,"counter":1387,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and his officials.

The first is in regard to the importance of Irish Defence Forces personnel and their excellent reputation in contributing to the campaign for a seat on the UN Security Council.  It is very important that we get back on the Security Council and we are in a serious struggle with two other major players.  I would like an update on that issue.  Second, the Minister of State might outline his engagement with the UN in regard to the role of Irish troops in peacekeeping missions and their reputation and contribution to peace and security, including their engagement with local communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2019051600002#C00200","speaker":"1343"},{"type":"speech","time":1557961200,"counter":1388,"content":"<p>In response to Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh's on deployment overseas, in 2017, we had 376 members of the Defence Forces and in 2018 we topped that up by a further 106, which brought it to over 400.  It is not that there was a drop from 376 to 106.  It was a joint Irish-Finnish mission and the Finns gave us five or six months' notice that they were withdrawing.  At the time, I spoke to my Department, the Chief of Staff and the Deputy Chief of Staff Operations as to what were our options.  We decided we would increase our personnel by a further 106 for one year only, from November 2018 to November 2019, a timeframe which gave us an opportunity to seek a partner.  The officials in my Department spoke to a number of countries, including the Czech Republic.  We had a long conversation with them and thought we would have had them over the line but, unfortunately, it did not happen.  We then spoke to Poland's armed forces and its department of defence.  I spoke to the Polish minister on two occasions and my officials met Polish officials, and the Poles are joining the Irish personnel in November of this year.  A number of Maltese officers who trained in the cadet school at the Curragh training camp are also part of the Irish personnel.  Therefore, we will reduce our numbers by a little over 100 in November of this year.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked how many personnel are on the ships and the answer is approximately 50, although it could be two or three more or less. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2019051600002#C00300","speaker":"1365"},{"type":"speech","time":1557961200,"counter":1389,"content":"<p>Is that 50 on each?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2019051600002#C00400","speaker":"1305"},{"type":"speech","time":1557961200,"counter":1390,"content":"<p>Yes, 50 on each, and that would include officers right through the ranks.<\/p><p>The Deputy asked about our commitment to overseas missions.  The White Paper on Defence 2015 states we would have up to 850 personnel on overseas peacekeeping missions.  The Deputy spoke about other people whom we have overseas but I am here today to talk about UN peacekeeping operations and UN-mandated missions.  Of course, we have other personnel overseas on smaller missions with one or two officers and we have a number of people in Brussels.  That has always been the case.<\/p><p>The Deputy spoke about the planned rotation of deployments to and from UNDOF.  In October 2018, there was a delay of personnel coming home and also a very short delay in April 2019.  I am very much aware that personnel and their families very much look forward to getting home on the scheduled date.  On my own behalf and on behalf of the Defence Forces, I accept these delays are regrettable.  However, this is totally out of our control as it is handled by the United Nations.  In recognition of the long delay in October 2018, which was ten days or perhaps even longer, I decided we would give personnel an <i>ex gratia<\/i>payment of &euro;1,000.  The delay in April of this year was for only a number of days.<\/p><p>There are a lot of moving parts when flights are being organised and it is not just a case of booking a flight and assuming everything is okay.  People are in a very difficult part of the Middle East and there are political pressures, border crossings and a number of other factors involved.  I have spoken to the Chief of Staff on this issue.  The position is that we should not be saying that they will be home on 1 June, or whatever other date.  We must have latitude.  It is more a case of saying we expect them home on 1 June but there might be a delay of two, three or four days.  However, this is totally out of our control.  With regard to the last delay in April of this year, I assure the Deputy that, with the officials of my Department, members of the Defence Forces and the Irish ambassador to the UN, H.E. Ms Geraldine Byrne Nason, we were working around the clock trying to get these personnel home and back to their families, although I can understand the frustrations people have.<\/p><p>The Deputy also spoke about EUTM Mali.  We have been participating in EUTM Mali since the start of the mission in 2013.<\/p><p>In response to Deputy McLoughlin, Ireland is going for a seat on the UN Security Council.  That campaign was launched in 2018 and members of the Defence Forces, including the Chief of Staff, and also, if memory serves me, the Secretary General of my Department, were there for the launch of the campaign, along with the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I have had many bilateral meetings in recent months and have taken any opportunity to go to New York to meet different countries, in particular at the UN peacekeeping conference in New York, as well as the UN peacekeeping conference in Canada.  In total, I would say I have had 25 or 30 bilateral meetings with a range of countries.  As Minister of State with responsibility for the Defence Forces, it is good to be able to talk about the great work members of the Defence Forces do overseas, which is very well recognised.  As I said in my opening statement, we are a country that has committed to blue hat missions since the day United Nations missions started, and Ireland has been one of the biggest troop contributing countries in Lebanon.  That is very much recognised, not just across Europe but right across the world.  People really appreciate what a small country like Ireland can do.<\/p><p>In March 2010, on my visit to UNIFIL, I changed my programme in that I wanted to get out into the local communities and talk to the local people.<\/p><p>A Minister normally gets to meet the troops and perhaps the local mayor but does not get an opportunity to get out on the ground.  I stayed on in Lebanon for an extra day and a half.  That fund is administered through Irish Aid and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, with involvement from members of the Defence Forces.  Money is invested into local communities, including in water-sewerage projects, sports facilities, libraries, schools, hospitals, orphanages, etc.  I visited up to seven or eight different projects from early in the morning to late at night and the following day also.  It is important for me to get first-hand knowledge and experience, and for me and the members of the Defence Forces to get out into the local communities.  While peacekeeping missions have changed completely, getting out into the local community is still as important as ever.<\/p><p> There is a range of different threats.  I spoke people in the Lebanese community who remember the first Irish Defence Forces members going out; they were only young children at the time.  They would say that the Irish Defence Forces are always very welcome and will continue to have a welcome from the Lebanese people.  It is vital for us to engage with the local communities and work with them in every way possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2019051600002#C00500","speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557961200,"counter":1392,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Jack Chambers, who will be followed by Deputy Barrett.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2019051600002#D00200","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speech","time":1557961200,"counter":1393,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and his officials for attending.  I also acknowledge the excellent work of our troops when they are abroad on UN peacekeeping missions.  I acknowledge the various documents the Minister of State has supplied.<\/p><p>Vice Admiral Mellett outlined his concerns about the difficulty in filling positions on some of these UN-mandated missions.  I ask the Minister of State to update the committee on the retention crisis and on the capability to fill certain positions and deploy personnel.  Has his attention been brought to the difficulty whereby certain people in the Defence Forces have been effectively instructed to go on overseas missions when they may have just returned home and have found it difficult to leave again owing to family commitments and so on?  I do not know if this matter has been brought to his attention.<\/p><p>As Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh mentioned, we had the second incident of the Department of Defence not properly fulfilling its commitment on the co-ordination of flights for returning troops.  It was unusual for this to happen twice this year.  Has it ever previously happened twice in one year?<\/p><p>There are reports in some of today's newspapers indicating that certain members of the Defence Forces are expressing concern about the serious cost for soldiers deployed overseas taking annual leave.  It is costing between &euro;800 and &euro;1,000 for them to return home.  Is the Department examining the cost implication of potentially subsidising members of our Defence Forces who are serving our country and the United Nations well abroad?  Is it examining the cost implication when taking their legitimate entitlement to holidays?<\/p><p>In terms of Partnership for Peace and the ongoing examination with NATO of Defence Forces, have any capability gaps been outlined to the Minister of State on our capacity to fulfil our international obligations?  Has that been discussed at a domestic level or at any of the defence bodies like the UN or others abroad?<\/p><p>On the capability drain, I am informed that the ongoing retention crisis is leaving units with limited or inexperienced instructor staff for essential weapons or vehicle skills required for overseas deployment.  This has resulted in people with certain skills being mandatorily selected having only returned from overseas within the previous 12 months.  Is that a concern for the Minister of State and what is he doing about it?  This drain in experience is having knock-on consequences for remaining soldiers who are now seeking to leave.  Some of the latter are avoiding taking certain courses because they know they will become the next flogging horses if they are being deployed.  That concern has been expressed to me where the capability gaps and the skills shortages are further undermining morale in the context of UN-mandated missions.  While the majority want to go, some are being turned around on an ongoing basis.  For example, a lack of vehicle gunnery instructors is having a knock-on effect on the capability to train crewmen.  This is compounded by a lack of suitable ammunition to conduct range practices in order to enable personnel to qualify in the use of weapons systems.  Is the Minister of State concerned that stocks of ammunition are being withheld for use in overseas missions readiness exercises?<\/p><p>Someone close to Government - I am not sure who - informed <i>The Irish Times<\/i>and other outlets about the report from the pay commission.

I have asked the Chief of Staff to provide me with an analysis of where the gaps lie.  As I have stated on numerous occasions, before the Government makes a decision on any overseas mission, it must ensure that the Defence Forces have the capability and capacity to participate.  The Chief of Staff has not informed me that the Defence Forces are unable to participate in any mission.  Of course, people are often required to go on back-to-back overseas missions.  They might have had to go on missions because they were ordered to do so.  That is the nature of the work they commit to doing when they join the Defence Forces.<\/p><p>I know of cases where people who have been unable to go on missions for personal or other reasons have been accommodated.  The Defence Forces military management has not told me that it is unable to participate in mission \"X\" for some reason.  I have not been told that.  <\/p><p> When the Finns pulled out of UNIFIL, I had a conversation with my officials and military management about whether we would be able to backfill for 12 months.  I was told we would be able to do so for not more than 12 months.  We will do that from November 2018 to November 2019.  As I stated to Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, my officials and I had conversations with other contributing countries that participate in UN missions about whether they would be interested in participating in UNIFIL alongside the Irish.  Poland has decided that it will do so and will join us in November.  Some Polish military officials have visited Ireland and met members of the Defence Forces on the operations side.  My officials have spoken to Polish officials on the civil side as well and that conversation will continue.  All going well, Poland will join us in November 2019.<\/p><p> Our capability to fulfil our international obligations was mentioned.  We are able to fulfil our international obligations.  If we are unable to participate in a mission, it is up to military management to inform me about that.  What I do not want is for us to participate in a mission for which we do not have the resources or personnel.  If we do not have the resources or personnel, I want to know about it because then we will not participate.  It is as simple as that.  I will not put any Irish personnel in harm's way if we do not have the capability, capacity or personnel to carry out that mission.  <\/p><p> I have stated on numerous occasions that I face challenges with retention.  We almost have full employment and since God was a boy, recruitment and retention have been issues for the Defence Forces in times of full employment.  The same issue arises elsewhere.  My European colleagues have told me that they face the same issues regarding recruitment and retention.  Holding on to personnel is a significant challenge for them because so many other opportunities are available.  Regarding attracting young people into the Defence Forces, it is very easy to say the issue is one of pay.  Pay is one element but young people now have so many opportunities that the Defence Forces is not as attractive a prospect as it was ten, 15, 20 or 30 years ago.  That is the nature of the period in which we live.  Hopefully, that will change over time.  <\/p><p> As to whether I can confirm that we will have no delays in return flights, I will be honest with the committee and say I cannot do so.  However, I have spoken to the chief of staff to ensure we do not announce definitive dates for return flights.  Previously, we said personnel would return from an overseas deployment on the first day of a particular month.  I do not want to say they will return on the first day of the month if it transpires that they do not come back until the seventh or eighth day of the month.  I would rather say they will return around a certain date until everything is fully confirmed but, unfortunately, on the most recent rotation or the previous one, the personnel were ready to leave the camp but were told that there was an issue regarding border crossings or some reason.  That is the way it goes.  I spoke to the Lebanese minister for defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  This is something we do not want to see happening.  We want to sort out these issues and get our personnel back home.  We understand the frustration of people stranded over there who expect to come back and the families over here who expect them to come back.  However, families who phone me also understand the position.  They have contacted me directly.  Once one explains to them, they understand the situation fully.  They understand the nature of the game we are in.  Someone joining the Defence Forces is not going into some ordinary nine-to-five job.  He or she is not just going from \"A\" to \"B\" and going out and coming back at particular times.  Unfortunately, life does not work out like that in any army anywhere in the world.  Since we returned to Camp Faouar, it has complicated the rotation process because personnel have to transit through Syria and Lebanon.  I think people will accept that we are dealing with a very difficult part of the world.  <\/p><p> There are challenges involving instructors in the Defence Forces.  I have noted that and we are trying to address that problem through the gap analysis.  I do not want us saying that we were able to do \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\" and \"E\" if we are unable to do them.  If we are unable to do something, we should say it.  Whether it is providing aid to the civil power or civil authority or something else, we will continue to do what we are able to do.  The most important issue in respect of military management asking members of the Defence Forces to do a particular job is the safety of the personnel.  That is paramount to me, the Department and military management.  We participate when we are able to do so and we do not participate when we are unable to do so.  It should not be a case of saying that the Government says that the Defence Forces must go to a particular place.  The Government does not do that.  It will only ask whether we can carry out that mission.  If we cannot do it, I want to know about it.  <\/p><p> It has been said that people are being flogged to go overseas.

It is important that we respect and appreciate fully the important role this country plays in peacekeeping missions.  For that reason, I want to ask the Minister of State about the fact that we seem to have been turning over the same missions for some years now.  I was Minister for Defence some years ago and we were doing the same thing then, more or less.  Have we reviewed the role of the United Nations?  Could we look at different areas or different responsibilities for our troops so that they can get some variation in experience?  It becomes monotonous to see another 600 troops regularly going off to the same place.  I am sure there are many other missions we could look at in fulfilling our duties as peacekeepers.  Whether we are sending 600 or 700 soldiers abroad annually, or whatever the figure is, it is important that we stand back for a while and take stock.<\/p> <p>  I ask the Minister of State to send a report to this committee, therefore, reviewing what we have been doing over the past ten years in peacekeeping and other missions.  We will then be able to look at what we have been doing rather than just turning over the same missions year in and year out.  The Minister of State might tell me that is impossible but I think it should be done.  Familiarity breeds contempt, as the famous saying goes, and that seems to describe what we are doing in sending another mission to the same place to do the same thing.  I am sure there are plenty of other areas in the world where our expertise in peacekeeping and peacemaking could be valuably used.  <\/p> <p>  That is why I am asking for a review of all of our activities and why we are going to the same places for the past 20 years or however long it has been.  I get the impression that the dynamism has gone out of this approach to peacekeeping and peacemaking.  The Minister of State can tell me if I am dreaming or if it might be possible for us to take an overall look at all of the operations undertaken.  If it is possible, perhaps we can then spend some time with the Minister of State reviewing the missions, learning from them and making suggestions as to other areas we could consider, rather than just repeating the same thing.

We are, however, still committed to that mission.  Turning to Deputy Barrett's question, I am happy to provide a review of the missions we have undertaken in the past 15 or 20 years, the rationale for participating in those missions and the numbers of troops committed.  Off the top of my head, the main missions in which we have participated were in Liberia, Chad, Ethiopia, the Golan Heights, Kosovo and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL.<\/p> <p>  We pulled most of our personnel out of the UNIFIL mission during 2008-2010 and committed ourselves to Chad.  We returned in strength to the UNIFIL mission in 2011-2012.  In 2013, we participated in the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF.  We have been there since and Irish troops have returned to Camp Faouar in recent months.  We keep all missions under constant review in respect of whether we can participate.  I agree it is not ideal that we continue to stay in one mission area for a long time and we have participated in UNIFIL since the day that mission began.  Personnel from the Defence Forces remained at UNIFIL headquarters in Naqoura even after we pulled out our main body of troops.  I will have compiled a review of all of our peacekeeping missions and will submit it to the committee as soon as possible.  <\/p> <p>  It is correct to state this is about peacekeeping and peacemaking.  As the Minister of State with special responsibility for defence, I respect and appreciate fully the work of the Defence Forces.  I have been honoured to help Ireland's efforts to get a seat on the United Nations Security Council over the past year.  Whenever representatives from other countries come here for bilateral meetings or round tables, they always refer to Ireland's participation in UN peacekeeping duties.  A small country like Ireland is a tiny dot on the world map, but reports from representatives of other countries help us realise that the size of our footprint on that map is amazing.  We keep all missions in which we participate under constant review, as well as new missions in which we might participate.  It is important for our personnel that they are challenged in different missions in different areas.  I do not suggest we will ever become complacent in participating in any mission but it is good to have a change.  That was one reason we participated in the mission in Chad.  I had the honour of visiting that mission as part of an Oireachtas trip when I was a member of the defence committee.  Chad was then a basket case but the improved situation there now demonstrates the great difference peacekeeping and peacemaking can bring about.  It will take some time to get that review completed but I will try to get it to the committee in the next four to six weeks or so.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2019051600002#F01400","speaker":"1365"},{"type":"speech","time":1557961200,"counter":1447,"content":"<p>It would be a good idea to review what we have been doing for the last number of years.

He mentioned the 2015 White Paper which provides that up to 850 members of the Defence Forces could serve overseas at a given time.  According to his statement, however, there is an aggregate number of 1,639 personnel on overseas missions.  I presume that is due to rotations and shorter journeys.  This is not a criticism.  We have debated previously the numbers serving in the Defence Forces.  Is there a difficulty with ensuring we contribute close to the maximum number possible for UN missions?  These missions are a laudable part of the role of our Defence Forces and many of the members I have met have a desire to go on them.  That role should continue.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State corrected the point I made regarding the 106 UNIFIL troops.  It was great that we were in a position to fill the gap when the Finns pulled out of the mission.  When the Poles take over the role previously carried out by the Finns in November, 106 Irish troops will no longer be required.  In addition, 100 troops may be freed up if Operation Sophia is not continued.  When one also takes into account the shortfall of 230 troops, these figures suggest that of the 850 members of the Defence Forces that we could have available for UN duties overseas, we will have 436 available.  Is there a demand for other UN missions?  I would like to get some idea of where Irish soldiers and Naval Service members may be sent.  In that regard, Operation Pontus was very laudable.  <\/p> <p>  Earlier this year, there was talk of the ranger wing being sent to Mali.  The Government indicated at the time that it was considering this possibility.  This is not a blue hat mission but a training mission and one of those of which I have been very critical.  Originally, seven members of the Defence Forces were sent to Mali.  The figure then increased to ten members and now stands at 20.  The D&aacute;il has never given its assent to the Mali mission, despite the triple lock.  A debate is required in the D&aacute;il and the triple lock is supposed to apply when 12 members or more of the Defence Forces are sent on an overseas operation.  That commitment was given during the debate on the Lisbon or Nice treaty when the Irish people changed their minds.  Can we have a debate in the D&aacute;il on the Mali mission, which is a dubious one, given that 20 personnel are serving on it, albeit in a training?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2019051600002#G00200","speaker":"1305"},{"type":"speech","time":1557961200,"counter":1452,"content":"<p>When will the Minister of State introduce an overseas establishment for officers and NCOs to allow vacancies to be filled when people are overseas?

Those who are left behind must plug the gaps and are effectively double-jobbing, which has an impact on morale and stress levels.  Has the Minister of State considered introducing a policy for personnel to act up one rank to fill overseas gaps?<\/p> <p>  In the context of the UN, has the Minister of State changed his position on engaging with military management on awarding distinguished service and gallantry medals for the heroes of Jadotville?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2019051600002#G00300","speaker":"1255"},{"type":"speech","time":1557961200,"counter":1453,"content":"<p>There is an overseas establishment for all ranks above captain.<\/p> <p>  Anyone who looks at my record on acknowledging what Defence Forces personnel did at Jadotville will see that I was the Minister who brought a motion to Cabinet with the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, to acknowledge their gallantry and contribution at the time.  It was only right and proper to do so. <\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh referred to a figure of more than 1,000 Defence Forces members on overseas missions.  Each mission is of six months' duration.  If there are 300 or 400 personnel on a mission, that number is doubled straightaway, as is the case with UNDOF where the numbers double in any 12-month period.  One of the reasons I was happy that the Defence Forces were able to backfill for the 106 Finnish troops concerns retention.  People who join the Defence Forces want to go overseas.  In saying that, ensuring the safety of our personnel is paramount to me, the Department and military management.  People want to go overseas and we try to accommodate that as early in their service as we can but that is not always possible.  The same applies to Operation Sophia.  The change to Operation Sophia does not mean we will not participate in other naval missions.  I will consider requests to participate in any such future missions.  We normally participate in only two large missions at any one time.  The amount of work involved in mission readiness is huge and these missions involve not only the personnel being deployed overseas but many others, as well as the assets of the Defence Forces.  I would not be satisfied if we were participating in three or four different missions.  I would prefer to continue with two missions and ensure personnel are fully trained and we have the capacity to perform our duties.<\/p> <p>  The EUTM Mali, as a training mission, does not require D&aacute;il approval under the 2006 Act.
