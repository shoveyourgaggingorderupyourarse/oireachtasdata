Lessons are obviously being learned in respect of the national children's hospital and the broadband plan.  As we discussed at our last meeting, there was a lot of commentary on the correspondence between Mr. Watt and the Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  That is fine.  He set out very real concerns regarding that project.  In the letter he cited that part of his concerns represented a learning from the national children's hospital.  Can we write to Mr. Watt asking if any similar correspondence was had, if any similar concerns were raised, or if any similar exchange of views occurred in respect of the national children's hospital?  That is one element of this issue at which we have not looked.  I know we had Mr. Watt before the committee.  He was reluctant to get into the matter of the national children's hospital - he was here dealing with the broader issue of procurement in respect of all of the big projects - but we now know that he put in writing very serious concerns in respect of the national broadband plan.  There may well also have been correspondence on this matter, although it may not have been as stark as that regarding the national broadband plan.

We will discuss this in further detail when we meet with the hospital board, the HSE and the Department of Health.

It says:<\/p><blockquote>This review was conducted over a nine-week period and involved the deployment of a highly experienced international PwC team comprising capital project and infrastructure specialists, required detailed examination of over 2,000 NCH project documents, more than 40 in-depth interviews with 52 members of the NCH project team and the development of a comprehensive and detailed PwC report.<br \/><br \/>This review was of a fundamentally different nature and scale to the high-level advice provided by PwC and others to the HSE in November 2018.  We do not see any conflict of interest arising from PwC&rsquo;s involvement in the provision of high-level advice to the HSE in November and its role in carrying out the review of cost escalation in 2019.  Indeed, we believe that the work conducted was highly complementary, given the technical nature of the skills and experience required.<\/blockquote><p>I am just putting that on the record.  It would be unfair to the people who I may have criticised the last day.

The first is that this was never about individuals.  I am not aware of what comments the Chairman made but any concerns that were raised, from recollection, were more about the process and conflicts of interest.  The letter itself says that the Department does not see any conflict of interest arising from PwC's involvement in the service of the so-called high-level advice it gave.  It then says there is no conflict between that and its role in carrying out a review into cost escalation.  Underneath that, when it expands on what PwC was doing, it states that it was giving advice on the guaranteed maximum price report, or, to use its own words, \"high-level advice\".  There seems to be a lack of understanding, at best, as to what constitutes a conflict of interest.  A conflict of interest can arise if there is a perception of a conflict of interest, so if we are going to do an independent report it has to be completely at arm's length.  I would imagine there should be no involvement in the project itself.  PwC does work for the HSE and the Department of Health, but given that it had a high-level role at some point in the process, that should have precluded it from independently examining the process.  That is a clear conflict as far as I am concerned.  I will take this up with the Department, but I do not think the Department can write to the committee with any seriousness and say that it does not see any conflict of interest.  Anybody who understands conflicts of interest would see that it is a glaringly obvious one, and should not have been allowed to happen.  We have been saying time and again that there are a small number of these companies doing the rounds, getting all these jobs, giving advice on the one hand and then doing so-called independent reviews on the other, and it is not good for accountability, or for getting answers to the questions people want answered.  While I have to say the PwC report was a good one and very much reflected what as in the Mazar's report in that it was not hugely different, I still think it is a conflict of interest.  I do not accept the response from the Accounting Officer, but we will take that up with him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019051600002#C00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1557993600,"counter":52,"content":"<p>We will take it up during the course of that meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019051600002#C00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1557993600,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I have no difficulty with what the Chairman said at the last meeting because I joined him, as many did at that meeting, in agreeing with it.  At the end of the day, we cannot have the contestants judging the beauty pageant.  There is effective admission here that the same few personnel were involved.  However, what worries me even more is that the Secretary General does not see a conflict of interest, so God knows what is going on in other capital projects throughout the country if that is the case.  PwC is a stand-up company with a global reputation that does excellent work, as does KPMG and so on.  There are only a limited number of companies between the two canals in Dublin but we seem to have a peculiar dedication to solely using them.  PwC was involved with high-level input.  What is high-level input?  The fact that it gave high-level input means it cannot review it.  It is called an independent review, but that was not independent.  Maybe everybody did the best possible job they could, but it is compromised, and its credibility is affected.  One of the best Secretaries General, to my mind, in terms of his candid answers here from time to time, is compromising his good name by saying that he does not see a conflict of interest in this, in effect.<\/p> <p>  The other thing I would say is that there is much a lot of woolly language and high-level expertise from health construction people, but who are they?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019051600002#C00400","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1557993600,"counter":54,"content":"<p>We will ask.

Deputy MacSharry made the point that the thought process in engaging companies should be of serious concern, and in any report we issue, we should be making that point as firmly as possible to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to the advice it gives other Departments in these kinds of conflicts.  It is almost like we are being made eejits of with this kind of response.  That is the way I feel about it.

I do not know what words I used but I certainly stand over whatever I said.  This document shows that PwC was engaged in November 2018 in relation to this.  It has been employed by contract since January 2019 in relation to general work but it was given this specific piece of work in November 2018.  The document states that in November PwC was appointed as one of a number of organisations and that there is no separate, documented advice from any of the external parties involved.  I happened to hear the Chairman's interview today and I think he said that PwC was only involved for a few days, but that is subject to clarification.  It was paid &euro;21,477, plus VAT, for a couple of days' work, and that is again subject to clarification.  That external advice, of which there is no documentation, along with the other external advice, was used to justify the step of going forward.  As there was no way of going back, they had to go forward, so they called in all of the expert advice to go forward with no documented evidence.  Fast-forward to January, and we commission PwC again to do an even more extensive review.  Significantly, the Chairman and I both commented at the time on the conclusion.  It was asked to give recommendations and findings but its conclusion was that there was no choice but to go ahead.  It was only copper-fastening what apparently - because one has to be very careful now, apparently - was already decided in November 2018, or that is how it looks to anyone listening, and to us trying to struggle through all this documentation.<\/p> <p>  Interestingly, it is not mentioned on the list of reports so we will be going back to that as well.

There was no declaration here.  I read the PwC report and it does not say anywhere that it provided high-level advice at an earlier stage in this project.  It was not said.  We had discussions at both this committee and the Joint Committee on Health and questions were asked about whether there was a conflict of interest.  It was only later on, when the report was published, that we got the letter from Mr. Mitchell that stated there was a relationship between the company and the HSE.  We found it out by accident, really.  My point is that conflicts of interest arise, and they can be managed, but this was not managed or declared at any point before or during the process.  It was only afterwards by accident, and by the good work of this committee, that we found out that there was a relationship there.  I think it is a slam dunk in terms of it being a clear conflict of interest and the fact that it was not even managed by the company, the Department, or the HSE, is even worse.<\/p><p>It is problematic that this letter justifies it and states that there was no conflict of interest.  If the Comptroller and Auditor General was doing a look-back on this he would look for correspondence from all sides.  He can speak for himself but I imagine he would not accept this.

I have put it on the record and people can judge it accordingly.  I am not drawing conclusions.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 2155, from the Comptroller and Auditor General, Seamus McCarthy, dated 9 May, providing an update to the committee regarding the submission by public bodies of draft financial statements for audit by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The first job of the Committee of Public Accounts is to review the financial statements of the approximately 300 public bodies audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We can only do that if they submit financial statements.  The primary requirement of a board in any organisation is to produce financial statements within a reasonable time period.  If they are not able to do that, I would question what else might not be working properly in the system.  When we took over a couple of years ago, the percentage of financial statements which had been submitted within a three-year period year stood at about 40%.  We have been following this issue relentlessly and we had the education and training boards, ETBs, before us when only one of 17 had submitted its accounts on time.  We have issued several reports and the committee took the unprecedented step of authorising me to write to the chair and secretary of every organisation reminding them of their obligations.  Over the past couple of years we have seen a vast improvement, with it going up to 70% and then over 80%.  I am happy to report that, up to the end of April, over 92% of the roughly 300 organisations audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General had submitted their draft accounts for audit.  There remain 24 which have not done so.  With the consent of the committee, I will write to the chairperson and chief executive of each of the 24 organisations tomorrow, reminding them of their obligation to get their accounts in straight away.  We are making outstanding progress in getting the financial statements because I realised a few years ago that the statements we were getting were four years old.  That was a waste of everybody's time and it showed a lack of governance in the organisations in question.<\/p> <p>  I will read out the names of the organisations which had not submitted their accounts by the end of April.  A number are directly from the Department of Finance.  The sundry moneys deposit account has a turnover of &euro;149 million.  The hepatitis C special account has a turnover of &euro;26 million, and the hepatitis C reparation account has a turnover of &euro;4 million.  The local loans fund normally has a turnover of &euro;280,000 and the Credit Union Restructuring Board, now in wind-down, has also not submitted accounts.  The environment fund, which is directly from the Department, has a turnover of &euro;44 million each year but has not submitted accounts and the fisheries harbour accounts in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has a turnover of &euro;6 million but has not submitted accounts.<\/p> <p>  In the education sector, the following colleges have not submitted accounts: University College Cork; Dublin City University; Dublin Institute of Technology, although that body is in a wind-down situation; the State Examinations Commission; Letterkenny Institute of Technology; St. Angela's College in Sligo; St. Patrick's College of Education, which is a residual account following amalgamation; and the Church of Ireland College of Education, also a residual account and in wind-down mode.  Some of the universities will make the fair point that they have external auditors and have to go through that process before it comes to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  They will say they have a double audit and I acknowledge that but the accounts are several months late.<\/p> <p>  The accounts in the HSE fund are: the private patients accounts of &euro;72 million; the National Treatment Purchase Fund; the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council; the hepatitis C insurance scheme; and two accounts with minor activity, namely, the long-stay repayment scheme special account and the long-stay repayment scheme donation account.  Finally, there are three State bodies which had not submitted accounts by the end of April, namely, the Legal Aid Board, Irish Water Safety and the Discovery Programme - Centre for Archaeology and Innovation.  We will write to the Accounting Officer in the Department of Finance and the relevant Government Departments and directly to the chairmen and chief executives of the organisations in question.  I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General for keeping on top of this.  If nothing else, we will make sure there is corporate governance at board and Accounting Officer level in all these organisations.  We are nearly there.<\/p> <p>  No. 2156 is from the Minister of State at the Department on Education and Skills with responsibility for training, skills, innovation and research and development, Deputy John Halligan, dated 18 April advising the committee of the recent launch of Ireland's national intellectual property protocol 2019 - a framework for a successful research, commercialisation and accompanying research guide.  I welcome the development, which will have a bearing on the commercialisation of all forms of intellectual property and I am pleased that there is a requirement for State research funding organisations and a State innovation funding agency to apply the policy and framework in the national intellectual property protocol, consistent across all programmes of funding.  The committee will continue to monitor this topic closely, especially in relation to the third level institutions.  We will note and publish this.<\/p> <p>   The next item is No. 2157 from John McKeown, Secretary General, Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, dated 9 May, providing information requested on foot of an inquiry regarding the use of precedential test cases by the Social Welfare Appeals Office to determine issues in respect of employment, self employment or bogus self employment.  We will note and publish this and forward the response to the correspondents who raised the issue.  No. 2158 is also from John McKeown, Secretary General, Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, dated 10 May, providing further information regarding the JobPath programme in response to our queries.  The Department is currently reviewing its contract of public employment services with a view to continuing to provide resource services to those who need support.  We will note and publish this.<\/p> <p>  The next item is correspondence is from private individuals and other correspondence.  No. 2153 was received from an individual dated 5 May relating to the national broadband plan.  The correspondent raised value for money issues that may feed in to our consideration of broadband matters.  We note this.  No. 2154 is from an individual, dated 6 May, relating to negative environmental impacts of broadband roll-out, which we will also note.  No. 2154 is from Deputy Cullinane and relates to the committee's consideration of the broadband issues.  We are awaiting documentation on broadband matters and I propose to note the item for the moment and return to it when we get the information we have requested.  The next item on the agenda is statements of accounts received since the last meeting.<\/p> <p>  I did not read out correspondence No. 2159 from the Tax Appeals Commission.  We had asked for a two-monthly update on its ten largest cases, which amounted to approximately &euro;700 million in March.  Some had been settled and there were different issues so we wrote back for an update.  The update will require clarification and we will write to the commission immediately.  It does not give exact estimates as to do so might prejudice the outcome of a hearing but it gives various bands.  It states that, as of 16 May, three cases are before the commission where the corporation tax to be determined is in excess of &euro;100 million each.<\/p><p>It goes on to state that in three further cases the amount to be determined is estimated at between &euro;50 million and &euro;100 million and in three other corporation tax cases the amount to be determined is between &euro;30 million and &euro;50 million.  There is one case in respect of an environmental levy where the amount in question is between &euro;30 million and &euro;50 million.  Interestingly, the schedule identifies an overall total of &euro;2.571 billion.  I do not know what that figure means.  Is it the quantum of cases with the Tax Appeals Commission?  On the last occasion we dealt with the commission, that figure was approximately &euro;1.7 billion.  If there has been a dramatic increase in the quantum of cases in value terms before the Tax Appeals Commission, we need that clarified.  I am not sure what is the figure at the bottom of its chart.  It does not state what the figure represents.  I am guessing.  If I am wrong, I need that clarified.  In addition, the commission should explain why the volume of cases on its desk has gone from what we understood to be &euro;1.7 billion to &euro;2.5 billion in a very short time.  I acknowledge that it must deal with the appeals, but it must have some observation on that increase.  We will write to the commission on that issue because it is a matter we have been following due to the quantum and volume of cases before the Tax Appeals Commission.  It appeared before the committee and there were many issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019051600002#D00400","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557993600,"counter":69,"content":"<p>There are also two court cases.

In advance of this meeting I circulated an update on developments since.<\/p><p>As is well known, the Government approved the construction investment to allow phase B, the above-ground works of the hospital, to be instructed in December.  At the same time the Government approved the commissioning of an independent review of the escalation in cost of the capital project.  The purpose of the review was to examine in detail the contributory factors to the cost escalation and associated responsibilities in order that any potential weakness would be identified and comprehensively resolved in the interests of the successful completion of the project and the effective management of public funds.  The terms of reference also required the review to identify and address major residual risks, as well as control and oversight issues.  It also was required to develop recommendations which may identify any areas of potential cost savings or reductions, which are consistent with the applicable contractual undertakings and the delivery of the project.  The report of the review was presented to the Government on 9 April last and published on the same day.<\/p><p> The PwC report is the result of an intensive and extensive body of work carried out by a team of experts over a period of nine weeks.  The PwC team was composed of a number of international capital project and infrastructural specialists, including chartered engineers, quantity surveyors, chartered accountants, commercial specialists, data analysts and healthcare experts with extensive experience in the review of complex capital projects and programmes.  In publishing the review, the Government requested that an implementation plan be prepared and submitted to the Government for its consideration.  Extensive work has been undertaken between the Departments of Health, Public Expenditure and Reform and the Taoiseach, the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, NPHDB, Children's Health Ireland, CHI, and the HSE.  The Minister for Health updated the Government on this work earlier this week and it is envisaged that the draft implementation plan will be considered by the Government shortly.  The PwC report accepted that the two-stage procurement process used to award the contract for construction of the new children's hospital is a widely used approach and can deliver significant benefits.  It also identified failures that occurred in the set-up, planning and budgeting stages for the project, and in the implementation of the two-stage process.  It warns that the guaranteed maximum price, GMP, established through the process does not provide a contractual ceiling on cost and significant residual risks remain.  A primary focus of the development board must be on managing this risk and preventing further cost increases.<\/p><p> The report synthesised the findings of the review into a set of 11 recommendations.  The first nine are specific to this project, and identify steps to be taken by all stakeholders in this project relating to project delivery, control, and assurance.  This ranges from a review of the scope and responsibilities of the advisory firms that constitute the design team to reflect their roles in the performance monitoring of contractors, to strengthening the capacity and capability of the development board executive and to putting in place a scrutiny process that includes all levels of the governance structure to review all proposals that are focused on reducing the GMP.  The remaining two recommendations relate to the management of other public sector spending on major capital infrastructure projects more generally, and therefore are a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Government noted the report's findings and requested the Ministers for Health and for Public Expenditure and Reform to revert with a proposed implementation plan for these nine recommendations.  The implementation plan will set out for each of the 11 recommendations the actions taken to date and the further actions proposed, together with timelines.  The implementation plan is being developed on a collaborative basis by key stakeholders and will be brought to the Government shortly for consideration, following which it is expected it will be published.  The implementation plan will address the deficiencies identified in the report, including developing and implementing, where necessary, more robust project control and project assurance plans appropriate for a project of this national importance throughout the remaining construction programme.<\/p><p> The development board is fully committed to implementing the recommendations, as are the Department, the HSE and Children's Health Ireland.  As the chair of the board will outline, he has established and leads a sub-committee of the board to ensure full implementation of the recommendations relevant to it.  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board has already taken a number of important steps to strengthen its project control systems, capacity and capability.  Work is under way to improve reporting standards and introduce revised working arrangements with the design team.  Consideration will need to be given to the report's warning of potential loss of corporate knowledge.  It is appropriate that the focus is on maintaining corporate knowledge and expertise and on strengthening the project by building further capacity and capability.  In that context, the committee may be aware in relation to the executive of the NPHDB, that the project director of the development board, who holds the statutory function of chief officer, announced his resignation in March, effective from early June.  Given the scale and complexity of the project and the challenges associated with both roles in this current phase of the project, the NPHDB decided that the roles should be divided.  Following receipt of sanction by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of the remuneration rate for the chief officer post, the job campaign was advertised by the Public Appointments Service last week.  Discussions are ongoing with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the terms and conditions for the recruitment of the project director post.<\/p><p> The PwC report's findings did not identify that the existing governance structures above the NPHDB contributed to the cost escalation.  The review was satisfied that these structures did not impede the flow of information in relation to the cost escalation but did find that the terms of reference and composition of the children's hospital project and programme steering group and board meant that their collective ability to provide challenge to the role of the NPHDB was limited, and accordingly recommends a review of these matters.  Such changes will form part of the implementation plan to be approved by the Government.<\/p><p> The project is now in the major construction phase.  Above-ground works at the St. James's site are progressing well with the structural frame, walls, slabs and columns now above ground level in most advanced areas.  Basement excavation and piling are now substantially complete.  The mechanical and electrical fit-out of the basement plant areas will commence in this quarter.  Construction work on the new children's hospital will be completed in the third quarter of 2022.  This will be followed by a period of commissioning and the hospital will open in 2023.<\/p><p> Work at the outpatient department, OPD, urgent care centre at Connolly is on target for handover to CHI this month followed by equipment installation and operational commissioning.  In fact, as the chair of the board will update us, the handover of the Connolly facility has taken place this week.  The delivery of services at the Connolly centre will be provided on a phased basis from the end of July 2019.  Decant works at Tallaght University Hospital are now complete and the new cr&egrave;che, changing facility and offices are open.  Construction work on the Tallaght paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre started last month and it is due to open next year.<\/p><p> Extensive engagement has taken place with the Oireachtas health committee and the Committee of Public Accounts on how the cost escalation came about and its reporting.  PwC reviewed more than 2,000 project documents, records and data.  The report documents what happened and the timeline of reporting.  I believe the review's findings on the reporting of the cost escalation are consistent with previous information provided to the Oireachtas, including this committee, and the documentation published by the Department and others.  The scale of the review, and the consequent robustness and comprehensiveness of the recommendations mean that the benefit of the review is of very considerable additional significance.<\/p><p> When we met the committee at the end of January, the Chairman impressed upon the witnesses the importance of the work required to complete the project and that the learning from the PwC should be used to inform the quality of that work.  We now have very detailed recommendations regarding the enhancement of control processes across the design team and the development board.  The board of the new development board has accepted these recommendations and implementation is under way.  PwC also quite correctly identifies that the nature of the project, which has now entered the major construction phase, will change as we approach the opening of the main hospital at St. James's.  The commissioning and bringing into operation of a project at this scale requires co-ordinated delivery of the building, equipment, technology, staff and clinical and non-clinical operations.  There is a very good working relationship between the development board and CHI.  This will be enhanced further with the support of the HSE and the Department and in line with the recommendations set out in the PwC report, for the benefit of the successful delivery of this major investment in children's health services.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and I am happy to address any queries<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019051600002#F01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557993600,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Breslin.

I am joined by Mr. Paul Quinn, board member of the development board, Mr. Jim Farragher, its finance officer, and Dr. Emma Curtis, who is the medical director of the development board.<\/p> <p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board was appointed in August 2013 to design, build, and equip a new children's hospital.<\/p><p>A planning application was lodged in August 2015 and An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted planning permission in April 2016 for the new children&rsquo;s hospital, the paediatric outpatients and urgent care centres at Connolly and Tallaght hospitals and related developments, including the Children&rsquo;s Research and Innovation Centre and a family accommodation unit adjacent to the new children&rsquo;s hospital.<\/p><p> The expenditure as at 31 December 2017 was &euro;67.2 million.  There is some more detail in the document which I will not read out if that is okay.  Also we have the draft unaudited expenditure as of 31 December 2018 and a date for Comptroller and Auditor General to audit these accounts has been set for late June 2019.  The expenditure in 2018 is &euro;129 million.<\/p><p> In December 2018 following the completion of the second stage of the two-stage procurement process, the final cost of the design, build and equipment programme for which the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, NPHDB, is responsible is now at &euro;1.433 billion, which is &euro;450 million more than advised to Government in April 2017.  Some &euro;319 million of the additional cost relates to construction costs, and the balance of &euro;131 million, which includes &euro;50 million in VAT, relates to costs associated with staff, construction-design consultants, planning, design team fees, risk and contingency.  Previously we included detail on the seven construction cost drivers in the briefing document sent to the committee for its review in January 2019.  A PwC review on the escalation of costs was commissioned by the HSE in January 2019 and the findings of the review were published on 9 April.<\/p><p> As discussed with the committee in January 2019, once the board became aware of the significant additional costs emerging, the board set in place a review of alternative options.  Contractually, the NPHDB did not have to proceed with the second stage - which is phase B above ground - construction works, and a number of options were considered and carefully evaluated.  The outcome of the options evaluated was a recommendation by the development board, accepted by the HSE, the Department of Health and Government, to proceed with the instruction of phase B works as it offered the best solution commercially and ensured the completion of the children&rsquo;s hospital in the shortest timeframe.<\/p><p> Since our last appearance before the committee in January 2019, the then chair, Tom Costello, resigned from the role and I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the contribution and personal commitment made by him.  Shortly after, I was pleased to be appointed to the role as chair of the NPHDB and I appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health to ratify my position as chair.  In March 2019, the project director, John Pollock decided that as the two-stage procurement process was finalised and approved, and the project has now moved into the final construction phase, it was an appropriate time for him to leave the project.<\/p><p> To this end and as per one of the recommendations from the recently published PwC report on cost escalation \"to strengthen the capacity of the NPH Executive\", we have recently advertised through the Public Appointments Service for a chief officer and we hope to interview for this role within the coming weeks.<\/p><p> As indicated, since our last appearance a PwC review on the cost escalation of the project has also taken place and recommendations have been made in this regard.  The board of the NPHDB has reviewed the report, acknowledged and noted the issues raised and the recommendations set out in the PwC report, and is developing an implementation plan against this.<\/p><p> Prior to the publication of the PwC report the board had identified and commenced implementing a number of key project changes, for example: strengthening the executive with separate chief officer and project director roles; establishing commissioning and project controls work streams within the NPHDB; key risks as a standing item at board meetings; agreed procurement strategy with stakeholders in relation to equipping the main children&rsquo;s hospital; and putting in place performance-based indicators with core design team members.  In addition, the NPHDB will continue to work with all stakeholders involved in this important project and will do all that is within its power to support the implementation of the PwC recommendations.<\/p><p> The paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre at Connolly hospital is complete and earlier this week was handed over to Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland for it to commence the commissioning and transitioning of staff.  Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland will operate the service and the centre is due to open in July 2019.<\/p><p> Decant works at Tallaght University Hospital are now complete, and the new cr&egrave;che, changing facility and offices are open.  Construction work on the 4,600 m2 paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre started last month and is due to open in 2020.<\/p><p> Construction work on the new children&rsquo;s hospital on a shared campus with St. James&rsquo;s is progressing well with the structural frame, walls, slabs and columns now above ground level in most advanced areas.  Basement excavation and piling are now substantially complete.  The mechanical and electrical fit-out of the basement plant areas is due to commence shortly.  Project costs incurred to end of March 2019, including construction costs were &euro;314 million.<\/p><p> Construction work on the new children&rsquo;s hospital is scheduled to be completed in quarter 3 2022.

Because of what has happened, I think we are going to have a lot of concentration on construction.  However, knowing what I know about projects, although this is a health project of a bigger scale, the biggest piece for the successful delivery of the benefits of the project is the handover and bringing the project into operation.  This includes commissioning phase, which the development board will be doing, but also the staffing, the introduction of the technology, the organisational culture and how it is all put in place in the new hospital.
