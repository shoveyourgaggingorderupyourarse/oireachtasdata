The Minister of State is very welcome to the House this morning.<\/p> <p>He knows that Monaghan's local economy is deeply dependent on the success of the agrifood sector.  There are data to support this.  Monaghan has the highest agricultural export value per hectare outside of Dublin, made up mainly of poultry, as 52% of the country's entire flock is located in County Monaghan.  It is also the largest producer and exporter of mushrooms in the country.  Local company, Monaghan Mushrooms, is the largest exporter of mushrooms in Europe and the second largest in the world.  To put this in perspective, the mushroom industry has a farm gate value of &euro;119 million, of which approximately 85% is exported to the UK.  It employs over 3,500 people and we produce 70,000 tonnes of mushrooms each year, of which 80%, worth &euro;120 million, is marketed to UK multiples.  These are world leaders in the field and we are very proud of the industry in County Monaghan.<\/p> <p>If anything was to damage the sector, it would have serious implications for the whole economy of the county.  Unfortunately, the sector is currently facing a number of threats, including in the case of the mushroom sector, the issue of peat harvesting.  I am sure the Minister of State is well aware of that and although it is a different matter, it is connected to what I am speaking about today.  I ask the Minister of State to bring the message that this needs to be sorted urgently back to the Government.  There should be a common sense approach to that matter.<\/p> <p>Today, I am speaking about a labour shortage threatening not just the mushroom industry but the poultry sector, meat processing and hospitality.  In the mushroom industry the labour shortage is at crisis levels and is continuing to deteriorate every month.  For both the poultry and meat processing industries, an increase in imported labour is vital.  These industries were hopeful of an announcement of a new horticulture worker permit quota in September but they are still awaiting official word on where exactly that stands.  Compounding matters is the fact that the employment permit application process is currently taking over ten weeks.  With respect, that is too long and adding to the stress being felt by these employers.<\/p> <p>These delays in the application process, along with problems I mentioned in peat importation, climate change, Brexit and currency fluctuation that we in Border counties must live with on a daily basis are combining to potentially create a perfect storm in Monaghan's agribusiness sector and in the sector generally.  This matter needs urgent attention so I ask the Government to give it such attention.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#B00400","speaker":"1658"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>It is good to be back in this House and see everybody back in their home.  I thank Senator Gallagher for raising this important matter, which has been topical over the past couple of months.  The matters raised today are directly important for Monaghan and its mushroom and poultry sector.  Agribusiness is extremely important for Monaghan, as it is for my county of Meath.  The matters raised here have been brought to me directly by the industry as well, along with the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, earlier in the year.  The Senator is right to call this out and it is a big issue to work on for the country and the sector.  It is really important for Monaghan that we find solutions to the labour difficulties in the area.<\/p> <p>The Senator mentioned mushrooms and poultry and I have engaged directly with some of the companies involved in trying to work with them on solutions.  I will certainly outline where that journey is as well.  I agree with the Senator that we must find a common sense solution to the peat harvesting question.  Peat is required for the domestic horticultural sector and it is only 1% or 2% of what would have been harvested or used in the country over the past couple of years.  There has been a massive gain already so we should try to find some way to make that work.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Malcolm Noonan, is working very closely with a group trying to make this a reality.  I hope we can find a solution that works for everybody.  Through innovation, research and development we will find solutions in the years ahead, and this will take a little bit longer, so in the meantime it makes sense to find some way to source the peat locally in Ireland rather than having to import it.  I agree with the Senator and I hope a common sense solution can be found.  I expect it will and the sector is working across numerous Departments and agencies to that end.<\/p> <p>The employment permits system is designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately skilled non-European Economic Area, EEA, nationals to fill skills and labour shortages in circumstances where there are no suitably qualified Irish or EEA nationals available to undertake the work and the shortage is genuine.  The system is managed through the operation of the critical skills and ineligible occupations lists, which are subject to twice-yearly evidence-based reviews, which is what the Senator referred to.  That generally happens in the autumn, in October or November, and we are trying to ensure much of the work is now carried out during August and September, with results to be published in October.  The decisions would be made at that stage.  The Senator mentioned how people are waiting to see what happens in that respect and we are in the middle of that work.<\/p> <p>In May 2018, a pilot quota-based scheme was introduced to remove certain agrifood occupations from the ineligible occupations list.  The scheme provided for 2,500 general employment permits for the meat processing industry, 500 for horticulture and 150 for the dairy sector to address the immediate needs of the sectors in sourcing labour.  In addition, a quota of 300 permits was granted in respect of meat deboners.  To date, this pilot scheme has proved very successful for a range of employers in the sector, including those mentioned by the Senator.  The difficulty is that all quotas expired in December 2019.<\/p> <p>A review of the occupation lists is currently under way and all submissions are under active consideration, including those from the agrifood sector.  I have met many of those representatives.  It is envisaged that the review will be finalised in the autumn, and we are targeting early October if possible.  We are working through the submissions, with over 26 such submissions from the various sectors and quite a few from agrifood businesses.<\/p> <p>Applications for employment permits have seen a significant increase over the course of the year.  As of the end of August, some 14,600 applications were received, representing a 35% increase over the same period in 2020 and a 19% increase over 2019, which itself represented an 11-year high in applications.  Recently, processing times have been impacted by this significant increase in demand and by the HSE cyberattack, as has been well documented.  These factors resulted in a significant additional administrative burden in dealing with applications associated with the July doctor rotation, which were submitted either manually or by other non-standard methods.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That has added to and delayed processing times, which are now above ten weeks and, in some cases, above 15 weeks.  We are trying to deal with that.  We are putting in place extra staff to process the permit applications that are needed urgently for certain sectors.  We try to operate that urgently along with trusted partners.<\/p><p>It is important to point out that when set against other international employment permit regimes, Ireland continues to compare extremely favourably.  We managed to keep our schemes open throughout the Covid pandemic.  However, my Department is conscious of the recent lengthening of timeframes for processing applications and is taking a range of measures to clear the current backlog as quickly as possible.  My Department advises employers to take current timelines into account as part of their recruitment plans.   That is something we discussed with the sector earlier in the year.  We will make every effort to reduce the timelines as well as dealing with the review of the lists in the next couple of weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#B00500","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I welcome the comments of the Minister of State regarding peat.

I assure him that we recognise it is extremely important.  An efficient and responsive employment permit system is a critical lever in addressing the economy&rsquo;s skills needs and in ensuring that talent is attracted to Ireland from non-EEA sources.  Its success in this regard is reflected in the flow of skilled non-EEA professionals to the country and the critical role they play in the continued growth of the economy.<\/p> <p>The reviews to which I referred are guided by research undertaken by the expert group on future skills needs and the skills and labour market research unit of SOLAS.  A public consultation is included.  Account is taken of education outputs, sectoral upskilling, training initiatives and known contextual factors such as Brexit and Covid-19.  Input is provided by the relevant policy Departments, including the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and the economic migration interdepartmental group chaired by the Department. <\/p> <p>I welcome the opportunity to underscore that Ireland is a leader in linking labour market intelligence to policy development.  In our discussions with all the sectors that are experiencing labour issues, I fully explained to them that we expect that, where at all possible, labour is sourced locally from within Ireland, then from within the EU and thereafter moving on to the permit scheme.  As part of that, industry and the various sectors have to make every effort to engage with our education partners through all our stakeholders, such as SOLAS, education and training boards, institutes of technology and so on, to try to find new programmes and initiatives to bring forward skills and to upskill staff.  In addition, they need to work with Intreo offices through the Department of Social Protection under the pathways to work strategy to access supports to enable them to find new talent, such as among people who are currently on the pandemic unemployment payment or jobseeker's benefit.  If there is a genuine need and shortage despite all that effort, we will work with the sector and respond.  It should be borne in mind that we have to try to put in place more initiatives to upskill people living here in order to enable them to take up those jobs in the long term and I expect all sectors to work with us on that.  The majority of them do so and are trying.  It needs an effort from all of us to make this happen in the long term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#C00300","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Risk Management","time":1632303000,"counter":17,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#C00350"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>The Minister, Deputy Foley, is welcome.  I am disappointed the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, is not present but I appreciate the Minister, Deputy Foley, being here to answer my question on flood defences in Galway city.  I am sure that in every county there are incidents of flooding in towns or rural areas and I am sure the Minister has visited scenes of helplessness either in the aftermath of or during a flood.  It is very difficult for residents or businesses that are dealing with a surge of water and wondering when the day will come that it will not happen again.<\/p> <p>As all present are aware, climate change and global warming are increasing the unpredictability of storms.  Galway suffers from flooding from the River Corrib, high tides, storm surges, wave overlapping and storm water drains.  In conjunction with Galway City Council, the Office of Public Works has funded studies under the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme, relating to mapping exercises of the area.  The previous Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW, Kevin Boxer Moran, announced an allocation of more than &euro;9 million for flood defences.  Since then, Arup consultant engineers have been appointed to progress the project and further the identification and development of a preferred scheme.  We were told that will take approximately 24 months, which will bring us up to the end of 2023.  Planning and development consent will take approximately 18 months, which will bring us up to early 2025, while detailed construction, design and tender will take approximately eight months, bringing us to early 2026.  Construction will take up to 36 months, which will overlap with the handover of works that will take approximately 15 months.  That will bring us up to the end of 2029 before the works in Galway city will be completed.  With the way things are, one could add another year or two to that, depending on processes.<\/p> <p>Realistically, can anything be done to speed up that project?  There are important requirements under the public spending code, but is there anything that the city council or the Arup consultants can do to speed up that process?  Taking, effectively, the guts of a decade before flood defences will be in place in Galway city is too long.  I refer to processes around the country.  I note the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, has expressed his frustration at the processes and the delays, whether due to planning, judicial review or anything else.  In the meantime, the city of Galway is at the mercy of water and the unpredictability of storms.  The impact that has on residents and businesses is so distressing and frustrating.

I appreciate the importance and significance of this issue for the people of Galway.  I am pleased to provide an update on the Coirib go C&oacute;sta - Galway City Flood Relief Scheme.<\/p><p>Galway City Council, as project sponsor and contracting authority, is leading the development of the Coirib go C&oacute;sta - Galway City Flood Relief Scheme for the city, with technical advice and funding being provided by the Office of Public Works.  Following a tender process undertaken by the city council, an engineering and environmental consultant was appointed in November 2020 to review and build on the initial proposals in the flood risk management plan, which were developed, as the Senator noted, under the CFRAM programme.<\/p><p>The objective of the Coirib go C&oacute;sta project is to assess, design and deliver a viable, cost-effective and environmentally sustainable flood relief scheme for Galway city.  The Coirib go C&oacute;sta - Galway City Flood Relief Scheme has a preliminary total project budget estimate of &euro;9.5 million and has the objective of protecting more than 940 properties from tidal and river flooding.  Among the areas of Galway city that will be protected are the Long Walk, Spanish Arch, Eglinton Canal, Merchants Quay, Raven Terrace, Salthill and the Claddagh.  The project website, <i>www.coiribgocosta.ie<\/i>, provides up-to-date information to those interested in the progress of the scheme.<\/p><p>The project name, Coirib go C&oacute;sta - Galway City Flood Relief Scheme, was developed to give the project a sense of identity and place.  The title and logo, which appears on the website, identify the link to both river and sea which are part of the fabric of Galway city.  The logo includes visuals of Galway cathedral and the Galway hooker to ensure the unique character of the city is central to the project and signifies how the project aims to promote and protect this character.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Norma Foley:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=NormaFoley&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> The scheme has been broken into five distinct stages with indicative timelines, subject to no major technical, planning or legal challenges arising.  Indeed, the Senator referred to that.  Stage 1 is the options assessment and scheme development.  The options assessment and development stage has an estimated completion date of mid-2023.  The project is currently at stage 1.  Stage 2 is planning and consent.  This is when the preparation and submission of planning documentation to An Bord Plean&aacute;la will be undertaken, along with the completion of all required environmental assessments and consents.  This stage has an estimated completion date of early 2025.  Stage 3 is the detailed design and tender process.  The detailed design of the preferred scheme will be completed in stage 3, followed by the procurement of contractors for the construction of the scheme.  It is estimated that this stage will be completed by late 2025.  Stage 4 is scheme construction.  The construction stage of the scheme is estimated to take approximately two and a half years and is estimated to run from early 2026 to mid-2028.  Stage 5 is handover and completion and is estimated to be finalised in mid-2029.<\/p><p>As stated, the project is currently at stage 1 where options development and initial scheme development take place.  Work to date on this stage has consisted of collection and review of available data relating to the scheme and study area, for example, historical flood data, CFRAM data, Irish Water data and Galway City Council data, and additional data collection in the form of surveys.  These surveys include invasive species, threshold levels, a wave overtopping study, culverts and drainage, hydrometric gauges and surveys of existing flood defences.  The hydrological method statement is currently being finalised.  This will form the basis for the hydrological design and hydraulic modelling required for the scheme.  Significant work has also been undertaken on stakeholder and public engagement.<\/p><p>A scheme-specific communications strategy has been developed to ensure best practice is implemented for stakeholder and public engagement throughout the project.  The opening public engagement process has already been undertaken, beginning on 1 June and finishing on 7 July 2021.

As she knows, families and children who depend on school escorts know the importance of that role in ensuring children can go to school in a semi-independent way.  School escorts are low-paid workers and many of them have to engage in other work to supplement their income.  Often they are special needs assistants, SNAs, or in other work.  It has only come to light in the past fortnight to three weeks that the impact of circular 0024\/2021, which was issued last April, by my measurement and the measurement of some of the school escorts and school principals who are administering the pay for school escorts, is a unilateral pay cut imposed on many school escorts.  Anybody working 230 or fewer hours per term or, on average, 4.6 or fewer hours per day will be worse off because of this new pay arrangement.  The new pay arrangement is, effectively, to get rid of the rolling up of the holiday pay, the additional 8% which was incorporated into the basic hourly pay, and to set aside days in respect of holidays.<\/p> <p>The Department set out in the circular that this had to be in line with the European working time directive.

One school principal said to me that the impact of this pay cut for the school escorts in his school amounts to just short of &euro;500 per year, which is a large amount of money for a low-paid worker.  I am seeking answers today with regard to the rationale behind the circular and the impact of the circular on school escorts.  I note that within the circular there is an assurance that no school escort will be worse off, yet when we do the figures we know that some escorts working 230 or fewer hours per term will be worse off.  Very serious questions are being posed here and I am seeking reassurance that no school escort will be worse off because of this change in how school escorts are paid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#D00700","speaker":"1683"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  I support the comments she made about the importance and significance of the work that is done by school escorts.  However, before I address the specific issue, I will provide an outline of the extent of the school transport system.<\/p> <p>The school transport scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department.  In the 2020-21 school year over 114,100 children, including over 14,700 children with special educational needs, were transported daily to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country, at a cost of over &euro;224.7 million in 2020.  There exists within the special needs transport scheme the appointment of a school bus escort where a child's care and safety needs while on school transport are such as to require the support of an escort.  The purpose of Circular 0024\/21 is to inform hourly-paid bus escorts in recognised primary, secondary and community and comprehensive schools of the changes to pay arrangements for hourly-paid bus escorts with effect from the commencement of the 2021-22 academic year.<\/p> <p>The hourly rates paid to bus escorts have heretofore included an element in respect of annual leave.  This practice is known as \"rolled-up holiday pay\".  The effect of the circular is to cease the practice of paying rolled-up holiday pay to such staff and to introduce a separate payment in respect of holiday pay.  This change is being made to bring the method of remunerating such staff into line with the European Union working time directive, following a decision of the European Commission.  It is important to note that the change should not result in the overall remuneration of such staff being changed.  The pay of a staff member under the new arrangements set out in the circular in respect of any period of employment should be equal to the pay which the staff member would have received for the corresponding period of employment under the pre-existing arrangements.<\/p> <p>However, the Department has recently received a number of queries from school authorities who are experiencing anomalies in terms of pay and annual leave when trying to implement the criteria set down in circular 0024\/2021.  In response to these queries the Department has carried out a full review of the circular and has identified that the calculation method in the circular was based on previous similar circulars for other school staff.  However, as bus escorts can work outside usual school hours, this results in an incorrect calculation.  The Department apologises for any inconvenience or confusion that has arisen in schools as a result.  The Department is currently amending Circular 0024\/2021.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Norma Foley:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=NormaFoley&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is expected that the revised version will be published next week to ensure the correct approach is followed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#D00800","speaker":"1582","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her reply.

Last Sunday, the <i>Irish Mail on Sunday<\/i>reported that work on the MetroLink project will not commence until 2027 and will not be completed until 2034.  Some of us are old enough to remember when MetroLink was first mooted for north County Dublin.  It was officially announced in Transport 21 back in 2005 when the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government was promoting efficient transport, probably before its time.  Now, in 2021, instead of cutting the ribbon to mark the start of work on this particular project, the people of Dublin North are finding out from a leak in a Sunday newspaper that the project is now not going to be delivered until 2034.  To be honest, there is no explanation that would make it acceptable to have a delay on top of the delays that we have experienced before.<\/p><p>Public transport is not just a response to the current climate crisis that we are in; it is an immediate need for the people in north County Dublin and north Dublin.  We have been waiting on it for bloody well donkey's years.  If there is one thing that we have all learnt in the last 18 months in respect of the positives from the pandemic, if there ever were any, it is about the quality of life and how much it has improved.  We have learnt that getting back the time we previously spent commuting in the last number of years, because we have been able to work remotely, has enhanced our quality of life.  Many of us have also realised that what is important in life is our children, friends and family and spending quality time with them.  The hardworking people of Dublin North deserve the opportunity, after years of promises, to be able to avoid what we have seen for many years as the gridlock that starts at CityNorth Hotel just outside Gormanston.  From 7 a.m., people are sitting in their cars waiting to get onto the M50 right back up to County Louth.  The hard-working people who are travelling to and from work deserve an efficient transport system sometime in the 21st century.<\/p><p>MetroLink is about the efficient movement of people.  As far back as when I bought my first house in Swords in 1996, it formed part of the sales brochures of what was to come for Swords.  Here we are now, 25 years later, being told by a Sunday newspaper that decisions have been made to push the project back to 2034.  We heard a statement from the Minister yesterday that he is committed to providing high-quality public transport in the greater Dublin area, that the national development plan includes these projects and that following consultation with his Government colleagues, a report will be published in the next few weeks.<\/p><p>I spent four years sitting around a Cabinet table and I know the kind of language that is designed to avoid giving bad news.  The kind of language that was used yesterday does not provide us with the confidence we need that the MetroLink north project is on track for completion within a reasonable timeframe.  If it genuinely is the Government's commitment to deliver top-notch public transport, we need somebody to come out and tell us definitively that what was reported in the <i>Irish Mail on Sunday<\/i>is wrong and inaccurate.  We need dates of when the new development plan is coming out and an absolute commitment to the timelines that we are working on currently, which is a commencement this year or next year of a planning application and an actual live, working, physical metro train running from Swords, through Dublin Airport and into Dublin that will be active in 2027.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#E00500","speaker":"1653"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for the opportunity to address this issue in the House today.  As the Senator has already acknowledged, I am reading this into the record on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan.<\/p> <p>Improving public transport services and infrastructure is central to improving citizens' quality of life and addressing our climate action challenge.  This Government is committed to a fundamental change in the nature of transport in Ireland.  As a Government, we need to provide more options to people so that they can make the switch to sustainable mobility.  Within the greater Dublin area, MetroLink is certainly one of these options.  It will facilitate the development of a better integrated public transport system - a system that will enable people to switch between bus, light rail, metro and rail, all under the umbrella of a revamped and integrated fare structure.  We know this challenge will be an enormous effort and in many ways, MetroLink as a project represents that enormity.  It will likely be the largest ever publicly funded project in the history of the State.<\/p> <p>I have seen the media reports of recent days and I think it is useful to clarify what the current position is in relation to MetroLink.  There has been no Government decision to defer the project.  Actually, the project faces two imminent and important milestones in the coming months, and these milestones will determine its progress in the coming years.  First, there is Government approval of the preliminary business case, and second, there is the submission of a railway order application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  There has not been any impact on either of these two hugely significant milestones over recent days.<\/p> <p>On the first milestone, the Department of Transport has received the preliminary business case.  This represents decision gate 1 under the public spending code.  That preliminary business case is currently under review.  For major projects like MetroLink, the public spending code requires a Government decision.  The Minister for Transport expects to seek such a decision in the near future.  If this is approved by the Government, it will allow MetroLink to move into the statutory planning system, subject to the completion of the necessary planning and environmental documentation.  The second impending milestone is the submission of a railway order application for MetroLink.  That application requires the finalisation of an extensive set of documentation, including environmental impact assessment reports.  That work is ongoing in relation to both projects.<\/p> <p>The Minister for Transport informed the House last week of his understanding that an extensive body of work remains in relation to finalising the preliminary design, completing the required environmental impact assessment reports and closing out property referencing issues.  The Minister stated his understanding that this work would be completed during the first quarter of next year.  Subject to the Government decision I mentioned earlier, the project will then be ready to seek planning permission.  An indicative timeline was published in the very early stages of the public consultation on MetroLink, which indicated a railway order application could potentially be made by 2019 and construction could commence by 2021.  However, as I have explained, it is the case that no railway order application has been made yet and work is still ongoing to finalise the application.  Clearly, therefore, construction work will not commence in 2021 and realistically, any objective timeline for the start of construction must await greater certainty on planning permission.<\/p> <p>I can reassure the Senator that the key focus at project level is to get the necessary documentation finalised to allow for a planning application and the key focus at departmental level is to conclude the review of the preliminary business case.  I am happy to confirm that work is continuing in relation to both, with important progress expected in the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#E00600","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I do not want to be disrespectful to the Minister for Education and I thank her for coming in to deliver the message from the Minister for Transport.

This is not my first time questioning the Government and being unable to address the Minister responsible.<\/p> <p>I again ask about the Government's position regarding the Energy Charter Treaty.  I was disappointed by the response I received the last time that Ireland is happy to continue to throw its lot into a reform process that is going nowhere and that fails to address the core problems in the treaty.  <\/p> <p>Putting aside the fact that change to the treaty requires unanimity and Japan has ruled out any changes to it, the proposals brought forward by the EU Commission fall way short of what is needed.  The EU amendments will lock in protections for gas plants, biomass and biogas.  There are no proposals for a climate carve-out from investor protections.  The EU is leaving the tribunal process, the lack of transparency, the conflicts of interest of the arbitrators and the high awards to the parallel process of reform being undertaken by the UN for which again there is no consensus internationally.<\/p> <p>Since I last raised this matter in the House, the European Court of Justice has confirmed what those of us who follow these matters expected which is that following the earlier Achmea ruling, investor state dispute tribunals are not compatible with EU law.  Does Ireland still want to continue to spend the critical time we should be using for climate action on negotiating changes to the Energy Charter Treaty?<\/p> <p>To date, the investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, tribunals have ignored the previous European Court of Justice rulings and dismissed member states' claims that the tribunals have no jurisdiction on intra-EU disputes.  Since the earlier Achmea ruling, despite an agreement by all EU governments to object to ISDS in intra-EU disputes, 48 ISDS cases have been taken against Spain and it is facing &euro;880 million in compensation awards from renewable energy firms.  The Netherlands is facing multi-billion-euro compensation claims by EU investors including RWE which is currently investing in the energy sector in Ireland.  Law firms are chomping at the bit to exploit Brexit so that companies can bypass the intra-EU ruling.  <\/p> <p>Surely it is time for Ireland to follow Italy and leave the Energy Charter Treaty.  It has a 20-year zombie clause that ties governments to its provisions even after they leave, but Italy is now five years into its 20-year sunset clause while we are shackling our wagon to a reform process that is going nowhere and losing critical time to act on climate change.  All the reports from the reform process suggest that there is no progress.  France and Spain have called for withdrawal to be considered and are looking for support from their EU counterparts.  I cannot understand why the Minister, as a member of the Green Party, which is completely opposed to ISDS, is not leading the charge for Ireland to leave the Energy Charter Treaty.<\/p> <p>The nationwide smoky coal ban was delayed because of legal threats on behalf of foreign investors by the Matheson law firm, despite approximately 1,300 people dying prematurely every year as a result of air pollution.  I believe the treaty was used to delay that action.  While the ban will now be introduced because it has been extended to other fuels, the truth of the matter is that the treaty had a chilling effect on the Government's right to regulate.<\/p> <p>I ask the Minister to outline what Ireland&rsquo;s position is following the ruling of the European Court of Justice this month.

I regret that the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is not present, but I read into the record for the Senator's benefit the reply he has issued.<\/p> <p>The treaty's provisions focus on four broad areas: the protection of foreign investments, based on the extension of national treatment or most-favoured nation treatment, whichever is more favourable, and protection against key non-commercial risks; non-discriminatory conditions for trade in energy materials, products and energy-related equipment based on World Trade Organization, WTO, rules, and provisions to ensure reliable cross-border energy transit flows through pipelines, grids and other means of transportation; the resolution of disputes between participating states, and in the case of investments between investors and host states; and the promotion of energy efficiency, and attempts to minimise the environmental impact of energy production and use.<\/p> <p>The treaty is, therefore, designed to promote energy security through the operation of more open and competitive energy markets, while respecting the principles of sustainable development and sovereignty over energy resources.<\/p> <p>Negotiations to modernise the treaty are currently under way, led by the European Commission, primarily to align with Paris Agreement objectives by reforming the protections provided by the treaty to carbon-intensive energy infrastructure.<\/p> <p>The recent ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union referenced by the Senator has since determined that the arbitration system under the treaty cannot be used to claim compensation in intra-EU disputes.<\/p> <p>The court confirmed that despite the multilateral character of the treaty, and the fact that it also governs relationships with non-EU countries, \"the preservation of the autonomy and specific character of EU law precludes the Energy Charter Treaty from being able to impose the same obligations on the Member States among themselves\".<\/p> <p>Since the ruling would likely not preclude the use of the treaty arbitration process for intra-EU cases heard elsewhere in the world, there have been further calls from several member states for a co-ordinated withdrawal from the treaty.

The European Commission's proposals, which are supported by the EU Council, meaning that our Minister would have been part of those proposals, do not address Article 16 of the Energy Charter Treaty, which clearly states that irrespective of other international agreements to which a country may be party, including the Paris agreement, the provisions of the treaty, if they are more favourable to the investor, are the provisions that must apply.

This scheme has a stated objective of improving children's outcomes, supporting lifelong learning, making work pay, reducing child poverty and tangibly reducing the cost of quality childcare for thousands of families throughout Ireland.  They are very noble objectives and I know the Minister is very passionate about delivering on them.  I thank him not just for coming in here today but for meeting me and early years childcare service providers from my constituency in Dublin Central.<\/p> <p>Apart from supporting children and parents, the national childcare scheme is at its core a labour activation scheme.  While that is an important objective as well, it is doing a disservice to some of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged children in our society and my constituency.  I thank the Minister for meeting the Dublin City Community Co-op.  This involved the Community After Schools project in Dublin 1, the Daughters of Charity St. Mary's Early Years Service in Dublin 1, Lourdes Youth and Community Services in Dublin 1, the North Wall Community Development Project in Dublin 1, and the Robert Emmet Community Development Project and the South Inner City Community Development Association from the south inner city.  The Minister has given a lot of his time and has listened to them and commissioned a review of the national childcare scheme, which is very important.<\/p> <p>However, those six services are already catering for approximately 300 young people and have a waiting list of more than 200.  Estimates are that a minimum of 50% of the children attending those childcare services come from significantly disadvantaged backgrounds.  The disadvantage can be multiple challenges.  It can be everything from housing poverty to the extremes of housing homelessness to mental illness to physical illness to systemic intergenerational disadvantage.  The Minister is passionate about breaking that cycle of disadvantage.  I know he understands and values the potential power of changing people's lives that early childhood education can provide and that these childcare service providers are not providing a babysitting service.  They are not even just providing an education service; it is a whole social infrastructure and social wrap-around service.  <\/p> <p>As the national childcare scheme applies to them, the funding model and accessing the funding is not equal for all children.  There is an advantage in terms of the way the funding is distributed to the children of parents who are in employment because, at its core, it is a labour activation model.  The Minister and I know the right supports during these early years can make life-determining outcome changes for these children.  I commend the Minister on providing support through the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, this year but we are looking at a cliff edge.  We are looking at the end of the EWSS.  Longer term, we need real sustainable funding.  I believe we need a DEIS-type model for the early years sector and childcare services.  We need to see it as part of the formal education system.

I have met with the Senator and services in her area and I know she is particularly engaged on this issue.<\/p> <p>The national childcare scheme, NCS, represents the first ever statutory entitlement to financial support for early learning and childcare.  It marks a shift away from previous schemes, which were based on medical card and social protection entitlements, to a progressive system of universal and income-based subsidies.  Under the NCS, significantly more families are eligible for support.  The NCS is designed so that those on the lowest incomes receive the greatest support.  It is also designed to ensure access provided is at a level necessary to support positive child development outcomes regardless of whether parents are in work.  This approach is taken in other jurisdictions.<\/p> <p>Where parents are not engaged in work or study, the NCS subsidises up to 20 hours per week.  Where parents are engaged in work or study, the NCS subsidises up to 45 hours per week.  The definition of work or study is broad, covering all forms of work or study arrangements - full-time, part-time, week-on, week-off, and zero-hour contracts - making the scheme as flexible as possible.  Indeed, the minimum hours required to engage in work or study to qualify for enhanced hours is very low at just two hours per week.  With this design feature, the NCS attempts to strike the right balance between enabling access to early learning and childcare services, given the benefits this confers on children, and supporting parents to engage in work or study, given the impact this has on alleviating the poverty that impacts so many children.<\/p> <p>I understand there will be children in exceptional circumstances for whom these supports are not enough.  This is why we have the sponsorship process.  Under the sponsorship arrangements, these children's families can avail of up to 45 hours free early learning and childcare with no work or study requirements to be met.  I know there were some issues in the initial roll-out of the sponsorship process.  I have engaged with Tusla and some of the other sponsorship bodies.  We now know that more than 2,000 children are sponsored in services throughout the country.  I expect this number will continue to grow.<\/p> <p>The NCS is designed to be dynamic and responsive to decisions of Government.  The scheme has been in place for almost 22 months.  This has been during Covid when everything has been so badly disrupted.  My Department has engaged an external consultant to review the first year of the scheme.  This includes its usage by socioeconomically disadvantaged families and providers serving socioeconomically disadvantaged communities.  I specifically asked for this element to be included in the review in light of the concerns raised with me by the Senator and others over the past year.  This review is almost finalised and I will be considering its findings with a view to ensuring it meets its policy objectives and functions in the best interests of families and children.<\/p> <p>A separate but related piece of work involves the expert group that has been meeting in respect of designing a new funding model for the sector.  This is due to report in November.  This group has been tasked with designing mechanisms to deliver additional funding to ensure greater levels of affordability, accessibility and quality of early learning and childcare and sustainability.  This is also looking at the issue referenced by the Senator, namely, the introduction of a DEIS-type model for childcare.  That review will arrive in November but I am very conscious of the upcoming budget.  I am aware of the high-level recommendations this review will bring forward, and I am engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I have told it that childcare is my priority in terms of my Department's budgetary bid this year.  I continue to engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the wider funding question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#G00300","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.

I call it a \"so-called protest\" because it was not a protest; it was an intimidation and bullying tactic by a group to ventilate its particular anti-vaccination position.  It also included appalling and vile homophobic slurs.  There is now a pattern whereby many Ministers have had the experience of their homes being beset by protesters.  The group behind the so-called protest on Sunday has said every politician is now liable for a protest outside his or her home.  The group is also threatening to protest outside the homes of GPs.  It is not acceptable.  I am referring to where a group takes it upon itself to engage in the activity I have described, has no reasonableness and cannot be appealed to.  My home has a young child and elderly parents.  Are their private lives to be open to interference?  It is certainly not what any of us signed up to.  Maybe we need legislation and to talk about safe zones.  We are already talking about safe zones in the context of abortion clinics.  We need to address the matter in the context of determining what constitutes a reasonable protest.  Our constitutional right to protest and to freedom of expression comes with a responsibility regarding how we do things. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#K00400","speaker":"1682","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":56,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#L00200","speaker":"1655"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":57,"content":"<p>We need to make sure this House provides for a debate on this, explores the possibility of legislation and determines whether the boundaries of our public order arrangements are too tight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#L00300","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":58,"content":"<p>My colleague, Senator Chambers, and I spoke yesterday about \"Women of Honour\" and the need to take the group's stories seriously and act.  This morning I wanted to mention the nine Army rangers who went to Afghanistan to help to bring our citizens home.  I congratulate them on the work they did.  Two officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs were present.  We need to recognise the work that the rangers and other members of our Defence Forces do and that the difficulties over pay and conditions still exist.  We need, once and for all, to deal with these issues.<\/p> <p>I also want to raise the issue of drinking water.  There was a problem earlier this summer.  There are ongoing issues in Gorey and Ballymore Eustace.  Silver eels were found in a water treatment plant serving approximately 10,000 people in the Castledermot area.  The EPA condemned that.  People are experiencing ongoing problems over the security and safety of their water supply.  It is not acceptable and we need to do far more in this regard.<\/p> <p>The last issue I would like to raise concerns a conversation I had yesterday morning with Kildare branch of Down Syndrome Ireland.  It relates somewhat to what Senator Seery Kearney was speaking about.  Some training courses for young people with an intellectual disability and for young people who have left formal education are offered during mainstream school hours.  In Kildare, the courses have covered literacy and horticulture.  I visited the premises myself and tremendous work was being done.  A grant was given through the Department of Health to fund the courses.  That has now been stopped but no alternative has been put in place.  The response to the organisation in question was that it should become a section 39 organisation.  That is ridiculous.  Groups of volunteers working hard to put in place positive experiences, including learning experiences, for young people with intellectual disabilities do not want to become formal organisations.  They are giving of their time and energy.  We need to have a debate on how best to support young people with intellectual disabilities in acquiring the skills they need for life, education and, hopefully, employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#L00400","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I thank Senator O'Loughlin for bringing up the issue of the rangers.

We have a new Chief of Staff coming on board now and a new Secretary General in the Department.  We also have a Minister who says he is committed to the Defence Forces and, therefore, it is my hope that we will see a tremendous improvement in the overall structures in the Defence Forces in the very near future.<\/p> <p>The Deputy Leader, Senator Chambers, spoke yesterday about \"Women of Honour\", as did Senator O'Loughlin.  We want a thorough investigation of the matter.  We want it independently chaired by an individual from outside the Defence Forces.  Every officer, non-commissioned officer and enlisted person I know is devastated because there are people within their ranks who have brought them into disrepute and because it is not known who the perpetrators are.  The quicker we get the commission up and running, the better.  That is a job for Major General Sean Clancy, the new Chief of Staff, as he comes in.  I wish him well with that.<\/p> <p>At the end of the summer session, I spoke about the search and rescue contract.  I said it would be placed before the Cabinet as an any-other-business item at the last moment.  Indeed, it has gone before the Cabinet and has been approved to go for tender.  I wrote to the Minister following the approval and said we cannot go to tender while we are awaiting the outcome of the report on Rescue 116.  There are three companies big enough to serve as a search and rescue operator for Ireland, one of which is CHC, the incumbent.  There are serious questions that will be asked of CHC  in the report on Rescue 116, which I understand is imminent.  The adviser on the business case, Frazer-Nash Consultancy, is associated with another of the three companies that will tender.  Really and truly, the system raises more questions than it answers.  This is something this House will have to watch as it progresses.  There is a maxim that once something is approved to go to tender, we should all step back from it and allow the process to go ahead but I have serious concerns about the process that has brought us to this point.  I need to have that firmly on the record.<\/p> <p>With regard to search and rescue operations, there should be no tender until we have the full outcome regarding Rescue 116.  The company in question was provided with night-vision solutions for the cockpits of its helicopters almost ten years ago but those solutions have never been implemented.

Looking forward, I would like to have a conversation on what the Department can do, in conjunction with some of the other Departments, on climate action.  This is a significant year for climate action.  A report was issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, during the summer, while we were not sitting.  We have not spoken about it but it is important to mention it in the Chamber.  It was a wake-up call for all of us, including all of us in the Green Party, but we have put in place a climate action Bill.  The 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP26, is coming up, which means every Department, ahead of the budget, will need to think about what it can do.  My party can given assurances that it will work with the Minister for Transport to invest in something that will make a significant difference for the Department of Education when it is examining its carbon footprint in respect of school transport.  We have probably all received many representations from people whose children have been refused school transport.

Sinn F&eacute;in, therefore, will not participate in today&rsquo;s debate with the MEPs.<\/p> <p>The key issue I want to raise today is once again - I cannot believe I am here saying this - the issue of funding for the inquest into the Stardust fire.  From September 2020 to February 2021, the Department of Justice and the legal team representing 46 of the 48 families engaged in a six-month negotiation regarding how the costs should be covered.   Despite the legal team continuously warning the Department of Justice that an inquest of this magnitude and this significance would require a bespoke arrangement the Department insisted that the legal aid route would be the route to use.  The legal team proceeded in good faith and is now being told by the Legal Aid Board that it was not informed of this decision.  This is despite a letter from the Minister and the Department of Justice saying that it is now up to the Legal Aid Board and the lawyers because it has agreed that the Legal Aid Board is the route that the families are going to take and that they will be paid a month in arrears.  It now appears that the Department of Justice is trying to wash its hands of the fact that it gave that written confirmation to the legal team and the families it represents and is saying that it is up to the Legal Aid Board and the lawyers to once again negotiate and thrash this out.  Is it seriously suggesting that having wasted six months on negotiating how this inquest was going to be funded, the Department now wants the lawyers to start that process all over again with the Legal Aid Board?<\/p> <p>I also have very serious concerns about the statement by the Minister of State in the D&aacute;il this morning on the costs and the funding that was allocated in the budget to help with the cost of the inquest.  We had a commitment from the then Minister, Deputy Flanagan, at the time the inquest was granted that all adequate resources would be put in place.  We had the Taoiseach talking about &euro;8 million being allocated for the funding of the inquest and today we had a statement from the Minister of State that the Government will put in place &euro;8 million to help cover the costs of the inquest.  That is a significant move and shift in position from what we were told when the inquest was granted.  I am absolutely disgusted by the senior Minister and the Department of Justice in how it has treated the families of the Stardust fire.  I ask again why it is that the State continuously forces these families to go through the mill in order to get the answers as to what happened to their loved ones on that night in 1981.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#M00300","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I express my sympathies to our colleague, Senator Annie Hoey, and her family.  Just a number of short weeks ago we were congratulating her on her wedding.  Thankfully her father, Ray, was able to attend it but after a very long illness, he lost that battle last night.<\/p> <p>The issue I raise this morning is one that many Deputies, Senators and other elected representatives from north County Dublin have been most anxious about over the past number of days, namely, the leak last Sunday in respect of MetroLink and the prospective delay in that project to 2034.  While it is understandable that communities in north County Dublin are outraged by this, it is also important to say that this is a very important issue for the communities in the north inner city and the communities of Cabra, Glasnevin, Phibsboro and Drumcondra.  These communities were very excited and very much needed MetroLink, believing that it was going to be a game-changer for them.  These communities are the gateway to the city.  They have to bear the brunt of commuter traffic and deal with emissions with nitrous oxide levels often 25% above the EU maximum limits.  MetroLink is, therefore, very important but now we hear that it may be delayed and, indeed, the question is being asked as whether it will happen at all.<\/p> <p>The important issue for me is that MetroLink is not a stand-alone project.  MetroLink is crucial to the full roll-out and success of BusConnects and it is also dependent on the DART+ South West project, in particular as it is connects Heuston Station to the new station in Glasnevin.  Anybody cycling or driving in the north inner city or just north of that area at the moment will know of the congestion in these communities.<\/p> <p>I listened very carefully to the Minister&rsquo;s reply to the Leader of this House when she posed the question about MetroLink this morning and a number of things stood out.  The Minister said that MetroLink is an option.  How can one call something an option when &euro;170 million has already been spent on metro north and another &euro;49 million has been spent on MetroLink?  It is crucial that we see this project progressing.<\/p> <p>The Department is also playing games with us because it is said the dates that were given were provided at the early part or start of the consultation.  At the start of this year the National Transport Authority and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, said that the railway order application would be made in August of this year but that has not happened.  The Department has wantonly attempted to mislead public representatives on what exactly is happening.  We need a clear answer from the Government as to whether it is committed to this project and, if it is committed to it, a clear timeline on when it is going to happen.  It is not good enough that these communities have for the past two decades dealt with uncertainty around this project.  They are now looking at another two decades of increasing congestion in their communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#M00400","speaker":"1683"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I want to highlight the issue of the Owenacurra Centre in Midleton, which is home to 19 people who have severe and enduring mental health difficulties, some of whom have lived there for many years.  It is the only long-stay adult mental health facility in east Cork and prior to the Covid-19 emergency, it also provided respite and day care.<\/p> <p>On 28 June the residents received the shock announcement that the Owenacurra Centre was to be closed by 31 October due to concerns about the building.  To get an understanding of this we have to understand that the town location of the Owenacurra Centre has allowed residents to integrate into the local community.  The residents are known within the town of Midleton and are very much looked after, not just by the staff of the centre but by the local people they meet every day in the cafes, shops, the post office and the library.  As well as the loss of their home, residents are facing the loss of many therapeutic relationships and staff all at the one time.  Families are deeply concerned that much of the progress that their loved ones have made over many years will be undone by the closure of the centre and the loss of their support systems.  <\/p> <p>We had two meetings of the Oireachtas Sub-Committee on Mental Health about the proposed closure in recent weeks.  The first of these involved family members and it was very emotional.  Yesterday, we heard from the HSE management.  Family members of residents wrote to me this morning and said there were greatly concerned that there are plans to start moving residents from the Owenacurra Centre next week and that management have not ruled out St. Stephen's Hospital in Glanmire as an alternative placement option.  St. Stephen's Hospital is an institutional ward setting where the Mental Health Commission has raised more serious concerns about the premises than the Owenacurra Centre.  It is in the countryside and residents do not have the same access there to community supports.  Dormitory-style accommodation is the norm there rather than single rooms.<\/p> <p>HSE management also did not rule out St. Catherine&rsquo;s ward for some of the Owenacurra residents.  St. Catherine's ward is a facility near Cork city which also received a lower compliance rating from the Mental Health Commission than on the commission&rsquo;s most recent visit to the Owenacurra centre.  The Mental Health Commission said that the residents of St. Catherine&rsquo;s were not allowed to access their rooms for 12 hours of the day.  Yesterday&rsquo;s Oireachtas committee raised many questions about the building reports on the Owenacurra Centre which HSE management were not able to answer.  I am also concerned that there appears to be no clear service plan for people in east Cork with either respite or long-term placement needs into the future.<\/p> <p>The four Cork East Deputies were united yesterday in calling for the closure of the Owenacurra Centre to be halted.

It should be published before the upcoming budget because as we know, there are extra costs for people with disabilities.<\/p> <p>The ESRI report referred to the number of people with disabilities who are employed in our country.  We must look at our public sector.  I want to highlight that the reasonable accommodation fund is only open to people in the private sector.  If we want to raise the number of people involved and have a more inclusive workplace, we need to start with what we have control over, that is, the public sector.  People in the public sector who might need reasonable accommodation and some assistive technology must go to their line managers.  A person told me they had to write a business case to get help to do their job a little better and more productively and to help them to feel like a part of the team.  That business case was not accepted and the person in question was told they had to prove themselves.  That is because the reasonable accommodation fund is not for public sector employees, and is only for those in the private sector.  It would be great if that was taken into consideration in the next budget.  It would also be great if the Indecon report was published and some action was taken on foot of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#N00200","speaker":"1671"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I join others in sympathising with the Hoey family on a very sad loss.<\/p> <p>I ask the Acting Leader for a debate on aviation as a matter of urgency.  As the Acting Leader will know, all airports must be, and should be, treated fairly and proportionately.  Given that the Government is looking at putting in place an incentivisation fund to assist airlines in restoring routes, it is important that in that hierarchy of routes, as the T&aacute;naiste said yesterday, Cork Airport, which is the second busiest airport in the country, is not treated unfairly or put at a disadvantage in terms of state aid or state support.  If other airports are to benefit, Cork Airport should also benefit.  It must be treated to the same equity in the context of financial incentivisation to restore connectivity on a proportional basis.  Cork Airport is the second busiest airport in the country and must get its fair share of Government support.  I ask the Acting Leader to have that debate as soon as possible.  In fact, I suggest and hope it could be done next week, ahead of the budget.  As the Acting Leader knows, routes are already being planned for next summer.  The summer season will begin in April of next year and it is incumbent on us to ensure we have as many aircraft bases in Ireland as possible.  <\/p> <p>I also ask, in the context of aviation, for a debate on the issue of work practices in the Irish Aviation Authority.

This issue may have been raised before but thousands of children, especially in the inner city of Dublin, are going to lose out on after-school places because of the October 2019 changes.  Many childcare providers are still staying afloat because of the current wage subsidy schemes, which will end in September.  Those schemes have given childcare providers some respite and space to figure out what to do.<\/p> <p>We know the part of the national childcare scheme that affects the Robert Emmet Community Development Project is the income assessment scheme whereby children of parents who are not working will only be entitled to 20 hours of childcare per week.  We may need to review the scheme in light of the fact that these are the most disadvantaged children in the country.  For their primary education, they have the advantage of attending schools with Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, status.  We might need also to look at DEIS after-school facilities so that these children are not left with nowhere to go.  The Robert Emmet group provides a huge service.  It is after school and includes a warm meal and help with homework.  To cut the service off would be an absolute indictment on us.  I would appreciate it if the Cathaoirleach and the Acting Leader would raise this matter with the Minister.<\/p> <p>I concur with my colleagues, Senators Seery Kearney and McGreehan, on the ESRI report into those working with disabilities.  We had the fourth lowest rate of employment for people with disabilities of working age in 2018.  A contributing factor was obviously the lack of supports for people going from second level education, where we are quite good, to third level education, where we are failing miserably.  Nearly 11% of us have some sort of disability so it is a considerable amount of the population.  We need to do a lot more to support our loved ones, family members and friends with a disability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#N00400","speaker":"1630"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I also pass on my condolences to Senator Hoey and her family on their sad loss.<\/p> <p>A large number of people from the campaign to save St. Brigid's Hospital in Carrick-on-Suir are today travelling to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.

Now the branch in Fethard is being closed and people are being told to go to Clonmel.  People will have to travel approximately 30 km.  I request that we ask the Minister for Finance or the Minister of State at the Department of Finance to come in.  This sort of thing has been going on in every single county.  It has happened in different parts of Tipperary, including Cahir, Cashel and Templemore, where Bank of Ireland has closed branches.  That has a considerable and detrimental impact on an area.

The council pays for housing for 25 years and owns nothing at the end of it.

Last Thursday, a young boy from Tulsk National School in County Roscommon, Callum Clarke, who is 11 years of age, saved his grandfather from drowning.  His grandfather had taken him out fishing on a local lake.  His grandfather stood up to disentangle the line that had got caught in the reeds.  I do not know what happened but the boat capsized.  This remarkable young lad got a piece of timber.  His grandfather had gone down under the water twice and the third time he came up, he got him to hold on to the piece of timber, rested his body some way on his body, got them back onto the boat and rowed the boat in.  It is one of the most remarkable stories I have ever heard.  On behalf of everybody here we should write a letter to him and other people who do such things to acknowledge what they do.  We might take this on board and if it can be done I would appreciate it.<\/p> <p>I ask the Deputy Leader to get the support of the House to ask RT&Eacute; to appoint an agriculture correspondent without further delay.  In fairness, this matter was raised by Senator Dooley a number of months ago.  I said at the time the matter was going to be decided on by RT&Eacute; as that was my information.  However, it has not done so and it is time it did.  Everyone recognises, whether they are urban or rural, that agriculture is still the backbone of our economy.  The agricultural sector should have an agriculture correspondent at the national broadcaster.  This correspondence subject should not be shared with any other.  It should not be an agriculture and climate change post.  Both are entitled to due coverage.  Fran McNulty was the previous agriculture correspondent.  He was an excellent presenter.  It is more than six months since he left and RT&Eacute; has not filled the position.

As colleagues said, our thoughts and prayers are with the family on this day.<\/p> <p>I want to raise two issues.  The first is an urgent request for a debate with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the proposed review of housing aid and housing adaptation grants administered by local authorities.  My office, particularly in recent months, has received an increasing number of calls from constituents stating the grants and assistance being offered do not cover the increased building costs and are no longer fit for purpose.  In one case, the cheapest quote the person dealing with my office received was more than 200% above the maximum grant payment, which is &euro;30,000.  The quote that person sought was for the works recommended by the local authority's occupational therapist.  The person had engaged with five different contractors to try to get a cheaper quote.  The problem many people in Kildare and, I am sure, throughout the country are having is that the amounts being offered by the local authorities are falling well short of the increasing quotes they are getting.  This is having a knock-on effect.  In some cases I am dealing with, the applicants have to remain in hospital because the family cannot afford the cost of the works to bring them home.  In an increasing number of cases, the people can no longer live in their own home, causing an additional cost to the State through the nursing homes subvention scheme.  I am turning to another arm of the State and trying to engage the community welfare service to see whether it can come up with the difference to secure these payments and ensure the grants are paid.  These issues causing a lot of stress, as the Deputy Leader can imagine, to loved ones at a most difficult time.  There is a feeling of helplessness in offering them assistance.  I ask her to contact the Minister for a debate.<\/p> <p>The other issue I want to raise is the publication of the long-awaited gambling Bill, which is due this month.  I ask the Deputy Leader to write to the Minister to ensure the legislation that has been promised for this month will be delivered.

The first is the spiralling cost of oil and gas fuel for aviation, transport and home heating.  It is having a significant impact on economic activity and it will certainly lead to fuel poverty.  This is happening at a time we have, rightly, adopted carbon pricing.  The budget will require an increase in the cost of carbon, which will have an impact on fuel.  What is important is that the Government ensures there is an appropriate safety mechanism for people on low incomes and not just for people who are getting the fuel allowance.  There has to be a lot of work done on this.  I would welcome a debate in the House.  We need to consider some kind of rebate scheme.  When carbon taxing was introduced, the expectation was that oil and gas prices would remain relatively stable because demand was expected to reduce in line with the direction of travel of eliminating carbon from our environment.  This has not happened.  As a result of the pandemic, costs have spiralled.  We need a debate in the House to address this at the earliest opportunity.<\/p> <p>Over the weekend, there was significant commentary in the media about an internal dispute in the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, among air traffic controllers.  Like others in the House, I have been contacted about this.  The scale of the contact is immense.  Many people are very concerned about what is going on in the authority.  Yesterday, the transport committee decided to write the Minister, Deputy Ryan, asking him to appoint Kieran Mulvey as an interlocutor to try to find a resolution to the crisis.  It is not just any other internal relations issue.  This is air traffic control.  We cannot afford to have a period of instability or anything that might happen that would raise issues of safety of personnel or within the aviation sector.  It is paramount that the Minister responds.  Perhaps there is an opportunity for the Deputy Leader to communicate with the Minister the desire of the House to support the wishes of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#O00500","speaker":"1655"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":77,"content":"<p>I too offer my condolences to Senator Hoey and her family at the very sad time of the passing of her dad.

Investment in public transportation is of great importance to us as a society and as an economy, and in achieving our climate action targets.  We all want to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.  I want to talk about two projects in particular: MetroLink and DART+.  Between them, more than &euro;5 billion of public money will be invested in these massive infrastructure projects.  With regard to MetroLink, there have been unsubstantiated reports in the media which need to be responded to.  I ask that the Deputy Leader write to the Minister for Transport and ask him to come to this House and update us on MetroLink.<\/p> <p>The DART+ West upgrade is part of the overall upgrade to DART services and the main rail lines from Drogheda, Celbridge and Maynooth.  In my own constituency of Dublin Central, the Maynooth line, which runs from the docklands out to Maynooth, is due for an upgrade.  That is a really important public transport service that needs to be upgraded.  We need more frequent, more efficient and more affordable public transport.  Part of the upgrade proposes to compulsorily purchase the Ashtown Stables.  Those stables have been in family ownership for decades.  Young children and adults from Cabra, Drumcondra, Phibsborough, the Navan Road, Castleknock and all of the surrounding areas have benefited, and do benefit, from those horse riding stables.  Not only do they provide an educational and cultural activity within the city, but they are also a tourist attraction.  Irish Rail has been conducting a non-statutory public consultation that has failed to engage properly with the owners of the stables.  It needs to meet with them.  I have written to the CEO of Irish Rail.  I ask the Deputy Leader to write to the CEO of Irish Rail and to ask him to meet with the family and to engage constructively.

It is not enough that the HSE has its version of guidelines for access for partners on its website when the lived experience of women in hospitals is entirely different.  That is where politicians step in on behalf of their constituents to say that this is just not good enough.  If the discrepancy in compliance is about infection control, where is the oversight and where is the transparency?  I thank the Leader, Senator Doherty, for organising the meeting of the Oireachtas women's caucus on better maternity care and on sending the letter to the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly.

We are focused on reopening and recovery.  The North's death rate is three times higher per head of population.  It was the highest in Europe for months until it was recently overtaken by Greece.  Some 88% of adults have received their first dose of vaccine but a quarter of 18 to 29-year-olds have not.  Those figures are reflected in ICUs.  They are facing this situation while also dealing with essential non-Covid care.  Last week, help from military medics was being looked at.  The Ministry of Defence was considering that.

As a country which has done so well with regard to employment generally and which bounced back so successfully from the economic crash back in 2010, it is shocking that we are the fourth worst in Europe with regard to people with disabilities.  The disability employment strategy has clearly failed.  The figures from 2018 are extremely concerning.  We need to have a debate in this House on that specific issue.  We need to engage with the Minister and to try to identify where the problems are.  We also need to look at offering incentives to the private sector to hire people with disabilities.

It is also shocking that we do not know as of yet who will be the new chair of the board of Shannon Airport.  No announcement has been made.  We all know how important the airport is to the mid-west region.  Months later, a replacement chair has not been announced.  Nobody is accountable.  Nobody is explaining what the delay is.

I do not agree with the Taoiseach when he says that the result of the recent debacle should be that such appointments would be made by open competition in future.  An argument can be made that, provided the process is transparent and deliberative - which it certainly was not in the case of the proposed Zappone appointment - it should be within the gift of the Government, having duly considered matters, to make such appointments.  However, there are two important lessons to be learned from the affair.  The first is that Cabinet Ministers are leaking and that the Taoiseach does not seem to care.  He seems to think it is part and parcel of politics.  Those are the words he used but Article 28 could not be clearer.  It says &quot;the confidentiality of discussions at meetings of the Government shall be respected in all circumstances&quot; and that only the High Court can determine otherwise.  Despite this, we have the bizarre situation of an alleged sting operation involving a junior Minister to find out if a senior Minister is leaking.  At this stage, the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, should be invited to take a polygraph test because the public is concerned.  People would be greatly interested.  It is a matter of public interest.<\/p><p>The second lesson is that appointments are being made because people have, shall we say, special privileges because they are in tune with the <i>zeitgeist<\/i>.  The rights of LGBT people worldwide are certainly important and need to be defended, particularly in countries where those rights are being abused, but the more obvious tried and trusted appointment to be made in this case would be a special envoy for freedom of religion and belief under Article 18 of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  That includes the freedom not to have any belief.  Many more people are being persecuted in the world today because of their religion than are being so persecuted because of their sexual orientation.  Atheists are being persecuted by certain regimes because they do not have religious belief.  The EU has such an envoy, as do Britain, Germany, Italy, Hungary and many other countries.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Is there any sign of a concept note on that issue from our diplomats?

It is obvious in the eyes of other countries that freedom of religion and belief is one of the critical issues in the world today.  It is not just Christians, though they are by far the most persecuted groups.  There are others, including Muslims in various Muslim countries, Yazidis - it is a long list.

They are not going hand in hand or helping each other.  I will give two examples, one relating to urban centres and the other to rural areas.  Not to be parochial about it, but I can only speak of what I know well, which is my home town of Dundalk.  We have the Planning Regulator coming down to the local authority to dezone land that is strategic 1 land.  It is land that is ready to be built on in the middle of an urban centre.  It is shovel-ready and can be built on straight away.  It is dezoned to strategic 2, which will not be built for five to ten years.  How do we correlate that with our desire to build so many homes each year over the period of this Government?<\/p> <p>I know the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, is doing a lot of this but it would be important for us as a House to have a debate about the Planning Regulator, county development plans and how we have two sectors working in tandem.  There is no point dezoning land we can build a load of houses on and, in two or three years, wondering why we cannot build houses.  It is because we are dezoning it now at the behest of the Planning Regulator.  As a result, there are many local councillors and local authorities saying \"No\" to the executives and the Planning Regulator.  They have to get independent legal advice and pay for it themselves to put a good case against it.  I do not think that is fair.<\/p> <p>It is the same in terms of rural one-off housing.  I have just come from a meeting with the IFA which brought up that the restrictions we are putting on such housing means we do not want anyone to live in rural Ireland anymore and we want people to move from rural areas to urban centres.  You would not expect some from an urban centre to move to a rural area they are not from, so I do not think it is fair.  I would appreciate a debate about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#Q00200","speaker":"1670"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":83,"content":"<p>On public representatives getting their own legal advice at local authority level, they are entitled to get a second opinion in those types of issues and this should be paid for by the council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#Q00300","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I thank all Members who contributed.  Senator Seery Kearney started off the day by mentioning the ESRI report on the employment rates of people with disabilities.  She was joined by Senators McGreehan, Ardagh and Conway in rasing that important issue.  It is a worrying statistic that we are the fourth worst country in terms of people with disabilities accessing meaningful employment.  We have a job of work to do today.  The Indecon report commissioned by Senator Doherty when she was the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which is a good piece of work, is long overdue in terms of publication.  It has been recommended by the Joint Committee on Disability Matters that it be published.  That is something tangible we can do early on.<\/p> <p>I concur with the remarks about what I will not even call a protest.  That is not what I understand protest to be.  That was harassment of a citizen of this country.  Regardless of his or her profession, nobody should have to endure that.  The idea of safe zones outside people's houses will be a complex debate.  It is something we could discuss but we need to be cautious about not restricting protests.  It will be a thin line to try to walk but it is an important conversation.<\/p> <p>Senator O'Loughlin raised the issue of the Army rangers who went to Afghanistan to extract citizens and their families, as did Senator Craughwell.  I commend them on their work.  Senator O'Loughlin raised it in the context of the \"Women of Honour\" discussion we had yesterday at Commencement matters.  There are ongoing difficulties with the Defence Forces.  There is a cultural issue which I hope is no longer there but it certainly was there.  It is important to acknowledge the fantastic work the Defence Forces do.  As Senators Wall and Craughwell pointed out, there is devastation across the Defence Forces following those revelations.  All current and past members want an independent inquiry.  That is important.<\/p> <p>Senator O'Loughlin also raised the issue of the Kildare Down's syndrome association and the need for support for young people in achieving their full potential.  That links in with the ESRI report.<\/p> <p>Senator Craughwell raised, as he has done on many occasions, the issue of the search and rescue contract.  I am persuaded by his argument that the tendering process may find some difficulties given we have not concluded the investigation into R116.  I have no doubt he will make that matter known further up the line and I will do the same.<\/p> <p>Senator Pauline O'Reilly spoke about the Minister for Education and I concur with her comments to the effect that the Minister has been doing fantastic work in education at a difficult time.  The Senator raised an interesting point on the role of the Department of Education and the Minister in climate action.  Our young people are leading the way in climate action and teaching us what we need to do better and that we can be better.  Senator O'Reilly mentioned the IPCC report and that we have not had a debate on that.  It might be worthwhile for this House to have a proper debate on that report.  It was stark.  It was nothing overly surprising for many people, but it sets a high bar for us to achieve as a country to achieve our emissions targets.  We will try to get the Minister in to have a debate on that.  Previously, the Senator brought a Bill to the House about solar panels in schools.  There are clever ways we can work with education and address the climate challenge.<\/p> <p>Senator Boylan started by raising the manner in which Chris MacManus MEP was invited to the debate later today with MEPs.  We had a discussion about that within the Seanad Committee on Parliamentary Privileges and Oversight.  Senator Gavan raised concerns on behalf of the group and we all agreed it would have been preferable had invitations been sent earlier and had people had more time.  It was agreed by the group that the MEP would be facilitated at another date to address the House so as not to be disadvantaged.  we were all keen to hear from all of our MEPs.  There is another MEP who cannot make it, namely, Luke Ming Flanagan.  We would like to facilitate all MEPs at a date that works for them and we will make sure to get all voices into the Chamber.<\/p> <p>The Stardust matter is one that Senator Boylan has raised before and it was raised in the D&aacute;il today.  It is an important issue and as a country we have not always been great at listening to victims, taking our lead from them and framing our responses to these types of issues.  I stand with the Senator in supporting those who have been victims and their families and community who have suffered for a long time.<\/p> <p>Senator Sherlock raised the north inner city MetroLink, as did Senator Fitzpatrick.  There have been media reports of a delay.  They are unsubstantiated.  The most recent advice we have from the Minister for Transport and his Department is that there is no requested delay on his behalf but there may be planning issues.  He has given a commitment that it is his intention to proceed with the project during the lifetime of this Government.  That is the most up-to-date information we have but I concur that we probably need to get a proper update in the House to clarify matters because there is media speculation and that serves to upset the communities involved.  I agree it links in with other public transport projects and we know how important public transport is for many reasons, including quality of life for people in those areas and meeting climate obligations.<\/p> <p>Senator Black raised the issue of the Owenacurra Centre in Midleton, County Cork, the long-stay adult mental health facility.  That is a major issue throughout the country.  In my county of Mayo there are not enough residential facilities for people.  We are leaving families in an awful place where it is a life sentence because they get very little support from the State.  We have many elderly carers who are at a stage of their lives where they need help and they need a break.  These facilities are very important.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is working on it.  She is an empathetic Minister and takes these issues to heart.  She is doing her best to find a resolution for that centre.  I wish the residents, staff and community well because it means a lot to them.  I thank the Deputy for bringing that issue to the House.<\/p> <p>Senator McGreehan raised the issue of the ESRI report and spoke passionately about the need for people with disabilities to do their jobs well in the workplace and to help employers help their employees.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lisa Chambers:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It should not be necessary to have to put together a complex business case to advocate for very basic assistance in the workplace to help the worker to do his or her job to the best of his or her ability.  There is definitely space in the budget negotiations to try to do better for people with disabilities.<\/p><p>Senator Buttimer raised the issue of aviation, as he has done on many occasions, particularly in respect of Cork Airport and the whole aviation sector.  We have seen the impact on the aviation sector in the past year and a half, but also the importance of retaining routes and connectivity to Ireland as an island nation.  We have a job of work to repair the aviation sector, restore confidence and look after staff in the sector.  I concur with the Senator's remarks on supporting Cork Airport.  We cannot just rely on Dublin Airport; we have to support regional airports such as Ireland West Airport Knock, Shannon Airport and Cork Airport.  They are really important for the country, not just for the location in which they are situated.<\/p><p>Senator Ardagh raised the issue of the national childcare scheme and spoke passionately about the inner city, the disadvantage that many children in the area face and the importance of the Robert Emmet group in supporting children after school with hot meals and homework.   They are our most vulnerable citizens and we have a duty of care to them, particularly those who are in such situations.  It is small money in the grand scheme of things and I hope something can be done on that issue.  I will certainly relay that to the Minister.<\/p><p>Senator Ahearn raised the issue of Carrick-on-Suir and the St. Brigid's hospital campaign.  I thank him for bringing the issue to the House.  I agree with him that more than 11,000 signatures is a significant number for a small community to gather.  We can see how important the issue is to those in the community.  I hope they will have an opportunity to speak to the Minister at the earliest opportunity and have their concerns heard.  If anything can be done, I hope it will be done.<\/p><p>The Senator also raised the issue of banking services in rural communities.  He mentioned the AIB branch in Fethard.  The loss of public services and banking is a concern for many rural communities.  Difficult as it might be, there are challenges relating to the demand for some of those services.  We need a conversation on how we support communities where, though the bank might be the centrepiece in the town, the services are not being used to the same level they were previously.  Particularly during the pandemic, many people who ordinarily used in-branch services began using online services, so the degree of change in this area has escalated and accelerated.  It is an issue to watch because it has a knock-on effect on other businesses in the town as footfall decreases when a business is lost.  There is certainly a conversation to be had regarding supports for those towns.<\/p><p>Senator Maria Byrne raised the issue of family carers.  She referred to the stark statistic that 50% of family carers report having mental health issues.  All Members deal with families in their constituencies that are looking for extra pay hours, home help and respite.  It is just one battle after the next.  It wears people down to the point of exhaustion and they just give up.  I believe we are failing families in this space.  There is just not enough help for people.  They save the State a significant amount of money by caring for their loved ones at home and that is not acknowledged to the point it ought to be.  Families are often pushed to the point where they just cannot do it any more, there is no one able to care for the person in question and there is then a need for a long-term residential facilities that do not exist.  There is a significant job of work to be done there.  That work has started under the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, but we need to start thinking outside the box on what supports we can give and not have it such a battle for families all the time to get those supports.<\/p><p>Senator Eugene Murphy spoke about young Callum Clarke.  I wish to pay tribute to Callum on behalf of this House for his really brave rescue of his grandfather, Sean Stroker, who I heard being interviewed by Joe Duffy on the \"Liveline\" radio programme.  He was really emotional talking about his grandson.  He was so proud of him and grateful to him.  It was a good news story and I want to wish Callum well.  I am sure he is taking it all in his stride, as young people often do.<\/p><p>Senator Murphy also raised a very important point regarding an agriculture correspondent for RT&Eacute;.  It is an important role to fill and I hope RT&Eacute; does so without any further delay.<\/p><p>Senator Wall raised the issue of the housing adaptation grants and building costs.  It is a really important issue.  I was told yesterday by a local auctioneer that the cost of building has gone from &euro;120 per square foot to &euro;160, which is a huge leap.  Those grants need to keep up with the increase in costs.  It is an important issue.  We need to have a debate on housing in general and perhaps this issue can be brought under that debate in order to get a response from the Minister.<\/p><p>I am assured the gambling Bill is progressing.  I know that in the last term it was a key priority for the now Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and it is a key priority for the Government.  I totally take on board the impact gambling has on individuals.  It is a scourge.  Young people and children are being targeted with very clever online advertising and in-play gambling, which is really dangerous.<\/p><p>Senator Dooley raised the issue of the spiralling cost of fuel.  I concur with him that this is a massive problem coming down the tracks.  The cost of fuel is increasing at a rate we did not expect.  We will need certain provisions to be put in place in the budget to offset that cost and protect our must vulnerable.  It is a commitment of the Government that any increases in carbon tax will be ring-fenced and put back into climate action and addressing fuel poverty to ensure those most at risk of experiencing fuel poverty are protected and do not experience it.  That is a really important pillar of our climate policy.<\/p><p>The Senator also mentioned the Irish Aviation Authority and the aviation sector, particularly air traffic controllers.  Perhaps that whole issue can come in under the debate on aviation.<\/p><p>Senator Fitzpatrick raised the issue of public transport.  She touched on the MetroLink, which I have addressed, but also the Maynooth line, the DART+ West service and the need to upgrade those services.  It goes to show the importance of public transport and the role it will play in those communities.<\/p><p>Senator Currie raised the issue of maternity restrictions.  That issue has been raised almost weekly by Members.  It is an ongoing issue.  One of the positives that has come out of this is that we now have an Oireachtas group of women from both Houses, all parties and none, who have come together to try to deal with this issue collectively because we realise there is power in numbers and the collective voice.  Today I will join other female Members of the Oireachtas, including the Leader, Senator Doherty, who organised the meeting, to meet the HSE, represent the women of Ireland and try to get this issue resolved.  We are hopeful of a resolution to it soon but it is long overdue.<\/p><p>The Senator also raised the issue of the health service in Northern Ireland being almost at breaking point.  I concur with her that it is incumbent on us to assist our friends in the North and do our best to help them.  I wish them well.  It is scary to listen to the descriptions of the scenes in hospitals that have every bed full and in which the health workers are put to the pin of their collar.  It is something we can do to help while we are doing really well here in Ireland in terms of our vaccination programme.  Our success in that regard has not been replicated everywhere else to the same degree.  People will get there, but if there is anything we can do to help, we should do it.<\/p><p>Senator Conway spoke very passionately about the ESRI report on disabilities.  Obviously, he has key lived experience of that issue and always speaks on behalf of people with disabilities in this Chamber.  I commend him on his comments. <\/p><p>Senator Mullen raised the issue of the Zappone appointment and how the Government appoints people to those roles.  He made a very interesting point regarding the need for an envoy for freedom of religion and belief.  I agree with him that there is definitely merit in that proposal.  As regards the leak from Cabinet, I concur with his remarks that it is very serious to have a leak from Cabinet.  It should not be chalked up to normal political operations; that is not what it is.  It is not acceptable and it is prohibited by the Constitution.  It should be addressed very seriously.  I concur with his remarks in that regard.<\/p><p>Senator McGahon raised the issue of county development plans.  I too have been engaging with many councillors across the country on this issue.  It is a massive issue.  There is a significant amount of tension between the Planning Regulator, elected members and local authorities.  One of the biggest issues is that the planning framework was published prior to the pandemic and it is possible that it now does not quite fit the needs of Ireland today, post pandemic, with all of the changes we have seen in work.  There is not yet a planned review of the national planning framework.  As Members know, it informs the regional plan, which informs the county plan, so it has a knock-on effect on county development plans.  I refer to the issue in respect of the dezoning of land by the Planning Regulator.  Many elected members are not happy with the direction they are getting from the Planning Regulator.  That has to be acknowledged.  That relationship needs to be worked out and the elected members need to be listened to.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lisa Chambers:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->At the end of the day, they are local representatives.  They are elected by the people in their communities to represent those communities.  They are the people's voice and if they are not happy across the board, in every corner of the country, we have a problem.  The county development plans are very important for planning for all our communities over a five-year period, which is a significant period.  There is a great deal of work to be done there and it is an important issue to raise in this House, given that most of us have come through that electoral process in local authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#Q00400","speaker":"1642","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1632303000,"counter":87,"content":"<p>Order of Business agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1632303000,"counter":88,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 1.20 p.m. and resumed at 2.40 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Address to Seanad \u00c9ireann by Members of the European Parliament","time":1632303000,"counter":89,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#AA00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I welcome Senators and our MEP colleagues for the constituency of Midlands-North-West to the Chamber.  I extend a warm welcome to Mr. Colm Markey, MEP, and Ms Maria Walsh, MEP.  Unfortunately, Mr. Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan, MEP, and Mr. Chris MacManus, MEP, could not be here today.  My apologies to Mr. MacManus for the late notification, which was entirely my fault.  He is unable to attend as a result.<\/p> <p>The working group on the implementation of Seanad reform and its report, written in 2015 by former Senator Maurice Manning, noted that our MEPs find themselves without a formal connection to our political structures.  The working group envisaged that MEPs could debate and engage with us on European developments through an audience in the House.  The 2018 report, which was prepared under the chairmanship of Senator Michael McDowell, picked up themes and suggested the link with Europe could be done through Seanad &Eacute;ireann. <\/p> <p>As Senators are aware, the Conference on the Future of Europe was formally inaugurated on Europe Day this year.  This conference is a unique opportunity for citizens, parliaments, local authorities and especially young people to engage with playing a part in shaping the future of Europe.  The conference organisers are doing that through a hybrid format, online and in person, such as this, and in panels and discussions around Europe.  I am delighted that it is one of the themes that will be discussed today by our MEPs.  I welcome them to the Chamber as they outline their work.  <\/p> <p>As we know, Colm Markey replaced the current Commissioner Mair&eacute;ad McGuinness as an MEP.  He was first elected in 2019 to Louth County Council and was its cathaoirleach from 2017 to 2018.  He is on the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and is a member of the Delegation for Northern Cooperation and for Relations with Switzerland and Norway.  He is also a member of the EU-Iceland Joint Parliamentary Committee and the EEA Joint Parliamentary Committee.  He is a substitute member of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, the Committee on Fisheries, and the Committee of Inquiry on the Protection of Animals during Transport.  Mr. Markey is a businessman and a farmer so Europe is of huge importance to him.  He brings great experience in terms of the UK and EU, especially given his knowledge of the practicalities of Border issues.<\/p> <p>Maria Walsh is known to us all since her election in 2019.  She is a proud Mayo woman, supporting Mayo through what I will term, \"thin and thin\".  Ms Walsh was born in Boston and raised in Shrule, County Mayo.  Her parents are from Connemara and Roundfort.  She is an MEP serving on the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and the Committee on Culture and Education.  She is a delegate to the United States of America, which is appropriate, and also substitutes on the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and is a delegate to the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly.  Since her election Ms Walsh continues her work on equality with a particular focus on young people.  She is a member of the Parliament's LGBTI inter-group and is a co-chair of the MEP alliance for mental health.  <\/p> <p>I thank Senators for coming to the Chamber today.  This is a unique format that we will test.  It is the first of the interactions between our MEPs and Senators, or Ireland and our European Parliament colleagues.  The MEPs will outline their work and what they are doing in Europe on behalf of their constituencies, their constituents, Ireland and Europe.  There will then be opening statements from the leaders of the Seanad groups and their spokespersons followed by a question and answer session.  Members will have to bear with us as the question and answer session is a European format - the Leas-Chathaoirleach will take over and police it - in that it comprises a question for a minute and an answer for two minutes.  The clock will be on, which will allow for better engagement and direct answers.  We will work through this format and, as with everything, we have decided on who speaks first alphabetically.  I again thank Mr. Markey for being with us today.  He has eight minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#AA00200","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632303000,"counter":91,"content":"<p>A Chathaoirligh, Senators, fellow MEP and ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to be here at this time to begin this conversation.  In the context of Covid, it is great to be here on the ground and to be physically in contact with people.  For the first seven or eight months of my term as an MEP it was all virtual, so the idea that we can sit down, meet and converse together is very important.  It is also very important and timely that this initiative and level of engagement have been taken between the European Parliament and the Oireachtas.  It is a very important time in the European context, post Covid on one level but also because there is something of a crisis of identity in terms of where Europe is at this stage.  That is part of the genesis on why we are having the Conference on the Future of Europe at European level now.  It is very important.<\/p> <p>As MEPs, we are struggling somewhat with getting people to engage with this whole process.  At one level, there is a conversation within the EU circle on matters such as defence policy, vetoes and tax harmonisation.  These are all issues that are very important but one thing Europe is struggling with at the moment is the idea of how it connects with the ordinary citizen and the ordinary person on the ground for whom these issues are often very disconnected.  It is very important that through the Conference on the Future of Europe initiative which started in Europe this year, which will run for the next year or year and a half, we get meaningful engagement from ordinary people on the ground and that we make citizens the centre of that conference.<\/p> <p>There is apathy out there we need to deal with and address.  We have to look at what issues are relevant to the ordinary European person.  If one looks at Ursula von der Leyen's State of the Union speech last week, she focused a lot on some very key issues we have to focus on.  Certainly, the likes of the initiative around young people, the Year of European Youth 2022, is very important.  Equally, one line of the agenda is around the environment, particularly, and around all the challenges Europe faces in terms of international policy and a whole range of areas that are very important.<\/p> <p>We have to try to find ways to bring this back to issues faced by ordinary people.  If one looks at the Covid situation over the past 12 or 18 months, one will see that Europe, in terms of digital certificates and vaccines, became very relevant to ordinary people.  If we can make Europe relevant in that sort of way, it will be very important.  Europe has done a lot of work in recent times around matters such as cancer care and preventive medicines, which is where we can look at vaccines in other areas.  Things like this make a difference to ordinary people, along with issues such as the whole obesity epidemic and positive mental health.  These are all areas that are relevant to ordinary people on the ground.  That is where we have to start.  We have to look at matters for young people in terms of the element of general disengagement with politics and the body politic they have.  Sometimes, politics at both European and national levels becomes about party politics and we have to bring it back to the issues.  That is what we can, hopefully, do at the Conference on the Future of Europe.  <\/p> <p>The environment agenda is key.  If we are talking about a dialogue between the Seanad and Europe we have to look at issues of common interest to both.  The challenges we face in terms of our environment include the Fit for 55% package, where we hope to reduce our emissions by 55% by 2030 and to achieve climate neutrality by 2050.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Colm Markey:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->They are enormous challenges to meet, yet if we approach them in the right way, we can get there.  Obviously, in areas like transport, alternative fuels and renewable energy, there are massive challenges to meet, but equally, they are areas in which there are great opportunities.  For example, from a wind energy perspective, we are probably best placed across Europe to take advantage of that.  If you build into that the idea of alternative fuels, such as hydrogen, these are things that we in Ireland can be a leader on into the future.  Offshore wind, particularly off the west coast, is something that could represent an opportunity for us to get an economic multiplier into our local economy.  We need to ensure that we embrace the challenges and take the opportunities that they provide going forward, particularly in the rural Ireland context.  We were always challenged in terms of the economic opportunities that exist in rural Ireland.  If we get the technologies right, renewable energy will provide opportunities.<\/p><p>As the Cathaoirleach said, I am a substitute on the Committee onTransport and Tourism.  One of the big challenges we face is finding alternative fuels for HGVs and aviation.  If we can be a leader in the research in that area and, equally, in the transition from renewable energy to alternative fuels in this area, it is something that will be very relevant for Ireland and a massive driver in terms of regenerating our economy.<\/p><p>A key interest of mine is the area of agriculture in which in many ways we are a market leader.  There is also a concern out there among the people in this sector in rural Ireland that in some ways agriculture is being targeted or faces major challenges in terms of meeting our climate goals.  However, I think there is an opportunity there if we focus, in particular, on the concept of sustainability.  Irish agriculture, certainly in the dairy sector, is recognised as the most sustainable worldwide.  In beef and tillage we are not far behind either.  If we can focus on sustainability, it will be the Irish farmers' friend.  If we are leaders in the area of sustainability; we can be best placed to take advantage of the opportunities that will provide in agriculture going forward.  It is a position that we need to focus on in particular.<\/p><p>There are other areas to discuss.  We were here earlier in the year discussing Brexit and a number of other issues that I would like to touch on that are particularly relevant to the constituents of Midlands-North-West.  However, I would like to bring it back to the Conference on the Future of Europe.  There is a challenge there to address an apathy and concern about where politics as a whole is going.  If we can create a vision and a strong link between this Seanad and the European Parliament, it will be a strength going forward.  I look forward to hearing the Members' questions later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#AA00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Markey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":93,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Markey for his considered thoughts.

As the Cathaoirleach went through the committees of which I am a member, I want to touch briefly on the work I do on behalf of citizens across Midlands-North-West but, in particular, I want to feed into some of the key topics that I believe should be fundamentally involved in the Conference on the Future of Europe.<\/p> <p>As many of the Members may know, the 2019 election was my first involvement in politics.  Prior to that, I was involved in a lot of advocacy work speaking on issues such as marriage equality, women's rights and mental health of young people in particular.  I very much attempt to carry that into my work within the European Parliament, talking about equality, diversity and inclusion in each file and amendment that I and my team put in.<\/p> <p>Currently, I am working on two pieces of policy which I consider to be of the utmost importance for citizens, particularly for minority groups and women right across the Midlands-North-West constituency and the island.  Last week in Strasbourg, I was a shadow rapporteur for the European People's Party on a piece of legislation which called on the Commission to establish gender-based violence as a European crime.  This, in effect, would make gender-based crimes illegal in all EU countries.  <\/p> <p>Gender-based violence is a breach of human rights and it is happening in Ireland and across Europe.  We need to legislate and take non-legislative actions that address these issues at a European level and across the EU, not just at home.  With some of the EU countries unfortunately refusing to implement the likes of the Istanbul Convention and some activity regressing on the protection of human rights in other countries, we need to continue to call on the Commission to take action.  Failing to do so and having an unco-ordinated approach on gender-based violence puts European women and girls at risk.  We certainly cannot allow time to pass.  I say that simply because if our young women and girls are travelling across Europe, their rights should also travel with them.  This is true particularly for our younger men and women who travel as part of the Erasmus+ scheme.<\/p> <p>I am also working as a shadow rapporteur to strengthen the application of the principle of equal pay for equal work and work of equal value between men and women through pay transparency and the enforcement mechanisms.  One of the major obstacles to enforcing equal pay is the lack of pay transparency.  As many, if not all, can agree, the gender pay gap is unjustified, unfair, and unfortunately will most likely grow, not shrink, due to Covid, with many more women than men taking time out to care for their families.  I am sure that as an MEP for Midlands-North-West I am not the only representative who has heard that.  No doubt, many of the Members are also hearing that in their constituencies.  Across the EU, on average women get paid 14.1% less per hour than men.  This translates into women having to work an additional 51 days to earn the same wage as their male colleagues.  Fortunately, equal pay has been enshrined in Irish law for decades, but the reality is that the implementation can be very different, as it is across the EU.  The recent Irish legislation on the gender pay gap is something that I will very much be using as a baseline, but also hoping to expand on it at EU level for this directive.  As an example of the everyday changes that a small increase in transparency can make, it will potentially offer clear criteria for workers to ask their employer for information on their individual pay level and average pay levels broken down by sex for categories for workers performing the same work or work of equal value.  I share that because I think it will be a key point in terms of fundamental rights coming into the Conference on the Future of Europe.<\/p> <p>I also want to add a quick point on vocational education training.  It is something I worked on before the summer.  It is fundamentally important to Irish citizens and is an essential tool for young people and adults to find jobs after this pandemic that we have lived through.  With many of Europe's employees and employers unable to find the right skills to fill vacancies, vocational skills have become one of the best ways to mould one's career.  I certainly hope that if asked from the Floor, we can get into it a bit further.<\/p> <p>I wish to add a note about the culture and education committee.  It was music to my ears hearing the proposal announced by Ursula von der Leyen, during her state of the union address last week, that 2022 will be dedicated as a European year for youth.  We all know that younger people face the greatest challenges coming out this pandemic, be it through continuing their education, entering the labour market and maintaining their social lives.  Many students have lost their part-time jobs and fear greatly for their future.  I certainly lived through such fear during the 2007 to 2008 financial crash.  A European year is an opportunity to bring the needs and fears of young people to the forefront.  I hope this feeds into the Conference on the Future of Europe coming from younger citizens not just from my constituency, but across the country.<\/p> <p>Just before I conclude, as I am standing in front of the Members, I wish to flag that as the Cathaoirleach mentioned, I am co-chair of the two Parliament interest groups dedicated to mental health.  I am very proud to be a rapporteur on a file entitled Mental Health in the Digital World of Work. This work will be done across the Parliament through all committees, ensuring that there is a cross-sectional approach to mental health in the digital world of work.  Of course, I hope any feedback that Members may have feeds into it.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Ms Maria Walsh:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Recently, we in the MEP Alliance for Mental Health wrote to national parliaments seeking support for the campaign to designate an EU year for good mental health.  I acknowledge Senator Black, who kindly agreed to come on board as a champion for that.<\/p><p>As my colleague, Mr. Markey, concluded by expressing his sentiments on the Conference on the Future of Europe, I will do the same.  During my election campaign in 2019, I was often asked what MEPs do and what the purpose of the European Parliament is.  Over the course of the subsequent two and a half years, my knowledge has grown from connecting with people, particularly younger people.  Nevertheless, we still have fundamental work to do, not just in Fine Gael or the EPP but throughout this House and next door.  For many citizens, what they know about the EU comes in the form of Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, grants, funding for roads or the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  In Ireland, we have become aware over recent years of the importance of EU solidarity due to Brexit.  This conference is a unique and timely opportunity for citizens to engage with and examine the challenges and interests they have within the Union.  Be it rural, urban, north, south, east or west, this is a perfect time for us to discuss as a country where we want to move forward in the Union.  Given that I cover fundamental rights and social issues, which constitute the fabric of our society, I hope that moving forward there will be a stronger sense of them for younger people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#BB00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":96,"content":"<p>I thank both Ms Walsh and Mr. Markey for their contributions.

This is an exciting day for us as a House as well because it marks the beginning of a new initiative by the Cathaoirleach to foster a greater connection with the European Parliament.  It is our first opportunity to have MEPs in the Chamber.  They represent my constituency of Midlands-North-West, so it is great to have them both here.  I look forward to greater engagement over the period ahead.<\/p> <p>Both our guests touched on some interesting aspects.  I agree with them that the Conference on the Future of Europe is an opportunity for us as citizens of Europe to reflect on the Union, the 45 years we have been a member and where we are going, particularly as we emerge from not just the pandemic but also the Brexit process.  We are still dealing with the latter but we are on the other side of it, if I can put it that way.  Both those events have rocked the European Union, but we are still standing and I think they will make us stronger and more unified.<\/p> <p>It was a clever and insightful remark when Mr. Markey stated vaccines had made Europe relevant to Irish citizens over the past year and a half.  I fully agree.  It was one issue where we looked to Europe. We would not have procured the same volume of vaccines if we had not banded together with other member states and negotiated collectively to get them for our citizens.  It was the great success story for the EU, despite a rocky start, which Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the Commission, acknowledged in her state of the Union address.<\/p> <p>The Commission did a very good job on vaccines but that was not the case at the outset.  Ms von der Leyen came under significant scrutiny at the beginning, suggesting there was too much negotiation and red tape and we were a bit slow off the mark.  It came good, however, and it has worked out very well for Ireland.  We are now in the really good position whereby we can send vaccines to third world countries and start meeting our global responsibilities to ensure that the most vulnerable are vaccinated, which is the next task of the Union.<\/p> <p>Of the topics that get Irish citizens excited about Europe or talking about Europe, there are three I identify as the most important, namely, agriculture, tax and defence.  They are the three that are most provocative at times.  They are sometimes controversial and we do not always agree on where we should go in our policy in those areas, but they are areas worth focusing on.<\/p> <p>I might touch on the comments of the President of the Commission in her state of the Union address.  She focused on many issues but she made a very good job of the speech.  It was an important point for her to reflect on where the Union was going and to come out fighting, and she did that.  She addressed all the key issues, including domestic violence, which was fantastic because she has been a leader and an inspiration to female representatives and women across the board.  She referred to the issue as a shadow pandemic.  She addressed events in Afghanistan and the ongoing human rights atrocities there, but again she focused on women, children and female judges, who are now running from those they had imprisoned for their offences.  She cleverly worked in many issues that perhaps are not debated as often as they should be, and she is using her position very well in that regard.<\/p> <p>The European year of youth 2022 was mentioned, which is brilliant, and Ms von der Leyen acknowledged the great sacrifice our young people have made this past year and a half.  They have lost more than anyone, including missing out on life milestones.  The president touched on two issues that are key for us to debate in the House and I would welcome our guests' comments and thoughts on this.  The first related to defence, the European defence union and the summit that she and the French President, Emmanuel Macron, will convene to discuss European defence policy.  That has always been a hot topic in Ireland and it has always provoked the most robust debate in the context of the treaty debates.  We do not have a unified approach to the matter.  Ms von der Leyen cleverly focused on cybersecurity and the new grounds where the threats are coming from.  She spoke about the ability to take down a country's health service from a laptop or smartphone and we know all about that here because we are still dealing with the fallout from the cyberattack on our health service and the impact on the victims of that, namely, patients who need those services.  I would welcome our guests' thoughts on what conversations are happening in the European Parliament on foot of those comments.  What are MEPs saying and what role do our guests expect to play in that conversation?<\/p> <p>The second issue to highlight in Ms von der Leyen's comments related to a minimum rate of corporation tax, another topic that is very much live in Ireland.  While the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform are very much pushing Ireland&rsquo;s agenda on that - we make no apology for that - Ms von der Leyen was clear in her calls for a minimum rate of corporation tax, and we know that would mean Ireland increasing its rate.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lisa Chambers:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We have to acknowledge that we are moving in a particular direction, which is fine, but I would welcome our guests' thoughts on her comments around that and where the European Union is going in getting buy-in from member states, given that we have a veto on that issue and how they might see that playing out for Ireland in the years ahead?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#CC00400","speaker":"1642","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Chambers for those remarks.

I welcome Ms Walsh and Mr. Markey to the Chamber.  As someone involved in representational politics as we all are, and as a former Deputy and county councillor, I do not know how anyone copes with the geographical size of our guests&rsquo; constituencies and the challenge of such diverse areas and how to represent them; I know that they are doing exceptional jobs in that regard.<\/p> <p>I will pick up on some of the points and I also agree that the perception of the European Union, going back to the EEC, was to ask what we could get out of it by way of direct transfers through Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, money for roads, cohesion funds, and all that was there.  That is understandable but it gave very high favourability and support ratings for the European Union, the EEC and the European Community at the time.  We still have those high figures but it has changed.  It has changed, whether that is the free movement, the Erasmus programme, opportunities that the EU provides, the Single Market, and CAP, which is still of great importance for our rural communities and particularly for the farming community.  I will pick up on two areas.<\/p> <p>Brexit, despite the atrocity that it is, has been very positive for the European programme and for people&rsquo;s perception of it in this country because the solidarity that was shown to Ireland, not just within the European Community but across every parliament, Prime Minister or Head of State over that period, was very impressive.   This solidarity was brought home to Irish people.  Sometimes whether it is Angela Merkel or whoever elses - not everyone can differentiate people sometimes - but people see European leaders standing up for Ireland and they see that solidarity, whether that is in the European Parliament or the European Commission.  That has been of great importance.  When Prime Ministers were talking about the Good Friday Agreement or the Irish Border, because of the work done by former Taoiseach Enda Kenny, the then Minister, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Simon Coveney, or our teams from the Department of Foreign Affairs or our ambassadors, they brought this message home.  The vaccination programme, as covered by Senator Chambers, has also been of great importance.<\/p> <p>Both MEPs have mentioned the Conference on the Future of Europe and the possibilities that holds for engagement with our citizens, and in particular, with our young people, in particular as this year is the International Year of Youth which is also of great importance.  Collectively as a Parliament and individually, I am sure our guests have plans to harness and promote that. <\/p> <p>Energy security is also an issue of great importance whether, as Mr. Markey has mentioned, it is the offshore potential - which is something I spoke about here yesterday - the Celtic interconnector. which is of great importance to France in the provision of energy security into the future, or the gas pipelines that will still provide needed energy for us.  It is something that needs to be further developed and explored because it is of such importance.  We have this continuing debate about data centres and they are important in respect of everything we do but energy security is also important.<\/p> <p>I compliment Ms Walsh on the humanitarian work that she is engaging in and I acknowledge its great importance.  <\/p> <p>The west and north-west region was downgraded a number of years ago to an area in transition, down from a developed area which is a worrying and retrograde step.  What is or can the European Commission or the European Parliament do with supports to bring us back to the level that we desire and need to be in?  Innovation and research is happening but is happening perhaps at a faster pace in other areas in other countries.  We have potential as to the technological university, which has been supported across all parties in the Houses of the Oireachtas, which may be a driver.  Great work is also being done by the Western Development Commission and the Northern and Western Regional Assembly which is important.  Partnering with other countries and other regions is also important.<\/p> <p>The CAP has been negotiated and I will not say that it has been put to bed because I am sure there is a great deal to do yet in the nitty-gritty of this policy.  Convergence is not an easy aspect of this within a constituency or a country, never mind within a county, in getting agreement on what is the best approach.<\/p> <p>Finally, I will mention the Trans-European Transport Network, TEN-T, which has been a concern over a number of years in terms of the opportunities there for investment.  It is not as clear-cut as some people would make it out to be in matching funds, or the large portion of funds that are required to draw down money under TEN-T, but perhaps our guests might comment on the opportunities there as well, please?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#DD00300","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Kyne for his in-depth speech where he has raised a wide range of very important issues which will emerge again in questioning and summations by our guests.

As our guests know very well, the EU has exclusive competence in negotiating international trade agreements for the bloc and the European Parliament, specifically, needs to give its consent for any agreement. <\/p> <p>More and more people are concerned by the economic dependence of so many countries in the world today on China and on the implications for the human rights of countless people of this intertwined dependence on China.<\/p> <p>I was recently looking for a toaster and went into a well-known supermarket chain and I turned its own brand toaster upside down and saw: &ldquo;Made in China&rdquo;.  I said to myself that I would like to deal with another country as much as possible, other than China.  I have nothing against the Chinese people but I am worried about economic dependence on China and the extent to which we were dependent on China for our personal protective equipment in the context of the battle against Covid-19, and so on.  I hope that people will learn the lessons that flowed from that.<\/p> <p>In any event, I looked at the next toaster which was a brand associated with an Irish company and I turned it upside down and what did I read but that it also was made in China.  People do not realise the extent to which we have become dependent on China, not just as a trading partner for the purchase of our goods - which I say as a son of the land myself as I am very conscious of China and other such markets for our agricultural produce - but when it comes to areas like healthcare, pharmaceuticals and drug-testing, there are many ways in which we have allowed ourselves to become greatly dependent on China.<\/p> <p>The danger is that the focus on trade is such that people forget to press hard for change in the area of human rights and the protection of human dignity.  The Seanad voted last year in favour of the Government here using all trade and diplomatic channels to put pressure on China to identify persecution of the Uighur people and other minorities.  It remains to be seen what the Government does in pursuit of that but there was a unanimous vote in this House on the subject.  Where do our guests stand on the EU-China trade and investment deal?  As the European Parliament needs to give its consent, what will our guests&rsquo; approach to that be?  Specifically, I ask our guests whether they would support the inclusion of ethical clauses in any agreements taking place in the context of that deal?<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Should we specifically ban the importation of products of Chinese companies that use forced labour, particularly forced labour involving weaker people but also any other kind?

I am aware it is connected to our economic welfare and trade agenda but the time has come for us to think globally about our security, including the security of the western world in the future.  I am thinking in the context of 5G but I am also thinking about whether our economic dependency on China has compromised us, not just in our ability to speak out and act strongly in defence of human rights and human dignity but also in respect of our very security in the longer term.  I would be grateful for the thoughts of our MEPs on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#DD00500","speaker":"1673","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I now call on the leader of the Green Party in the Seanad, Senator Pauline O'Reilly, whose voice is very important here in the context of some of the remarks that have been made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#EE00200","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":106,"content":"<p>Ms Walsh and Mr. Markey are both very welcome.  It is fantastic to be surrounded by my colleagues here today.  This gives us an opportunity not only to examine what it means to be European but also to work together on a regional basis, which we may not have done in the past.  For both of these reasons, I thank the delegates for coming along.  The meaning of Europe and the European project is about coming together to act as one in our mutual interest.  The same can be said of our parliaments and MEPs when they go out to Europe to speak, almost on our behalf or certainly on behalf of our constituents.<\/p> <p>Acting as one has always been key to green thinking but we must be careful to remember that with membership of a large bloc comes great responsibility on the global stage.  We talk about what we can get out of Europe but Europe also has an obligation beyond that.  I think about us as human rights defenders, which the MEPs have spoken about.  Ms Walsh has spoken very well about human rights and her passion for human rights.  We have to look close to home.  It is correct that domestic violence, which has not gone away and continues to be an epidemic, is part of a problem within Europe.  We felt somewhat hamstrung when it came to acting on some matters, such as Afghanistan.<\/p> <p>When we are considering changing what it now means to be Europeans and when we are having the conference, we have to go back to our core values all the time.  That means that while we must be human rights defenders, our doing so must be based on pacifism, our neutrality and our sense of self as a nation.  We must not be pushed into a stream that will ultimately see the destruction of Europe and go against the principle of being the responsible global citizen we are as a member of the EU and as a country.<\/p> <p>The environment is the next big challenge.  It is the current challenge.  There are 73 Green MEPs in Europe.  We do not have one in my constituency but both MEPs have spoken about the environment.  It is important to have these conversations because the environment is not about one party; it is about all of us now.  We all recognise that, not only in respect of the Common Agricultural Policy and all the funding that is available but also the broader issues concerning how we trade, which Senator Mullen touched on.<\/p> <p>The real danger with opaque institutions is that there can be unethical practices.  Trade deals must be borne in mind in this regard.  I must ask a question about Mercosur, in particular.  How will the MEPs vote?  We face a major environmental danger in this regard, as does the agriculture industry in this country.  Many trade deals are made in closed circles and the negotiations are conducted even before the proposals get to the European Parliament.  How do the MEPs believe we can manage that?  It is our responsibility.  If trade is an EU competency, how do we oversee it as a country to make sure that all the deals live up to our values as global citizens?<\/p> <p>My time is nearly up so I will ask some specific questions.  I am sure there will be some hard-hitting questions but this is a good opportunity.  It is the first of its kind.  This makes the Seanad relevant and makes the European Parliament more relevant to the people within our constituencies, who are looking to see whether their issues are being brought up.  This is a significant step.  It is one of several initiatives by the Seanad to give back and to be relevant to our citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#EE00300","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":107,"content":"<p>The MEPs will have summation time at the end in which they might address the global questions being raised by the leaders.

On behalf of the Civil Engagement Group, I welcome our colleagues from the European Parliament.  It is lovely to see them again.  This is about Irish and European parliamentarians.  It is both important and timely that we have the opportunity to discuss the role of the EU in addressing challenges such as the Covid-19 pandemic, the climate and biodiversity crisis, and the humanitarian crisis happening across the globe.  It is also an opportunity to discuss more broadly the ideals that underpin our Union and how they intersect with the challenges we face.<\/p> <p>Since the Covid-19 pandemic began, parliamentarians across Europe, including Oireachtas Members, have been calling on the European Commission to play its part in ensuring equitable access to vaccination and medical treatment in the global south.  Shamefully, the European Commission has continued to block a waiver under the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS, on Covid-19 vaccine technology at the WTO.  A TRIPS waiver is a key tool in the global public health emergency, and the blockage to waiving intellectual property rights is actively prolonging the pandemic.  The delivery of effective vaccines was not driven by the market but by large-scale public investment.  Vaccines were developed with public money and, therefore, should be treated as a public good.  I commend my European colleagues who have campaigned in favour of a TRIPS waiver.  I urge the MEPs present to advocate strongly for a change in the European Commission&rsquo;s position.<\/p> <p>As we begin administering booster jabs in wealthy countries, we must recognise that we are doing so when a large proportion of the global south remains unvaccinated.  Irishman Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO has compared this to giving lifejackets to people who already have them while others are allowed to drown.  Human rights principles are not being upheld and profit is being prioritised over human life.  This is one of the defining moral issues of this global pandemic.  So far, the EU has failed to act in a manner consistent with the principles of protecting public health and human rights.<\/p> <p>At the end of the summer term, the Houses of the Oireachtas passed the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill.  At the time, my colleague, Senator Higgins, said Ireland is starting late and should be starting stronger.  The same is true of the Fit for 55 legislative package.  It is vital that our colleagues in the European Parliament be given a stronger role in strengthening the European Green Deal agenda.  A 55% reduction in emissions by 2030 is welcome, but 55% should be the floor, not the ceiling.  We must be prepared and, indeed, planning to exceed that target.  It is also important that we should not enter agreements that will actively harm our ability to engage in climate action.  The recent ruling from the ECJ demonstrates that the kinds of cases being taken by the fossil fuel companies under the ISDS provisions of the Energy Charter Treaty are not compatible with the achievement of EU climate targets.  The European Commission has acknowledged that one of the main reasons EU countries have not left is the 20-year exit clause.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Frances Black:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2474\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This 20-year exit clause from the Energy Charter Treaty is similar to the exit clause contained in the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, a treaty that contains a rebranded form of investor-state dispute settlements, and which would have the same regulatory chill effect.  As parliamentarians we must oppose trade treaties that endanger our ability to tackle the climate emergency.<\/p><p>In respect of trade I must also emphasise to colleagues from this House and the European Parliament the need to ensure our trade does not legitimise violations of international law.  The occupied territories Bill I introduced in the Seanad in 2018 must be passed to ensure Ireland does not legitimise international law violations in illegally occupied territories and places such as Palestine and Western Sahara.  The Government's suggestion that the legislation would not be compatible with EU law is unfounded, given that in respect of Russia, sanctions relating to occupied Crimea and goods from there were found last year by the Court of Justice of the European Union to be legal within our trade law under the Rosneft ruling.  It was found it was a matter of public policy when human rights are being violated.  I urge colleagues in the House to support justice in international trade, and legislation that seeks to align public policy with human rights principles.<\/p><p>I finish by thanking the Members of the European Parliament for their attendance today.  I look forward to getting further opportunities to engage with them, as well as our colleagues from Dublin and Ireland South.  I apologise to Members as I must leave shortly and will not be able to stay for the answers.

There are counties affected including that of the Leas-Chathaoirleach, my county and right down to Louth, from which Senator McGreehan hails.

At the European level I urge that we keep Brexit on the agenda and ensure we give a bit of time to proposals that might address such issues.  That is very important.  The other key question is about creating structures that include the South and the North in a European context.  Europe as a whole does not really allow for engagement with regional parliaments.  We are looking at structures within the Good Friday Agreement and joint committee structures of the European Parliament to allow engagement at that level.  It is what is required to move things forward.  The small details can be resolved and there must be a focus in putting those types of structures in place.

There is great work to be done not just in the funding streams, including the &euro;5 billion reserve fund to be ring-fenced into further peace process work and conversations North and South.

We have to be careful about where we go on that.  We have always had a history, as other Senators touched on, and Europe as a whole has had such a history of being a leader in the moderate approach to world affairs.  It is about looking at where we can play a role within the UN in bolstering the power that is there and having a global response, rather than creating another superpower.  Superpowers have not served the world well and we need a pan-global response to address those issues.  The environment, food security and defence are where that debate is going.

The long-term future of Europe, it is said by many and seems to be borne out by the figures, is that we face a demographic winter with a massive decline in population.  Who will look after us in our old age?  Who will pay the taxes to fund the public services we will need?  What has the EU got to say?  What is its area of competence?  What role can it play or is it playing a role in addressing that question?  How do we reflect on the migration crisis of 2015 in the light of that question?  For many people, the decision of Frau Merkel to open the borders was about saying we need to fill the demographic hole through migration.  There is a solidarity argument for doing all that in the context of migration but is that the main answer or does the answer involve policies that encourage people to have children?  Is that a legitimate and important question for the EU?  Countries such as Hungary, which have been criticised for their attitudes to migration, have enlightened policies in assisting families to have children, giving them tax benefits and so on.

We have to look at Europe's place on the world stage and whether it be migration or dealing with economic circumstances of people in other parts of the world, Europe has to play a bigger part on that stage in supporting and giving people opportunity elsewhere.  That is part of what we have to do.  Whether that involves an element of migration or not will have to be looked at.<\/p> <p>There is another fundamental issue about supporting families, which the Senator talked about.  We have to support people's choice of lifestyles and facilitate such choice.  The pandemic has taught us a lot about people valuing other priorities that may not be just economic, such as time and family life.  We have to do more to support people in their family lives.  That allows people the opportunity if they choose to have family and makes it easier for them to do so.<\/p> <p>There is no doubt we are facing a demographic cliff and the economic challenges of that.  We have to ask why we are facing it and why people are choosing not to have bigger families or whatever.  As part of that, we have to look at supporting how we work, including remote working, which we all talk about in this day and age.  Childcare, for instance, is extortionate in this country.  I have two children.  One is four and a half and the other is two and a half.  I am well aware that across Europe these issues are there.  It is about a broader picture of how we support people in the lifestyles they have and the choices they make.  If they want to have bigger families, we have to support them in terms of childcare.

As the Senator has rightly pointed out, Northern Ireland is perhaps not getting a fair and full voice in that situation.  There are structures, such as the joint committee and other structures within the protocol and the Good Friday Agreement, that can ultimately give Northern Ireland a greater voice.  I do not think these structures are being invested in enough.  They have not received the recognition they deserve.

There needs to be a project group on that area alone which could focus on a type of regeneration of Northern Ireland and that is an opportunity.  One can talk about ambassadors or suchlike, but over two thirds of all businesses have identified this opportunity yet politics is lagging behind that opportunity.

We all referred earlier to the solidarity that Ireland received in the whole Brexit debate.  That is something we can certainly reflect upon as to the importance of smaller countries.  During the Conference on the Future of Europe debate, it is vital that the smaller countries still have a very recognised voice and are supported because they are the vulnerable ones.<\/p> <p>That brings me back to my point about the global response.  If one responds by allowing superpowers to dominate, vulnerable smaller countries are left behind, are exposed and frankly get rolled over.  We need to get away from the world of superpowers and China is now a superpower.  If we can get a global response and invest in institutions like the UN, as opposed to putting power blocs in place which undermine one&rsquo;s position, that is very important.  It is vital that we invest in a global response on issues as opposed to looking at having a vested interest in a superpower.  It is very important that we talk about this superpower scenario at a time when America is taking a step back and Europe is looking at where to go.  The Senator&rsquo;s question is very relevant.  In respect of China, which can be very different in how it approaches these things compared to how we would understand them in Europe, a response at European level needs to show, similar to Brexit, that we care for and put our arms around smaller nations.

I could not add any more to the remarks of Mr. Markey.  It comes down to ensuring the buzzword \"solidarity\" is not just a buzzword.  It is that the Commission and, in particular, the Council, are calling out these issue, that politics gets left at the door, and we are examining the issues, engaging with fundamental activists in human rights and ensuring communities are safe as a whole.<\/p><p>On the point made by Senator Mullen, there is a bigger conversation at play.  The European People's Party, of which I am a member, is discussing and formulating a paper on our future relationship with China, which I will relay to Senators because it will be the blueprint for how we support further countries such as Lithuania and Ireland.  I agree it is not just happening in one place; it is happening in many.  Lithuania just happens to be the most recent example of it.  From a committee base, we will discuss and debate it.  We have done so at the Parliamentary Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, LIBE, and I will work to see if we can get some sort of independent report based on that and feed it in to the Seanad.

We very much have to hold our position until such time as there is a universal consensus regarding where that is going.  There is another fundamental point in this regard.  There are other ways in which corporations have been supported by other countries.  One such way I was studying over the weekend is in personal taxes.  A corporation can pay its top executives who can then avail of tax breaks in some countries that allow them to avail of 2% personal taxation based on a classification such as a lack of IT skills in the country or whatever.  That creates an imbalance.  It is not appropriate to deal with corporation tax in isolation.  You have to consider the grant aid that is provided to countries and the way in which corporations can be supported indirectly by virtue of their employees getting a particular tax break.  There needs to be a broader response than just dealing with corporation tax on its own.<\/p> <p>On the point regarding Poland and Hungary, I agree that Europe needs to take a stronger line.  There are fundamental principles we in Europe believe in.  If countries are not complying with those principles, we need to take full or stronger action.<\/p> <p>The point regarding dementia is similar to the point I made regarding cancer care.  At European level, we have the resources to invest in certain key areas, of which cancer is one and dementia is another, such that we can advance research much more effectively than individual countries can on their own.

Mr. Markey could not have covered corporate tax better so, if the Senator does not mind, I will focus on the Article 7 proceedings against Hungary and Poland.  I speak quite a lot about both as I am a member of the bureau of the Parliament intergroup responsible for LGBTQI issues.  It is the largest intergroup, with more than 150 MEPs, which is very promising.  A large proportion of them come from centre-right or centre-left groups, including the EPP and the Renew Europe Group.  I believe it has taken too long to address this issue.  Article 7 proceedings should have happened in the previous mandate.  The fact we are allowing activists and community members on the ground to feel the impact again and again is testament, as a previous point made out, that society moves a lot faster than the political system, and that is a fundamental problem.  I know with both there is back and forth in terms of legal proceedings and written reports.  We are certainly keeping pressure on the Commissioner for Equality, Helena Dalli, and the President of the Commission to ensure that is not dragged on any further and we will see a real move on the issue this side of Christmas.<\/p> <p>Many of the questions in recent weeks and months regarding Article 7 have revolved around whether there will be another Brexit, but with Hungary and Poland leaving the EU.  I believe that will not be the case but what I flag with regard to Article 7 is that if we reduce funding, while that slap on the wrist will hurt the purse strings, I fundamentally believe it will also hurt the people we need to protect the most.  As such, some other sort of mechanism is needed, particularly in the context of women and girls as well as LGBTQI and other minority groups that are feeling the force of both the extremist Governments in question.<\/p> <p>On the point regarding healthcare and dementia, I know our colleague, Frances Fitzgerald MEP, is working quite closely on the care package in respect of the people who support those with dementia.

Lifelong learning has to become a part of our everyday work and study environment so that we are not just finishing secondary school or third level and then removing ourselves from the education stream.  That portal would ensure that it covers all 27 member states.  Someone from the Senator's constituency of Midlands&ndash;North-West could, therefore, travel anywhere across the EU and engage with and talk about the benefits of the European Union but also get skills he or she might not receive here in Ireland.

As someone who did not have the benefit of a third level university education, I place enormous value in the vocational educational system and on apprenticeships in terms of what they do for people who are not necessarily academic but are no less intelligent.  The system as we have it is very judgmental and disparaging towards people who do not go to third level education.  It is something we need to address.<\/p> <p>One thing that I always point out, which is very central to this issue, is that we should look at the amount of people in society today who started with an apprenticeship and run their own businesses.  They are some of the best entrepreneurs we have the length and breadth of the country, from the one-man van to the people who have more.  I deal with a couple of guys, one of whom is an electrician with 80 vans on the road.  That fellow started with an apprenticeship.  We have absolutely no respect for that type of education and where people can go from there.  We need to change that fundamentally.<\/p> <p>The Senator mentioned Macra na Feirme and rural Ireland.  To carry on the same theme, there are so many people in rural Ireland who do not necessarily go to third level university education.

It was about how we protect our own versus welcoming a fundamental loss, as the Senator said, into why we built the European Union.

Hungary and Poland were previously mentioned.  Since 2008, the anti-discrimination directive has been blocked by members of the European Council.  When we think about it so many years on, that is the cornerstone and fundamental foundation for what the Senator just shared in terms of the peace project, protecting minority groups, anti-discrimination and hate both online and offline.

As I mentioned earlier, with the change in the Afghanistan situation, the tone has been set from America and the like.  Europe has always been a considered voice on the world stage; a moderate.  It has always had a positive influence, probably borne out of its history.  Let us consider that the great wars were all in Europe and we hopefully learned much from them.<\/p> <p>I have a worry at this stage that this is changing somewhat and there is a need for us to go back to making sure, particularly from an Irish perspective, that our peacekeeping mentality is where we need to start from.  There is a need to set a world agenda, driven by Europe, that is not about a superpower or about militarisation.  It is about how we play the part of being that moderate but being proactive in terms of a response in somewhere like Afghanistan, where there are clear human rights issues and needs, and how we do that without just being another boots on the ground - I will not call it violent - military response.  We must in some way move away from the superpower model to a global model.  Europe is the very influence that can drive that agenda because we have never, as a bloc, gone down the strong military route.

We saw that through the EU-Covid digital certificate and now I hope a portal will be launched whereby they will have access to it, but there are still question marks around what takes precedence, citizenship or residency.

We ran a webinar in the early summer on remote working.  We worked closely with Grow Remote, which is a wonderful Irish organisation that is in 16 countries at this stage.  One of the key issues it identified was that 55,000 jobs across Europe were available remotely.  Anyone from anywhere could take up one of those jobs.  The question was what was their status in terms of paying tax.  Did they pay tax in the country they worked in or in the country where the company was based?  Multiple issues arise about tax in a remote working scenario in a European context.  That is something we identified, as have some of the organisations we have been dealing with.

That has led to some of the concerns that exist.  It leads to a broader debate.  It is not just about Covid certificates.  It is about the status people have with Irish citizenship who are not necessarily resident in a country.  I have a brother living in Spain who debates this with me every Christmas when he comes home.  It is very important that we look at the broader picture.  In other ways, it is an island-of-Ireland debate and we must look at how we can build consensus on wherever we are going in terms of an outcome that allows everybody to be part of something without being forced into it, and allows everybody's difference to be recognised as well.

I understand the resources in other countries is not the same as it would be in the European Union.  That still does not mean we leave anybody behind.  The question was asked by Senator Pauline O'Reilly of whether we are here as a building block of solidarity or if we are leaving.  I agree with what was said about any work we can do in terms of echoing that in the European Parliament.  She should please let me know.<\/p> <p>I wholeheartedly agree with her about Mercosur.  We cannot ask for perfection in the custodians of the land and ignore the fact that, first, climate disasters are happening in other countries, and fundamental rights are not being protected either.  I will be watching closely to make sure that the work we do as Ireland Inc. is also in sync.  Mr. Markey sits on the agriculture committee.  We make sure that we feed in any suggestions from constituents.  I will be going into any debates on Mercosur with a green perspective because green initiatives and mental health are two common threads we need to have on everything and we are not getting it within that package.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Ms Maria Walsh:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I believe in competition and we must figure out other markets that will benefit the European Union and Ireland Inc., but not to the detriment of the environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#LL00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Walsh.

As far as I am concerned, the only way we can solve the pandemic scenario is to deal with it in the context of a complete global response.  In that regard, there is nearly a more fundamental need to address the situation in third countries, or developing countries, than in the First World.  I voted against a TRIPS waiver.  It passed, but it has achieved nothing.  It was a symbolic gesture that allowed people to cleanse their hands and then state that they had done their bit and voted for a TRIPS waiver.  I do not believe that the TRIPS waiver provided the capacity to roll out the vaccines.  It did provide a patent.  However, we saw how difficult it was to deliver vaccines, even for the companies that designed the patents.  I think the TRIPS waiver is symbolic rubbish, frankly.  It is a fairly strong thing to say, but what we must do is invest in capacity in third countries or developing countries.  Europe has indicated that it is prepared to do that.  It has put 750 million vaccine doses on the table already, plus another 250 million, and this week it has again committed to providing another 200 million doses.  That is a real response.  Investing in the capacity to deliver vaccines in third countries and developing countries is what we must do.  The TRIPS waiver was a grand thing to vote through, but it delivered nothing.  It did not deliver any capacity to roll out vaccines on the ground.  My frustration with the TRIPS waiver stemmed from everyone voting for it, washing their hands afterwards and then saying our job was done.  Our job was not done.  We have much more to do in that area and I felt the TRIPS waiver was a distraction and a deflection from what we need to do in this regard.  <\/p> <p>I have only 11 seconds left.  Regarding Mercosur, an agenda exists that is, essentially, transplanting the rainforests from South America to Europe and food production from Europe to South America.  If we do not support industries producing food sustainably, we will allow our food to be produced in places where it is less sustainable.  Therefore, we must protect sustainable food production and the knowledge and research base that underlies that undertaking in Europe.  Mercosur does not allow us to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#MM00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Markey"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":164,"content":"<p>We will reverse the initial order for the two four-minute summations.

While I may not have given direct answers or feedback initially, I am honoured and excited by this engagement and the prospect of the next steps within the context of the building blocks we have laid down today.  I am not just excited for us in Midlands-North-West, but for all the other constituencies as well.  Ireland Inc. must be moving in solidarity in the European Union, right across the political spectrum.<\/p> <p>I will run through some of the points raised and start with those from Senator Chambers.  I agree with the Senator's comments concerning the committee report on Brexit.  I commend her on the ongoing work and conversations she has had in that regard and on ensuring MEPs were included in that process.  I refer to the blueprint to address the Covid-19 pandemic and solidarity concerning how to move forward in that regard.  The Senator made the point that citizens got excited about the EU and began to listen and learn a little more about the organisation in that context.  I flag my concern, however, regarding last week's state of the Union speech in respect of the line that Ursula von der Leyen took on defence.  We are a country of great accord.  Senator Chambers and I have experience in the Reserve Defence Force and Ireland has long experience with peacekeeping missions.  Peace in the European Union and throughout the world should never be forgotten and, therefore, we will be watching that aspect with bated breath.  I am looking forward to the conversation we will have in the European People's Party group next week and to seeing some more of the detail regarding the building blocks that Ms von der Leyen laid down in her state of the Union speech.<\/p> <p>I wholeheartedly agree with Senator Kyne's point about the perception of the EU and EEC.  There are many benefits.  Regarding Senator Chambers's point in this regard as well, there is much greatness coming out of the European Union, but there is a question concerning how we talk about the organisation except in the contexts of CAP and Erasmus.  How are we linking these elements?  Energy security was mentioned as well and I completely agree with those comments.  Energy security is especially important in our neck of the woods and warrants further exploration.  Working together with our councillors on the ground and in the context of different programmes, the Northern and Western Regional Assembly is applying for as many opportunities as possible in that context to help to bring the regions together and, essentially, to be as ambitious as we can for our Midlands-North-West constituency.  We are a region in transition, but that should mean we will have the scope to excel in the context of other funding opportunities.  I refer also to working with other EU member states to ensure we are drawing down as much as we can, while equally giving back as much as we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#MM00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":166,"content":"<p>Ms Walsh has one minute left.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#MM00600","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632303000,"counter":167,"content":"<p>That is fine.

We have relied on superpowers a great deal.  I do not know how that will play out.  I am keeping an eye on developing countries.  The infrastructure being provided by a superpower like China in that regard and our reliance on sourcing personal protective equipment gear in that context certainly put me into that space as well and caused me to have a similar outlook in this regard.  We will also discuss this issue as a group next week in respect of a paper on the future of China.

Senator Chambers referred to some of the matters we have covered in detail, including a minimum tax rate, defence issues and aspects of the pandemic.  The importance of agriculture did not come up much, nor indeed its importance as a multiplier in the local economy.  Where agriculture must transition to during the current CAP is something that we could have spent a little more time talking about, but I will be happy to talk about it any time.<\/p> <p>Turning to Senator Kyne's remarks, one aspect that I would like to pick up on, because it did not come up, is the Trans-European Transport Network, TEN-T, structure at European level in the context of transport in our region.  We benefit very little from that programme.  One thing which came to my attention in the transport committee, and which was initially brought to my attention by representatives of some of the ports in our region, is that the status of port traffic across Europe is measured by tonnage and passenger transport numbers.  However, ports have become much more diversified or will do so in future.  That will especially be the case if we develop offshore wind energy facilities off the coast of Ireland.  Ports will have to facilitate significant construction and service requirements in that context.  The method by which the status of TEN-T ports and similar scenarios in the wider transport network are gauged is not fit for purpose for our region in this respect.  We must focus on that matter.  <\/p> <p>Regarding transition, the TEN-T scenario is one of the elements in that context.  Investment in the agricultural sector, obviously, and the renewable energy sector has enormous capacity to regenerate a rural Ireland that would help to move our region out of its status as one in transition.  Those undertakings would be in addition to the European Green Deal agenda, which has the potential to bring about a great deal of investment in our town centres, in the context of energy conservation of buildings, for example.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Colm Markey:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Remote working offers us shorter transport commutes.  It also offers us the opportunity to reinvigorate small towns and villages in the region of the Midlands-North-West.  This is something very important that we could focus on.<\/p><p>In regard to Senator Mullen's remarks about protection of human rights and trade agreements, if we do not ensure human rights feature in all our trade agreements, apart from anything else, it is going to leave us at a competitive disadvantage, because if the standards we demand from our competitors are not equal to the standards demanded by the EU, then we are undermining the businesses which deliver the higher standards.<\/p><p>I can translate that argument across to environmental legislation and the economy.  If we do not demand from our competitors the same standards that apply in Europe for the food and the produce we produce, we are undermining our own industries which are doing things to the best standards.  It is critical in any trade agreement or policy going forward that we demand similar standards from developing countries and third countries, although primarily third countries because there are different considerations in developing countries.  We need to look at how that impacts on us at home.<\/p><p>Other points were made that I would like to pick up on, but time will not allow.  I will finish by saying that this engagement is very important.  It allows us to put on the issues on the agenda at a European level and it allows Members to put the issues on the ground onto the European stage.  I would like such engagement to continue into the future, if possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#MM01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Markey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":173,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Markey.

The purpose of this Bill is to give full effect to the Taoiseach's announcement on 27 June 2020 that education and welfare functions would return to the Department of Education.  These functions, namely, the functions vested in me, or under the Education Welfare Act 2000, and the administrative functions in relation to the administration of the home school liaison scheme and the school completion programme, were transferred to the Minister for Education by the transfer of functions order SI 588 of 2020, with effect from 1 January 2021.<\/p> <p>Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, is responsible for the delivery of these services under the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, through the Tusla education support services, TESS, and the alternative education and registration service, AEARS.  The Child and Family Agency Act 2013 currently provides for my governance and oversight of Tusla in respect of all Tusla functions.  This Bill is to provide the Minister for Education with appropriate powers to provide policy guidance, direction and prioritisation parameters for Tusla in respect of education welfare matters.<\/p> <p>Following approval by Government on 22 June 2021, I sought a waiver of pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill in order to publish it before the end of summer session, because the Bill is intended to provide the Minister for Education with the appropriate statutory oversight in respect of education welfare functions, which are exercised by Tusla, and does not represent any new policy objective.  The request for a waiver was approved by the Oireachtas joint committee on children at its meeting of 29 June 2021.  I now turn to the provisions of the Bill.   <\/p> <p>Section 1 provides the definition of the principal Act as the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, while section 2 provides a definition of educational welfare functions in respect of the Child and Family Agency and the Minister for Education.  Section 3 amends the principal Act for the purpose of including a reference to the Minister for Education into the standard expenses provision of principal Act.  Section 4 amends section 8 of the principal Act, which sets out functions of the agency.  It provides that the Minister for Education may request the agency to undertake or commission research into matters in respect of his or her education welfare functions and that the agency may give information, advice or make proposals to Minister for Education in respect of its education welfare functions.  Section 5 amends section 13 of the principal Act and provides the annual report of the Child and Family Agency shall include any particulars that the Minister for Education may require, and will be submitted to the Minister for Education at the same time that it is submitted to me.<\/p> <p>Section 6 amends section 14 of the principal Act by placing an obligation on the agency to furnish the Minister for Education with information that the Minister is likely to consider significant for the performance of his or her functions under the principal Act or otherwise.  The amendment further provides that the agency must provide information regarding any other occurrence or development that falls within a class of occurrences or developments that has been specified in writing by the Minister for Education, having regard to his or her functions under the principal Act or otherwise.  The agency shall when required by the Minister for Education submit a report on matters connected with the education welfare functions of the agency and specified by the Minister for Education.<\/p> <p>Section 7 amends section 15 of the principal Act to provide that the Minister for Education may require the agency to furnish certain information and documents where he or she considers it necessary in the public interest to so, for the performance of his or her functions under the principal Act or otherwise.  The agency is required to provide the information with any period specified by that Minister and in any event, without delay.  Section 8 amends section 16 of the principal Act by inserting references to the Minister for Education in order to enable the Minister to share certain information or documents received pursuant to sections 14 or 15 of the principal Act in the context of any examination or inquiry. <\/p> <p>Section 9 amends section 17 of the principal Act by inserting a reference to the Minister for Education for the purpose of enabling that Minister to use any information or documents furnished under sections 14 or 15 as he or she requires for the performance of his or her functions.  Section 10 amends section 18 of the principal Act by inserting a reference to the Minister for Education into the saver section, to clarify that nothing in sections 14 to 17, inclusive, limits the power of the that Minister contained elsewhere in the principal Act or otherwise to require information from, or issue directions to, the agency.<\/p> <p>Section 11 amends section 19 of the principal Act and provides that the Minister for Education will nominate a person to be a member of the board who, in that Minister's opinion, has experience of and expertise in matters connected to the education welfare functions of the agency.  This section further provides that the Minister will appoint the nominee of the Minister for Education no later than 24 September 2023.  Section 12 amends section 20 of the principal Act with a similar provision should a casual vacancy arise in respect of a board member with educational welfare experience appointed in accordance with section 19(2A).<\/p> <p>Section 13 amends section 21 of the principal Act, by providing that the board of the agency is accountable to the Minister for Education in respect of the performance of education welfare functions.  It places a requirement on the board of the agency to inform the Minister for Education of any delegation or revocation which relates to the education welfare function of the agency.  It further provides for the Minister for Education to issue directions to the board.  It also requires the agency to bring any matter to the attention of the Minister for Education that it considers requires that Minister's attention.  Section 14 amends section 29 of the principal Act.  The purpose of this amendment is to place a requirement on the chief executive to provide the Minister for Education with information that he or she may require relating to the performance of his or her education welfare functions and the implementation of that Minister's policies and priorities with regard to those functions.<\/p> <p>Section 15 amends section 40 of the principal Act.  The purpose of this amendment is to provide for a person making a disclosure of confidential information to the Minister for Education.  Section 16 amends section 41 of the principal Act and provides that the performance framework shall include such policy guidance, direction and prioritisation parameters for the preparation of the corporate plan of the agency as the Minister for Education in respect of his or her education welfare function shall provide.  Section 17 amends section 42 of the principal Act to provide that the corporate plan of the agency will accord with my policies and objectives, and those of the Minister for Education and the Government, as they relate to the functions of the agency.  The corporate plan will be submitted to the Minister for Education at the same time that it is submitted to me.  Furthermore, within the timeframe specified, the Minister for Education may, insofar as the corporate plan relates to the education welfare functions of the agency, issue directions regarding amendments to the proposed plan.<\/p> <p>Section 18 amends section 44 of the principal Act, by providing that the Minister for Education shall, in respect of the education welfare functions of the agency develop an annual performance statement.  This performance statement will provide the agency with specific policy guidance, direction, prioritisation and resource parameters, in respect of each year for the preparation of its annual business plan.  Section 19 amends section 45 the principal Act to provide that the Minister for Education will, in respect of the financial year of the agency, determine the maximum amount of net expenditure that may be incurred by the agency in respect of its education welfare functions for that financial year, and notify the agency of the determination of net expenditure in the context of the performance statement developed under section 44(1A).<\/p> <p>Section 20 amends section 46 the principal Act to provide that within the timeframe specified, the agency will submit a business plan to the Minister for Education prepared in accordance with the performance statement developed by that Minister.  The business plan must contain any other information specified by the Minister for Education in respect of education welfare functions of the agency and accord with the policies and objectives of that Minister as they relate to the functions of the agency. The Minister for Education may, in certain specified circumstances, direct the agency to amend the business plan.<\/p> <p>Section 21 amends section 47 of the principal Act and provides that the Minister for Education may, in respect of the education welfare functions of the agency, give an additional direction in writing to the agency with which the agency must comply.

This is a technical Bill, but it would be a mistake to think that it is not significant because it is.  One of the first things I called for when I was elected was that some of these services would move back to the Department of Education.  Having engaged, as a homeschooling mother for ten years, with some of the services in this area of Tusla it always seemed quite strange to me that things to do with education were put under Tusla.  That happened in the 2013 Act.  When Tusla was formed in 2014 a lot of these things came under the remit of the Minister for children, Deputy O'Gorman.  There was a period where there was quite a lot of stakeholder engagement with many parents and young people who were availing of some of the services.  There was no ability under legislation to do that through the Department of Education, which again does not make any sense.<\/p> <p>Nothing in the Bill changes the fact that parents are the primary educators, regardless of which service they are using.  They are legally entitled to home educate.  Several of these things are about supporting children and families who want their children to be in school but who are struggling.  The entire community is supporting them in their return to school or having an out-of-school experience that is related to the school community. <\/p> <p>I welcome the Bill.  From speaking to the Minister, I understand it is a tidying up operation.  I previously asked for some of the services to be moved back to the Department of Education, and that has already happened.  A difficulty was created when legislation was not in place to back that up and the current and future Ministers for Education did not have the powers required in order to be able to do the accounting, oversee stakeholder engagement and report properly on what was happening. <\/p> <p>We know that the pandemic has created a different kind of experience for families around education.  Having been chair of the Home Education Network, I know a lot of families around the country.  There has been a huge rise in the number of families who are home educating.  Apart from that, I know instinctively that there has been a rise in the number of people who have been struggling in school and have had difficulties.  Children have felt the brunt of the pandemic, and I would like to hear from the Minister in his closing statement what the Department has done in order to address that.  These things should be under the remit of the Department of Education because they are matters of education.  The Minister has a responsibility, which I know he takes very seriously, for the children who have fallen through the cracks over the past year. <\/p> <p>I will not list everything I believe the Government has done.  It is quite appropriate for the Minister to outline to Senators what he has done in that regard.<\/p> <p>I support the Bill and I hope it has cross-party support.  It is something that is already happening and legally could happen through statutory instrument.  In order for every child to get what he or she needs, we need to have this Bill in place to ensure that the Minister for Education can do her job in overseeing all of that work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#QQ00300","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":188,"content":"<p>The Minister is again welcome to the House.  This is a technical Bill providing the Minister for Education with a direct line for policy direction and oversight of Tusla in respect of its education welfare functions.  The functions vested in the Minister for Education in last year's statutory instrument cover the home school community liaison scheme, the school completion programme and the Educational Welfare Service, which make up the three strands of Tusla's education support service.<\/p> <p>Tusla stated that all three strands share the same national outcomes, that is, improved attendance, participation and retention.  In short, these programmes are about not letting children fall through the cracks.  That is the most important fundamental role of the Government.  We as politicians are transient custodians of this country and we bequeath it to the children of this country.  We have a duty to each child to allow him or her to reach his or her full potential through education.<\/p> <p>Whenever I think about education I am reminded of Plutarch's words, \"The mind is not a vessel to be filled but a fire to be kindled\".  While some filling is necessary in order to pass the leaving certificate, the system has rightly received renewed scrutiny in the past few months.  Would we all not rather a passion for learning be instilled in our youth?  Who will be better served by this inspiration then students who are at risk of not reaching their potential in the education system because of economic and social disadvantage and children and young people who have been identified as potentially being at risk of early school leaving, are out of school or have not successfully transferred to an alternative learning site?  They are the two target demographics of the schemes now under the remit of the Minister for Education.<\/p> <p>I speak with some experience on this issue.  Over the years many children have come into my home on an emergency or short-term care basis.  They may not have been in education and may have gone from house to house for a year or year and a half before they can find a forever home and, therefore, a forever school.  I am delighted to see this Bill finally going through the House and somebody taking the issue seriously. <\/p> <p>I understand social workers in Tusla are extremely busy.  One area over which I constantly fight with social workers is getting children into school.  They already have had disruption to their family life and having them pulled away from school life is another disruption for them.  It can be very traumatic.  <\/p> <p>I support the Bill and the Minister for Education in her very important task of looking after these children.  I hope she can cause our youth to receive the inspiration that can be so transformative in attitudes towards education and the experiences that our children have in our education system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#QQ00400","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.

I commend the Minister on the hard work he has been doing with Tusla to improve the service and on the funding allocated to the agency in budget 2021.  Tusla has a major role to play in the context of much of the legislation that will come through the Houses this session.  It is hoped that every social worker is adequately trained to deal with whatever need presents at the agency's door.  I ask the Minister to ensure that procedures are reviewed and that staff or upskilled and 100% aware of all of their responsibilities under this legislation and the proposed Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2021.  We heard from Aitheantas previously.  It recently published a report setting out the fears of members about having to go through the doors of Tusla and the Adoption Authority of Ireland because of their previous trauma, the lack of legislation and us, as a State, not catching up with their needs.  I hope that Government and State organisations such as Tusla can catch up with their needs, listen to them and make sure the system in place is more caring than structural and procedural.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#QQ00500","speaker":"1671","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister back to the House.  In the two days the Seanad has been back, he has been here more than I have.  I thank him for his commitment to always be in the House for Commencement matters, which is appreciated.<\/p> <p>I get the logic of this Bill.  There is no question about that.  It is wieldy, technical legislation.  I do not envy the Minister.  I want to address the education welfare issue with regard to homeschooling.  It is intuitive that all of that will be under the remit of the Department of Education.  However, I am taken by and committed to the Minister's leadership of the Department of Children, Disability, Equality, Integration and Youth and his vision, and that of the Department, in having all of those areas dealt with under one roof.  I am taken by all of the moves that he has made over the past year.  In some ways, it is counter-intuitive that in moving that welfare concept to the Department of Education we do not have the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, here to assure us that everything will be okay and that she will deal with the issue in the same way and with the same vision, although I have no doubt she will do so.  <\/p> <p>There are many technical provisions in this Bill.  My hope is that school attendance for children will be monitored and provided for in a holistic manner.  That begins with preschool.  It begins with our vision, the investment we make and the programmes we put in place at preschool level, as well as at school level and in respect of homeschooling.  This afternoon, many of us received an email regarding a particular case.  It is not unusual that we have children with special needs and disabilities who get only a couple of hours per week in school because of a lack of SNAs or particular provisions, the particular needs of the child, or some other reason and that this is deemed to be sufficient by the system, when it is not.  It is that child's right to have an education as well.  There are potentials for gaps where we have different Departments, that is, the Department of Education and the Department of Children, Disability, Equality, Integration and Youth, involved in the welfare of children and contributing to the issues as to why a child might not be fulfilling his or her potential and being given full provision when it comes to his or her education.  I am a little concerned about that oversight.  If Tusla is accountable to the Department of Children, Disability, Equality, Integration and Youth and to the committee that works with it, then we need to make sure there are no gaps.  We may need an interdepartmental group or meeting to which the Minister commits on an annual basis to ensure that we have that holistic provision for children which he has very well articulated in the last year.  <\/p> <p>Last September, the Tusla report on school attendance detailed the attendance for the years 2017 and 2018 and we saw that the schools where students were absent for more than 20 days per year were predominantly DEIS schools in Leinster.  It is shocking that more than 12% of primary school children were absent for more than 20 days.  While the number in respect of secondary schools was reducing, it was increasing for primary schools.  This is where the Minister's Department comes into play.  It is important that in childcare we prepare children for that socialising and experience.  For example, we can ensure that the First 5 vision is feeding into and being informed by the education welfare reports produced by Tusla on an annual basis.  The ECCE scheme, albeit welcome, is only operational for 38 weeks of the year.  We have come through a policy lab within Fine Gael on the care of the child at which this was a significant issue.  Children and parents do not disappear for the remaining weeks of the year.  This week, we have heard from Opposition members and the Minister that there are employees in childcare that are on unlawfully renewed fixed-term contracts each year under the ECCE scheme.  Those precious weeks where the ECCE is not operational could be preschool weeks wherein children are prepared specifically for the transition to school.  <\/p> <p>I am aware of the range and impressive qualifications of the staff within the education welfare area in Tusla but are they equipped for the hidden matters that contribute to absenteeism?  I am chair of a drugs task force.  In discussions at that forum, the professionals talked about identifying those factors within the home that will cause school absenteeism and the chaos for children in some instances.  It is important that there is an ability and skill set to detect that hidden harm and that this informs the holistic developmental and socialising of children in terms of their education and the inhibiting factors to their education.  The cessation of the community childcare subvention programme funding is having a particular impact in that regard on after-school services.  The Dublin 8 Afterschool Alliance has articulated well how the manner in which the 20 hours is allocated disproportionately affects the children in areas where absenteeism is very high and more likely to be an issue and that after-school support and provision may be the very thing that keeps them in school and part of that welfare package that supports those children.  <\/p> <p>I am seeking reassurance regarding the change.  While it is intuitive for the welfare aspect of Tusla to be governed within the Department of Education, I lament that movement away from the vision articulated by the Minister for his Department, which he has brought to fruition in the last year and which we all continue to work to under the programme for Government.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is important to make sure that no child is being left behind or falls through the gaps, whether he or she is from a particular area or has a particular disability.

I will not repeat what others have said but will focus my contribution on the school completion programme.  Sinn F&eacute;in will be supporting this Bill.<\/p> <p>As others have mentioned, the school completion programme was originally with the Department of Education but was transferred over to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs with the formation of the previous Government.  The programme is a fantastic resource and is particularly crucial following the closures that have taken place over the last 18 months.  It is clear that some students have been left behind while school buildings were closed.  Recent reports show that some 4,500 students and young people did not return when schools reopened following Covid-19 closures last year.  There is no doubt that contained within that number are vulnerable students who may have become disengaged through the closures.  While the Covid learning and support scheme, CLASS, recently announced by the Government is welcome, it does not go far enough to ensure that young people who are at risk of becoming disengaged are supported and included.  It is concerning that the Government thinks that potential regression can be reversed with a small number of additional teaching hours through CLASS.  This temporary increase in hours is not adequate unless backed up by ongoing investment.  Many schools that could benefit from the school completion programme do not have access to it due to the failure to expand DEIS, particularly band two, in recent years.  Without an increase in funding for school completion programmes, many students will be at risk of becoming disengaged from education entirely.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes that increased investment in the school completion programme is crucial to ensure that young people do not lose out, fall through the cracks and lose contact with education.

I echo the sentiments of Senator Warfield regarding the school completion programme.  I also commend the community homework clubs that are operating all over the country.  I will focus my remarks on the budget negotiations that Ministers are completing at the moment.  It is very clear that Covid-19 has disproportionately affected vulnerable students.  Educational welfare officers and home school liaison officers in constituencies such as mine have found that kids are either not coming back at all or have had to be provided with massive levels of support.  Last week the Dublin Economics Workshop discussed research conducted by the Institute of Fiscal Studies, IFS, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and Trinity College Dublin, TCD, that looked at the impact of school closures and the responses that policy makers such as the Minister could make in order to mitigate the impact on our most vulnerable students.  In their contributions, researchers said that over the course of the pandemic there was evidence of a widening of inequality, which affects our more vulnerable students, and of significant learning loss.  They also said that there were future challenges coming down the line in terms of high stress arising from unemployment of parents, particularly as the PUP is phased out and some industries do not come back.<\/p> <p>My party colleagues, Deputies Bacik and &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, have been campaigning for a catch-up fund for children in order to alleviate the worst effects of the loss of learning over 18 months when schools were closed.  Unfortunately, the Government recently announced that &euro;50 million has been allocated towards this, which equates to just &euro;50 per child to make up for 18 months of disrupted learning.  Compare that to the Netherlands, where &euro;2,500 has been allocated per child.  In the UK, the Tories have allocated &pound;1 billion, equating to &pound;85.47 per child.  While that amount falls far short of the &pound;3.5 billion that the Education Policy Institute in the UK calculated was needed, it is still much more than we have provided.  We know that educational disadvantage and inequality does not just last for the course of a school year but lasts a lifetime.  We also know that investing in children early, often and intensively reduces later rates of problems such as crime, unemployment, addiction and family breakdown.  <\/p> <p>The Bill before us is a technical one dealing with allocating responsibility for things that would naturally fit within the Department of Education and with Tusla personnel who would naturally be dealing with  people who are employed in that Department.  I ask that the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and the Minister for Education negotiate intensively for the allocation of a catch-up fund for children of at least &euro;100 million because the last 18 months might have a lifelong effect.  It is important that the State makes up for the 18 months of disrupted learning, especially for those children who did not have access to computers or data and who were sitting at home in freezing cold flats and houses trying to continue to learn.  My niece is a home school liaison officer in a school in the inner city and she has been dealing with the impact of that every day since the children returned in September.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#SS00300","speaker":"1672"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":195,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  While I acknowledge that elements of this Bill are very much technical in nature, I was struck by what Senator Seery Kearney said about the culture and leadership of the Minister.  It is very clear that the Minister has stamped his own ethos, ethics and style on his Department and has shown real leadership.  I share the hope that this will continue and that the culture the Minister has embedded over the last 12 to 18 months will persist.  I have no doubt that it will.<\/p> <p>Of course, it is appropriate that certain functions would sit with the Department of Education.  The home school liaison and school completion programmes have developed over the last number of years and have had enormous success in certain areas where they have been targeted and where resources have been made available.  We all have stories and examples of where the programmes have been successful but would also know of areas where they have been less successful.  We need uniformity in terms of both of those programmes because they are exceptionally positive and beneficial.<\/p> <p>Of course, legislation often needs to be tweaked.  If the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, in collaboration with the Minister for Education, finds that this legislation needs to be tweaked and that certain functions have to revert to him, we should not be shy about doing that because his Department performed these functions well when it had responsibility for them.  That said, it does make absolute sense that they would transfer and the fact that this legislation is getting cross-party support speaks volumes.  I welcome that and believe this legislation represents a move in the right direction.  I wish the legislation well but much more importantly, I hope the programmes continue to achieve what we all want them to achieve, namely to ensure that young people are protected, encouraged and ultimately achieve their potential.  <\/p> <p>Today the ESRI published a report on graduates with disabilities.  These are students who went through the education system, got a third level qualification, including in some cases 2.1 degrees, but cannot get employment.

I know from discussions with the Minister in the recent past how committed he is to the area of equality.  I believe actions speak louder than words. The Minister's actions in terms of equality and giving all our children protection, supports and belief speak louder than words.

I am pleased to hear the broad cross-party and cross-group welcome for the Bill in principle.  I listened carefully to what the speakers said and I will consider some of the issues they raised.  I will respond to a few of the Senators now.<\/p> <p>The day-to-day responsibility for these services has been moved to the Department of Education by a statutory instrument, as the Chair said earlier.  The essence of this Bill is to give a clear legal base or, as Senator Keogan said, a direct line from the Department of Education into Tusla on these specific functions so that the Minister for Education can appoint one of the board members.  There will, therefore, be reporting lines so that the Department of Education will have a clear ability to influence policymaking in this area.<\/p> <p>Senators Seery Kearney and Conway spoke about what we have tried to do in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in terms of the importance of integration and looking at issues in an holistic way.  I will be honest.  When I learned these functions were leaving my Department I was actually disappointed because I am interested in this issue.  I was chair of a board of management for a number of years.  We had a fantastic home school community liaison teacher.  The system worked very well.  The nitty-gritty of how it works and can bring in children and, probably just as important, engage with parents for whom English is not their first language or who were disenfranchised from the education system themselves.  All of that is important.  While I was somewhat disappointed to see that leave my Department in terms of the policymaking role, it is important that my role in the oversight of Tusla and its general operations will now, I believe, be enhanced by the role of the Minister for Education.  As a number of Senators have said, the natural place for the responsibility of these services to rest is with the Department of Education.  However, there will be close and ongoing co-operation with my Department in that context.  This Bill allows for an integrated approach between the two Departments and Tusla.<\/p> <p>On the issue of Tusla and its wider role, which Senator McGreehan raised, I have just come from my quarterly meeting with the chief executive and a number of board members, including the chair.  We had a detailed discussion on a range of issues.  Tusla is an agency that is very much in transformation.  It has had difficulties; that has been accepted.  I have great confidence in its leadership team: Bernard Gloster, the chair and the board.  I see huge ambition to implement the transformation document that was drafted a number of years ago.  I am doing whatever I can to support them in doing that.  In terms of other issues which it is hoped we will deal with in this term, we discussed information and tracing.  I am very conscious of, and we discussed the importance of, the need for a range of skill sets beyond the very important social work skill set to deal with the additional workload the agency will have in information and tracing, and that is not the only necessary skill set in genealogy and identification, particularly for the tracing element.  That discussion is ongoing and an area I have confidence in.  I reaffirm my strong confidence in the transformation being seen in Tusla as an agency.<\/p> <p>All of what we are talking about is in the context of Covid.  Senators quite rightly raised the issue of the supports the Government is putting in place.  Senators Warfield, McGreehan and Moynihan referred to them.  The additional teaching hours are very important.  I have visited several primary schools in my constituency in recent weeks.  Principals are excited about the allocation and the degree of autonomy we are giving schools to identify the subjects and the students who need those additional supports.  They are not the only available supports.  The Department of Education has provided additional supports.  Last September, significant additional supports in the area of well-being were provided when students were coming back after the long gap away from schools.<\/p> <p>A number of Senators asked what I have been doing in my Department about this.  I am doing my best to support youth services, initially in terms of new guidance, so that indoor services in particular can get back up and running as we go into October and November, when weather will not permit outdoor youth services.  On financial support, we also gave an additional &euro;5 million last year.  I know additional supports are being sought this year.  I will do my best in the context of the budget to deliver that.<\/p> <p>As regards research we are doing on the impact of Covid on young people, a good piece of research was conducted in conjunction with mental health charities last year.  This was the SpunOut How's Your Head piece of research.  In addition, the Growing Up in Ireland longitudinal survey was conducted.  It was a significant survey with thousands of young people surveyed at various times of life.  That has been very beneficial to us by giving us information about the impacts on them.  As a result of those groups being surveyed successively, we can compare like with like and see the immediate impacts.  We are using that research to engage with Government colleagues in terms of the wider Government responses.<\/p> <p>Senator Moynihan raised the issue of youth unemployment.  My Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science will engage later this week with a range of groups about the issue of youth employment.<\/p> <p>Senator Conway mentioned unemployment affecting persons with disabilities.  That partially falls within the remit of my Department.  We will introduce the assisted decision-making (capacity) (amendment) Bill later this year which will be important in getting the decision support service up and running.  That Bill will also increase the obligation on public services to employ persons with a disability.  The current level is at 3%.  We will double that to bring it up to 6%.  That will be tough because the public service in total is at a level of just over 3% at present.  We are, therefore, setting an ambitious target which all State agencies and bodies will have to work hard on to deliver.  That is one part of the answer to the important issue of employment of persons with disabilities.<\/p> <p>On the subject matter of the Bill before us, as Senators will know, the National Educational Welfare Board merged with Tusla on its establishment in 2014.  The educational welfare responsibility is now fully integrated into the whole of Tusla approach to service delivery for the protection and welfare of children.  Having educational welfare services within the Tusla service structure gives the Tusla education support service, TESS, immediate access to expertise and a wide range of supports to meet the presenting needs of children and families referred to both TESS and the alternative education and registration service, AEARS.  I believe that is the integrated approach a number of Senators referred to.<\/p> <p>It is important the critical links and synergies developed between TESS, AEARS and the other key areas within Tusla continue to be enhanced and developed to strengthen the supports to vulnerable children in the educational context.  In addition, it is important that critical links and synergies are developed between TESS and AEARS and other key services under the remit of the Department of Education to enhance and develop the supports to vulnerable children in the educational context.  This Bill provides the Minister for Education with the appropriate statutory oversight for educational welfare functions carried out by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  My Department will work with the Department of Education and Tusla to support this objective with the core principle of the best interest of the child.  I look forward to engaging further with Senators during the passage of this Bill through the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#TT00300","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1632303000,"counter":198,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":199,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#UU00100","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":200,"content":"<p>Next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#UU00200","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":201,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

This offence, in this Bill, would carry a maximum sentence of ten years imprisonment.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lisa Chambers:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Earlier this year, two very brave women, Una Ring from Cork and Eve McDowell from Sligo, both victims of stalking, came together to campaign for a change in the law in this area that would make stalking a stand-alone offence.  They both drew on their own lived experience of being victims of stalking and highlighted the deficiencies in Irish law and the inadequacies in the justice system they had to go through to bring their perpetrators to justice.  I heard both women on the radio a number of months ago as I was driving to work in Leinster House, and I was struck by both of their ordeals and what they had been through.  I was even more struck, as a legislator and as a lawyer, that such a law did not exist.  I was not aware that we did not have a stand-alone offence of stalking and was quite taken aback by that.  I felt that, in this day and age, this was a clear omission on our part and this was a gap in the law that we should close.  Had I not heard both women on the radio and had they not started their campaign, this Bill would not be here today, so I want to commend both of them for the campaign they set up.  We would not have the Bill we have on Second Stage Bill at all if it was not for their immense work over the past number of months.<\/p><p>Thankfully, both of their attackers are now behind bars in jail, but for a relatively short period, given the ordeal they put their victims through and what both Eve and Una are continuing to have to live with as a result of what they experienced.  I ask Members to reflect on the experiences of both women and the many other women victims of stalking in this country, and to ask themselves whether the current laws are sufficient.<\/p><p>In Una's case, she knew her attacker through the workplace.  They were not friends as such, but they were colleagues at work in a normal work relationship.  That changed over time and it became an obsession and a fixation, where he moved job but he lured her to his place of employment.  Then the text messages and telephone calls started.  That did not get him where he wanted to get to and she quickly rebuffed his advances, but he then proceeded to escalate his behaviours.  He spray-painted her car, he spray-painted her house and he left messages.  He sent her letters outlining what he was going to do and what she was going to put up with.  Thankfully, Una had a very good response from garda&iacute; locally in Cork, who took this seriously.  It resulted in garda&iacute; camping outside her house between midnight and 5 a.m. every night to keep her safe.  Ultimately, her attacker arrived at her home with a rape kit - a dildo, crowbar and rope - with the clear intention of doing serious harm and potentially taking her life.  Thankfully, he was caught but he will serve less than four years in prison for what he did.  Meanwhile, Una will live with the impact of this for much longer.  I pose the question: does the word &ldquo;harassment&rdquo; cover that?  I suggest it does not adequately cover what she has been through and the seriousness of the crime.<\/p><p>The other co-founder of Stalking Ireland is Eve McDowell.  Each situation is so unique and different.  Eve was in college in Galway.  She lived on the same campus as her attacker but they did not know each other, they did not have a prior relationship and they had never gone out or anything like that.  He took to following her around, never with any direct contact, unlike the previous case.  He was not messaging, he was not calling, but he was coming into the shop where she worked.  Then he stopped coming in and was just walking around outside all day.  She ended up having to leave her job.  He then ended up hanging around outside her house in the bushes.  He shaved off his hair, his eyebrows and his beard.  He tried to break into her property a couple of times.  No statement was taken and nothing was done about it until one evening when her friend was sleeping on the couch in the apartment because she had forgotten the key to her room.  That friend had opened the balcony doors to let some air in.  The next thing, there was a creak on the floorboards and there he was, in the house, with a hammer.  He attacked her friend with the intention of getting into Eve&rsquo;s bedroom.<\/p><p>Again, I pose the question: does the word &ldquo;harassment&rdquo; cover that?  I suggest it does not.<\/p><p>We have a poor track record in this country of listening to victims and framing our response in the terms that they have set out, and a poor track record of listening to women.  This is predominately a women&rsquo;s safety issue.  I attach a caveat to that as, of course, stalking can affect men and women, and it is estimated that one in ten victims is male.  However, women are predominantly the victims and men are the perpetrators.  We have to listen carefully to what these women are telling us.  It is not just Una and Eve.  Because of the campaign they started, they now have almost 11,000 signatures in support of this legislation.  The very least we can do, as legislators, is to listen and take action.  I have no doubt I will have the support of this House in doing that.<\/p><p>In terms of why this legislation is so important, the response from the Department of Justice until this evening - obviously, we will wait to hear the Minister of State's response to this debate - has been that the current harassment laws are sufficient because, for want of a better phrase, they were beefed up last year and there is a stronger sentence of up to seven years.  However, words matter, words have impact and words have a meaning.  By using the term &ldquo;harassment&rdquo;, we minimise the seriousness of the crime and we minimise the experiences of the victim.<\/p><p>Even more than that, the Law Reform Commission, LRC, had recommended in its \"Report on Harmful Communications and Digital Safety\" in 2016 that this become a stand-alone offence in law.  It expressed a view that consideration should be given to having a stand-alone offence of stalking in Irish law for good reason.  It looked at other jurisdictions, in particular at England, Scotland and Wales, where this has been law for more than a decade.  It looked at the impact of having enacted those laws in those countries.  To take Wales as an example, between 2014 and 2018, because of the enactment of a law providing for a stand-alone offence of stalking, there was a trebling of reporting of stalking offences in that jurisdiction.  If 2019 is compared with 2015, there was a doubling of charges brought against perpetrators for those types of offences.  Straightaway, we see a very real impact in terms of the level of reporting, of victims coming forward and of that carrying through to charges being brought and then prosecutions, and people getting the justice they deserve from the justice system.  That is why the LRC recommended that we follow suit and do the same.  Unfortunately, the Department of Justice did not act upon that and is still today failing to act upon that recommendation.<\/p><p>We also know from victims that their experiences with garda&iacute; and the justice system fall short of what we would all like to see happen.  In Una&rsquo;s case, she had a very good response.  Garda&iacute; were on-site, they were at her house and they were so helpful, giving their mobile numbers and saying, &ldquo;Call me anytime&rdquo; - it was really an &ldquo;above and beyond&rdquo; response.  The same could not be said in Eve&rsquo;s case, where, repeatedly, she was calling the Garda station, having to explain herself every time, and trying to convince somebody that she feared for life, and she was right to fear for her life.  We need to have a uniform approach across An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is going to require additional training to make sure that every garda is up to speed on what stalking is, what it means, the seriousness of the offence and how quickly it can escalate.<\/p><p>One of the points Eve and Una have constantly made regarding the difference between harassment and stalking is that we should look to the intent of the attacker.  What is the intent of a harasser and what is the intent of a stalker?  The endgame is very different and that shows the clear distinction.  Stalking is going up a notch in terms of seriousness.  Let us take, for example, the laws on assault.  There are different degrees of assault and they are clearly laid out in different sections of legislation because one section cannot cover the entire spectrum of offences.  The same can be said for harassment legislation.  It cannot cover everything from unwanted repeated text messages to entering someone's home with a rape kit with the intention to kill him or her.  It is too much for one section to cover.  That is why we need a stand-alone offence of stalking.<\/p><p>We will see a very different attitude and a very different approach from the Garda and the Judiciary when there is a separate offence of stalking.  Straightaway, we are saying we attach a higher seriousness to this.  Straightaway, garda&iacute; will know that this is a bigger deal than perhaps text messages, although I am not minimising that because everything has a psychological impact and stays with the victim.  Similarly, when it goes before the Judiciary, if a prosecution is being brought for stalking as opposed to harassment, straightaway, the judge is on notice that this is a more serious crime because they are bringing forward a case under this section as opposed to the lower of offence of harassment.  It has an impact on the attitude of all of the arms of the Judiciary and the Garda, and on the attitude of the public.<\/p><p>To conclude, I have been struck by the bravery of Una Ring and Eve McDowell, who have, time and again, had to recount their ordeals on various media platforms, and to friends and family, just to lay bare everything they have been through and the impact on themselves.  They got their day in court, they will say.  It was partial justice, in my view, and I think they will agree with that.  In Eve's case, her perpetrator was charged with aggravated burglary because it was the most serious offence they could get him on, which means he is now in prison for just that incident in her home, but nothing in the run-up to that, and that has had a significant psychological impact on her.  We are now at a position where we can help other potential victims not to have to go through the same ordeal again, which is very important.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lisa Chambers:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->If I could ask for one thing from this debate, it is that we should not repeat the mistakes of the past.

I am proud to second this reading of the Bill by Senator Lisa Chambers.  I start by paying tribute to Una Ring and Eve McDowell.  I had the pleasure of meeting them personally today.  I have heard them give such brave testimony in the media.  Their courage, strength and generosity are incredible.  They have endured terrible ordeals and somehow found the strength not only to cope with that and to move forward personally but to actually give further of themselves to other victims and to broader society.  It is our great honour and privilege to be here in the Seanad with the Minister of State, to put this Bill before him and to ask him to take it to Government and to champion it for Una, Eve and all of the victims whose names will never be known to many of us.  I start by paying tribute to them.<\/p> <p>The Bill is about stalking and harassment.  Senator Chambers eloquently explained the difference between harassment and stalking.  I heard Eve describe it this morning as being fixated.  It is behaviour which is fixated, obsessive, unwanted and repeated.  Those words convey the intrusive, insidious violence of it as an activity and how it manifests in being followed, watched or observed.  Your personal space or identity are intruded upon and invaded.  That is before it gets to the actual physical threat.  It is a horrendous situation for any human being to be threatened with.  I firmly believe that we need the law to recognise this as a particular crime.  It causes alarm and distress, both mental and physical, for the victims and for everyone who cares for and loves them.<\/p> <p>We as a society should all be distressed and want it to be recognised as a crime in our society and in our law.  There would be many benefits to it being criminalised.  It would be simple to call it out as a crime, not something to be dismissed or to be confused as being odd behaviour.  It is a crime.  We need to say that as a society and our laws should say that it is a crime.  That will send a clear message to anybody who is thinking about acting in an antisocial way towards another individual that they need to think twice.  It also sends a strong message to the statutory and non-statutory authorities.  We heard Una talk about how great the support that she got from the garda&iacute; was.<\/p> <p>Youghal is a beautiful seaside heritage town and a place where people go for their holidays.  When I first heard about it, I said, \"Wow, that is happening there.\"  Eve talked about Galway.  It is a town where many young people in Ireland go to university and it is a tourist destination.  These are the heart of Ireland.  These are not dystopian, remote places.  These are the heart of our communities.  We need to ensure that stalking is a criminal activity in the heart of every community in our country.  Every garda needs to be trained to understand that.  Every garda needs to be equipped and resourced to respond to victims or potential victims of stalking.  It is important that, in progressing this legislation and stating that stalking is a criminal activity, that we as a society are not only calling it out and ensuring that it is not hidden, dismissed and passed over, but that all of the survivors are empowered, supported and valued.  All those who are charged with enforcing our laws should know that this is something that we want to tackle, that we will support, resource, train and equip them to tackle and criminalise this activity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#BBB00200","speaker":"1656"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":213,"content":"<p>Stalking is a clear example of a crime which has become all too common, facilitated by the rise in communications technology.  The word no longer conjures up images of hooded figures in dark alleys but of inboxes spammed with messages, private social media accounts being bombarded with comments, identity theft, phone calls and more.  There has been a move over the past decade or so to an online life, which has been made more drastic by Covid and has led to many victims of stalking being unable to escape their tormentors.  It is a depraved and destructive behaviour which can cause severe distress to a victim and leave a lasting negative impact which may not fade even when the behaviour stops.  As such, it is appropriate that we legislate to dissuade and punish such behaviour.  It is also true that we must be extremely careful with new criminal legislation.  Imprisoning someone is not a decision which should be made lightly.  We owe it to the people and the courts to make sure that the legislation does not catch other, less serious behaviour in its definition of stalking behaviour while also ensuring that in those cases where legitimate stalking is taking place, a conviction can be secured.<\/p> <p>As has been mentioned, the creation of a specific stalking offence was a recommendation of the Law Reform Commission in 2016.  It differentiated it from harassment based on an element of intense obsession or fixation which creates unwanted intimacy between the stalker and the victim.  I do not speak about these things in any abstract sense.  I am sure that I am not alone in that.  My nightmare started on 23 August 2013 and it went on for two and a half years.  The garda&iacute; tried their best to try to get the person who was making the calls to me.  I got up to 92 calls one day.  It really destroys your life.  No matter where I went, this individual knew exactly where I was.  He knew what I was wearing.  He knew whose company I was in.  He would ring friends to see if I was with them if he could not get me.  I welcome this legislation but we need to resource the garda&iacute; better to deal with such cases.  Nothing could be done in my case because the person making the phone calls did not own the phones that the calls were being made from.  He got away with it on that basis.  He put me through two and a half years of hell and he got away with it.  That should not happen.<\/p> <p>One concern I have with this legislation is with the difficulties that may be encountered where the existence of a crime is based on how events are perceived or experienced by an individual.  I trust that as this Bill passes through the House, we will strike the correct balance in this regard in anticipation of cases which may not be as clear cut as others.  I think of subsection (3)(g) lists \"interfering with the property of a person\" as an example of stalking behaviour.  While one can certainly think of instances wherein such an action would be stalking behaviour, it is easy to envisage where such behaviour could be more innocent.  Likewise, the persistent nature of any activity is instrumental in a behaviour being a stalking behaviour, yet the list of defined stalking behaviours only refers to this in the first of its eight examples, which could have serious legal ramifications.  I have no doubt that these issues will be explored in detail and dealt with over the next stages of the Bill.  I look forward to working on it.  I commend Senators Chambers, Fitzpatrick and McGreehan on bringing it before the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#BBB00300","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Keogan for sharing her story.

I commend my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues on bringing forward this important legislation.  I commend the bravery of Una Ring and Eve McDowell in sharing their stories and speaking of their horrific experiences.  There is no doubt that coming forward and creating the lobbying of Stalking Ireland is advancing the case.  It is right we start to parse down that sense of entitlement others have to interfere with the free movement and living of another individual as a means of control and aggression.  There is no other way to interpret it.  The Senator is absolutely right that harassment does not go anywhere near describing what this could be and the experience of this for people.<\/p> <p>Prosecutions for stalking, under the guise of harassment, have repeatedly failed to hit the bar and we have a very low number of prosecutions for that reason.  We take it that stalking is a way down the road toward what can be the inevitable consequence, that being the homicide of an individual.  Yesterday morning, I listened to Newstalk as the outcome of its recent survey on women and their sense of safety at night was talked about.  The shocking result that 90% of women were uncomfortable being out alone after dark is an appalling statistic.  In that discussion, it was said that the biggest fear men have is that women will laugh at them.  As someone who has been a counselling psychologist and counselled men coming through domestic violence and being the victims, that is not the only fear that some men have of women, but the real issue talked about yesterday was that the biggest fear women have is that they will be killed.<\/p> <p>In 2019, Women's Aid published a report on a legacy of loss to femicide, which showed rather frightening statistics.  Since 1996, when Women's Aid started collating its figures, 230 women have died violently, including 16 children who were killed alongside their mothers.  Almost two thirds of the women were killed in their own homes.  One hundred women were murdered by their current or ex-partner, another 20 women were killed by a male relative, and 37 were killed by men who were known to them.  In the murder-suicide cases, of 21 of these, it was a current or ex-partner of the victim.<\/p> <p>We need to take very seriously that women live in the fear that their lives will be ended by this individual.  Calling it stalking and having a serious penalty attached to that is very important.  It is incredibly important we have that on our Statute Book and that the Garda and all services recognise just how serious it is.  It is unacceptable that, as you read the reports and the victims' experiences, people feel that when they first talk about it, it is dismissed, said to be just a bit of attention and their experience is minimised.  Bringing it forward and having it on the Statute Book as a stand-alone offence frames in all our minds that we should take seriously that repeated unwanted attention can very often lead to something significantly more sinister.  It is unacceptable that women, in particular, live in fear of their lives and that any other person could exhibit that level of control and aggression.  Stalking is an extremely aggressive act.  I commend the Senator and there is absolute support from the Fine Gael group in bringing this forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#CCC00200","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":216,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and thank the Fianna F&aacute;il Senators for bringing this forward.

What we bring to the floor of this Chamber is our experiences and those of the people to whom we speak.  I commend Senator Keogan on sharing her experience, and I commend Una Ring and Eve McDowell.  Legislation such as this does not come out of thin air.  It is not that a person has a great idea and decides to put forward legislation.  These are real lived experiences put down in words on which somebody can act.  The important thing to remember about the law, especially criminal law, is that it is there to protect people.  Garda&iacute; can only act when there is a law in black and white in front of them.  In some cases, what prevents garda&iacute; from acting, or feeling they can act, is a lack of certainty around whether something is a crime.  That is why it is important we have something that specifically talks about this insidious behaviour which is stalking and which is different from harassment.<\/p> <p>There has been no explanation as to why the Department has not stepped up to the mark when it comes to stalking, especially in light of the fact the Law Reform Commission has recommended this legislation and other jurisdictions have it.  I find it baffling that Ireland is not stepping up to the mark and I commend the Senators on bringing it forward.  I look forward to the Minister of State's comments and hope things have changed.  They may have and I know there will be cross-party support.  If the politicians have to drive this and push the Department, that is what we will do.<\/p> <p>Ireland has changed.  We have had the Citizens' Assembly on gender this year, which has shown there are clear failures, but also that the citizens and those living in this country want change and a recognition of women's place in society.  It is quite right to say it is not only women who are impacted by stalking.  I know men who are experiencing this and, throughout the years, I have known many women who have experienced it.  It is, for the most part, gendered because of power and a patriarchal system.  Stalking fundamentally comes down to control, in my layperson's view.  To any victims who are watching this, our thoughts are with them and we will do all we can to ensure this legislation goes beyond today and we see a clear response from the Department of Justice on this very important issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#CCC00300","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":217,"content":"<p>Gabhaim mo bhu&iacute;ochas leis na molt&oacute;ir&iacute; as an mBille seo.  I welcome the Minister of State and commend the proposers of this legislation because, as has been said so eloquently by colleagues, there is a need for it.  In listening to the powerful testimony from Senator Keogan, it certainly touched on the reasons it is necessary and, in what was a powerful and convincing contribution from Senator Chambers, she laid out the extremes, for want of a better term, of why legislation such as this is necessary for victims.  I again commend the proposers of the Bill and all of those who have campaigned.

In saying that I do not want to take anything away from any of the other contributions tonight, including my own.  Second Stage affords us the opportunity to make contributions such as this.  I am keen, in the short remarks I will make, to get beyond that.  Hopefully, the Minister of State will respond positively and proactively from the perspective of the Department, for all the reasons outlined earlier and all the reasons we know, and we can get this on the Statute Book and not only assist victims but perhaps more important, get perpetrators off the street and punish them for what they are doing and what they are responsible for.  I beg the Cathaoirleach's pardon.  I was not able to print my notes so I will be working off my phone.  I do not like doing that but there we go.<br\/><br\/>This Bill is a welcome addition to the measures in place to deal with the intimidation and harassment of individuals by others that takes place for many and varied reasons.  The top and bottom line is that individuals who experience this unwarranted intrusion into their lives need to be protected by the law from their assailants.  This Bill sets out a specific offence of stalking, characterised by repeated unwanted behaviour that occurs as a result of fixation of obsession and causes alarm, distress or harm to the victim and provides for related matters.  During the debate on the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020, organisations such as the NWCI and Women's Aid noted that we need a separate offence of stalking in addition to existing laws around gender-based violence and abuse and this Bill addresses that gap.<br\/><br\/>Under the current law, some of the behaviours that currently constitute stalking are not, <i>per se<\/i>, illegal.  These can include behaviours such as the installation of spyware on a partner's computer or mobile device as well as persistent use of the Internet by a stranger to harass and stalk an individual through impersonation or the use of other computer-based tactics.  This Bill will be a welcome addition to the Statute Book, which is starting to catch up and legally protect women who are experiencing the frightening attention of a stalker but of course, as we all know, we still have some way to go.  Although legislation is progressing, it is not the sole element in combating stalking and similar behaviour.  Education, resourcing and trainign for garda&iacute;, which many Members have referenced, as well as restorative justice programmes and portrayals within popular media are also of importance.  Reality needs to be the benchmark against which the law is made effective and stalkers must face the full rigour of it.  Too often, cases have been before the courts and have been presented as perpetrators being besotted with or love-struck by their victims.  The reality is that many of these cases occur with no romantic contact or, indeed, any contact between the victim and the perpetrator.  Often the victim has the misfortune of coming to the casual attention of the stalker.<br\/><br\/>The Bill is expansive in its provisions.  One notable aspect is that it extends to a victim's pets.  This is welcome as pets are frequently the target of stalkers and are kidnapped, injured or killed.  Family members being targeted is also a feature of many stalking incidents.  The provision regarding any means of communication is also crucial.  Combined with the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act, there should now be few behaviours currently used by stalkers against victims that are not in some way caught by this Bill.  If enacted, the legislation should be subject to frequent review so that its practicalities and the degree to which it can be used can be clear.  I am sure colleagues would support me in that.  The strength of the Bill and its ability to protect the victim and punish the stalker is to be found in its all-embracing and comprehensive provisions.  For that reason and many others, Sinn F&eacute;in will support the Bill. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#CCC00400","speaker":"1688","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":219,"content":"<p>We in the Labour Party welcome this Bill and I thank the Fianna F&aacute;il Senators for bringing it forward.  As we have heard from a number of accounts and from reading the LRC report, stalking is a deeply insidious and appalling violation of a person's dignity, safety and security.  I pay tribute to Una Ring, Eve McDowell, and, indeed, Senator Keogan, for sharing their stories.<\/p> <p>This is a welcome Bill but it is important to say, particularly to the Department of Justice, that this ask is not new.  The Dublin Rape Crisis Centre has been calling for a change in the law and, as has been said, the LRC has also called for a new offence of stalking.  When my colleague, Deputy Brendan Howlin, was introducing Coco's Law, or the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill, there was a provision for stalking in it but when it was going through the Houses, he was prevailed upon to remove that provision for stalking as a separate offence, with the promise that it would be dealt with at a later date.  Unfortunately, we have now come to this; a Private Members' Bill has had to be brought forward to deal with it.<\/p> <p>As I said, we are glad that this issue is now back on the agenda, in the form of separate, stand-alone legislation.  The big difference now is that we have two such powerful advocates in Una Ring and Eve McDowell.  We have all watched and listened to them speak with such dignity today.  The genesis of Coco's Law was that the mother of Nicole Fox Fenlon was so fiercely determined that nobody else's daughter, or son, would ever have to go through what her daughter did, or would not get justice in the way that her daughter did not.  Unfortunately, she is not here today.<\/p> <p>It is great that we have cross-party support but the key issue now is making sure there is speedy passage of this Bill through the Houses.  I am struck by how far behind Ireland is in comparison with England, Scotland and Wales, as has been referenced.  Scotland made this an offence 11 years ago.  It has taken us until now for the Department of Justice to, hopefully, accept this Bill and have stalking as a distinct and separate offence.<\/p> <p>While it is one thing to put in place the measures to identify stalking as a crime, we cannot forget the conversation about the supports and the enforcement.  Senator Keogan made that point about how An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is resourced in pursuing prosecutions for this crime.  In a separate but related area, I have spoken to quite a number of women over the past few weeks who have been victims of assault, rape, harassment, and other related offences and they have been badly let down by the counselling services in this country.  There are some fantastic counselling services but there are significant waits of up to 12 months in some parts of the country for those services after an event has happened, when going through the courts system, or after a prosecution or a lack of conviction.  That also deserves attention because it is one thing to put in place the law but it is a very different matter to put in place the supports around it.  That needs to be part of the conversation.  Let us pass this Bill speedily through the Houses but let us also follow up with action.  I commend our colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il on bringing forward this Bill. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#DDD00200","speaker":"1683"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":220,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is very welcome.  First, I congratulate my colleague, Senator Chambers, on the work she has done on this Bill.  I am incredibly in awe and humbled by the two women in particular, Una Ring and Eve McDowell, who set up Stalking Ireland.  They have been victims and because of their experiences they started this process to change things.  I also thank Senator Keogan for sharing her story.  As Senator O'Reilly said, we are human here and we all come with our lived experiences so I thank her for sharing hers.  I am sorry she had to go through that, and that the crime committed against her did not result in a conviction because stalking is not an offence.  This is the reason we are here this evening.  Stalking should be an offence and the pressure is on now.  There is cross-party support in the House.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Erin McGreehan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=ErinMcGreehan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I hope the Department will change its mind and attitude towards this and work with us all here on the Fianna F&aacute;il benches to bring this Bill through all Stages.<\/p><p>I must commend Una and Eve who, against all odds, have come out of this stronger.  We speak about survivors and victims a lot in this House and it is always about their strength, about how they have overcome and come out the other side and actually end up turning into those advocates that the State has failed to be.  They are advocating for people.  They are there with counselling supports and organising for support and help for other victims.  The State fails to do it.  Now is our opportunity as legislators to make sure that the State grows up and actually starts to support victims and not put the onus onto victims to support other victims.  I have seen this time and again.  I do not know how many times we have discussed this in the House.<\/p><p>The Department has said that the law of harassment is sufficient but we have seen and heard evidence, there is a consensus from the Law Reform Commission and from survivors, and there is evidence from the UK, that stalking needs to be a stand-alone offence.  By legislating to identify stalking it empowers our police force to identify stalking and it empowers victims to know that they are actually being stalked, that it is not a normal behaviour, that it is unwanted behaviour and that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will listen to them.<\/p><p>Stalking generally is a gendered crime, while there is always the exception where men are stalked or harassed and attacked.  Going by the Newstalk survey this week about our unsafe streets, at an early age women and girls are conditioned to act differently, to be careful, to be careful where they go, be careful about who they talk to, what they wear and what they say, how they do it and how they dress.  It is always on the woman and the victim to change and adapt and not to encourage another illegal behaviour.  The State and the church have perpetuated this for 100 years.<\/p><p>We owe it to women not to treat them as passengers in this society, and to stand up and have us in that front seat and to listen to women because women know what has happened to women over the past 100 years.  We are the best advocates for ourselves.  Listen to us.  It comes from the ingrained bias or degradation of women that sex was something a man could take for granted and a woman had to suppress it.  Again and again we see this.  This all goes to the exact same thing.<\/p><p>Hopefully women have now turned a corner and we are standing up for ourselves.  We are taking no more of it.  We want our State, our Government and our country to stand up and back us, back our mothers, sisters and friends, wives and partners and everyone among us.  It is time.<\/p><p>I thank Senator Chambers for all her hard work.  I thank all of the victims who are suffering and those who may not have come forward.  Hopefully, when this Bill is brought through all Stages in the Houses, the next person who is stalked can go to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and say \"I am being stalked, protect me\" and will be protected.  That is the name and the aim of this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#DDD00300","speaker":"1671","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":222,"content":"<p>I express my thanks to Senator Chambers, and to Senators McGreehan and Fitzpatrick, for bringing forward this Bill.  In her remarks Senator Chambers set out the horrific examples of just two victims.  The Senator put this on the record of the House for people to hear and listen to.  As the Senator said, does the word \"harassment\" from a legal standpoint adequately cover what she has documented here: the continued and pointed stalking of these particular victims to the point where the man turns up with a rape kit, clearly intent on causing exceptional harm to that victim?<\/p> <p>This morning we met Una and Eve.  I was the only man in the room when we met.  The testimony of the particular cases that led to the convictions of the perpetrators was scary.  It was most unsettling to hear the conversation within the room that was sparked among my female Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary colleagues as a result of listening to the testimony.  It just happened naturally and the conversation sparked and flowed around their fears and their apprehensions in society in general.  I do not know how I felt but \"uncomfortable\" is probably one adjective I would use.  It felt uncomfortable to sit there and hear my colleagues speak so openly, it just flowed out, about the fear and anxiety they live with and deal with from having such heightened awareness when they go out in the evening time, and their feeling on edge if they are alone and walking.  That is no way to live.  I found it shocking.  Perhaps I should have been more attuned but I found it shocking to see that fear in the eyes of my colleagues and for them to have that fear as women.<\/p> <p>As Senator McGreehan said, women are conditioned that way and it is even more shocking that society has led this and actually stood back and allowed that to happen. When my 12-year-old daughter becomes 18 years of age I do not want her to have those same fears and anxieties that I listened to today, or that she would feel conditioned to have to act in a certain way when she goes out at night or that she would have to carry keys in her hand to be on guard for an assailant or a perpetrator.  If we are perturbed by this and if we find this abhorrent then there are steps we must take, and of course the starting point is the national Legislature and the law.  As Senator Chambers pointed out, however, the law is not adequate to deal with it.<\/p> <p>It was shocking to hear the two women say that when they were coming here today they were left here by a taxi man who told them they should have no problem in terms of dealing with it.  It was nearly the attitude of \"aren't they lovely girls\".  Society is wrong.  The law needs to change to reflect that and to change attitudes.  Senator Chambers also referred to the Garda response, which in some instances was exemplary and it is very important to point this out.  In other instances, however, it is not because there is no law there to adequately deal with this issue.  Garda&iacute; are only dealing with what they have before them.  When dealing with a case we are hoping that there is enough empathy from the members of the force who deal with these complaints to actually take it seriously to begin with.  This is not consistent.<\/p> <p>It is important that the men in this Chamber and in the D&aacute;il Chamber speak out.  There was a significant lack of men tonight but I pay tribute to those who were here to speak.  It is not just a female issue: men are at the heart of what is wrong.  It is important that men speak out.  It is also important that men would listen to and hear what is being said, and to hear what I heard today, that is, the fear in my colleagues' voices.  It shook me all day.  It was not just the testimony of the victims, it was also the voices of women in general and the colleagues we have here in this Chamber.  It is incumbent on us to listen to them.  We are not here just to change the law, we are here to change attitudes as well, and words matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#EEE00200","speaker":"1641"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I commend my colleague, Senator Cassells, for his words, which were heartfelt and passionate.  I welcome this amendment Bill to the house and I appreciate having the opportunity to speak on it.  Stalking is more prevalent in Ireland than many of us may believe and it is an insidious and intimidating crime.  I commend my colleague, Senator Chambers, on her work in this area and on her tenacity and dedication to representing victims of stalking.<\/p><p>This Bill, as we know, provides for a specific offence of stalking which is characterised as the willful, malicious and repeated following and harassing of another person that creates fear, sadness and anxiety and threatens the safety of the other person.  Victims of stalking, like Eve McDowell and Una Ring, have bravely detailed the incredible distress they felt while being subjected to stalking.  Unfortunately, they came close to losing their lives.  I was humbled today to meet and speak with Eve and Una, who are the true heroes here.  Not alone are they going through their personal trauma but they are supporting and helping other victims.  They have spent huge time and resources setting up <i>stalking.ie<\/i>.  An action I suggest to everyone is to go to their website and sign their petition.  It is very heartwarming to see that almost 1,000 people have signed today since they and Senator Chambers were on the airwaves.  They both did campaigning courses and met people from other campaigns.  They empowered themselves and empowered others.  Over the last few months I have become familiar with their stories from print, radio and television.  Their stories are hugely harrowing.  Both of their experiences have highlighted the inadequacy that exists in Irish law where protection from stalking is concerned.  Listening to them talking about its impact on their lives is quite horrific.  In Una's words:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIt was the most harrowing experience of my life.  To know that I was being hunted and having to constantly look over my shoulder was completely exhausting and debilitating.  I used to wake up and think &quot;is this the day that I get abducted, raped and murdered?  Is today the day that my kids lose their mam?&quot;. <\/blockquote> <p>We in the Seanad are here to give voice to those without voices who live in fear of speaking up and speaking out.  We are here to argue for and demand proper legislation and appropriate consequences for perpetrators.  We are speaking on behalf of women who are at risk and who are holding their lives and safety, and those of their children, in their empty hands.<\/p><p>We can often talk endlessly about statistics and figures which are stark, bleak and disturbing in relation to offences but at present they mean little where stalking is concerned because there is no specific crime of stalking on the Statute Book.  That should disturb us because as a society we must be able to record, report and monitor these offences and support these women through the court system.  Those of us who have not been through such a situation cannot fully imagine how this can take over your life.  The toxic power struggle these women endure is unimaginable but tonight we must, for them, imagine ourselves in such a situation.  We must imagine what it is like to be living a life of fear, never to be able to relax in one's own home and never to know what is coming next, whether it will be an assault or an attack.  It could be an attack on your children, or indeed your children could witness an attack on yourself.  We also need to look at the court system, which is difficult to navigate and terrifying for many women.<\/p><p>We have a duty as legislators to act.  This Bill is balanced, is supported by victims and is long overdue.  The Law Reform Commission has already recommended that a specific stalking offence should be enacted.  This appears to have had a significant practical effect in Scotland, England and Wales since their introduction of similar legislation.<\/p><p>It is important that in this debate we distinguish between an act of harassment and a campaign of stalking.  There is a distinct difference between the two.  As things currently stand, stalkers are likely to be charged on the basis of having harassed their victims; that is, if they are charged at all.  It is important that incidents of stalking are reported urgently to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that male or female victims are cautious and take all threats seriously.  It was interesting to note the different experiences Una and Eve had with the Garda.  Una found huge empathy and dedication to the victim and Eve found the opposite.  We must support our garda&iacute; to be empathic and supportive and ensure they get the training that is essential.<\/p><p>We in this House must play our part and give our justice system the powers to deal with stalking appropriately.  We must send a strong message to victims that we support them, to perpetrators that their behaviour is absolutely unacceptable and that there will be consequences, and to society that stalking will not be tolerated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#FFF00100","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":224,"content":"<p>I congratulate Senator Chambers for bringing this legislation to the House.  We were fortunate enough to meet the protagonists, Una and Eve, today.  I understand the Senator heard them on the radio, contacted them and was able to support them in their mission to get to this stage.  They must be thanked.  The women of Ireland owe them huge gratitude for being so brave.  We are also grateful to Senator Chambers for running with them and supporting them through the legislative process to where we are today.<\/p> <p>I listened to many of the speeches downstairs in my office.  I was really taken aback, especially by Senator Cassells's remarks on how it is very important that the men in our lives - our brothers, fathers and friends - realise it is a little bit different for us.  If we were to leave Leinster House today and cross the city, we would probably not be as relaxed as many of our male counterparts would.  That being said, we have a beautiful and very safe city and I am glad I live here.<\/p> <p>It has been shown in Scotland that bringing in this type of legislation gives women the confidence to report instances of stalking.  If we as legislators fail to bring in this legislation, it will almost be like some sort of State-sponsored gaslighting of women.  We heard from Eve and Una today that garda&iacute; would sometimes ask them whether the individuals in question actually harmed them.  Eve and Una replied that they did not actually harm them, but they were crossing their paths a few times a day, including where they worked.  One of them told us how she was second-guessing whether she should be a victim here.  That is wrong.  That is what happens in a relationship, but what we are seeing is almost a State-sponsored gaslighting of women.  It is really important that we put an end to it and listen to women, as many of my colleagues have said.  We are not all victims but we have smaller physical frames and we are generally more vulnerable to attack.  We probably do not really say that because we like to feel we are strong but we are made differently and we are more vulnerable.  We want to feel safe in our cities and in our homes and we have the absolute right to do so.  This legislation is very neat and goes a small way towards vindicating women's rights.

I thank those who bravely told of their experiences here this evening, including Senator Keogan, and those who allowed their experiences to be shared in the House on their behalf by Senators.  The Government is not opposing this Bill this evening.  I am aware of the sincerity and the depth of feeling of my colleagues who brought forward this Bill.  I am aware also that Senator Chambers has given a lot of time to and is dedicated to this Bill on which she has worked closely with Una Ring and Niamh McDowell who launched the campaign for a new offence earlier this year.  Senator Chambers has paid tribute to the courage and tenacity of those two women in campaigning for a new law.  I also pay tribute to them for sharing their terrifying experiences with the people of Ireland.  They are experiences which all too many women recognise.  I acknowledge Senators McGreehan and Fitzpatrick as co-sponsors of the Bill.  I want to be associated with the comments of Senator Shane Cassells who referred to the importance of men speaking out to support women who find themselves in these horrific situations.  Men have a vital role to play in standing up and having their voices added to those of women who find themselves in very terrifying situations.<\/p><p>The Government appreciates the seriousness of the crime of stalking.  It is an intrusive pattern of behaviour where the perpetrator becomes so fixated on another person that will cause any reasonable person to fear for his or her safety.  It is not a one-off incident.  It involves repeated victimisation over a period of time that can shatter the private and personal life of the victim.  Victims of stalking have endured an experience that no person should have to endure.  Victims also often have to change their daily routine, phone numbers and social media accounts to escape unwanted contacts.  They are constantly looking over their shoulders and cannot feel safe, even in their own homes and places of work.  I sympathise with anyone who has suffered in this way and I fully appreciate that for victims of crime, the words that are used for their experiences matter. <\/p><p>I will now address the law as it stands today and how the current law came into being and the Minister's rationale for previously not bringing forward an amendment to refer to the specific word of stalking.  It is less than one year ago since I came to this House to debate what became the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020, also known as Coco's Law.  That Bill was largely based on the criminal law recommendations contained in the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s 2016 report on harmful communications and digital safety.<\/p><p>One of the recommendations of that report was that a specific stand-alone offence of stalking should be introduced in Ireland.  My officials considered this fully over the last two years.  The commission recommended that a new stalking offence be enacted but that the essential ingredients of a stalking offence, should be the same as the harassment offence contained in section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.  The commission recommended that the stalking offence would differ from the harassment offence by requiring the intentional or reckless acts of the perpetrator to seriously interfere with the victim&rsquo;s peace and privacy and cause him or her alarm, distress or harm.  This would be a higher threshold to prove than the existing harassment offence which would result in fewer successful prosecutions.  My officials examined the court reports and found that stalking was being successfully prosecuted under the harassment offence and convictions were being secured.  Legal advices have advised that stalking is indeed an offence in Irish law.  The only lacuna is one of perception in that the word &quot;stalking&quot; is not used but this is not the only case where a commonly known word is not used in law.  I refer to kidnapping, which is commonly prosecuted as false imprisonment.<\/p><p>In 1997, when introducing a harassment offence to the D&aacute;il, the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Nora Owen said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tSection 10 provides for the important new offence of harassment which is aimed at what is commonly called &quot;stalking&quot;.  We are all aware of high profile cases of stalking but such behaviour is not necessarily peculiar to people in the spotlight.  Unfortunately, it can occur in everyday life when a person, usually a woman, becomes the object of the stalker's affection &mdash; perhaps obsession is a better word &mdash; and that person is subjected to sustained harassment and intimidation in a perverted attempt by the stalker to gain the attention or affection of the unfortunate person concerned. <\/blockquote> <p>I also wish to refer to the words of Charlton J in DPP <i>v. <\/i>Doherty.  That July 2020 judgment stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tHarassment was made an offence by s 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.  Before that time, those whose lives were affected by harassment, or as it is commonly called stalking, could only have resort to the equitable jurisdiction of the courts.   <\/blockquote> <p>While working on Coco's Law, my officials consulted our legal advisers as well as key stakeholders in the criminal justice system.  All were of the view that the harassment offence works well and there is insufficient reason to change it at this time.  There was also concern that legislating specifically for stalking could cast doubt over previous convictions for stalking behaviour under the harassment offence.  We looked internationally to see if there was a common approach emerging.  Some have stalking offences and others have other harassment offences.  The Government concluded that there was no clear benefit to be gained by a stand-alone stalking offence as the elements of the offence were clearly encompassed within the parameters of the harassment offence.  The Minister formed the view that a stalking offence called &quot;harassment&quot; already existed in Ireland and it was successfully securing convictions.  The Minister also formed the view that the offence is so serious that it merited a higher maximum sentence to reflect the very grave impact on lived experiences of victims.<\/p><p>In December 2020, the Oireachtas, in passing Coco's Law, amended the harassment offence in two ways.  The first was to extend the offence to persistent communication about a person as well as persistent to communication to a person.  This is an important change as harassing behaviour can also be in the form of unwanted communication to family members, work colleagues and friends of a victim, not simply directly to a victim.  Perhaps more importantly, the maximum sentence for harassment was increased to ten years putting it at the top end of the scale internationally for similar offences.  I understand that legislation for stalking in England, Wales and Scotland attracts a maximum sentence of five years.  This was a clear statement to perpetrators of harassment or stalking that their actions will be subject to very serious penalties that reflect the harm that they have perpetrated on their victims.<\/p><p>In addition to increasing the penalties for harassment, particularly for its more serious forms such as stalking, supporting victims of crime is a priority for the Government.  This year, the Department of Justice is providing &euro;4.1 million of funding to support of victims of crime along with &euro;3 million to raise awareness of domestic sexual and gender-based violence.  <\/p><p>The work to implement all of the recommendations of the O'Malley report, as set out in Supporting a Victim&rsquo;s Journey, continues apace.  It is introducing important reforms in the criminal justice system to make it more victim-centred.  The reforms will ensure that victims are better supported, better informed and are treated with respect and dignity by everyone they come into contact with.  It is a living document and as more areas of reform are identified, they will be progressed. <\/p><p>For all these reasons the Government decided less than a year ago not to introduce a stand-alone stalking offence.  Section 12 of Coco's Law, which was introduced by way of amendment in the D&aacute;il, provides for view of the operation of that Act within three years of its commencement.  This means that a statutory review of its effectiveness of all the changes brought by Coco's Law will be carried out by December 2023.  That is the correct time to review the position on harassment and stalking, in the Minister&rsquo;s view.  It is the Minister&rsquo;s view that we need to allow some time for recent changes in the law to bed down so that we will be able to fully consider what changes, if any, are necessary at that stage.<\/p><p>As I said at the outset, the Government will not oppose the Bill this evening.  Once again, I want to acknowledge the work that has gone into its development.  I fully acknowledge the intentions behind the Bill and the courage and convictions of victims in seeking a change in the law.  This is a very serious and complex issue, which has a profound effect on victims.  I am hopeful that the changes brought about by Coco's Law will make a real difference to victims in the coming years and that the statutory review of the Act can identify any further need for legislative change.  I thank Senators Chambers, Fitzpatrick and McGreehan once again for bringing this Bill forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#GGG00100","speaker":"1618"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":226,"content":"<p>Senator Maria Byrne was not here earlier but she is more than welcome to make a contribution at this point.

I received his comments as he was speaking, so if it is okay with him, I will pick through a few of the issues he raised and give him my response to those.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State said \"the Government appreciates the seriousness of the crime of stalking\" but today, there is no crime of stalking.  It does not actually exist.  He then went on to describe in great detail what stalking actually is: \"an intrusive pattern of behaviour where the perpetrator becomes so fixated on another person that ... [it would] cause any reasonable person to fear for his or her safety\".  Again, this is not actually in the law in this country.  This is a definition I would agree with and I would certainly like to see it on the Statute Book.  It seems strange, however, that the response from the Government and Minister for Justice is actually to refer to the crime of stalking which does not exist as we stand here today.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State said that the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020, known as Coco&rsquo;s Law, was largely based on the criminal law recommendations contained in the Law Reform Commission's report, to which I referred.  There is an omission in that reply, particularly after we heard from Senator Sherlock, who spoke about Deputy Howlin's engagement on this law.  I was not aware of that when I brought forward my legislation.  I did not realise that stalking, as was recommended in that report, was actually in Coco's Law and was then pulled.  That was said on the floor of the House.  If that is the case and there is a commitment to do it later, that should be looked at.  To say, however, that the Bill was largely based on that report and not refer to the big omission that the report also recommended having a stalking offence, which did not happen, is misleading.  That should have been referred to.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State said that court reports were examined and it was found that stalking was being successfully prosecuted.  Examined by who?  Who decides what successful prosecution looks like?  I gave two examples today of two victims of stalking who had to go through the courts system to get justice.  One case in particular really highlights how stalking clearly is not successfully prosecuted.  Take the case of Eve McDowell, who in the end had to have her case prosecuted under aggravated burglary because harassment was not cutting the mustard, effectively, and aggravated burglary was going to allow the judicial system to give the perpetrator a stronger sentence.  If there was ever evidence that stalking is not being successfully prosecuted, it is evident in that particular case.  I am sure it is not unique.<\/p> <p>If I might say, a very weak link was then drawn when the Minister of State said it is not the only time when we exchange language, if I can say that, where one word is not used but it can mean something else.  He referred to kidnapping and compared it to false imprisonment.  It is apples and oranges.  I can see a link between kidnapping and false imprisonment.  It is a similar experience.  The intent of the perpetrator is the same, but that distinction is important here.  The intent of the perpetrator, when you compare harassment to stalking, is quite different.  I point very seriously to the intent of the stalkers in the cases of Eve McDowell and Una Ring, where the intent was to cause serious harm and, potentially, death.  That is what both victims feared.  That is the difference.  When you compare kidnapping and false imprisonment, the difference is the intention and the outcome and, therefore, I think the comparison is weak and does not really serve a purpose in this debate.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State then referred to a debate from when the then Minister for Justice, Nora Owen, was a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann 24 years ago.  Might I suggest we have moved on a lot in this country?  Women's rights have advanced a lot in the past 24 years.  We have a different attitude now to women's safety, safety on our streets and to listening to women.  The very fact the Department saw fit to refer to a D&aacute;il debate from 24 years ago highlights the problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#HHH00300","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":231,"content":"<p>It says a lot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#HHH00400","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":232,"content":"<p>It says a lot, in my view.  The Minister of State also referred to the case of the DPP <i>v.<\/i>Doherty, where Charleton J in his 2020 judgment stated, &quot;Harassment was made an offence by s 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.&quot;  That is a fact.  The judgment went on to state, &quot;Before that time, those whose lives were affected by harassment, or as it is commonly called stalking&quot;.  That is used then as evidence to say that the terms are interchangeable.  That is the opinion of one person - a man - who took a subjective view and thought the words were interchangeable.  I would suggest it was unlikely he was ever stalked so perhaps he did not understand the seriousness of the comparison.  The victims with whom we have been dealing do understand the seriousness of that comparison, however, and would not use those terms interchangeably.  Again, I think the argument is quite weak and does not serve to explain properly the Department's reluctance to this.<\/p><p>The response goes on to state that it is the view of the Government &quot;that the harassment offence works well&quot;.  Works well for who?  It is not working well for the victims.  It is not working well for women.  We are very clearly saying today that we want the Government to listen to women.  It does not work well.  I can only assume that is the opinion of the author of this piece of paper but it is not the opinion shared widely in this Chamber-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#HHH00500","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":233,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#HHH00600","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":234,"content":"<p>-----and we want to make that view very strongly here today.<\/p> <p>Again, this is a very serious allegation that I really do not think should have been made on the floor of this House.

He said, \"There was also concern that legislating specifically for stalking could cast doubt over previous convictions for stalking behaviour under the harassment offence.\"  That is an incredibly serious assertion to make-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#HHH00700","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":235,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092200002#HHH00800","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1632303000,"counter":236,"content":"<p>-----and one I strongly disagree with.  That, to me, is undermining the Judiciary on the floor of this House.  It is seeking to undermine all those cases that have been prosecuted to date because of the failure of the Department of Justice to act on a five-year-old recommendation and a law that is already in place in other jurisdictions which we commonly followed for more than a decade.  I suggest the Department and the Minister for Justice should reflect upon that particular sentence.  It should be retracted, in my view, because it is a very serious allegation to make.<\/p> <p>The Government concluded that there was \"no clear benefit to be gained by a stand-alone stalking offence\".  Again, based on what?  Who is deciding this?  I ask that the Department reflect and consider the testimony and lived experience of those who have experienced stalking.  The Minister of State said again that the offence of harassment was \"successfully securing convictions\" under the current law.  That is because there are no other options.<\/p> <p>I will finish on this.  One thing that was not dealt with is moving away from the importance of language and using the word \"stalking\" so that when victims reach out to try to find information, at least they can find it, they can know it exists and, as other speakers have discussed, they are not second-guessing themselves and asking if they are actually experiencing a crime or if it is all in their heads.  It is not all in their head and they are experiencing a crime.  Our laws just do not cater for it.<\/p> <p>What was not dealt with adequately, however, was the impact that legislation for stalking had in the other jurisdictions, namely, England, Scotland and Wales, which experienced a trebling in reporting of stalking incidences and a doubling of charges being brought against the perpetrators.  They are the tangible impacts of legislating and that has not been addressed.  All we have heard is the Department reiterating time and again that it has decided what is best, that it is not going to listen to victims and that it has decided that the law, as it stands, is satisfactory.  My message for the Minister of State tonight to take back to the Minister for Justice is that it is not satisfactory.  Coco's Law does not cut the mustard.  It does not cover the experience of the victims.<\/p> <p>I will finish by thanking all of my colleagues, cross-party, for supporting the Bill tonight.  In particular, I thank Senator Keogan for sharing her personal experience.  I ask that the Minister of State relay to the Minister for Justice that a period of reflection might happen over the next while so that when I get to move this legislation forward from this House to the next, we can see it progressed quickly.
