When the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills appeared before the committee when we were dealing with Cork Institute of Technology, CIT, the Marine Institute and problems that arose there, I asked about reviews of public private partnerships and the very lengthy periods that are allowed to elapse before they are reviewed and now, at least in one instance but potentially in more than 40 others where there may be difficulties, schoolchildren will have no school to go to in the next few weeks.  In terms of value for money, this is a very serious issue.  Clearly, a level of oversight, enforcement and inspection took place during the construction of those schools but the problems that have emerged certainly seem to suggest those processes and procedures were defective.  Perhaps there are new procedures.  We should move quickly to request the people from, I presume, the building unit of the Department of Education and Skills to come before us to give an account of what seem to be clear failings in the system that operated at the time these schools were being constructed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018102500002#B00300","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1540454400,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I support what Deputy MacSharry has said.  This is a very serious issue.  It involves more than 40 schools and it may involve more.  We all saw the images of the schoolchildren and their parents locked out of their school yesterday.  I imagine temporary arrangements will have to be made which will involve a cost.  There will be a cost involved for the taxpayer even in relocating the students.  We do not know what remedial works will have to be carried out in all these schools to bring them up to the required standards.  There are issues regarding contracts, regulation, enforcement and the other issues that have been raised.  Would it be wise for us to request a detailed note from the Department on the number of and nature of the contracts for each of these schools and the number of schools involved?  When we request that note, perhaps unfortunately more schools might be added to that list.  We need a very detailed note on that.  We also need to know the nature of the problems involved.  We need as much information as we can get on it for the next meeting and we can determine then how we can map this from this committee's perspective.  We should definitely write to the Secretary General of the Department today and get as much information as possible.  The big issue is the way it will affect the children concerned, but from our perspective there is the value for money aspect and the additional costs involved, which I imagine is a guaranteed.  Unfortunately, there will be an additional cost involved for the taxpayer.  We need to understand what happened, why, and what lessons will be learned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018102500002#B00400","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1540454400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>When the tender was done, one of the factors that saved money at the time was not having somebody on site to monitor the building.

Next week is the mid-term break in schools and assessments will be done and probably more information will become available after that.

We should ask it at this stage for the contract price for each of the schools involved.  If we are sorting out the money side of this issue, we need to know the global cost of what is involved.  We want to be specific on that.  I propose that we write to the Department and ask that it reply by 13 November, as we have a meeting on 15 November.  The Department will need a week or two to reply.  If we get a quick reply, it will not be remotely complete.  We will give it at least a fortnight and there will be updates on that.  I am sure the Joint Committee on Education and Skills will deal with this issue but we will focus on the points that were mentioned, namely, the teaching, alternative accommodation, and the health and safety of students.  The joint committee will inevitably deal with that latter aspect.<\/p> <p>  A substantial element of the issue, however, involves the contract, the procurement process, the tendering, supervision and cost of the project.  Regarding each contract, and the Department can give us the information in a variety of ways, but, in terms of the company that won the contract to build the schools, I want to know what was the next highest price submitted by the alternative contractors.  Did the company that was awarded the contract come in as the cheapest all round?  In terms of its bid, where was it in the ranking?  Was it marginally below the second one on the list or was it well below it?  We would be worried if it was very well below the industry norm at the time.  If it was, that in itself should have set off alarm bells.  We want to examine that tendering process.  We will seek that additional information from the Department on each of the tenders.  We will ask it to give us as much information as it can supply by 13 November.  That is a good two weeks away, and at that stage we can assess the issue at our meeting on 15 November.  That is very helpful and I thank the members for raising that issue.<\/p> <p>  The next item on the agenda is correspondence received since the last meeting.

She does not answer the question.  The information is interesting, but when I read it for the third time, I realised she did not answer the question.  There is a very short paragraph that I want to read out.  We had asked for a note on the &euro;24 billion sale of underlying assets with a geographic breakdown of where the purchasers were located.  That was straightforward.  The reply is three sentences:<\/p><blockquote>Since inception, &euro;24 billion has been generated from the sales of secured assets by NAMA debtors and receivers.  Of this, &euro;13.2 billion was generated from the sales of assets located outside of Ireland.  Based on our analysis, the geographic location of the purchasers of assets located in Ireland is set out in the table.<\/blockquote> <p>They have given us a table but we asked for a breakdown of the &euro;24 billion and the geographic breakdown of where the purchasers were located.  In the second sentence, she confirms that &euro;13.2 billion or 55% of the assets were located outside Ireland, but the banks and loans fell to the Irish taxpayer.  I am not worried about where the property was that fell to the Irish taxpayer.  Then she proceeds to give us a breakdown of the locations of the purchasers of the 45% of the assets that were located in Ireland.  She only gave us a breakdown of a subset of the &euro;24 billion.  We will send it straight back and say we want the original question answered.  She broke our question into two halves and answered one half of it.  That is not satisfactory.  We will note and publish it but we are writing back for a proper answer.<\/p><p>Next is<b><\/b>No. 1659 B from Mr Robert Watt, Secretary General, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, providing information requested by the committee on the costs incurred by the State for the recent visit by Pope Francis to Ireland.  The original inquiry referenced article 44.2 of the Constitution, which provides that the State guarantees not to endow any religion. We will note and publish the response.  The response says that the Papal visit will not cost any more than the &euro;20 million budget approved for the visit.

I think there is an issue in respect of one or two things.

We need a breakdown of the &euro;14.1 million from the OPW.  That is reasonable.  We will write directly to the OPW as the Deputy has suggested.  In the meantime we will note and publish this.<\/p> <p>  Next is No. 1662 B from Mr Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, providing an update to the committee regarding the transfer of properties in respect of contributions from religious congregations towards the costs incurred by the State in responding to residential institutional child abuse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018102500002#D00400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1540454400,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I welcome the update from Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;.  It is clear.  What is not clear is why it has taken so long.  Going back to the 2002 indemnity agreement, 16 years later, five properties remain to be transferred fully.  It was expected that four of these properties would have transferred by the end of quarter 3 of this year.  The current position is that three of the five will transfer by the end of the year, one by the first half of next year, and I do not know when the fifth will transfer.  That is outstanding.<\/p> <p>  If we go to the 2009 voluntary offers, I have followed matters up with the assistance of the Chair, who has been very attentive to it.  They arose as a result of the Ryan report and its damning findings.  Properties were offered on a voluntary basis.  We were led to believe there would be no difficulty.  That was in 2009 and of those 18 properties, nine still have not been transferred in 2018.  I see that there is progress and that a lot of those buildings and properties are in use by various State bodies.  I welcome that.<\/p> <p>  Coming to Galway and St. Anne's, Lenaboy, if anything typifies or brings into acute focus this whole scheme it is Lenaboy in Galway, which I think is empty since 2009 although I am told it has been empty officially since 2011.  Galway City Council announced it was a gift.  I have gone into that background and will not do so again.  It was not a gift.  It was given by way of redress.  It has, inexplicably, remained empty since 2009 or at least 2011, and now we are told that a geophysical survey was carried out.  I realise that was under way.  I did not realise the city council had requested it.  I understand that the results of the geophysical survey have not yet been provided to the congregation.  A geophysical survey was commissioned.  It is very important to see the results.<\/p> <p>  The context of the mother and baby home in Tuam is only relevant to today's proceedings insofar as we again have a Minister saying that the sisters of the Bon Secours are willing to give so much money.  We are back again.  We do not know the circumstances.  It seems the Minister approached them for a contribution but it is not put in context.  It is very important to give context in these matters.  The context here is that this particular building at Lenaboy was never given as a gift.  It was given as redress and it is inexplicably empty and deteriorating at a terrible rate since it became empty.  In this regard and in respect of the other ones, I simply do not understand the role of the Department of Education and Skills or how it failed to ensure these agreements were complied with in a more speedy fashion.  I do welcome the Department's continual updates and I welcome the progress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018102500002#D00500","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1540454400,"counter":55,"content":"<p>Some of these are from 2002 and 2009.  Obviously the 2002 properties are a legal obligation and the 2009 ones are a moral obligation.  Given the particular sector in question, I would have thought the moral obligation would have been almost on a par with the legal obligation, but so be it.  We have all said this kind of stuff before.<\/p> <p>  I want to find out about one or two practical things.  The HSE and the Department of Education and Skills are pursuing the matter with different organisations because some of the facilities are being used, for example No. 15, the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  There is work being pursued on one of them.  I am talking about No. 15.  This offer comprises the lease of land for the operation of the National Rehabilitation Hospital and the transfer of a 33 acre site.  It is stated that this transfer will facilitate the redevelopment of the hospital.<\/p><p>That project is under way.<\/p><p> The final paragraph states that work on this complex transfer is progressing but is taking longer than expected.  The estimated timeframe for completion is the third quarter of 2019.  Is the lack of clear title and spending of public money on a development delaying that?  Is there duplication going on between the Department of Education and Skills and the HSE?  How is that working in practice?  It costs money to follow this up.  Is the lack of clear title causing a problem?  Since the HSE has an involvement, perhaps we should ask it about that and about how it relates to the Department of Education and Skills.  A few relate to the HSE, not just that one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018102500002#D00600","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1540454400,"counter":57,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

This has been going on for 16 years.  I want to say to the Accounting Officer that it says something about how the Department of Education and Skills follows up issues relating to taxpayers' money.  I hope it does not have broader implications across the public service.  As a result of our previous meeting, the committee asked for a breakdown report by report.  On 23 July, Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; wrote to us with a detailed breakdown.  He gave us those commitments, we did not ask him to do so.  In respect of each of the outstanding properties, we asked him to provide a breakdown as to the position at the end of June 2018 and the timescale for completion.  That letter was dated 23 July.  I am referring to the commitments he voluntarily gave last June.  Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; outlined which items would be completed by the end of September.  We gave him further time.  At the end of September, we asked him how he had got on in respect of the commitments he gave to the committee in writing in June.<\/p> <p>  I will now outline the current situation.  I have the letter Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; sent to the committee in June.  The heading is \"Properties not fully and finally completed under the 2002 agreement\".  We are discussing the 2002 agreement.  Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; told us in July that the estimated date for completion regarding the property at Waterpark, Newtown Road, County Waterford, was the end of September.  That was his commitment.  Today, he states that the estimated timeframe has moved to the second quarter of 2019.  Not only did he not meet the commitment he gave to us for the end of September, in his most recent letter he has moved the completion date out by nine months to the end of next June.  That is unacceptable.<\/p> <p>  The next property Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; mentions is Coisc&eacute;im, Cappoquin, County Waterford.  The commitment he provided in respect of that property was that the estimated timeframe for completion was the end of September.  That had been revised from the previous quarter.  What happened with that commitment for the end of September?  The estimated timeframe is now the end of the fourth quarter.  That has been moved back by three months and the commitment not been delivered upon.<\/p> <p>  The next item on Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;'s list was the fifth item on his list for the last day.  It refers to the Sacred Heart centre in Waterford.  The estimated time he gave the committee for completion in that instance was the end of September.  That had also been moved already from a previous commitment.  His response to us today is that it is now being pushed back a further three months.<\/p> <p>  In the context of the 2002 agreement, none of the three commitments Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; gave to us in writing has been honoured.  That is the problem.  I do not mind once it has been done but I am not going to have people give commitments to this committee in writing and then fail to honour them.  There has been 100% failure to meet the deadlines.  They are Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;'s deadlines.  We will accept the current deadlines he has provided.

I am concerned that the HSE is not fully up to speed with the situation.  The HSE did not exist in 1997 so, presumably, the reference is to the relevant health board.  This group was charging a daily rate, in the normal way, of &euro;12.50 and, in addition, was charging people for incontinence wear.  The issue was pursued by a long-term resident's family and eventually the HSE and the group were dragged, kicking and screaming, to reimburse some money to the individuals' families.<\/p> <p>  The note before us states that those involved have got all their money but I have information to suggest otherwise and that some people were not reimbursed for the period 1997 to 2001.  A family raised the issue in 2013 and was refunded &euro;6,000 out of a possible &euro;21,000, meaning &euro;15,000 remained outstanding.  On the back of the 2005 change, the Minister of the day, Mary Harney, introduced legislation to deal with illegal charges.  However, for this one resident, the service decided to impose a retrospective, long-term-stay charge to reduce the &euro;15,000 that it may have been applicable to return.  The situation continued for a number of years, with families being put through an extraordinary level of difficulty.  Questions were not answered and there is a deeper problem than is covered in this note.  I would like the section 38 organisation, along with the appropriate people from the HSE, to join us in order to discuss the matter in more detail.  This note suggests that the synergy project, Mary Harney's legislation and the HSE's own initiatives, dealt with the problem but that is not the case.  The evidence will show that those involved were dragged, kicking and screaming, to acknowledge this as an issue and to refund the money in full.  To this day, moneys from the period 1997 to 2001 remain outstanding for some families.  I also have concerns that the Ombudsman closed the case without adequately dealing with all the facts.<\/p> <p>  Public money has been provided to the Brothers of Charity Services - most recently &euro;105,335, on a once-off basis, for this year - so we could usefully have this section 38 organisation before us, together with the appropriate people from the HSE.  In advance, and, if necessary, with names redacted, they might provide us with details of how much was charged to these individuals, how much was refunded and when.

The letter reassures us that the Department is monitoring this matter closely and that an audit committee, on which the Minister is represented, has been set up and meets regularly.  I remain concerned, however, that there is no performance delivery agreement for the Galway 2020 programme.  I have asked numerous parliamentary questions and followed the issue up here.  I have been informed that it is coming and that the terms of the agreement set out the conditions for the release of the funds.  Presumably, this means that they will do so.  We are talking about &euro;15 million.  Some &euro;250,000 has already been disbursed and a further &euro;6 million will be disbursed in 2019.<\/p> <p>  I am raising this matter because we have been here already with the P&aacute;l&aacute;s Cinema.  We have been here with a special chapter from the Department.  All of these are very good ideas.  The P&aacute;l&aacute;s Cinema was a very good idea.  It is a privilege for Galway to be named European Capital of Culture 2020, but the operation of it is a completely different matter.  The performance delivery agreement is at an advanced stage of negotiation.  In the meantime, a series of people have left the board in Galway.  It is interesting that we have a head of programme, a head of production, a director of communications, a director of finance and operations and a head of human resources for Galway 2020, but we do not yet have anyone in charge of the culture and leadership role.

The Galway 2020 programme seriously lacks of someone in charge with, in the Department's terms \"the required creative talent\".<\/p> <p>  I highlight this because we look back on the P&aacute;l&aacute;s Cinema story and we cannot do anything about it.

As the figure indicates, housing-related expenditure accounted for 63% of that expenditure.  The Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency, usually referred to simply as the Housing Agency, operates under the aegis of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The agency&rsquo;s role is to provide a range of support services to assist the Department, local authorities and approved housing bodies in the discharge of their functions.  This includes implementation by the agency of the pyrite remediation scheme.<\/p> <p>  The Housing Agency is mainly funded through State grants.  Its income in 2017 was just over &euro;34 million.  Expenditure in the year was &euro;33.1 million, of which payments under the pyrite remediation scheme accounted for &euro;25.3 million.  The agency has two roles relevant to housing provision that might not be immediately obvious from the principal financial statements.  First, in 2016 and 2017, the agency received capital grant funding of over &euro;70 million from the Department which it used to establish a revolving fund for social housing acquisition.  Using the fund&rsquo;s resources, the Housing Agency acts as an intermediary, purchasing targeted suitable residential properties from banks, investors and other owners.  The properties are then sold on to the relevant approved housing bodies, which are not-for-profit organisations that provide and manage housing for people with a housing need.  Second, at end-2017, the agency held 243 ha of residential development land in 72 locations.  This land was transferred to the agency from local authorities under the land aggregation scheme that operated between 2010 and 2013.  The agency does not have the authority to dispose of or develop the land without ministerial sanction, and carries the land at a token value in the financial statements.<\/p> <p>  I turn now to chapter 10 on funding and oversight of approved housing bodies.  Both local authorities and approved housing bodies are outside my audit remit.  As Members are aware, the local authorities are subject to audit annually by the Local Government Audit Service.  I felt it might be useful to examine how the Department gains assurance about the effectiveness of the use of the resources being channelled through the local authorities to the approved housing bodies.  That examination resulted in the chapter that is before the committee today.<\/p> <p>  The report sets the context for operation of the approved housing bodies by outlining the range of schemes used to provide social housing or to support households in rental accommodation, and the associated costs in 2017.  When we tried to match the scheme expenditure with output data, we found the Department does not currently report outputs on a scheme-by-scheme basis.  We also found that the Department does not report the size of the social housing stock.  It has figures for local authority stocks but not for social housing held by the approved housing bodies.<\/p> <p>  In 2017, the Department provided capital funding of just over &euro;180 million to the approved housing bodies through four schemes.  The schemes involve varying degrees of complexity in terms of flow of funds between the Department, the local authorities, the Housing Finance Agency and the housing bodies.  We have tried to summarise those fund flows in diagrams in the chapter.  The key message from this analysis is that the bulk of the capital funding for the housing bodies' stock of properties comes from public sources.<\/p> <p>  We found there is currently no statutory regulation of the housing bodies.  An interim regulation office was set up within the Housing Agency which launched a voluntary regulation code for such bodies in July 2013.  By mid-2018, 246 bodies had signed up to that code, which represents less than half of the housing bodies registered with the Department.  However, the Department has pointed out that the bodies that have signed up for the voluntary code account for an estimated 95% of the housing stock of the sector.<\/p> <p>  The chapter recommended introducing a process for identifying inactive housing bodies so that they do not retain approved status indefinitely.  The Department has committed to tidying up the register prior to the introduction of statutory regulation.<\/p> <p>  In December 2015, the Local Government Audit Service published a report on the oversight role of local authorities in the provision of social housing by approved housing bodies.  That report recommended that a review and reconciliation of all mortgages charged on housing body properties should be carried out and that a comprehensive management information system should be put in place in local authorities to record details of properties and their tenants.  As we were completing the chapter in September 2018, the Local Government Audit Service was reviewing the implementation of its recommendations.<\/p> <p>  The chapter also makes a recommendation aimed to ensure that the standard requirements in regard to the management of Exchequer grants are met in regard to the oversight of public funds provided to approved housing bodies.  The Department is undertaking a review of all circulars relating to approved housing body activity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018102500002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540454400,"counter":191,"content":"<p>Chairman and members, I am pleased to be here this morning, as Accounting Officer, to assist the committee in its examination of Vote 34, insofar as it relates to housing supply issues, and its consideration of chapter 10 of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s annual report 2017, concerning the funding and oversight of approved housing bodies, AHBs.<\/p> <p>  I am joined by a number of colleagues who the Chairman has already introduced.  As requested, I have provided some advance briefing on housing expenditure and delivery, as well as a range of notes on specific issues of interest that had been raised by the committee, so I will keep these opening comments brief.<\/p> <p>  In terms of Vote 34, the Department&rsquo;s gross voted expenditure on housing programmes, as set out in the subheads of the appropriation account before the committee today, totalled some &euro;1.3 billion in 2017.  This includes an additional &euro;100 million that was provided to the local authority housing and regeneration subheads by way of Supplementary Estimate towards the end of 2017, to meet costs arising from the level of housing-related activity then under way across the country.  A further &euro;98 million was also made available in 2017 from surplus local property tax, LPT, receipts to fund housing programmes, bringing the overall total resourcing for the Department&rsquo;s housing programmes to over &euro;1.4 billion in 2017.<\/p> <p>  The implementation of the Government&rsquo;s Rebuilding Ireland action plan is the core focus of our daily work in the Department and, indeed, across central and local government, as we strive to make meaningful, tangible and sustainable progress towards a better housing landscape.  I and my colleagues in the Department, together with our Ministers, are firmly committed to achieving the maximum outputs possible from State investment, both current and capital, while ensuring that close attention is paid to delivering value for money and tangible housing outcomes for citizens.  We are committed to regular review of policy and delivery and work very closely with colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in this regard.<\/p> <p>  Rebuilding Ireland is a six year action plan, with a very firm emphasis on delivery across the full range of housing mechanisms.  All stakeholders agree that accelerating the delivery of new build activity is absolutely critical.  At the outset of the programme, however, we knew that establishing viable pipelines and building local authority and AHB capacity to expand new build delivery would take time, taking particular account of the significant extent to which house building, both in the general market and of social housing, had contracted.  Therefore, in parallel with driving increased capacity building, we focused also on harnessing the potential of the available housing stock.<\/p> <p>  In summary, Rebuilding Ireland seeks to achieve the delivery of some 50,000 additional social housing homes through build, acquisition and leasing schemes, out to 2021.  A further 87,000 households will have their needs met under the housing assistance payment, HAP, and rental accommodation, RAS, schemes.  The relative contributions of individual programmes to overall delivery is to shift significantly over the course of the six years, taking particular account of the substantial increase in the delivery of new build social housing homes as the programme progresses.<\/p> <p>  During 2017, significant progress was made to deliver on the commitments in Rebuilding Ireland.  In overall terms, housing supports were delivered to some 25,900 households last year, through the range of social housing measures in Rebuilding Ireland, which were significantly ahead of the target of 21,050.  Within this, almost 2,300 new build social housing homes were delivered, more than three times the level in the previous year.  In addition, wider housing supply continued to grow, with the number of new homes becoming available for use reaching 18,222 in 2017, an increase of 29% on 2016.<\/p> <p>  Significant progress was made in 2017 in advancing many social housing projects, through the range of delivery mechanisms and programmes.  By the end of last year, a substantial construction pipeline was in place, which will result in further increases in the number of new social housing homes being built this year and in the coming years.<\/p> <p>  This year is a critical year for delivery.  Pipelines established over the last two years, in particular, are yielding fruit, with the number of private and social homes on-site and completions increasing quarter on quarter.  While this is welcome, there remains very significant further progress to be made right through to the end of the Rebuilding Ireland action plan.  There is absolutely no room for complacency and we continue to actively monitor, refocus as necessary and mobilise the range of players involved in order to achieve our ambitions in what is a very challenging landscape.<\/p> <p>  Nowhere is this more evident than with regard to homelessness.  It is essential that supply continues to increase if we are to address both the backlog of housing demand in the system, and also new demand arising.  While Rebuilding Ireland is heavily focused on this, in the interim we must, and are, continuing to work to provide the most appropriate accommodation possible for those of our citizens who find themselves in immediate housing need.  The programme of family hubs is intended to provide more family-friendly transition accommodation, and the implementation of the HAP placefinder service will further assist families in various types of emergency accommodation to transition into more long-term housing solutions.  One of our key areas of focus is on prevention and avoiding the use of emergency accommodation wherever possible by matching families and individuals in need with appropriate accommodation.<\/p> <p>  While the numbers presenting to homeless services continue to be very challenging, the numbers for whom pathways to more sustainable housing solutions are secured are also increasing significantly.  A record 4,729 adults exited homelessness into an independent tenancy in 2017, with a further 2,332 adults in the first 6 months of this year.<\/p> <p>  Overall, in the first two and a half years of Rebuilding Ireland up to the end of the second quarter of 2018, housing solutions have been delivered for over 57,000 households across all delivery streams.  The impact of this delivery can be seen in the year on year reduction in local authority housing waiting lists.<\/p> <p>  In addition to highlighting outputs, it is critical to mention the pipelines for future delivery, particularly new build homes, that are now being put in place.  The latest social housing construction status report published on the Department&rsquo;s website provides significant detail on projects at various stages of advancement across a range of delivery schemes led by local authorities and AHBs as at the end of the second quarter of this year.  Overall, we can see a substantial increase in the scale of the build programme since end 2016, when it included over 500 projects, delivering more than 8,400 homes.  By end of the second quarter of 2018, the programme had virtually doubled in size to over 1,060 projects and 16,350 homes.  Some 3,518 of these homes have already been delivered, 4,602 more were on site and under construction, and a further 1,577 were at the final pre-construction stage, with the remainder progressing through the various stages of planning, procurement and design.<\/p> <p>  In the second quarter of 2018 alone, projects delivering almost 1,100 homes went on site, an increase of 27% on the previous quarter and an increase of 239% on the second quarter in 2017.<\/p> <p>  Table 1, which I have circulated in the briefing paper, sets out for the information of the committee the key Rebuilding Ireland targets for the period 2016 to 2021 and details the progress that has been made to mid-2018.  Delivering on this scale, and committing to doing even more, is crucially dependent on effective cross-organisational co-operation.  Within the policy and legislative decisions made at political level, the Department provides the funding streams to support delivery.  However, on the ground activity and delivery can only be accelerated by local authorities, the Housing Agency and AHBs working in partnership.<\/p> <p>  Turning to chapter 10, as I have highlighted, AHBs play an important role in our work to address housing need.  Indeed in terms of social housing delivery, it is expected that AHBs will deliver up to one third of all build, acquired and leased social housing homes out to 2021.  Given that the sector has been mandated to deliver on this scale, it is imperative that appropriate structures and oversight mechanisms are in place.  Chapter 10 of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s annual report provides an account of the range of the housing programmes generally, including detail on AHB delivery and the associated funding and oversight arrangements for local authorities to deliver social housing supports in partnership with AHBs.  Funding under these programmes is provided by<\/p> <p>my Department directly to local authorities, which in turn advance the funding to AHBs, as appropriate, with robust arrangements and agreements in place in order to ensure value for money and quality delivery.<\/p> <p>  A number of years ago, the Department recognised the need to put in place a more comprehensive regulatory regime for the AHB sector, beyond that which had been put in place historically under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992.  Rather than wait for the development of legislative proposals for this purpose, in parallel, a voluntary regulation code, entitled, Building for the Future - A Voluntary Regulation Code for Approved Housing Bodies in Ireland, was put in place as an interim step.  The implementation of the code is overseen by the interim regulation committee, IRC, based in the Housing Agency.  Since the code was put in place, any AHB applying for housing funding from the Department and local authorities must furnish proof of compliance with the code.  This interim arrangement will be built on by a new statutory regime, which will include placing the code on a statutory basis.  The Department is at an advanced stage in preparing the necessary legislation under which the regulator will be responsible for approving and registering housing bodies, setting standards for the sector and ensuring AHB compliance with the standards, and will be provided with the necessary powers to fulfil that role.  Subject to Government approval, it is expected that the Bill will be published in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>  In these opening remarks, I have touched on the important work of my Department, local authorities, the AHBs and other partner bodies to address the housing challenges that we face and to support our most vulnerable citizens, while managing long-term programmes to create a clear pathway to a more stable and sustainable housing sector.  I and my colleagues will be happy to respond to questions or issues that emerge in the course of the committee&rsquo;s work today.

The Housing Agency works with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, local authorities, approved housing bodies and others in the public and private sectors in meeting the current and future housing needs and demands.  For example, in the last few weeks, the Housing Agency has provided an apartment building to one of the homeless charities; has concluded an agreement to deliver a large housing project for Dublin City Council; and has finalised an agreement to deliver 155 housing and apartments for social and affordable rental housing on Housing Agency land in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.<\/p><p>The Housing Agency supports direct delivery initiatives such as the acquisition of vacant properties from banks centrally through the use of a &euro;70 million revolving fund.  A total of 487 properties have been acquired to date.  The agency also sources properties and potential developments for local authorities and AHBs.  It addresses homelessness by acquiring and refurbishing vacant properties for permanent accommodation, including suitable homes for families and for the Housing First initiative.  The agency sources properties for family hubs and supported temporary accommodation.  It works with NAMA and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in the acquisition of properties from NAMA's loan portfolio.  A total of 2,475 houses and apartments have been delivered to date.  The agency provides procurement services for local authorities and AHBs.  It manages and develops sites that it owns.  It centrally supports the implementation of the housing strategy for people with disabilities.<\/p><p> The Housing Agency undertakes a significant amount of work in research and supporting policy development.  Specifically, it prepares the annual summary assessment of housing need report and the national statement on housing supply and demand.  The agency works on supporting affordability measures through the central management of specific schemes such as the mortgage to rent scheme, the underwriting of local authority Rebuilding Ireland home loan applications and the provision of support for the Department as it develops affordable housing purchase arrangements and a cost rental scheme.  It provides the interim regulatory function for AHBs and is working in partnership with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government towards the transition to a statutory regulation.  The agency remediates homes under the pyrite remediation scheme and has remediated 1,237 homes to date.<\/p><p> The primary objective of the Housing Agency is to promote the building of sustainable communities that last in places that are well planned.  We promote the development of good quality housing in places where people want to live and have opportunities.  The four key features of good housing are security, quality, affordability and appropriateness.  Our housing stock needs to be appropriate in size and accessible.  The location of housing should meet current and future needs.  The Housing Agency has undertaken a great deal of additional work in the past two years to assist in dealing with the significant housing challenges we face.  We are committed to ensuring financial probity, good governance structures and efficient measures are in place to meet the remit and objectives of the Housing Agency.  <\/p><p> I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff for their assistance and courtesy during the conducting of the audit.

It states there has been a surplus of local property tax receipts to fund housing programmes and gives figures for 2016 to 2018, inclusive.  This year's figure is &euro;92 million, for example.  The Department confirmed to us not that long ago that a review of its baselines was under way.  The amount of money involved could change significantly.  Population has not been accounted for in determining the baselines since they were established in 2000 or thereabouts.  There is a significant shortfall in some of the larger local authorities, which are the ones contributing to the local property tax pool.  Not all local authorities make a contribution to it, only those in the likes of Dublin, some commuter belt counties, Galway and Cork, which are the likely winners in a reconfiguration if the baselines change.

Very often there is a degree of spin, not necessarily from the Department but politically, on the number of houses built, as opposed, for example, to housing assistance payments, HAP, leasing and various other schemes.  One of the things that is referenced in the report is the lack of clarity.  A recommendation was made on foot of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report that there was a need to have a more transparent approach.  The Comptroller and Auditor General said that, in addition to the current output report, the Department should consider reporting on the output of social housing support schemes on a scheme by scheme basis, both to assist its oversight and increase transparency.

In fact, when we started out initially, we would probably have had more scheme by scheme-type specific reporting of the kind to which the Comptroller and Auditor General referred.  We would have said so many homes had been delivered using the capital advance leasing facility and so many under the capital assistance scheme, but the view we were getting back was that they were terms we understood but that people generally did not.  We moved from it to a programme of reporting.  We publish data every quarter, fundamentally built around the build, acquisition and lease scheme, the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and the HAP scheme.  In terms of the recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General, the form of reporting we have and what he is recommending are not incompatible because we can tell behind these broad categories what the individual schemes are.

Clearly, on the basis of capital cost, it would not have been possible to fund that because the capital resources were not available.  It would also not have been deliverable in the timeframe required because construction takes time and, as we know, construction had virtually ground to a halt.  The mix of approaches between construction, acquisition, lease, RAS and HAP, that are in Rebuilding Ireland reflect a policy balance between getting as many units as possible through the capital side while also determining what was needed on the current programme side to be able to achieve the 50,000 by 2021.<\/p> <p>  Historically, we got into the business of leasing-type programmes in 2008 or 2009, when the market had crashed.

The conclusion that the service came to was that in certain parts of the country, it may be more expensive, while in other parts of the country, it is less so.  The broad conclusion arrived at was that the change in the mix of housing delivery mechanisms more towards capital delivered mechanisms over the course of Rebuilding Ireland was the way to go.  When we get to 2021, for example, we will deliver more housing solutions in that year through build, acquisition and lease rather than through RAS and HAP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018102500002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1540454400,"counter":252,"content":"<p>Is that the totality of the documents to which we can refer in terms of answering the questions I asked about evaluations having been done from a value for money perspective?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018102500002#P00300","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540454400,"counter":253,"content":"<p>We would do various value for money tests according as different programmes are being rolled out, but in terms of the broad current versus capital question, there would have been the analysis in 2011 and the more recent analysis as part of the budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018102500002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1540454400,"counter":254,"content":"<p>We are continually being told that it takes time to build houses, that there is a pipeline and a lead-in time and so forth.

My focus since I came into the D&aacute;il has mainly been on health, and HSE representatives tend to get a fair beating in the media when things are not going well.  I am very conscious of the fact that many of the witnesses here today also get the raw end of the stick sometimes, even though they are doing their very best.<\/p> <p>  I will start with Brexit.  I believe the Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government has commissioned a report on the impact of Brexit on the housing and homelessness situation in this country.  This is coming down the tracks, possibly very quickly.  It has been suggested that up to 500,000 people in the UK exist in a sort of no man's land and that after Brexit, there is a risk that they may end up here.  This could cause problems and exert serious pressure on our system.  If the witnesses know anything about that or have done any preliminary work on it, I ask them to speak on it and outline how we might deal with it.<\/p> <p>  Last week or the week before, representatives of the OPW were before this committee.  They told us that they use the British standards of the Royal College of Chartered Surveyors when calculating the size of a building.  In terms of buildings, if we photocopy what is done in the UK and use it here, what impact will any changes in regulatory alignment have on our system?  Will there be any issues with regard to materials or products that we import from the UK and the related building standards associated with those products? <\/p> <p>  The second issue I want to raise is Traveller accommodation.  It is my understanding that local authorities have a ring-fenced budget for accommodation for members of the Traveller community but it is often not spent in its entirety.   At the same time, as is evidenced by recent media reports, there are still many people from that community seeking accommodation.<\/p><p>Perhaps Mr. McCarthy could give me some indications of the barriers in the development of Traveller accommodation despite the resources being there?  What are the additional complexities that may be associated with the housing of members of the Traveller community?  Perhaps it is not as simple as giving a house or a bed and there are far more complex issues to consider.  I am thinking of lifestyle issues such as connections with the equine industry.  I am also speaking about complex medical needs that require additional equipment at home.  Will Mr. McCarthy outline that it is maybe not as simple as putting somebody in a bed.  Will Mr. McCarthy answer those questions first and we will go back then?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018102500002#P02200","speaker":"1297","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540454400,"counter":273,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  On the first issue, I cannot attest to the figure of 500,000 people the Deputy referred to.  There is a difference between the UK and Ireland.  In Ireland if families or individuals present as homeless, even though they may not strictly have entitlement to housing services within the law, they are provided with emergency housing supports on a repeated short-term basis.  In the UK, as I understand it, those services are not provided to anything like the same extent.  In a post-Brexit situation, the movements of people both legally and otherwise is an issue that is being looked at.  The Dublin Region Homeless Executive has formed a group to look at the possible implications for homeless services and we are liaising with it.  We are about to engage in a liaison with the Department of Justice and Equality because there are connected issues across the system that we will need to join up.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of standards, the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, is the key accreditation body for products generally in the construction industry and otherwise.  The key thing from a building point of view is that products will continue to have the relevant CE mark, meaning they meet the relevant standards.  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the NSAI have been looking at this.  There have been some inquiries from some certifying bodies - I forget the technical term - looking to relocate to Ireland so they can continue to provide those kinds of CE marking services.<\/p> <p>  In terms of Traveller accommodation, we have certainly had difficulties in recent years in terms of the drawdown of funding from the Traveller accommodation budget.  Looking back as far as the year 2000, not far off 20 years ago, we have invested a total of just over &euro;350 million in Traveller accommodation.  Looking at more recent years, particularly in 2017, for example, the allocation for capital was &euro;9 million, yet &euro;4.8 million was drawn down.  There are problems in particular areas.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, has established an expert group to dig into this to see what issues are giving rise to the poor drawdown of the available funding.  I do not want to start talking about specific cases that have been in the media.  Local authorities will be able to provide plenty of examples of where there can be difficulties getting projects through the planning process.  There can sometimes be local opposition.  As we have seen in some cases when projects are delivered, they can run into issues at that stage.  A group has been established by the Minister of State, Deputy English, to drill into it to see what the issues are that need to be tackled to get the Traveller accommodation programme back delivering at a rate equivalent to the funding that is available for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018102500002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1540454400,"counter":274,"content":"<p>Mr. McCarthy has answered the first number of questions.  With regard to the issue of the delivery of homes and supply, we have a skills shortage as a result of emigration and a drop in the number of people entering the sector.

Will Mr. McCarthy outline any measures his Department or other Departments are taking to deal with this manpower - or womanpower - issue?<\/p> <p>  Targets are set by local authorities.  In the case of Dublin City Council we have had recent examples of councillors voting against projects.  In South Dublin we had 1,000 homes at Kilcarbery voted against.  I do not want to be drawn into the issue of what the average house price is or what is affordable but those houses would have been in or around the property price index average price.  That is 1,000 homes that could have been delivered that were voted against.

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has established a group with relevant Departments, the Construction Industry Federation and others to look at this and to engage with the likes of SOLAS on apprenticeships and skills but also to engage with the construction industry on modern methods of construction and to determine whether the industry is engaging with those to the extent that it needs to.<\/p> <p>  In terms of attracting new workers, from an overall perspective one would nearly prefer people already in the country to be upskilled into the construction industry.  Attracting more people into the country will result in an increased demand for housing.  I am not saying we will get all the skills we need from within our own space but efforts are being made.  That is why the likes of SOLAS and activation measures by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection have to be an important part of the solution as well.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of going from a field being zoned to the appearance of houses, Deputy Catherine Murphy referred earlier to the one-stage approval process.  I am talking purely about social housing projects.  I will come to private ones in a minute.  We have a four-stage approval process for the bigger type social housing projects that do not come within the limits of the one-stage process.  That four-stage process is borne out of the public spending code and the capital works management framework the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has in place for capital projects generally.<\/p><p>I am sure most of the members are blue in the face, as I am blue in the face, from hearing about the four-stage approval process and projects bouncing backwards and forwards.  To try to deal with this, we sat down with the local government system and set timelines for each stage of the process.  We benchmarked getting from the first idea of a project to getting on site with comparable private sector delivery.  It is as good as what can be delivered in the private sector at 59 weeks.  People speak about it as 59 weeks to get approval but it is 59 weeks to do the design, get through the Part VIII process with the local authority, do the procurement and do all of the work on assessments at various stages of the process.

A total of 239 people are homeless and while there are 154 in the west.  Those figures do not cover people living in cars, staying with friends and living in refuges or direct provision.  I am from a city that did not build a single local authority house in the period from 2009.  I am just providing the context.  It was inevitable that there would be a major housing crisis.  I think we have now built 14 houses and I am not sure if they are even available.  That is the length of time it has taken.  We received quarterly reports to which I will refer.  We bought land at astronomical prices partly under the land aggregation scheme to which I will return.  We received quarterly reports.  From 2010, our housing programme was laid out.  The final column contained the word \"suspended\".  There was no construction.  Today, I looked at the empty properties in Galway as of the end of August.  A total of 60 houses were empty.  I can tell Mr. McCarthy that I am most unhappy with the oversight of the Department with regard to these houses.  As the crisis intensifies, less information comes out.  We were told when the houses became vacant in these quarterly reports.  This significant piece of information is now gone.  Reasons why they are empty include \"pre-tenancy works completed\", \"under consideration\" and \"under offer\".  I do not know the difference between the latter two.  Other reasons include under offer or offer accepted pending allocation.  A total of 60 houses are empty, most of which are in the middle of the city or very near the outskirts.  That is the background to my questions.<\/p> <p>  I thank Mr. John McCarthy for all of the information, which has been very helpful in clarifying matters.  There are 547 voluntary bodies, the Department, the Housing Agency, the Land Development Agency and the Housing Finance Agency, which does not come under the committee's remit.  A new agency is about to be set up to lend because the banks are not lending.  In the midst of this, we have the most significant housing crisis, which I am glad Mr. John McCarthy has acknowledged.  I acknowledge that 95% of the 547 voluntary bodies come under a small group.  What did the Department do about regulation?  Why has it taken up until now to talk about it?

Following on from that, I asked the Minister, via a parliamentary question, the reason not all units offered were availed of.  The answer I received was that the Department, the Housing Agency and the local authorities worked systematically through the full list of homes supplied to determine if there was a social housing demand for the properties identified.  There are tens of thousands of people who have been languishing for years on waiting lists.  The average waiting time in my county is around eight years.  I am sure that it is similar in other constituencies.  The word \"systematically\" was used.  Huge resources are being expended on the housing assistance payment, HAP, increasing with every budget.

Of those, 1,843 were sold, so the actual number available from NAMA was 5,108 properties.  It is important to clarify that.  More than half of those properties that were available from NAMA will be provided as social housing.  The properties that were deemed not suitable by local authorities included holiday homes and large houses in golf villages, but more importantly there were some very large developments in parts of the country, for example over 500 apartments in one local authority area in one development, which had already been partially allocated to local authorities under Part V provision.  It was decided that 65 additional apartments was an appropriate number so as not to cause an over-concentration of social housing in that area.  Similar scenarios played out in other locations.  There were large concentrations of social housing and it was decided to only take some of those properties.

The Secretary General has said that he does not want the Department to issue missives or directives in terms of what the local authorities do.  When I asked this question I was told that as part of the process the Housing Agency has been liaising and in direct contact with all the relevant local authorities to discuss the demand requirements, and that it was for the Housing Agency to co-ordinate the response to NAMA.  It seems to me that is exactly what is happening here.  The Secretary General has said that the Department is not issuing directives or missives, but the Housing Agency seems to be acting in a very controlling way, deciding the properties that were picked and were not picked.

We would be quite supportive of local authorities in that regard.  In many cases they would be properties that might have been on sale for a significant period and there was no market for them.  For example, our buy-and-renew programme is targeted at town centres, particularly in the context of properties that probably nobody else is going to buy which we do up even if there is a site further out on the fringe of a town.  The latter might be for the next phase of activity.  The national planning framework refers to trying to build up the core.  We are not be in any saying that it should be either-or.

Let us say that a local authority bought land a few years ago but did not use the site.  Solicitors on both sides got paid for conveyancing in order to transfer the land to the Housing Agency.  Now the Housing Agency is going to transfer to the land development agency and will pay for the conveyancing again.  We have about three sets of conveyancing happening here, with up to six solicitors involved, all for the one parcel of land.  Title is being moved from the local authority to the Housing Agency and then from the Housing Agency to the land development agency.  It is possible that the legal fees at the end of this process will be more per acre than the cost of the actual site.  Has anyone thought about that?  It seems grossly inefficient.  Why do we need another State agency?  Why can the Housing Agency not be beefed up?  Perhaps it is a policy matter but we must ask why every time there is a problem the answer seems to be to establish a new agency.  Here we go again.  The Housing Agency is relatively new.  I was here a few years ago when the land aggregation group, or whatever it was called, was in place.  That agency is gone now and the Housing Agency is in place but we are still talking about the same fields in all of these places throughout the country.  The Housing Agency will be gone in a few years.  There will be someone else at a future meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts looking at the same field owned by a new State organisation.  It is the same field the entire time.  This is great news for solicitors in any event .  I am not asking our guests to respond but I hope they understand the point I am making.  I am sensing a shrugging of the shoulders here.  I would prefer to see a greater effort going into building houses rather than into transferring title from one body to another.  That point flows out of the chart showing sites in the various local authority areas.<\/p> <p>  Who manages the land that is under the stewardship of the Housing Agency in all of the different counties?  Let us say it has 20 acres in a particular local authority area and 20 acres in another.  Does the farmer next door use that land to graze his cattle?  What happens with all of those sites?  The agency has 2 ha here, 3 ha there and so on.  What is happening with that land?  Money was spent when the local authorities bought the land initially.  When the Housing Agency was taking it over, contractors were sent out to fence off every one of the fields.  It will probably have to be re-fenced.  Who manages the sites?  How many sites does the agency have in its ownership around the country?

I should not be trying to come up with this figure.  The fact that this figure has not been recorded by anyone in the Department to date is awful.  Mr. McCarthy mentioned earlier that 4,729 adults exited homelessness in 2017.  He also said that 2,332 adults exited homelessness up to the end of June of this year.  The document provided to the committee during the break refers to 3,079 adults exiting homelessness in 2016, 2,322 exiting in 2015 and 2,161 exiting in 2014.<\/p><p>That adds up to 14,623 adults who have exited homelessness since 2014.  That figure excludes children.  In the circumstances, I am going to add on another 5,000 for the children who exited homelessness.  Shame on the Department that it did not count them.  I cannot believe it does not count the children exiting homelessness.  So 14,000 adults and approximately 5,000 children exited homelessness during that period and the officials tell me there are 9,800 people still homeless, which includes adults and children.  That is over 28,000 people who have been declared homeless since 2014.  I want to put that figure on the public record.<\/p><p> We all hear about the figures hovering around 9,000 or 10,000 but every year there are thousands going out of the system and thousands more coming in.  Effectively, 20,000 people have been homeless at some point in the past four years.  They were declared homeless and were accommodated in various centres and hotels.  They are no longer there, thank God, but there are still another 10,000 or 9,800 there.  The figure for those who have presented as homeless, adults and children, since 2014, at a minimum and based on what the officials are telling us, is over 28,000.  That is a figure I have never seen or heard before and I am only putting it together on the basis of the information we have been given.  Do our guests follow how I have arrived at that number?  There were 14,000 adults and I am adding on a third again to account for children, making almost 20,000.  There are nearly 10,000 still there, which means that over 28,000 people have been declared homeless since 2014.  I want the public to understand that.<\/p><p> We talk about homelessness figures and hear that only 10,000 people are homeless and that the problem is not really getting worse.  Almost 30,000 people have been declared homeless since 2014.  I can understand why the Department is not getting on top of the problem if it does not even count all of those affected.  I do not want to be dramatic but, as a public representative, I find this hurtful.  After all this and after we have trusted the Department to deal with homelessness, the officials now tell us they do not even count the homeless children who are going into hotels, hubs and places of that nature.

Let us hope there is a big increase on that.  That is all I can hope for.<\/p><p>I will ask about one related topic before I let other members come back.  The issue concerns the housing summit the Department held on 17 September in the Custom House.  I thank the witnesses for giving us information on that.  The Department gave the committee a sheet of paper.  I am not sure it was fully circulated over lunch.  The document lists actions to be taken following the summit.  These are notes taken by officials of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on the summit.  In attendance were Mr. McCarthy, the Minister of State, Deputy English, the City and County Management Association, CCMA, and the Irish Council for Social Housing, ICSH.  <\/p><p>How many years into the housing crisis are we?  I know the Department will not use the term but it is an emergency for those who are affected.  It has been quite a number of years.  If homelessness has been highlighted since before 2014, we are certainly five years into the housing crisis.  In that light, under the heading &quot;Actions to bring forward&quot;, this is what the Department's notes of its meeting on that day with its Minister of State state:<\/p><blockquote>More high-level\/ national strategic collaboration between CCMA and AHB representatives in order to plan and develop best practice on a national basis.  As it stands, we don&rsquo;t have a view of how the shortfall against targets will be made-up; don&rsquo;t have a view of the local plans at the level of the individual 31 local authorities. <\/blockquote> <p>Five years into the housing crisis, according to the minutes of a meeting attended by the Minister of State, the Secretary General, the CCMA and the body representing the approved housing bodies, the attendees state they do not have a view of the plans at the level of the 31 individual local authorities.  Is it any wonder we are where we are when it comes to housing?  If, as an occupant, I had read that four years ago, I would have thought those concerned should get their act together.  Five years on, however, this is what we are being told.<\/p><p>The Department has made light of the lack of statutory regulation for approved housing bodies.  It has spoken of the voluntary code but that has not delivered information that gives the Department a view of the plans at the level of the 31 individual local authorities.  I can understand that the Comptroller and Auditor General might say that, and I believe he does say that in his report.  However, I note this is stated in the minutes taken by the Department's own senior officials on its meeting four weeks ago with its Minister of State and the organisations I have mentioned.  The Department still does not know what is happening in the 31 local authorities.  We had hoped to make a bit of progress here today, but we are so badly prepared five years on that we do not even know what is happening in the local authorities.  These are the Department's minutes. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018102500002#PP04400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540454400,"counter":905,"content":"<p>I think-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018102500002#PP04500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1540454400,"counter":906,"content":"<p>That is what the Department says.

It usually happens on a Friday afternoon when I can do very little about it.  We are seeing the stress these people are suffering.  It is not possible to quantify the damage done by that experience of homelessness even if it is only for two or three months.  Given the uncertainty and stress that is caused, we need to accurately capture the number of people it is damaging.<\/p> <p>  Mr. John McCarthy gave us figures for builds and acquiring leases.  In terms of transparency we should not see builds and acquiring leases connected together because acquiring leases is not new, but existing.  We need to see the amount of money for builds expressed separately on every occasion.  Is regeneration included in that build component?  A number of regeneration programmes are under way.  Presumably they are also counted in that.  Some of those go back many years, including, for example, O'Devaney Gardens and St. Michael's Estate in Inchicore.

I accept the percentages are right, but the numbers are tiny relative to the scale of the problem.  That kind of presentation suggesting something is a great leap ahead drives us bananas.  The Department would want to put an extra zero at the end of some of those numbers to make a sizeable impact.<\/p> <p>  Page 125 of the Comptroller and Auditor General report relates to the approved housing bodies.  Paragraph 10.36 states \"A report from the Local Government Audit Service (LGAS) in December 2015 found a number of instances in a number of local authorities, where mortgages, related to the three schemes, were not fully executed and recommended conducting a review and reconciliation of all mortgages charged on AHB properties.\"  About 12 different points are made about other recommendations.  One of them is that \"local authorities should record all loans outstanding on their financial systems and issue annual loan balance statement\".  Another recommendation is that \"local authorities should review AHB projects to ensure that final accounts and post-project reviews have been completed\".  Another one is that \"suitably qualified local authority staff should inspect and verify certificates for payment for capital projects\", which suggests they are not suitably qualified.

There was a very hot debate in the D&aacute;il because the feeling was that HAP was being introduced to get people off the housing waiting list.<\/p><p>A housing transfer provision was introduced where somebody was regarded as suitably accommodated where HAP was supporting that tenancy.  However, we are seeing the housing waiting lists appearing to go down when, in fact, the number of HAP tenancies is going up.  In essence, the same number of people must be provided for.  Is HAP regarded as a sustainable form of long-term housing?  If someone loses a tenancy, he or she must source accommodation himself or herself.  For example, in my area HAP for a family of two adults and three children is approximately &euro;1,300 per month, if one can find accommodation.  Usually, the family has to pay more than that themselves.  Over 30 years, that is &euro;468,000 but with no house at the end of it.  It is a very expensive funding mechanism.  We have been told by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that by 2022, HAP will cost in the region of &euro;1.7 billion.  The more that goes up, the greater the squeeze on the finance needed to build.  It then becomes an unsustainable form of housing support.  Is it regarded within the Department as sustainable in the long term?  Given the new thinking on building, are we likely to see HAP phased out?

One of the difficulties with building new homes is the process and the Cathaoirleach has asked how much of the overall money is spent on building new homes.  We have been told that one of the problems is the four stage process.  We hope to get some of the county managers, or their association, in to help us better understand that aspect .  We know they have been before the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The Secretary General said the Department came up with a bespoke one stage process that was offered to local authorities.  It was anticipated that 200 projects would avail of it but only 12 did so.  He said that the reason for the low uptake was that local authorities felt they would be exposed to risk.  I counter that the reason there was a four stage process in the first place was that local authorities did not want to take any of the risk.  The point they make to us when we meet them, as politicians, is that unless they know they are going to get paid back fully by the Department they will not take any risk because they cannot afford to do so.  Whether it is one stage or four stages the problem is the risk.  The Secretary General said the process was modified and some of the risks were removed.  Have all the risks been removed?

My problem is that we can never really determine that, however.  We can determine it at some stage long afterwards, but there is little democratic accountability about all of this.  We came up against it in other areas also.  We must find some way of doing it and of satisfactorily establishing that going down this route will give value for money and that everything is what it seems.<\/p> <p>  I will return to that point but I wish to make a general observation about the human side of all of this.  I imagine Mr. John McCarthy and everyone else here understands that there are people in need of social housing, that there are people on housing lists - many of whom live in their parents' or friends' homes - and people in need of affordable housing, a matter on which we have not even touched.  There was very little in the budget in respect of affordable housing.  Almost everyone who has a housing need is forced into the private rented sector, which has pushed up the price of rents.  When I arrive in my constituency office in Waterford tomorrow, probably a dozen or more of the many people I must meet will have housing-related issues.  They are looking for social housing but it is not there.  I will have to tell them that they must find private rented accommodation through HAP, but they cannot find places within the rent caps.  They are on a merry-go-round and they come to us to look for assistance.  They then ask us to make representations for houses which do not exist.  I do not buy into that clientelist system of doing things in any event; people should be entitled to a home based on merit and need.  They come to local politicians, however, when they want advice.  The problem is that for many of them there is not enough private rented accommodation available, or certainly not at the rates where they can avail of HAP.  They are left to their own devices and, in many cases, abandoned.  That is the reality and, unless we seriously start to build, it will continue to be the case and there will be debate after debate in the D&aacute;il regarding the housing crisis.  The Cathaoirleach said earlier that it had gone on for five years but it is probably longer than that.<\/p> <p>  I return to what was said earlier about the amount of money we spend on subsidising people in private rented accommodation rather than building homes.  The human cost of this is enormous.  I stress that it is difficult for us, as politicians, to deal with people who we know have a real housing need and who ask us to help them or make representations.  As I said, however, we are making representations for houses that do not exist.  We must do it and we go into the local council and meet the housing officers but they say \"Sorry, Deputy, but HAP is the only option\".  We revert to the constituents but they say they cannot find anywhere.  Does the Department understand what it is like for people in that situation?  Does it understand why we say there is a housing emergency which is real, which impacts on people's lives and about which much more needs to be done?<\/p> <p>  As an observation, in my constituency in Waterford, where the target is 687 units by the end of 2021 and with almost 300 people who are approved for housing this year alone, notwithstanding how many came off the list, we are only scratching the surface.  We are not dealing with the crisis at all, notwithstanding all the figures trotted out about how many homes will be built, how many acquisitions and purchases there will be and so on.  If the targets for each local authority are broken down, one will see we are not getting to grips with it at all.  That is only an observation and if Mr. John McCarthy wishes to respond he can do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018102500002#UU01200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540454400,"counter":1075,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to respond.

I fully understand and accept, therefore, what he says.<\/p> <p>  We have embarked on a six-year plan in the form of Rebuilding Ireland.  In overall terms, we have exceeded the targets of the first two years and the build piece is increasing, has increased over the past two years and will get to a point in 2021 where it will exceed 8,700, from a point in 2014 or 2015 when it was in the hundreds at most.

We are investing a significant amount of money.  The housing crisis in Galway is equal to, if not worse than, the crisis in Dublin.  Let me outline the facts.  People have been on the housing waiting list since 2002.  Up until very recently, there were almost 5,000 households on the list, but, mysteriously and magically, that number has been reduced.  We do not know how that was achieved, but one of the reasons is that when someone takes a house under the HAP scheme, he or she is taken off the list.  The figures the Housing Agency sees for Galway have been reduced because people have accepted a HAP scheme payment and are no longer on the waiting list but a transfer list and so on.  Do the witnesses understand my frustration?  I am looking at the statistics, yet the housing crisis is getting worse.  We have a housing agency that is holding a summit, conferences and spring lectures, but it is not carrying out research into the real causes of the crisis which I see as no social houses having been built in Galway city - I am using Galway as an example - since 2009.  In 2018 it started to build 14.  There is no escaping the figure.

No social house was built and the only game in town is the HAP scheme.  That was a policy decision made in the Department.  As my colleague said, people are being told that their only option is to find a place to rent and what costs the HAP scheme will cover, but the amount of the payment is useless in Galway.

I am very pleased to have the opportunity to present this Bill this afternoon.  It has been discussed in previous meetings of the committee and I commend the Chairman and am encouraged by the sentiments expressed by the committee on the need for a digital safety commissioner at this time.  There is no doubt that online safety has become one of the most significant challenges facing Irish life and is arguably one of the most significant child protection issues of our times.  It is one which legislators very urgently need to face.  While it is the case that this requires a policy response and an educational response, it is also my belief that we need strong regulation and a statutory office with real powers and teeth.  In most areas of policy, we generally accept that self-regulation is no regulation, and I do not see how this area is any different.  It is for this reason that I have introduced the Bill, which I think would be a significant move towards promoting a positive and safe online culture for all.  There should be a permanent statutory body rather than an office internal to the Department.  I acknowledge the work of the Law Reform Commission in producing the report on digital safety and harmful communications, upon which the Bill is built, and acknowledge particularly the primary author of the report, Dr. Fiona O'Regan.<\/p> <p>  We face significant challenges and many, especially parents, are concerned about what is happening online.  It is hard to blame them when we read the stories of predatory behaviour, harmful material and online bullying.  While bullying in any circumstances is bad, the idea that it can follow the child home bothers many parents and must be a very difficult experience for the children affected.  However, the digital safety commissioner is not intended as an office solely responsible for preventing harm to children online, but for the population as a whole.  It should be responsible for the promotion of a positive online experience.  I said on Second Stage that the Internet is a significant public space.  It is part of the life of most citizens and increasingly of the lives of younger citizens.  As well as the risks it contains, it creates great value which must also be reflected in discussions on the risks and harms associated with it.  Our philosophy should not be to be hostile to the Internet or to see it only as a source of danger.  We must try as best we can to ensure that Irish citizens will be protected from those who use the Internet for harm and abuse but can also access its benefits.  We need a measured, proportionate and sensible response to the risks and hazards.  This Bill and a digital safety commissioner are a part of that.<\/p> <p>  Technology and online platforms evolve very rapidly and dramatically.  It is vitally important that the remit of the office is drawn in such a way as to ensure that it stays abreast of all changes and is in a position to evolve.  The primary proposed functions of the commissioner as outlined in the Bill are, among others, to promote digital safety for all, and to support and encourage the implementation of measures to improve digital safety, including oversight, regulation and, crucially, a timely and efficient procedure for removal of harmful digital communications.  This would ensure that take-down procedures and removal of material are made available to all affected individuals by digital service providers free of charge.  The commissioner would ensure that there is a code of practice of safe and responsible Internet usage, develop national digital safety standards and ensure compliance with them, and he or she would have powers to revoke a certificate of compliance with same.  Crucially, the commissioner would be responsible for ensuring digital service providers such as websites and social media platforms abide by those codes of practice and national digital safety standards.<\/p> <p>  There should be recourse directly to the office, but we should seek to have quick, effective and timely remedies put in place by the platforms themselves without having to be forced to do so by the commissioner, to reach the standards because if there is a significant delay in dealing with harmful material, then some damage is already done by the time the material is eventually removed.  Some providers have good mechanisms, but some do not.<\/p><p>We also need legislation to ensure that where they are not stepping up to the mark and putting in place safeguards, they are made to do so.<\/p><p> I wish to address some of the criticisms of the Bill, which I take in the co-operative spirit in which they were intended.  These were stated on Second Stage by the then Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, who has since been replaced by Deputy Bruton.  I am anxious to engage with the new Minister on this.  I hope that the Minister, like his predecessor, believes there is value in a body of this kind and in a robust digital safety commission.  I am open minded about these issues and proposals and about any issues people may flag.  Moreover, I am amenable to any potential suggestions or amendments.<\/p><p> I will address some of the points made by the former Minister.  The first relates to a definition of harmful communications, a term used in this Bill to denote when a take-down mechanism could be engaged.  The former Minister stated that the Bill does not define what is meant by harmful communications other than those which will be addressed through criminal law.  It is possible that it would be appropriate for this to fall within the ambit of the digital safety commissioner's office.  Such an office could draw up the definition.  In any event, it certainly should not be left to the provider.  The commissioner could define what harmful communications would be suitable for take-down mechanisms.  However, on balance, I believe it would be appropriate for the sake of legal certainty to provide a definition, especially given that there would be a legal requirement to be in compliance with sections 4 and 5.  I am developing a draft of a definition, as I believe it will be necessary.<\/p><p> We should look to the Law Reform Commission recommendations for guidance in this regard.  The recommendations did not define harmful communications in terms of a specific stand-alone offence or conduct.  Rather, they provided a description of a category of offences that already exist, including section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.  That provision would require updating in terms of communications as well as in terms of what the Law Reform Commission proposes.  Potential new offences are outlined within pages 5 to 7 and pages 167 to 172 of the Law Reform Commission report.  These behaviours require legislation to make them clear and specific criminal offences and that, in turn, would require updating existing legislation.  While I do not propose to introduce amendments at this stage to make such criminal offences in this Bill, I favour seeking to address these types of behaviours.  In general, such behaviours would include: distribution or publication of an intimate image of another person taken without consent, or threatening to do so; taking or distribution or publication of an intimate image of another without consent; distribution or publication of intimate material where it seriously interferes with privacy or causes alarm, distress or harm to the other person; the distribution or publication of a threatening, false, indecent or obscene message to or about another person for the purpose of causing alarm, distress or harm to the other person, or where it is done persistently; and persistently communicating with a person in circumstances which seriously interfere with the other person's privacy or which cause alarm, distress or harm and any other inchoate behaviours related to the same.  This formula is one I am working on.  I will communicate with the Minister and the committee further on the matter but I believe there needs to be a definition.<\/p><p> The former Minister also said that the Bill provides for a role for the courts where an entity is established outside the State in respect of a harmful communication and that it was not clear how this would work in practice.  He did not elaborate on this so I cannot necessarily describe what specific difficulties would arise.<\/p><p> Committee members have a copy of my opening statement and I can elaborate on the detail in response to questions.  I note that the extra-territorial elements of the Bill are not particularly radical or unusual.  I believe the Law Reform Commission recommendations dealt with this comprehensively.  What is drafted is consistent and entirely in keeping with existing practice on extra-territorial proceedings on Norwich Pharmacal orders in the Rules of the Superior Courts.  However, I will listen to argumentation and points in this respect.  In the interests of absolute clarity, I am willing to consider whether it may be appropriate to include a specific enabling provision in the Bill.<\/p><p> The former Minister also said that the Bill imposes a number of obligations on digital service undertakings established in the State.  Clearly that is the intention.  This is not intended to be a dead letter or a soft body.  It is intended to have teeth and powers.  I see no difficulty with that.<\/p><p> The former Minister also referred to overlap with other State organisations with statutory and non-statutory roles in this area and said the delineation was not clear.  I believe this is a matter which requires direction from the Minister.  Much of this cannot be dealt with in legislation given that many of the bodies dealing with this area are not doing so on the basis of legislation or statute but on the basis of responsibility assigned by Departments and Government offices.  It is possible that some of this could enter the ambit of legislation.  Ultimately, if the Minister wishes to support the Bill or a proposal such as this, which I hope he does, he will recognise that there will be a role for the Department in identifying work done by other offices such as the Office for Internet Safety and how any relevant functions could relate to the digital safety commission.<\/p><p> I note this matter was briefly addressed by Ms Niamh Sweeney and Ms Siobh&aacute;n Cummiskey of Facebook at the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment some weeks ago.  I note that they were not opposed to the idea.  They stated that Facebook sees great benefit in a single office having the ability to oversee and co-ordinate efforts to promote digital safety.  Ms Sweeney went on to state that while it would clearly not be the intention of the Bill to impact on free speech in Ireland, the commissioner's ability to issue a decision ordering the removal of harmful communications should be considered in light of the potential for limiting freedom of speech.  She argued that it was important, therefore, to have a clear definition of what constitutes a harmful communication included in the legislation.  I accept the point on freedom of speech.  We must be conscious of it in all our deliberations.  The other point relates to the harmful communications definition, which I have already addressed.<\/p><p> Some other points have been raised with me separately.  There has been a suggestion that it might be more appropriate for the parent or key Minister identified in the Bill to be the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment rather than the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Given that the Government directed the Bill to this committee, this is clearly the view of the Government.  It is probably the view of the committee as well and I am happy to take that on board and agree that the parent Department should be the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.<\/p><p> Reference was made to sections 3(e) and 3(f).  I believe these provisions require some amendment.  The onus placed on the Ombudsman for Children should perhaps be revised.  Certainly there is a role for the Ombudsman for Children but the key responsibility for directing and initiating any material for the curriculum should be from the digital safety commissioner in consultation with the Ombudsman for Children and the Department of Education and Skills as well as perhaps the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and any other relevant bodies.  Rather than simply producing material and documentation, I believe the commissioner should be focused on working with the NCCA to hard-wire digital literacy into schools.  I know the Minister has done good work in the Department of Education and Skills in respect of digital literacy already.<\/p><p> In general, these are constructive positive suggestions.  I am keen to hear the views of committee members.  I will be open to potential amendments across a wide range of areas.  I am keen for the Bill to improve and progress.  I want to see a digital safety commissioner established in this jurisdiction.  I have included my contact details in my opening statement to all committee members and the Department.  I am open to people for any contact following this meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018102500002#D00300","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1540472400,"counter":1411,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire very much for his comments.

This issue is part of the Government's digital strategy and we are keen to work with the committee in this area.  I have a little experience in this area from the work I was doing in the Department of Education and Skills.  For example, we required all schools to consult parents regarding the use of smartphones in schools.  Some 87% of primary schools have policies of absolute disallowance.  Others have some form of usage restriction.  There are differing practices.  Some schools have developed codes that cover not only in-school usage but the attitude of parents to the ownership and use of smartphones among their children.  That consultation will give us some idea of the direction parents and school communities want to go in this area.<\/p><p>Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire raised several points.  We have been active in the area of developing materials through <i>www.webwise.ie<\/i>, which is part of our continuing professional development section of the Department.  This involves developing materials that can be used in the classroom by students as well as teachers.  We are keen to use students as ambassadors for improving people's resilience to deal with some of the experiences they have had with social media.<\/p><p>Their work is particularly innovative.  It is supported by the European Union.  <\/p><p> One of the major initiatives in the Government's plan was to set up an interdepartmental group which is being chaired by the Department of Education and Skills.  I attended its first meeting to emphasise the importance of working across the silos and developing a coherent response.  As the committee is probably aware, the action plan has a range of goals around online safety for all groups, better supports, stronger criminal protections and better arenas for influencing policy.  In that context, it set up an advisory council which involves people right across the sector helping to guide Government in the development of a strategy.  It has many valuable initiatives, of which I am sure the committee is aware, such as having a single access point, equipping teachers, the curriculum and so on around the school, developing supports in the arena of mental health and the new criminal offences which are not part of this Bill but are being developed and which I believe are also part of a Labour Party Bill.  There is very strong momentum now for implementing change in the digital safety arena.  <\/p><p> Turning to this Bill, I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire that it is time to move beyond self-regulation in this area but we have to make sure that whatever we do is robust and workable.  My understanding of this area in the context of the European Union is that there are different levels of regulation.  It has not yet addressed the take-down issue but where it has addressed regulation it has different dimensions of regulation.  In the audiovisual area, for example, it envisages regulation that would involve the oversight of a code of practice but not taking on third party complaints. Clearly, the idea of having third party complaints is probably integral to what the Deputy is proposing and I can see the sense in that.  However,  the other models would have ensured that the codes, as the Deputy said, some of which are good and some of which are bad, would be overseen.  In other words, somebody would be riding shotgun on the companies in terms of their implementation of their codes whereas this model goes a step beyond that and says that where there are disputes that are unresolved, they would be arbitrated upon.  That is the context in which it is probably important to have one's definitions right if one goes from having general oversight of codes to having third party arbitration with respect to what is it one will have arbitration upon.  That probably needs to be spelt out.  I note that the Deputy is working on this.  As I understand it, what he spelt out were largely criminal offences.  He seems to be envisaging that the take-down power would be in regard to matters that were already unlawful.  There is an issue that probably needs to be teased through and I will be asking the Attorney General to help us tease through this.  If we introduce powers for a body, a data digital safety commissioner, to require take-down of material in areas where something is illegal, there is also the issue that the Garda will be examining illegal activities and working to ensure they are taken down.  In that category we will need to examine what is the relationship with the Garda and the investigation it might be doing.  I understand the companies would have strict liability if they leave up something that is illegal that would expose them to liability, whereas if we move beyond the illegal ones to another category - which I understand has been done in Australia where they have defined other areas such as cyberbullying which would be short of something that is illegal but is nonetheless undesirable and should be taken down - we need to decide what is the realm within which we are working.  That is one of the issues on which I am very happy to get advice from our own legal people as to how we would define that range and to make sure that if we are envisaging, as the Deputy is, take-down rights in regard to matters that are illegal already, that what we, or the digital safety commissioner, would be doing would not interfere with the Garda investigation, prosecution and so on.  I am not saying that is insuperable but there is an issue to be addressed there.  While I recognise the work the Deputy is doing on those issues, clearly some more work needs to be done.  Like the Deputy, I am not an expert on what the extraterritorial effect might be.  The Deputy said he would work with whatever advice we get from the Attorney General.  Our officials will be coming back to the committee later and, hopefully, we will have some more advice for it at that point.  <\/p><p> In some ways that is the most core function of the Deputy's Bill.  It refers to most of these functions around paragraphs (c), (d), (e) of section 3 and so on.  We need to do some more work on that but moving away from self-regulation is absolutely right.  Let us define the scope of it and decide on how the third party complaint is defined and proceeded with.  <\/p><p> With respect to the wider sections of the Deputy's Bill, we need to think more clearly about what it is we are trying to achieve.  The Government has established an interdepartmental committee where each person represented on that committee has the functions and powers to execute change.  We strongly believe in all of these areas that we need to ensure that it works across the silos, and we are creating that momentum to work across the silos.  We are also creating an outside advisory body to input into and critique what is being done within Government.<\/p><p> I would ask the Deputy to consider what added value would occur with respect to someone who had a co-ordination role on top of that structure.  The structure that is now in place will report back to a Cabinet committee and will have Ministers judging if this is being proceeded with quickly enough, if we are doing the right things or do we need to add new measures to the action plan.  That is a tried and established tier of power, authority and execution.  Where a digital co-ordinator would fit into that is open to question.  To take the example of the education area, if the Deputy is saying the digital commissioner should become the driver of educational change, is he saying that the Professional Development Service for Teachers, PDST, or Webwise would transfer to the office of the digital commissioner from the Department of Education and Skills, which the Department would consider is its natural home?  The work of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the PDST, the continuing professional development agency within the Department of Education and Skills is a co-ordinated and effective structure for designing, delivering and executing education content to improve people's digital safety online.  Does the Deputy envisage a research capacity whereby the digital safety commissioner could ask had they thought of that or should they be thinking of something else?  However, for those people to be co-ordinating when they do not the power structure creates a danger that we have someone with a parent responsibility without the tools to execute, whereas the Cabinet committee, the interdepartmental group driving to implement the changes and the advisory committee have a structure that has been thought out and it is designed to get maximum impact in this area by driving across Government activity, forcing Departments to work across the silos and to work to agreed goals set by Government, with report-back responsibility to the Cabinet committee.  It is a structure I have certainly seen work from my experience when I was working in the employment area.  I would not have been advocating then for creating a tsar for employment outside of those structures because I would be questioning its capacity.<\/p><p> I am not sure joined-up research is being carried out across the system.  Perhaps this strategy needs to think more clearly about research.  Presumably, that will evolve from the work of the advisory committee working into the structure that is being put in place in government.  The committee ought to think seriously about taking many of these roles out of a structure we put up.  It is there and I am sure members have read it but as far as I can remember, there are 50 actions here.  They are quarterly and 25 of them relate to this year.  There are about 60 next year.  The horse is in motion and the train is moving and has gone out of the station.  A good deal of work is being delivered.  I ask members to think about that dimension of the Bill.  I would certainly have some misgivings about whether it would add value to what is being done.  That is not to say we should not be critiqued for what is being done.  The advisory group will be there to critique, as will the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.<\/p><p> That is really it.  There are some technical things there that must be worked through.  We will get advice from the Attorney General so that when officials come back - I am only a week in the job myself and do not pretend to be right about all these issues - they will come back if there are technical and legal issues that need to be teased out as the committee proceeds.  I thank the Deputy for the Bill.  I see the value in moving away from self-regulation and accept that we need to design a structure that is effective in this area but we do not want to create something in these other areas that may not add to the effectiveness of an Internet safety strategy that is well under way.  When this was launched, we recognised that this is a dynamic area that keeps changing.  We need that advisory committee and to scan the horizon to ensure that what we are doing is effective as the threats change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018102500002#E00300","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1540472400,"counter":1415,"content":"<p>Before I bring in members, I thank the Minister for his response.  I know the issue was raised with regard to other jurisdictions.  This committee will visit Strasbourg to meet the European Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society.  That is a very important strand of this.  The best law could be put in place here but if online content that needs to be moderated originates in another jurisdiction, it is very hard to deal with that so we want to work at a pan-European level on that as well and see if we can progress that area.  With regard to looking at best practice across the world, the Minister made reference to Australia.  I heard an interview with the Australian digital safety commissioner.  Her view was that she has the power to fine, so the stick and carrot are used but she never really needs to use the stick and fine.  It is engagement with these social media platforms that encourages them to take down content that is abusive or illegal.  I assume the Commissioner would work in tandem with the law enforcement agency in that jurisdiction.  That is why we need to work at a European level as well.

He has given recognition to the Law Reform Commission with which he has worked in bringing the Bill to its current level.  We have supported and will continue to support this initiative.  I may have some amendments at a later Stage because I certainly think we need to strengthen the powers a digital safety commissioner would have.  I take the point about the definitions but I think it is important that fines would be set out in the legislation.  I think they must be very significant because, quite frankly, I do not trust the social media platforms to adhere to anything unless there is a very significant monetary penalty.<\/p> <p>  I recognise that the Minister is relatively new to this area but he will certainly have experience from his time as Minister for Education and Skills and would know the concerns of the education sector about the harmful impact of online bullying on children.  I hope that in furthering this effort, he will look to address the situation now rather than later because there is little doubt that children and vulnerable adults are definitely in danger and are being harmed every day.  We do not want to leave it for five, ten or 15 years.  We do not want to allow this to get to a point where we are depending on somebody else to tell us what to do.  While I accept that good work is happening in other jurisdictions, it is for us to try to implement insofar as we can rules and laws here that govern to the extent of protecting our own.  I am conscious that the Germans have made very significant advances in this area.  As a result of that, the digital platforms employ significantly more people there to ensure that harmful content is removed more quickly.  They do so because the law penalises them if they do not do so it is certainly worth looking at that.  I do not think we can necessarily wait for Europe to force us.  I think we can be ground breakers and leaders in that regard.  The digital platforms have very significant bases here.  I do not want to make a charge against the Minister or Government but I am taken to some extent with the Taoiseach's infatuation with these digital media platforms and their mega-wealthy owners.  They are always up for a selfie with the Taoiseach when the opportunity arises.  While we must recognise that they are really important employers here, I still think it should not be a wild west for the digital media platforms just because we value their significance in terms of the benefits to our economy.  We must also ensure that we have a rule-based society and that these people are brought to book.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the fact the Minister said it is time to move beyond self-regulation.  Facebook and others have appeared before us.  They publish their own guidelines and protocols.  On the face of it, they look fantastic and anybody would sign up to them yet we saw that investigative programme on Channel 4, which the Minister may or may not have had a chance to see.  In respect of what we see them do at management level and how they moderate their own content, it is very clear that the vast majority of the people who watched that programme believed the content was harmful and in breach of the company's own guidelines and regulations yet its moderators said material such as footage of a child being beaten or people talking about self harming was okay.  We saw people who were demonstrably affected by that content being left there for very considerable periods of time.  The company was aware of it and it was in breach of the company's own stated protocols and guidelines yet it was being used as training material to say it was okay to leave that there.  I have great respect for Facebook and the way the company has been built but in respect of the idea that this is not material it wants up there and that it somehow impacts negatively on people who advertise because they do not want to advertise around this content, the model for Facebook and all digital media platforms involves trying to retain the user in their space for as long as possible.  Their stated intention is that they will only take down content where the user is gratified by or in some way engages positively with negative or harmful content yet if a user adds a tag to some negative piece of content or video saying \"Isn't this awful?\", they seem to suggest that this is okay to leave that up there because of free speech.  This is furthering their agenda because if I comment negatively about some hurtful, harmful or damaging content, I promulgate that information and others view it.  That works for Facebook because it keeps my friends and I longer on the platform.  We must stand up to them and protect our own, including our children and vulnerable adults because while much of this debate has been about children, there are vulnerable communities out there.<\/p><p>That programme signalled the difficulties for people who have certain forms of mental illness.  I was taken by the story of one particular young adult who had an affliction whereby, on certain occasions, she self-harmed by cutting herself and drawing blood.  The idea that there were others talking in an open chat environment about that behaviour was almost creating an impulse to act in that way and encouragement to do more than the last person did.  That really is difficult and harmful content.  If we heard such news on the radio or on television there would be uproar throughout society.  However, one can access all of this information on one's iPad, iPhone or smartphone.  Society has not yet understood the extent to which this material is there, personalised to everybody and accessible, yet there is a massive amount of regulation regarding what our national broadcaster, local radio stations and our independent broadcast sector can do.  There are phenomenal controls in place there, yet this is far more accessible and direct and we are taking a <i>laissez-faire <\/i>approach.  It has not reached the level we expect it to reach yet because it is developing and evolving, and I do not believe that will be an excuse in the long term.  We will have to act.  <br\/><br\/>I welcome that the Minister has signalled there will be movement in this area but I believe he will have to do more as he reads his way into the brief.  We can build upon this Bill to offer the necessary protections.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018102500002#G00300","speaker":"1274","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1540472400,"counter":1418,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  It is his first attendance at this committee as Minister, and I wish him well.  I also thank Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, who has brought this Bill forward.<\/p> <p>  The Minister discussed the interdepartmental group, and while it has a role, this has become a really big issue.  I was here for all of the hearings with Facebook and other platforms.  I welcome the Minister's acceptance that the days of self-regulation are over.  We must accept, however, that when everyone is in charge no-one is in charge.  A clearly defined role is set out in the Bill.  The Bill will have to be amended - I certainly will be proposing some amendments - but it provides us with something to work with and sets out clearly the functions of the office, including the promotion of digital safety, ensuring oversight, the removal of harmful material, the power to force companies to take down such material, responsibility for collecting and analysing information, advising the Government and working with the Ombudsman for Children and, indeed, the Department of Education and Skills.  It is a very important area.  <\/p> <p>  When my granddaughter started using the Internet I was worried about her, but I think she is more worried about me now because she knows more about it than I do.  If I have any problems with my phone I just hand it to her and she sorts it out.  She does not tell me how she sorts it out but she does and then she hands it back to me.  That is all I need to know.  There is a real issue here.  A large amount of time is spent online and there is a huge amount of engagement with the various platforms.  It can be seen on a walk down the street on any given day.  It is important that we move to take action in this area.  I heard what the Minister has said about the interdepartmental group and that he wants people to work between the different silos to achieve co-operation.  However, at any organisation, when everyone is in charge nobody is in charge.  That is particularly the case when we are dealing with something as big as digital safety at State level.   <\/p> <p>  Huge progress has been made on the technology itself.  There is a possibility that by the time this Bill progresses through the Houses other forms of technology will be available and other advances will be made.  We will have to run to catch up with those developments and we do not have a good record in that regard.  This has crept up on us and we are ill-prepared for it.  <\/p> <p>  I read the legal advice on the jurisdiction issues.  Complicated jurisdiction provisions are set out in the EU regulation but I would like to see more work done in that area to clarify how we can work to enforce that.  I am not suggesting that is a reason to do nothing but it is one of the challenges we are faced with.  <\/p> <p>  Another part of the Bill concerns penalties.  The powers of the commissioner are laid out in sections 8 and 9.  Should the commissioner be able to issue a fine?  An equivalent example is that under the Control of Dogs Act 1986, the dog warden can issue a fine while any more serious matter will appear before a court.  In this case, it is suggested that the Circuit Court would deal with any issues and thereafter it might progress to the High Court if necessary.  Should there be provision in the Bill for the commissioner to issue penalties at that point?  <\/p> <p>  I am working backwards through the Bill, but under section 4 the term \"harmful communications\" is used.  I wonder whether the words \"harmful\" and \"illegal\" should be used in the same sentence or whether perhaps \"harmful\" could be replaced with \"illegal\".  It might be an area we could look at.  I am just highlighting some issues I noticed when reading the Bill, the legal advice and the briefing note for today for Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.  The Bill is necessary and needs to be progressed, and we should not wait for the European Union to act.  We are moving to roll out broadband and to give more people access to it, which is one of the other roles of this committee, as I am sure the Minister will discover quickly.  More people will be engaging with the Internet and this Bill is very important in that respect.  <\/p> <p>  I do not understand how it is proposed to deal with one issue.  Common abuse and bullying must be dealt with, and it may involve a more minor sanction that the commissioner could issue, which might be useful.  We lost one Member of this House who was subjected to serious bullying online.  Some of us had political differences with him.  Indeed, there are some people who are still with us who are subjected to huge intimidation and bullying on the Internet.  That is just one area.  This type of abuse applies not just to public representatives, but to people in all areas of life.  We have to try to protect people from it.  One specific area that has emerged in the last number of years is the targeting of elderly and vulnerable people, some of whom are being profiled by people living in this country.  Widowers and widows are being targeted by international gangs which befriend them on the Internet and build up a relationship with them.  The person believes he or she is talking to a girlfriend or boyfriend in another country and starts to send money to those gangs.  I have come across one really serious case of that where an elderly gentleman was borrowing money to send into a foreign bank account, believing he was sending it to a person.<\/p><p>I advised him that, in my opinion, he was sending it to a criminal gang.  I got another person in the community who might have more influence to speak to the man about it.  I am not too sure what one can do about that.  I suppose I make the point merely to highlight that the Internet is a wonderful tool and has many purposes but it is also a very dangerous world out there.  There are many examples of it.  I am not an expert on IT and I am not sure how the example I gave could be dealt with.  However, we should move ahead with this and use it as the basis for getting strong, robust legislation in place and getting a digital safety commissioner in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018102500002#H00200","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1540472400,"counter":1420,"content":"<p>I call on Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018102500002#J00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1540472400,"counter":1421,"content":"<p>There were a few points.  First, merely to clarify, what I outlined is a general basis for a definition of harmful communication.  The behaviours I enumerated were general behaviours rather than specific offences.  They are not necessarily all criminal offences.  Some of them are proposed criminal offences from the Law Reform Commission paper.  That is for the purpose of drafting this.<\/p> <p>  My view is that one could consider whether only communications which are at the threshold of being criminal could be subject to take-down procedures and the regulations proposed in this.  That would not be the right approach.  There are behaviours which are extremely harmful which probably fall short of criminal and the definition would have to take that into account.<\/p> <p>  I also believe that if we were to use the word \"criminal\" specifically in a definition of harmful communications - I am open-minded on this - it would seem that there is a danger that one could be entering into the area of a commissioner being responsible for the administration of justice, which, obviously, can only happen before the courts and through the Garda and all that is constitutionally provided.  My initial view is that it would be better to stick with the phrase \"harmful communications\" but to define that specifically to take in areas that include issues which are criminal behaviour.<\/p> <p>  There is much that happens online, in terms of abuse and all the rest of it, that would currently qualify as harassment or as one of a variety of criminal offences - for example, stalking - but that often are not progressed to the Garda and the DPP.  However, there has to be a category just short of that that should be subject to take-down procedures as well.  There is a balance to be struck because one needs to be conscious of freedom of speech but we should not only be dealing with matters that are criminal.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the platforms, it is a fair point that it would likely be the case in some circumstances that where they see certain behaviours they would refer them to the Garda.  However, that would depend on the nature of the communication or the behaviour and, as I say, every harmful communication that we should be looking at should not be at that level because that is a very high threshold and much of what we want to address would fall short of that.<\/p> <p>  The Minister spoke in terms of what added value was involved.  As I said, Facebook states it sees great benefit in a single office having the ability to oversee and co-ordinate efforts to promote digital safety.  If one is in the space that one is talking about where self-regulation is no regulation and we are going beyond that, then one needs something that is a regulator.  This is, essentially, what we are talking about here.  If one has a regulator or a commissioner of this kind, it must have real powers.  If it has those real powers and is involved in taking down harmful material, intervening with platforms and perhaps, occasionally, having to go to the court to see measures enforced, but it is dealing with that kind of responsibility all the time, then it makes sense.  This commission will be the body at the front line of developments in and behaviour on social media and those working for this body will be the first to see the dangers that exist with new platforms or new uses of the platforms and it is right and proper that they would be responsible for co-ordination.<\/p> <p>  That is not to say that every person who is dealing with online safety in any Department or body needs to be subsumed into it.  That is not the case but the commission may need to be the central body for co-ordination and designing policy, and identify issues arising in different platforms and their use.  Of course, it is the case that there should still be staff in the Department of Education and Skills, in whatever form that Department may see fit, who would be responsible for addressing this and identifying how this material is worked out through the schools.  However, they should be talking to a digital safety commissioner and asking what has been happening recently, what are the new platforms, etc.  That is the dialogue that needs to happen.  The Ombudsman for Children can have a role in communication but the direction and formulation of research and analysis of what is harmful and what the best way of dealing with it should come from the digital safety commission.<\/p> <p>  In relation to Deputy Dooley's points on strengthening powers and on fines and penalties of that kind, I am open-minded in that regard.  It is a power that exists in the Australian eSafety Commissioner and in Netsafe in New Zealand and that is something that is well worth considering.  I would be interested in the Minister's views on that.  However, if one has a commissioner, it is important not only that he or she has powers to remove material but that, if he or she is not getting co-operation from those platforms, the commissioner can sanction them, not only through the revocation of their certificate of compliance which is an incentive to an extent because it allows parents and users to identify what is safe and what is not but - there is a case for going beyond that - through sanctions, such as fines.<\/p> <p>  The point has been made in terms of Europe.  I recognise a great deal is being considered here but there is nothing in European legislation of which I am aware that precludes us from doing this.  If we are talking about proposal formulations that Europe is currently considering, European legislation can take eight or nine years.  There is no sense in us waiting.  I believe there is a consensus in this country that this is something that needs to be proceeded with.  We need serious regulation.  Self-regulation needs to be brought to a close.  We cannot afford to simply stand around and wait for Europe to take action and see what it comes up with because we could be waiting a long time.<\/p> <p>  On the point on jurisdiction raised by Deputy Stanley, as I stated at the start, what is proposed, first of all, by the Law Reform Commission, is not particularly radical in terms of extraterritorial effect.  It is limited to situations where harmful communication affects an Irish citizen or a person ordinarily resident in the State and the means of communication used in connection with that harmful communication is in the control of an undertaking or company established under the law of the State or such harmful communications affect an Irish person or a person ordinarily resident in the State where the means of communication used in connection with such harmful communications are within the control to any extent of an undertaking established under the law of another state or where a court established in this State would have jurisdiction to give notice of service outside the State in respect of civil proceedings to which harmful communications refer.  That is in keeping with Order 11D of the Rules of the Superior Courts 1986 and many other areas of the rules of the courts.  As I understand it, this is standard enough.  Certainly, there is no great difficulty in bringing cases.  I suppose it is fair to say it may be difficult in practice pursuing persons on foot of proceedings brought before the court but there is no difficulty in what I have outlined here in the ability of the proposed commissioner to bring proceedings, which is absolutely possible.<\/p> <p>  In summary, I will make two or three final points.  As I outlined, I believe there is a consensus that self-regulation is no regulation.  That is the case across a wide range of sectors.  It should be the case here.  It is an issue that affects an ever-growing percentage of the population.  We need to be ambitious and imaginative.  Other common law jurisdictions, such as Australia and New Zealand, have put in place robust regulators and commissioners with real teeth.  There is no reason, in another common law jurisdiction such as ours, that we cannot do the same.  We need to do that.<\/p> <p>  I am not sure whether the Minister stated it clearly so I take this opportunity to ask him whether he favours, in general, whatever about the technicalities and details, putting in place a commissioner or an office of regulator of the kind outlined here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018102500002#J00300","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1540472400,"counter":1422,"content":"<p>As well as working on national issues, it would be remiss of this committee not to work and push this agenda at a European level.

Someone needs to oversee this, as has been clear from everything I said.  The Deputy is correct to anticipate that this will go beyond criminal offences.  There is already a liability for criminal offences and a responsibility to remove material from websites and failure to do so will be exposed.  This is moving into a realm beyond the criminal and to where we believe it is in the public interest.  Deputy Dooley articulated that in some of the examples he cited.<\/p> <p>  A corollary of that, however, is that if we are discussing the introduction of fines, as Deputy Dooley is, we must set out the potential offences for which people could be fined.  The more we go down a route of imposing penalties, the more important it is to define what harmful communication represents and what is the category in which we are creating this obligation.  It is important to bear that in mind.<\/p> <p>  Facebook may like the idea of having one digital safety commissioner.  However, would we ask Facebook what is the best way of providing resilience to students in our schools or would we ask that question of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, whose membership includes trade union officials, curricular experts and others with experience of implementing policy?  Would we cut out Webwise, which is on the cutting edge in terms of what it is doing, or wait for someone else to tell it what to do?  Deputy Stanley noted the importance of having someone who is accountable.  In the structure we have now, accountability goes from the Taoiseach down through the Ministers.  There is an action plan we have to deliver and we will be held to account in each Department for that delivery.  Each Department has its responsibility and a timeline for delivery.  It is not the case that no one is being held accountable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018102500002#K00500","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1540472400,"counter":1427,"content":"<p>Could I say-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018102500002#K00600","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1540472400,"counter":1428,"content":"<p>Please allow the Minister to finish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018102500002#K00700","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1540472400,"counter":1429,"content":"<p>In our desire to show that the Oireachtas is serious about online safety, we need to be careful because setting up some central body is not always the correct approach.

When this was drafted, the Ombudsman for Children may have been considered to be at the cutting edge in terms of information about this issue.  Webwise, the NCCA and others would now be considered cutting edge.  Under this legislation, Webwise has to ensure there is integration across its curricula and it has to be conscious that it is being asked to develop the primary and secondary curricula.  There is a well-being curriculum in place, which has, at its heart, helping people to become resilient in dealing with social media and threats that come their way.   Much work has been integrated into what has already been done.  I caution against the view that hanging a sign on someone's door will solve the problem.

The Chairman has already introduced everyone, but I would add that Mr. Paul Gibbons is an environmental health officer in the Border area so he may be able to answer some of the questions with a first-hand perspective.<br\/><br\/>Our opening statement deals with the potential implications for <i>safe<\/i>food, the food safety promotion board, from Brexit.  <i>safe<\/i>food, one of six implementation bodies set up under the Good Friday Agreement, is a food safety promotion agency, and as such, has no food regulatory role nor involvement in mitigation of the potential implications and consequences to the efficient and effective post-Brexit operation of the food control framework on this island.<br\/><br\/>Its mandate covers both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and, accordingly, we must operate in two jurisdictions that may have two different legislative frameworks post-Brexit for various aspects that may impact the effective operation of food safety and nutrition promotion.  These frameworks include food law, public health, employment law, taxation, pension law, data protection law, human rights, freedom of information and controls on movement of people, goods, services and capital, the four freedoms of the single market.  It is expected that the political, legislative and operational consequences of Brexit for <i>safe<\/i>food will only become apparent towards the completion of the withdrawal agreement and-or transition period.  <i>safe<\/i>food has identified potential Brexit issues that may have implications for both its legislative mandate and the framework within which it operates, and general operational processes which I will outline here.<br\/><br\/>The Border will represent a barrier to <i>safe<\/i>food's effective working.  There has been much commentary and speculation as to the effects of Brexit in regard to the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, and the potential significant risk to both community cohesion in Northern Ireland, and the cross-Border and North-South dimensions of the ongoing peace and reconciliation process.  The Good Friday Agreement is an international agreement registered with the UN, with Ireland and the UK acting as co-guarantors, and is financially supported by the EU.  For all parties, the avoidance of a hard border on the island of Ireland is a key priority.<br\/><br\/>One of the most valuable outcomes of the EU cross-border programmes has been the facilitation of multi-level cross-Border networks where partnership working has effected a real change in culture for civil society organisations.<br\/><br\/><i>safe<\/i>food has operated in both jurisdictions for over 18 years, running programmes of food safety and public health nutrition promotional activity for both consumers, food producers, regulators, public health professionals, scientists and academics.  It has not only focused on enhancing knowledge and encouraging positive behaviour change, but also developing cross-Border working, partnership and collaboration.  The possibility of a hard border or barrier will make the achievement of our objectives far more challenging in terms of encouraging and fostering multidisciplinary and multisectoral collaboration.  For <i>safe<\/i>food, a hard border will actively discourage partnership, joint working, be a barrier for those who wish and choose to collaborate, and a reason for those who do not value North-South co-operation to obstruct meaningful work and mutual benefit.<br\/><br\/>In the absence of any legislative changes,<i>safe<\/i>food would still continue to function, however the costs of North-South working and co-operation would increase as a result of the likely emergence of new practical and policy impediments to meaningful collaboration, and the necessity for two different strategic and tactical approaches to public health promotional activity, North and South.  <br\/><br\/>I refer to the general North-South partnership working and potential implications for <i>safe<\/i>food.  Common EU legislation, policies, guidelines and approaches have supported <i>safe<\/i>food&rsquo;s ability to deliver its remit and functions of promoting food safety and healthy eating across the island of Ireland.  Promoting North-South co-operation, which is an inherent part of our work, may be adversely affected once Brexit is complete and certainly the introduction of a hard border will be seen as a major obstacle to joint working.  It will be far more difficult to initiate and sustain effective North-South working relationships.<br\/><br\/>As a North-South body, <i>safe<\/i>food has successfully operated in both jurisdictions since inception and an open border has facilitated openness, awareness of others working in similar fields and opportunities for various organisations to partner and work together for mutual benefit.  <i>safe<\/i>food has firmly established itself as constructive working partners with organisations across the island of Ireland and have established a strong network of stakeholder relationships.  With an approved staff count of only 30 and a challenging work portfolio, these relationships are key and essential to achieving <i>safe<\/i>food&rsquo;s legislative mandate and objectives.<br\/><br\/>At present, staff based at the Cork headquarters often travel to and from work in Northern Ireland, which is a significant journey and sacrifice.  <i>safe<\/i>food is alone among all the North-South bodies in not having a staffed Northern Ireland office.  The introduction of a hard border post-Brexit will, in the absence of a staffed Northern Ireland office, pose a tremendous challenge to both our capability and capacity to identify and provide local and regional public health promotional services across Northern Ireland.  We anticipate that a hard border will only accentuate present challenges faced by staff and the core need to have a sustainable and valued <i>safe<\/i>food presence in Northern Ireland.<br\/><br\/>The future regulatory landscape in the UK is not clear other than the passing of the great repeal Bill for all current EU legislation.  There is strong potential for regulatory divergence in food safety legislation and standards between the EU and the UK, but the timescale is uncertain.  The final political decision around access to markets and possible tariffs will be a key determinant.<br\/><br\/>There may be a hierarchy of standards in the UK.  For instance, UK-based food producers exporting into the EU will need to comply with EU law but those supplying the domestic UK market may not.  Furthermore, as the UK produces only 54% of the food it requires, it will need to import significant quantities of food, perhaps from non-EU regions across the world where standards are typically not as robust as those set in place by the EU.  This aspect is particularly relevant given the porous nature of the Border on the island.  The key question is whether the final negotiations will agree on food safety regulatory equivalence or alignment.<br\/><br\/>Any divergence in legislation, policies, guidelines and approaches governing food safety and public health nutrition in the two jurisdictions, North and South, will be a challenge for <i>safe<\/i>food in delivering its remit and functions which will become more complex.  At present, food safety legislation has its origins in EU directives and regulations and, therefore, most organisations involved in the food chain, North and South, comply with the same standards set by regulators.  The agrifood sector is very significant in both economies and any divergence in food safety standards, affecting for example, manufacturing, labelling, packaging standards and certification between the UK and the EU will lead to complications for the food sectors on the island of Ireland and to confusion and concern among consumers.<br\/><br\/>Significant divergences in areas of food safety will pose immediate challenges in regard to <i>safe<\/i>food promotional programmes and activities for food producers and processors, and science and academic communities generally.  Opinions vary on the degree and nature of these potential legislative divergences.  Food labelling aspects include the removal of country of origin labels and producer name and address have been mentioned, in addition to possible changes to labelling of various types of meats and substitute ingredients together with new guidance on aspects such as fresh pure and natural, vegetarian and vegan.<\/p><p>The UK may review use by and best before date periods to make what it considers to be sensible and practical guidance.  However, the most practical changes will come in the area of interpretative nutrition information, including traffic light labelling.  A very realistic example of potential divergence in the area of public health can be found in the August 2016 report, Childhood obesity: a plan for action, published by the UK Government which states:<\/p><blockquote>The UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the European Union will give us greater flexibility to determine what information should be presented on packaged food, and how it should be displayed.  We want to build on the success of our current labelling scheme, and review additional opportunities to go further and ensure we are using the most effective ways to communicate information to families.  This might include clearer visual labelling, such as teaspoons of sugar, to show consumers about the sugar content in packaged food and drink.<\/blockquote><p>Were this divergence to be significant and the need for <i>safe<\/i>food to develop jurisdictional specific programmes realised, there would be significant additional operational costs if <i>safe<\/i>food had to develop two separate versions of media promotional campaigns, resources and advisory guidance.  Such activity would require substantial additional external support and assistance in view of the staff cap and notably the increase in opportunity costs.  Regulatory stability in the UK will be essential, as will non-tariff barriers such as border delays, transport of ingredients back and forth for single finished food products etc.  It should also be noted that the UK will now have to set up specific food standard validation functions currently exercised by the EU, such as risk assessment and communication from the European Food Safety Authority, EFSA, surveillance from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control etc.  Will these functions be as robust and acceptable as current EU models?<br\/><br\/>I refer to data and information sharing and the potential implications for <i>safe<\/i>food.  Data and information exchange, which is essential to <i>safe<\/i>food&rsquo;s evidence-based promotional role, has worked well between state agencies and organisations in both jurisdictions.  This willingness has been facilitated by enhanced North-South working relationships and through our shared membership of EU, Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland public health and food safety families and bodies such as the Public Health Agency in Northern Ireland, the HSE, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, the Food Standards Agency in the UK, and the EFSA.  In addition, <i>safe<\/i>food&rsquo;s well-developed research function accumulates significant volumes of raw and aggregate data and information from research projects completed by various academic and other institutions in the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and the UK.  Currently, EU data protection laws put restrictions on movement of data outside of the European Economic Area and, accordingly, significant divergence in data protection legislation in the UK could pose an insurmountable obstacle for the type of data and information sharing that forms the key evidence base that underpins all our consumer and food supply chain messaging and guidance, and indeed our priority legislative function.<br\/><br\/>I refer to external activities and administrative issues.  When procuring goods and services, will one EU tendering process be replaced by a dual EU and UK tendering process?  Will there be any issue with retaining our website address which is <i>safefood.eu<\/i>at the moment?  Will mutual recognition of qualifications continue post Brexit?  Will the legal status of contracts entered into with UK organisations before and after the exit date be affected?  Will the basis, contractual and otherwise, of the commissioning of research by <i>safe<\/i>food be impacted?  Will changes in the common trade and travel area between the UK and the Republic of Ireland impact on staff and the board and committee members and speakers at events travelling between and working in Northern Ireland and the Republic and <i>vice versa<\/i>?  I mention the risk of currency fluctuations between the euro and pound sterling and whether the cross jurisdictional North-South pension scheme which supports all six North-South bodies can continue to exist.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2018102500002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray Dolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1540473300,"counter":1450,"content":"<p>Does anyone else want to come in?

It is great to have an all-Ireland body here that is doing good work in a quiet manner.  The genius of the Good Friday Agreement was bringing people together to work together in new areas where such co-operation on all-Ireland basis would not have been envisaged.  Such co-operation is also taking place on an east-west basis and further afield with the other 26 members of the European Union, apart from Britain and Ireland.<\/p><p>Mr. Dolan outlined very clearly the practical difficulties that will emerge for an organisation like <i>safe<\/i>food.  He outlined that it is a small organisation but it carries out very important work.  When I served as Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food I was very familiar with <i>safe<\/i>food's work and it is so important to get the message across.  I like the phraseology Mr. Dolan used about the open Border and the fact that people work on an all-Ireland basis.  That natural evolution of the work emerged without people shouting political slogans or waving flags of any sort.  It was down to actions being carried out on a practical basis to contribute to a better society and a better Ireland in an all-Ireland context, which is the really heartening thing that has happened with all of these bodies.  It has happened in the private sector as well where the Good Friday Agreement gave us the environment for businesses to be established on an all-Ireland basis.  If we take the area of food, which is <i>safe<\/i>food's speciality, we have so many food industries today that were exclusively North or South in the past and thankfully today a huge number of them are all-Ireland businesses.<\/p><p>I hope I would be right in differing with Mr. Dolan on the hierarchy of standards in Britain.  I have two contradictory views on that.  I do not think the British consumer will allow a dumbing down of standards in food production.  Britain exports substantial amounts of food too, so I would hope that they will not want to lose the markets that they have because of the high regulatory standards that they work to today as well as we do.  We know to our cost that over many decades Britain had a cheap food policy that killed our farming sector for many decades.  I sincerely hope that they do not go back to that but I presume that is where Mr. Dolan is coming from.  It is not that they would deliberately try to implement a cheap food policy because I will not suggest that about any government or country, but imports from other countries where the standards are much lower than ours have to be a worry and there is no doubt about that.  We have often heard people talking about climate change, environmental protection and all of that, and at the same time those people were advocating that we reduce the production of food in Ireland and western Europe, with that food production being replaced by food produced in less environmentally friendly and less sustainable systems such as South America, with all of the attendant environmental damage that would cause.  That difficulty is there if food comes into Britain and comes over the Border then, but I sincerely hope that the British Government, its agencies and people would not agree to a dumbing down in food standards.<\/p><p>The message that Mr. Dolan gives out today is important for the great co-operation that happens every day without anybody talking about any political ideology from any tradition.  I welcome the engagement and I complement the Cathaoirleach and the support staff on arranging for him to make this presentation.  The public at large are not made aware often enough of what has flowed from the Good Friday Agreement and the practical work that is going on daily basis, being carried out by Mr. Dolan and his colleagues and <i>safe<\/i>food's sister organisations as well.  I know that is in a structured way from the organisation that evolved from the Good Friday Agreement but it is happening in many other ways as well in the private sector and other public agencies.  <i>safe<\/i>food might come back on the hierarchy of standards.  I sincerely hope that my gut instinct that they will not go for a dumbing down of standards in Britain is right because they will not be buying our food products if they do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2018102500002#G00300","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540473300,"counter":1452,"content":"<p>I totally agree with everything the Deputy said.

It is great to see a presentation such as this.  I remember attending some of the first consultative forums relating to the issues that will be affected.  That was at an early stage and food was clearly an issue.  I remember it being played down but it has clearly come to the fore with people such as the witnesses raising the core issues.  I come from a Border constituency and am too long in the tooth not to remember the more recent horse meat scandal, foot and mouth disease in the Cooley Peninsula, BSE on an ongoing basis and even the reintroduction of a case last week in Scotland.  Every time we see this, it reminds us of the importance of food safety.  I acknowledge the witnesses' role in food safety and public health and nutrition programmes.  That comes on the basis of having spent 35 years as a primary school teacher and seeing the programmes that the witnesses have brought into schools and that they have brought home to families.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned barriers to effective working.  The idea was that there would be no barriers.  Barriers or potential barriers seem to be the order of the day.  The breakout sessions that came through the consultative forum included the agrifood people.  To what degree are food producers contacting the witnesses for advice?  That feeds into the local enterprise offices, LEOs.  Many have started to realise lately that they have to make an effort and make changes or to be ready for changes.<\/p> <p>  I raised the subjects of external activities and administrative issues at the previous meeting and Mr. Dolan referred to them.  I am interested in his take on the tendering process.  How do the witnesses see the ability for people to tender for food production working if there is a real Brexit?  Will there be a reintroduction of a British standard as opposed to the European standard that we have?  While we all want to see this dovetail and it is to be hoped everybody will sing off the same hymn sheet, there will always be a difficulty.  To what degree has that been examined?<\/p> <p>  I wish the witnesses well in their endeavours.  The document they presented is typical of what many other companies, small or big, have to do, to be ready and to make sure that nothing is missed.  I remember being pooh-poohed by a Minister when I flagged this as something which needed to be looked at seriously, and I am glad the witnesses have taken it seriously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2018102500002#H00200","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540473300,"counter":1455,"content":"<p>I will take the Deputy's second question first and then might hand over to Dr. Kearney.  With regard to procurement, we do not know.  Most of these issues are common to many organisations.  They are not unique to us but we do not know what Brexit will look like.  We hope the standards we spoke about earlier will be very similar but we do not know.  With regard to processors, last year, we started to conduct workshops for small and medium enterprises, SMEs.  That is Dr. Kearney's responsibility and I will ask him for his comments.  We do not see many processors come through the front door, but when we put these workshops together, and we have them dotted around the island, North and South, they certainly come through the front door in their droves.  They are a wonderful example of how partnership works but also of the ability to communicate with processors.  Dr. Kearney might like to comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2018102500002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray Dolan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540473300,"counter":1456,"content":"<p>As part of our role in promoting food safety, we hold quite a number of workshops, especially with food SMEs across the island.  The focus of those workshops is not on legislation, guidelines or anything relating to that, because our sister agencies look after that element.  We focus on education relating to food safety, such as food hygiene, allergens, what to do if one receives an adverse report, how to interpret microbiology results and so on.  As members will appreciate, some food SMEs might only have one or two people involved and so will not have the necessary knowledge.  We fill that gap.  This year alone, we held 12 different workshops across the island.  They did not raise the issue of Brexit.  They tend to approach the Food Safety Authority of Ireland or the Food Standards Agency.  We work with LEOs but food safety is just one of a dozen different things that a food SME has to think about it.  It is a core element.  If they get food safety wrong, the whole house of cards comes tumbling down.  We try to upskill the food SMEs and increase their capacity to provide good food safety in the production of their food.<\/p> <p>  We are a promoter.  We do not have a big stick.  We are facilitators and try to encourage various organisations to come together.  We have done that for the guts of 20 years.  That is why an open border is fantastic.  It creates awareness of others working in the same field and develops a strong network across stakeholders.  We get various organisations working together.  Not to labour the point, but one example is when we got a number of food microbiology laboratories together from the two jurisdictions which had not liaised or worked together before.  We developed an agenda related to them, stepped back and moved along.  Not long after that initiative, laboratories in Northern Ireland were auditing those in the South voluntarily.  It was all about developing working relationships relating to common areas and mutual benefit.  It is not just doing it for the sake of doing it.  There is value in it.  We try to do that with the workshops.  We bring various partners in, such as our sister agencies.

Those friendships and relationships endure through difficult times.  One can never put a value on the work the witnesses have done in the past 20 years but it is very positive.  The possibility of a hard border will make achieving the objectives far more challenging.  It could discourage partnerships and joint working and create a barrier for those who wish to collaborate.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses said they were concerned about any divergence in food safety standards, manufacturing, labelling and packaging standards, and certification in the UK and the EU.

It might make the building of sustainable relationships take longer.  It is a challenge but we have had many challenges and will get over that challenge.  It might be at a slower rate, especially when developing new relationships.  We have great networks already in place and they will continue.  One would not want a hard border when developing new networks.<\/p><p>Senator Feighan asked how particular foods could be affected.  We do not know what the United Kingdom is going to do in the way of amending the existing food standard legislation so my answer involves a bit of speculation.  The United Kingdom could, for example, decide to remove best-before dates, which could be for very good reasons because these dates are related to quality and not safety.  If one eats a tin of beans six months after the best-before date, it might not taste very good but it will be safe, whereas use-by dates are critical for perishable foods.  However, to remove them would not dovetail with EU legislation and I do not know what would happen in that scenario.  From a promotional point of view, nutritional standards are represented by a nutritional pyramid in the Republic but a plate in Northern Ireland and the UK.  We deal with the two different approaches by just getting on with it.  We can work around the issues relating to our promotional activity but if labelling is significantly different it would be a matter for Government and the regulatory agencies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2018102500002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gary Kearney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1540473300,"counter":1460,"content":"<p>Today's presentation is another example of the challenges thrown up by Brexit.

It was frightening to hear some of the things they said about the River Faughan and things like applications for a pig farm which, in the absence of the Executive, are not being dealt with.

We had a good collaboration with the Northern Ireland Food Standards Agency on a campaign to advise people not to wash raw chicken.

I express our sincere gratitude to this Oireachtas committee for taking the time and having the interest to meet us today.  We are a group of retired staff associations from a number of semi-State organisations.  We are people who devoted our entire working lives providing infrastructural services for the State.  We represent a great number of people who provided these services for the benefit of this country.  However, although we are a large group of retirees, semi-State pensioners do not have any recognised mechanism or organisation to deal with concerns and grievances with former employers.  We are really locked out of all the machinery of this State.  A retired semi-State pensioner is set adrift once he or she walks out that door.  The Pensions Authority does not deal with complaints from pensioner organisations and neither does the Pensions Ombudsman, industrial relations nor the trustees from our pension funds.  Legal remedies are cost-prohibitive for pensioners.  As it currently stands, semi-State pensioners have no avenue for representation or access to arbitration.  This must now be corrected in order to seek a voice for our members at the negotiating table and the facility for arbitration.<\/p> <p>  It is not commonly understood that most semi-State or State organisation pensioners do not qualify for old age pensions or any of the benefits associated with it, including dental, optical or aural benefits.  There are a few exceptions.  Those of us who were in RT&Eacute; do not benefit from any of these.  We were not allowed to pay a full PRSI stamp.  There is a myth out there that RT&Eacute; pensioners have gold-plated pensions but the reality is that a fifth of our pensioners are on an income of &euro;12,000 yearly.  We have not received any pension increase since 2005.  In the same period, contributory old age recipients have had their pensions increased from &euro;179 to &euro;248, an increase of 38.5%.  They also received a double payment in the Christmas period of 2017 and another double payment due this coming Christmas 2018.  In the same period, our pension decreased by 2.5% because of the Government levy, and that will be imposed on us for the rest of our lives.  The consumer price index has seen an increase of 14% since 2005, so we have endured a loss value in our money of 16.5% since 2005.<\/p> <p>  Earlier this year RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s pension scheme actuary had provided for a 2.25% increase following actuarial valuation, solvency and providing for the minimum funding standards.  Despite these hurdles being met we have not received &euro;1 of an increase.  Our association has made a number of representations on behalf of our members to RT&Eacute; but we have heard nothing back.  Clarity is required as to who is ultimately responsible for public sector pension schemes.  Is it the companies or the State?  There are variations in each of these schemes in how they are governed and in how much oversight is involved by the Departments.  In our case the Department of Finance and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is involved.  We need absolute guarantees that our concerns will be addressed in the forthcoming amendments to the pensions legislation.  Looking forward to the future, our members must have the resources to feed, clothe, stay warm and to be able to meet their health needs as they progress through their older years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018102500002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mair&eacute;ad de Buitl&eacute;ir"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540458600,"counter":1487,"content":"<p>I am a pensioner representing the Bord na M&oacute;na retirement association.  In the general scheme of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2017, published on 9 May 2017, head 12 related to minimum notice for ceasing contributions and head 13 related to determination of schedule of contributions.  This provided for some but not sufficient protection for pensioners from employer sponsors of defined benefit pension schemes who intend to cease contributions to the schemes.  Head 12, under provision No. 5, referred to funding proposals.<\/p><p>It proposes that the sponsoring employer continues to pay the contributory rate as per the terms of the funding proposal during the 12 month period.<\/p><p> Under head 13 (2), it also states that the amount determined by the board in subsection (1) shall be deemed to be a debt due from the employer concerned to the trustees of the scheme and may be so recovered by the trustees in any court of competent jurisdiction.<\/p><p> The Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017, as published on 6 July 2017 had none of the above.  In fact, heads 12 and 13 were excluded.  Instead it had only two amendments to Part 3 of the Pensions Act 1990 concerning timing.<\/p><p> I wish to bring to the committee's attention some facts in relation to the semi-State companies defined benefit pension schemes.  Firstly, pension scheme membership was compulsory and a condition of employment.  In looking at my own documentation, my job offer letter from Bord na M&oacute;na on 19 August 1974, states that the board had in operation a general employees superannuation and widows and orphans pension scheme, membership of which is compulsory.  I want to put that on the record.<\/p><p> The next item is that the scheme trustees are appointed by the company board which also has the right to approve trustees nominated by members, and in some cases members have a right to nominate trustees.  Furthermore, company board approvals are required for trustee decisions, for example, pension increases, as mentioned by Ms de Buitl&eacute;ir, appointment of investment managers and investment strategies.  Finally, the shareholder through its company board has significant influence and control on defined benefit schemes and this must be aligned with its responsibility and accountability to those schemes.<\/p><p> Under clause (5) and the provisions of head 12 in the draft head, as published in May 2017, and the reference to funding proposals, the draft Bill proposes that the company-sponsoring employer \"continue paying the contribution rate as per the terms of the funding proposal during the 12 month period\".  This, in line with company responsibility and accountability to the scheme, which I referred to earlier, must also reflect the requirement to make good the sponsoring employer&rsquo;s remaining balance of the funding proposal and that this becomes a debt on the sponsoring employer.  The ranking order of this debt should be reflective of when the debt was incurred, that is, the date of the agreement on the funding proposal.<\/p><p> The rationale for this is that in all schemes, and especially in schemes where both sponsoring employer and scheme members both contribute to fund deficit resolution via a funding proposal, the scheme member share is fully committed and provided for as scheme liability is immediately reduced via the implementation of pension payment reductions whereas the sponsoring employer's contribution is made on a phased basis of up to ten years, as may be set out in the terms of the funding proposal.<\/p><p> In summary, the sponsoring employer sets out the rules and controls of a defined benefit scheme via the trust deed.  It has total control of that.  We ask the committee to ensure that this power is aligned with the sponsoring employer&rsquo;s responsibility and accountability to the scheme.  A 12 month notice period of cessation of funding proposal contributions is not reflective of that responsibility nor accountability.

There is a triple lock on pension increases to be considered.  In some cases, as well as the triple lock, any proposed increase is subject to employer approval as well.  These locks are: scheme solvency; minimum funding standard; and actuarial opinion and assumptions.  This has resulted in semi-State company pensions having a freeze on pensions for a ten year period, which is a very significant portion of a pensioner&rsquo;s remaining lifetime, while being denied any compensation for cumulative consumer price index increases over the period.  What affects pensioners is the consumer pensioner price increase, which would be even greater.  We do not buy Ferraris.<\/p> <p>  Scheme solvency has been impacted by the pension levy which has resulted in semi-State pensioners burdened with a levy on their pensions for life and should the pensioner pre-decease a spouse, the levy would also apply to the spouse&rsquo;s reduced pension, half-pension, of what the pensioner had for the spouse's lifetime.<\/p> <p>  The minimum funding standard as applied in Ireland needs greater flexibility in reserve calculations and on quoted costs of annuities which can overstate the costs of annuity purchase.  This has been stated by the Minister but we are waiting for her to effect any amendments to the Bill going through the D&aacute;il at the moment.  In fact, I am amazed the Bill, as it currently stands, has only two items on pensions and they are timing items.  There is absolutely nothing else in the general scheme.  I cannot understand why that has happened.  The ability of the State to apply levies by means of stamp duties or similar charges to pension funds, which we should remember are the private property of the scheme members, is legal but morally indefensible.  It would not encourage those who may be auto-enrolled in future proposed State-employer-employee schemes to remain in them if the funds are liable to be levied in times of financial stress.<\/p> <p>  Provision in actuarial assumptions for annual percentage increases in pensions which are known will not to be paid create even further liability on pension funds and push the funds further into apparent deficit.  Semi-State workers employed before 1995 in many State organisations differ from other employees in that a condition of employment was obligatory membership of the company pension scheme and exclusion from qualification for a State contributory pension.  It is implicit that the first tier benefits available to State contributory pensions are included in semi-State employee and pensioner benefits.  The pension freeze has ignored the fact that since it started in 2008, an approximate 9% increase in State contributory pensions took place during the pension freeze period.<\/p> <p>  When I joined ESB there was a pension promise, which was that pensions would reflect the salary of the job the person left.  This pension promise, implicit in the State pension schemes, has not been honoured during the last ten years and we ask that the committee work to give legal effect to the pension promise and to vindicate the legitimate expectations of pensioners.<\/p> <p>  All of the above factors have impacted to the detriment of semi-State pensioners and need to be addressed in amendments to the Bill.  The omissions mentioned in the general scheme are of great concern to pensioners as is the fact semi-State companies and employer organisations have lobbied to have certain provisions of the general scheme removed or not included in the Bill.<\/p><p>In summary, the Minister said proposed amendments were intended to be introduced on Committee Stage to allow an employer to walk away after a 12 month notification period with a possible funding obligation by the employer to be determined by the Pensions Authority.  This would be insufficient to provide adequate protection for pensioners, because an employer could walk away after 12 months and abandon the pension scheme.  We urge the committee to make efforts to have these protections included in the Bill.<br\/><br\/>I will summarise the three contributions in seven points.  First, legislation is necessary to enable representation and arbitration for pensioners.  As Ms<b><\/b>de Buitl&eacute;ir said, our groups have been trying to engage with everyone and we have nowhere left to go.  Representation is no good without arbitration.  Second, a definition is needed to identify what body should have the ultimate responsibility for funding deficits in public sector companies.  Third, flexibility in the minimum funding standards must be provided to avoid overstatement of liabilities in the pension funds which result in the pension freeze.  Fourth, the extension of employer debt should include a balance of funding proposals beyond a walk-away period of 12 months.  Fifth, legal effect must be given to the pension promise to meet the legitimate expectations of pensioners.  Sixth, it is necessary to have a constitutional prohibition on the imposition of levies or similar charges on pension funds legitimately set up under the legislation for the pension auto-enrolment proposal.  Tomorrow, we will hold a constitutional referendum on blasphemy, an issue that does not affect many people.  Pension legislation affects hundreds of thousands of pensioners of semi-State companies.  I do not know what has happened to the proposal to amend the Constitution.  Perhaps Deputy O'Dea can comment on that.  Finally, pensioner representative organisations must be included in consultations to identify funding standard reform options and provide balance and equity.<br\/><br\/>One of the big problems we face is that organisations and State agencies will agree to speak only to individual pensioners.  Individual pensioners do not have the ability to represent the entire body of pensioners.  It is vital that organisations representing pensioners are allowed to engage in representations.  Pensioners are facing IBEC and semi-State corporations and, as such, we cannot be represented by individuals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018102500002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matt Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1540458600,"counter":1492,"content":"<p>I have one quick question.

We were as surprised as the witnesses to note that certain sections that we had discussed in pre-legislative scrutiny did not appear in the Bill when it was published.  When I spoke in the D&aacute;il in July 2017, just before the summer recess, the Minister stated clearly that substantial amendments would be introduced on Committee Stage.  The committee has written to the Minister on a number of occasions pointing out that we are still waiting for amendments to appear more than a year after the pre-legislative scrutiny.  We had anticipated, perhaps wrongly, that the select committee would deal with Committee Stage of the Bill in late 2017.  We have corresponded with the Minister urging that the amendments to the Bill be dealt with because she has not introduced amendments.

I thank the witnesses for attending and for their excellent presentations.  My views on the minimum funding standard, the solvency of pension funds and how pensions are calculated are fairly well known.  The current provisions in this regard are insane and bear no relationship to reality.<\/p> <p>  As the Chairman will be aware, I had an amendment to previous legislation passed by the D&aacute;il requiring the Pensions Authority to produce a number of models for the Oireachtas to consider.  However, as the legislation has been parked and currently resides somewhere in the Bermuda Triangle, we do not know what the position is in that regard.  We will continue to press for the introduction of legislation, however.  The accountancy type rules are irrelevant and have resulted, as the witnesses correctly noted, in many defined benefit pension schemes being declared insolvent when they were not insolvent.<\/p> <p>  The major issue is access and lack of representation.  I do not know how many pensioners of semi-State companies there are but I expect the figure is considerable.  At this stage in 2018, it is beyond bizarre that such a large group has no avenue through which to make a complaint.  Members of private pension schemes have access to the Pensions Ombudsman and various organs, whereas pensioners of semi-State companies have no such access.  We must address this in the forthcoming legislation, if we ever get to see it.  The Minister has been promising to bring it back to the House for more than 14 months and we will push for it to come before us.  We will debate a social welfare Bill that will reflect changes introduced in the budget.  I do not see any reason to further delay this legislation, which has lain in abeyance for so long.<\/p> <p>  As the Chairman pointed out, the heads of a Bill were discussed by the committee.  They included certain protections, which in my view were not adequate.  When the Bill was published, however, these provisions had disappeared, although the Minister promised to introduce substantial amendments to reflect the earlier heads.  We are still waiting to see these amendments.  The initial proposals were based to some extent on a Private Members' Bill I introduced to provide substantial protections for people in defined benefit pension schemes.  These protections would not have brought the pensions industry to its knees or caused the sky to fall in because they were modelled largely on what had been done in the United Kingdom for defined benefit pension schemes.  They were not, therefore, extraordinarily radical.  They were, however, a significant step forward when compared with what we have now, namely, virtually nothing.<\/p> <p>  It is self-defeating nonsense to propose a charge on the assets of the company because of non-payment of pension provisions for a 12 month period.  It would not achieve anything and could have unintended consequences that would have the opposite effect of what was intended in the first place.  That point was discussed during the debate.<\/p> <p>  It is extraordinary that despite the representative groups of the semi-State sector having no access to bodies such as the Pensions Ombudsman, decisions by actuaries and trustees that members of certain funds were entitled to a pensions increase have not been implemented.  Companies and employers have been able to ignore these decisions.  I am familiar, for example, with the position in CI&Eacute;, whose pensioners are not represented today.  Under an agreement reached in 1994, two pensions schemes that were heavily in deficit were amalgamated with a scheme that was not in deficit.<\/p><p>As a <i>quid pro quo<\/i>, the company undertook to pay pension increases to retired staff as salaries increased, but that has not been honoured despite the fact that the actuary recommended it in some cases.  I see now that even though the trustees of RT&Eacute; have recommended a 2.5% pension increase, that is not being paid.  That strikes me as a bit ironic given what I remember from being involved in a current affairs programme in RT&Eacute; at the time of the controversy concerning Independent Newspapers.  I met a large number of journalists, producers and programme managers out there who were bursting with indignation at the carry-on of Independent Newspapers, yet here we have RT&Eacute; refusing to pay retired staff a pension increase of 2.5% as recommended by its own trustees.  There is a great deal of hypocrisy in this country of which this is just another example.<br\/><br\/>We put forward legislation to prevent future Governments of whatever persuasion from imposing levies.  As the witnesses correctly pointed out, the fact that a levy can still be imposed is a deterrent and will certainly slow down the auto-enrolment process when it comes in as people will be tempted to opt out.  Many people will probably opt out if a levy is imposed at some stage.  There were some genuine constitutional difficulties with that and we have committed to resubmit the legislation.  I hope we will be able to get all of those things done while the current D&aacute;il is still in existence.  We are committed to that.  The immediate issue is amendments to the forthcoming legislation to protect people like the witnesses and those in defined benefit pension schemes generally.  That legislation has been due here for the past 14 months.  We will get ahead with drafting some of those amendments.  I thank the witnesses for their suggestions which will help us in the work we are doing in that regard.  They can rest assured that we will have the appropriate amendments drafted if there is anything else they want us to include or if they have concrete suggestions apart from what they say here.  They should, by all means, send them on to us.  We have done our work and are simply waiting for the Minister to republish the legislation so that we can give effect to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018102500002#F00500","speaker":"1227","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1540458600,"counter":1497,"content":"<p>I thank everyone who presented.  This is an issue, as the Chairman has said, on which the committee has been pressing.  We have raised the matter in private session and corresponded on it consistently over the past two years.  I proposed amendments to the Social Welfare Bill in December 2016.  These were not on the semi-State companies but on defined benefit schemes and one of the newspaper chains.  We were assured at the time that speedy action would be taken.  That is what we were promised and it is what we facilitated by moving our schedule as a committee in early 2017.  We examined the heads of the Bill, which has gone into complete abeyance since.  There are many valid concerns and serious questions need to be asked regarding any future auto-enrolment scheme also.  I have concerns about a constitutional provision in respect of levies.  There may, honestly, be issues in that regard.  However, I strongly support the other matters.<\/p> <p>  It is important to note regarding employees such as the witnesses that the question of representation is a fundamental one.  It is key.  This is part of a relationship they have had.  It was a collective relationship and the measures secured and required were the result of collective action.  It is part of an ongoing relationship.  I worked with Older &amp;amp; Bolder for many years and I believe fundamentally in the right of people to continue to organise and speak and represent themselves collectively.  That is fundamental in relationships with organisations and companies.  Certainly, a divide and conquer approach to individuals who must fight and take cases alone is not acceptable.<\/p> <p>  There is a particular question for semi-State bodies here.  As pointed out very eloquently by the witnesses, this is not a matter in which people had a choice in many cases.  It is not a provision which was there as an option for persons.  It is one thing I would be cautious of when talking about auto-enrolment schemes and so forth.  They are supplementary pension schemes but what was offered by semi-State companies is the core pension of employees.  It is the fundamental basis for the witnesses to live the rest of their lives.  In many cases, albeit not all, the option to engage with the contributory State pension was not available.  When we have had presentations from the Department, it has been very clear on the different purposes of the contributory State pension which is, for example, aimed at ensuring an adequacy of income.  It is a core standard.  The supplementary pension is intended then to increase the level of replacement income.  The idea is that the witnesses are entitled to fundamental security.  This is not a speculative pension.  It is not additional or supplementary.  This is their security and they were required to pay into it.  There should be a clear message, as I think it was put in the heads of the Bill, that this is a debt.  It is something which is owed and there is a duty and responsibility in respect of its delivery.  We need to be very clear.  I am worried not only that there seems to be a slipping away but that there is an idea that we can have this debt but it will disappear after 12 months or we will walk away.  Frankly, that is completely unacceptable.  This is the core and foundational contract of employment.  It is a contract made by the State via its bodies.  That is fundamental and it can be fought tooth and nail.<\/p> <p>  As well as the idea that a responsibility cannot be evaded, there is a question of risk.  I am very concerned by the correspondence we have received about the national broadcaster looking at a contract for advisers to look at mitigating risks.  The risks to be mitigated do not include the risk that former employees may have inadequate replacement income or income to cover the fundamentals they need to plan the rest of their lives and to live well.  The risks considered appear to be risks to the organisation, namely, regulatory, operational, legislative or legal risks.  It is very clear and important.  This was a big debate when we came to supplementary income.  It was about where risk sat and whether it would be placed on the individual.  Where does the risk sit and where does the guarantee sit?  From my perspective, there must be a fundamental level in the proposed supplementary pension system whereby the risk sits with the State, which is proposing the scheme, or with the company if a pension company is contracted regarding a universal supplementary retirement savings scheme.  One cannot have a situation where risk is spread out to the individuals given what we saw in 2008 when private pension schemes lost 38% of their value and individuals took the hit.  That is fundamental.  That is a fundamental argument on the supplementary scheme but it is much more serious for the witnesses because this is a core pension.  This is first-tier pension whereas the supplementary pension is second-tier.  I underscore that because we could get lost.  I support the witnesses very much in that.<\/p> <p>  I would appreciate comments from the witnesses on their experience as persons paying into pensions of making choices at the time and what their expectations were.  I ask about their plans, not as individuals, but for those they represent.  What were the legitimate expectations?  I imagine that very few of the witnesses were saying they hoped stocks would go up and that they would get a fabulous dividend.  I think people went in with the idea that they were planning for the long term.  I ask them to reflect on that.  I ask the witnesses to elaborate on the concern that there is a very large tender contract of &euro;500,000 going out on the mitigation of risks.  Does anyone from RT&Eacute; wish to comment on that?  I thank the witnesses.  I had one other point, but I have lost track of it in the discussion.  I might get a chance to get back in later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018102500002#G00200","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1540458600,"counter":1498,"content":"<p>We might get back to the Senator again.

I refer to the triple lock system that represents a block in terms of increases.  What specific measures are required in that regard?  Is it to push for transparency in the way that is exercised?  Is it about ensuring that employer approval is removed completely from that process?  In terms of the scheme solvency, minimum funding standard and actuarial opinion and assumptions, there are many hoops to jump through before an increase is given.  Should removing that extra hoop of employer approval be the first move we should make?  Is it to do with transparency?

The minimum funding standard is there to be amended in the Bill currently before the D&aacute;il.  As Teachta O'Dea stated, the minimum funding standard affects the liabilities of pension schemes.  The liabilities of pension schemes are used as blocks.<\/p> <p>  On the other point about actuarial opinion, we would see actuarial opinion where assumptions are made on facts.  Assumptions are made when we do not know what is going to happen but when assumptions are made in the full knowledge that there is a pension freeze in place for at least ten years, that puts an extra liability of approximately &euro;700 million on the ESB pension fund, which is the one I am familiar with.  Actuarial opinion decided last year that those of us in the ESB scheme will live longer than everybody else in the country and thereby lumped a huge liability of an extra hundreds of millions of euro into the pension fund.  It has been reduced this year, although I do not know the reason.  Perhaps it is because we have highlighted the problem.<\/p> <p>  We believe employers have too big an influence on allegedly independent boards of trustees.<\/p><p>The people appointed to boards of trustees by employers are generally highly placed individuals in the companies.  Whereas the trustees are very assiduous in not revealing information to the members we do not know how much information goes back to the employers.  This is something the committee might look at in the context of the IORP II directive that must be in law in the State by 13 January.  I do not know whether it is proposed to implement the directive via the pensions Bill or from where it will come.  I have not seen it mentioned anywhere.

From the committee's point of view, the presentations made by the witnesses were certainly eye-opening.  Most of us were unaware of the lower-end pensions referred to, whereby people from semi-State bodies are on pensions that are less than the State pension.  Ms de Buitl&eacute;ir indicated people are on pensions that are 20% less than &euro;12,000.  That was an eye-opener.  Mr. Kelly gave us averages on others.  This type of information has been very useful to the committee because it is not something of which we would generally be aware.<\/p> <p>  The committee is also concerned about the lack of access and information and the difficulty with this.  As the witnesses indicated, people can go the legal route if they have very deep pockets but it is not a route that most people can access.  The presentations have been very helpful and informative.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Dea referred to the minimum funding standard in quite a level of detail and colleagues have indicated from their own point of view that on Committee Stage of the Bill they would be prepared to table and make amendments.
