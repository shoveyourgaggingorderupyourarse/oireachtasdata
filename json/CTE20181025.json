When the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills appeared before the committee when we were dealing with Cork Institute of Technology, CIT, the Marine Institute and problems that arose there, I asked about reviews of public private partnerships and the very lengthy periods that are allowed to elapse before they are reviewed and now, at least in one instance but potentially in more than 40 others where there may be difficulties, schoolchildren will have no school to go to in the next few weeks.  In terms of value for money, this is a very serious issue.  Clearly, a level of oversight, enforcement and inspection took place during the construction of those schools but the problems that have emerged certainly seem to suggest those processes and procedures were defective.  Perhaps there are new procedures.  We should move quickly to request the people from, I presume, the building unit of the Department of Education and Skills to come before us to give an account of what seem to be clear failings in the system that operated at the time these schools were being constructed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018102500002#B00300","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1540454400,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I support what Deputy MacSharry has said.  This is a very serious issue.  It involves more than 40 schools and it may involve more.  We all saw the images of the schoolchildren and their parents locked out of their school yesterday.  I imagine temporary arrangements will have to be made which will involve a cost.  There will be a cost involved for the taxpayer even in relocating the students.  We do not know what remedial works will have to be carried out in all these schools to bring them up to the required standards.  There are issues regarding contracts, regulation, enforcement and the other issues that have been raised.  Would it be wise for us to request a detailed note from the Department on the number of and nature of the contracts for each of these schools and the number of schools involved?  When we request that note, perhaps unfortunately more schools might be added to that list.  We need a very detailed note on that.  We also need to know the nature of the problems involved.  We need as much information as we can get on it for the next meeting and we can determine then how we can map this from this committee's perspective.  We should definitely write to the Secretary General of the Department today and get as much information as possible.  The big issue is the way it will affect the children concerned, but from our perspective there is the value for money aspect and the additional costs involved, which I imagine is a guaranteed.  Unfortunately, there will be an additional cost involved for the taxpayer.  We need to understand what happened, why, and what lessons will be learned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018102500002#B00400","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1540454400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>When the tender was done, one of the factors that saved money at the time was not having somebody on site to monitor the building.

Next week is the mid-term break in schools and assessments will be done and probably more information will become available after that.

We should ask it at this stage for the contract price for each of the schools involved.  If we are sorting out the money side of this issue, we need to know the global cost of what is involved.  We want to be specific on that.  I propose that we write to the Department and ask that it reply by 13 November, as we have a meeting on 15 November.  The Department will need a week or two to reply.  If we get a quick reply, it will not be remotely complete.  We will give it at least a fortnight and there will be updates on that.  I am sure the Joint Committee on Education and Skills will deal with this issue but we will focus on the points that were mentioned, namely, the teaching, alternative accommodation, and the health and safety of students.  The joint committee will inevitably deal with that latter aspect.<\/p> <p>  A substantial element of the issue, however, involves the contract, the procurement process, the tendering, supervision and cost of the project.  Regarding each contract, and the Department can give us the information in a variety of ways, but, in terms of the company that won the contract to build the schools, I want to know what was the next highest price submitted by the alternative contractors.  Did the company that was awarded the contract come in as the cheapest all round?  In terms of its bid, where was it in the ranking?  Was it marginally below the second one on the list or was it well below it?  We would be worried if it was very well below the industry norm at the time.  If it was, that in itself should have set off alarm bells.  We want to examine that tendering process.  We will seek that additional information from the Department on each of the tenders.  We will ask it to give us as much information as it can supply by 13 November.  That is a good two weeks away, and at that stage we can assess the issue at our meeting on 15 November.  That is very helpful and I thank the members for raising that issue.<\/p> <p>  The next item on the agenda is correspondence received since the last meeting.

She does not answer the question.  The information is interesting, but when I read it for the third time, I realised she did not answer the question.  There is a very short paragraph that I want to read out.  We had asked for a note on the &euro;24 billion sale of underlying assets with a geographic breakdown of where the purchasers were located.  That was straightforward.  The reply is three sentences:<\/p><blockquote>Since inception, &euro;24 billion has been generated from the sales of secured assets by NAMA debtors and receivers.  Of this, &euro;13.2 billion was generated from the sales of assets located outside of Ireland.  Based on our analysis, the geographic location of the purchasers of assets located in Ireland is set out in the table.<\/blockquote> <p>They have given us a table but we asked for a breakdown of the &euro;24 billion and the geographic breakdown of where the purchasers were located.  In the second sentence, she confirms that &euro;13.2 billion or 55% of the assets were located outside Ireland, but the banks and loans fell to the Irish taxpayer.  I am not worried about where the property was that fell to the Irish taxpayer.  Then she proceeds to give us a breakdown of the locations of the purchasers of the 45% of the assets that were located in Ireland.  She only gave us a breakdown of a subset of the &euro;24 billion.  We will send it straight back and say we want the original question answered.  She broke our question into two halves and answered one half of it.  That is not satisfactory.  We will note and publish it but we are writing back for a proper answer.<\/p><p>Next is<b><\/b>No. 1659 B from Mr Robert Watt, Secretary General, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, providing information requested by the committee on the costs incurred by the State for the recent visit by Pope Francis to Ireland.  The original inquiry referenced article 44.2 of the Constitution, which provides that the State guarantees not to endow any religion. We will note and publish the response.  The response says that the Papal visit will not cost any more than the &euro;20 million budget approved for the visit.

I think there is an issue in respect of one or two things.

We need a breakdown of the &euro;14.1 million from the OPW.  That is reasonable.  We will write directly to the OPW as the Deputy has suggested.  In the meantime we will note and publish this.<\/p> <p>  Next is No. 1662 B from Mr Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, providing an update to the committee regarding the transfer of properties in respect of contributions from religious congregations towards the costs incurred by the State in responding to residential institutional child abuse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018102500002#D00400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1540454400,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I welcome the update from Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;.  It is clear.  What is not clear is why it has taken so long.  Going back to the 2002 indemnity agreement, 16 years later, five properties remain to be transferred fully.  It was expected that four of these properties would have transferred by the end of quarter 3 of this year.  The current position is that three of the five will transfer by the end of the year, one by the first half of next year, and I do not know when the fifth will transfer.  That is outstanding.<\/p> <p>  If we go to the 2009 voluntary offers, I have followed matters up with the assistance of the Chair, who has been very attentive to it.  They arose as a result of the Ryan report and its damning findings.  Properties were offered on a voluntary basis.  We were led to believe there would be no difficulty.  That was in 2009 and of those 18 properties, nine still have not been transferred in 2018.  I see that there is progress and that a lot of those buildings and properties are in use by various State bodies.  I welcome that.<\/p> <p>  Coming to Galway and St. Anne's, Lenaboy, if anything typifies or brings into acute focus this whole scheme it is Lenaboy in Galway, which I think is empty since 2009 although I am told it has been empty officially since 2011.  Galway City Council announced it was a gift.  I have gone into that background and will not do so again.  It was not a gift.  It was given by way of redress.  It has, inexplicably, remained empty since 2009 or at least 2011, and now we are told that a geophysical survey was carried out.  I realise that was under way.  I did not realise the city council had requested it.  I understand that the results of the geophysical survey have not yet been provided to the congregation.  A geophysical survey was commissioned.  It is very important to see the results.<\/p> <p>  The context of the mother and baby home in Tuam is only relevant to today's proceedings insofar as we again have a Minister saying that the sisters of the Bon Secours are willing to give so much money.  We are back again.  We do not know the circumstances.  It seems the Minister approached them for a contribution but it is not put in context.  It is very important to give context in these matters.  The context here is that this particular building at Lenaboy was never given as a gift.  It was given as redress and it is inexplicably empty and deteriorating at a terrible rate since it became empty.  In this regard and in respect of the other ones, I simply do not understand the role of the Department of Education and Skills or how it failed to ensure these agreements were complied with in a more speedy fashion.  I do welcome the Department's continual updates and I welcome the progress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018102500002#D00500","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1540454400,"counter":55,"content":"<p>Some of these are from 2002 and 2009.  Obviously the 2002 properties are a legal obligation and the 2009 ones are a moral obligation.  Given the particular sector in question, I would have thought the moral obligation would have been almost on a par with the legal obligation, but so be it.  We have all said this kind of stuff before.<\/p> <p>  I want to find out about one or two practical things.  The HSE and the Department of Education and Skills are pursuing the matter with different organisations because some of the facilities are being used, for example No. 15, the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  There is work being pursued on one of them.  I am talking about No. 15.  This offer comprises the lease of land for the operation of the National Rehabilitation Hospital and the transfer of a 33 acre site.  It is stated that this transfer will facilitate the redevelopment of the hospital.<\/p><p>That project is under way.<\/p><p> The final paragraph states that work on this complex transfer is progressing but is taking longer than expected.  The estimated timeframe for completion is the third quarter of 2019.  Is the lack of clear title and spending of public money on a development delaying that?  Is there duplication going on between the Department of Education and Skills and the HSE?  How is that working in practice?  It costs money to follow this up.  Is the lack of clear title causing a problem?  Since the HSE has an involvement, perhaps we should ask it about that and about how it relates to the Department of Education and Skills.  A few relate to the HSE, not just that one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018102500002#D00600","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1540454400,"counter":57,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

This has been going on for 16 years.  I want to say to the Accounting Officer that it says something about how the Department of Education and Skills follows up issues relating to taxpayers' money.  I hope it does not have broader implications across the public service.  As a result of our previous meeting, the committee asked for a breakdown report by report.  On 23 July, Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; wrote to us with a detailed breakdown.  He gave us those commitments, we did not ask him to do so.  In respect of each of the outstanding properties, we asked him to provide a breakdown as to the position at the end of June 2018 and the timescale for completion.  That letter was dated 23 July.  I am referring to the commitments he voluntarily gave last June.  Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; outlined which items would be completed by the end of September.  We gave him further time.  At the end of September, we asked him how he had got on in respect of the commitments he gave to the committee in writing in June.<\/p> <p>  I will now outline the current situation.  I have the letter Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; sent to the committee in June.  The heading is \"Properties not fully and finally completed under the 2002 agreement\".  We are discussing the 2002 agreement.  Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; told us in July that the estimated date for completion regarding the property at Waterpark, Newtown Road, County Waterford, was the end of September.  That was his commitment.  Today, he states that the estimated timeframe has moved to the second quarter of 2019.  Not only did he not meet the commitment he gave to us for the end of September, in his most recent letter he has moved the completion date out by nine months to the end of next June.  That is unacceptable.<\/p> <p>  The next property Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; mentions is Coisc&eacute;im, Cappoquin, County Waterford.  The commitment he provided in respect of that property was that the estimated timeframe for completion was the end of September.  That had been revised from the previous quarter.  What happened with that commitment for the end of September?  The estimated timeframe is now the end of the fourth quarter.  That has been moved back by three months and the commitment not been delivered upon.<\/p> <p>  The next item on Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;'s list was the fifth item on his list for the last day.  It refers to the Sacred Heart centre in Waterford.  The estimated time he gave the committee for completion in that instance was the end of September.  That had also been moved already from a previous commitment.  His response to us today is that it is now being pushed back a further three months.<\/p> <p>  In the context of the 2002 agreement, none of the three commitments Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; gave to us in writing has been honoured.  That is the problem.  I do not mind once it has been done but I am not going to have people give commitments to this committee in writing and then fail to honour them.  There has been 100% failure to meet the deadlines.  They are Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;'s deadlines.  We will accept the current deadlines he has provided.

I am concerned that the HSE is not fully up to speed with the situation.  The HSE did not exist in 1997 so, presumably, the reference is to the relevant health board.  This group was charging a daily rate, in the normal way, of &euro;12.50 and, in addition, was charging people for incontinence wear.  The issue was pursued by a long-term resident's family and eventually the HSE and the group were dragged, kicking and screaming, to reimburse some money to the individuals' families.<\/p> <p>  The note before us states that those involved have got all their money but I have information to suggest otherwise and that some people were not reimbursed for the period 1997 to 2001.  A family raised the issue in 2013 and was refunded &euro;6,000 out of a possible &euro;21,000, meaning &euro;15,000 remained outstanding.  On the back of the 2005 change, the Minister of the day, Mary Harney, introduced legislation to deal with illegal charges.  However, for this one resident, the service decided to impose a retrospective, long-term-stay charge to reduce the &euro;15,000 that it may have been applicable to return.  The situation continued for a number of years, with families being put through an extraordinary level of difficulty.  Questions were not answered and there is a deeper problem than is covered in this note.  I would like the section 38 organisation, along with the appropriate people from the HSE, to join us in order to discuss the matter in more detail.  This note suggests that the synergy project, Mary Harney's legislation and the HSE's own initiatives, dealt with the problem but that is not the case.  The evidence will show that those involved were dragged, kicking and screaming, to acknowledge this as an issue and to refund the money in full.  To this day, moneys from the period 1997 to 2001 remain outstanding for some families.  I also have concerns that the Ombudsman closed the case without adequately dealing with all the facts.<\/p> <p>  Public money has been provided to the Brothers of Charity Services - most recently &euro;105,335, on a once-off basis, for this year - so we could usefully have this section 38 organisation before us, together with the appropriate people from the HSE.  In advance, and, if necessary, with names redacted, they might provide us with details of how much was charged to these individuals, how much was refunded and when.

The letter reassures us that the Department is monitoring this matter closely and that an audit committee, on which the Minister is represented, has been set up and meets regularly.  I remain concerned, however, that there is no performance delivery agreement for the Galway 2020 programme.  I have asked numerous parliamentary questions and followed the issue up here.  I have been informed that it is coming and that the terms of the agreement set out the conditions for the release of the funds.  Presumably, this means that they will do so.  We are talking about &euro;15 million.  Some &euro;250,000 has already been disbursed and a further &euro;6 million will be disbursed in 2019.<\/p> <p>  I am raising this matter because we have been here already with the P&aacute;l&aacute;s Cinema.  We have been here with a special chapter from the Department.  All of these are very good ideas.  The P&aacute;l&aacute;s Cinema was a very good idea.  It is a privilege for Galway to be named European Capital of Culture 2020, but the operation of it is a completely different matter.  The performance delivery agreement is at an advanced stage of negotiation.  In the meantime, a series of people have left the board in Galway.  It is interesting that we have a head of programme, a head of production, a director of communications, a director of finance and operations and a head of human resources for Galway 2020, but we do not yet have anyone in charge of the culture and leadership role.

The Galway 2020 programme seriously lacks of someone in charge with, in the Department's terms \"the required creative talent\".<\/p> <p>  I highlight this because we look back on the P&aacute;l&aacute;s Cinema story and we cannot do anything about it.

As the figure indicates, housing-related expenditure accounted for 63% of that expenditure.  The Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency, usually referred to simply as the Housing Agency, operates under the aegis of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The agency&rsquo;s role is to provide a range of support services to assist the Department, local authorities and approved housing bodies in the discharge of their functions.  This includes implementation by the agency of the pyrite remediation scheme.<\/p> <p>  The Housing Agency is mainly funded through State grants.  Its income in 2017 was just over &euro;34 million.  Expenditure in the year was &euro;33.1 million, of which payments under the pyrite remediation scheme accounted for &euro;25.3 million.  The agency has two roles relevant to housing provision that might not be immediately obvious from the principal financial statements.  First, in 2016 and 2017, the agency received capital grant funding of over &euro;70 million from the Department which it used to establish a revolving fund for social housing acquisition.  Using the fund&rsquo;s resources, the Housing Agency acts as an intermediary, purchasing targeted suitable residential properties from banks, investors and other owners.  The properties are then sold on to the relevant approved housing bodies, which are not-for-profit organisations that provide and manage housing for people with a housing need.  Second, at end-2017, the agency held 243 ha of residential development land in 72 locations.  This land was transferred to the agency from local authorities under the land aggregation scheme that operated between 2010 and 2013.  The agency does not have the authority to dispose of or develop the land without ministerial sanction, and carries the land at a token value in the financial statements.<\/p> <p>  I turn now to chapter 10 on funding and oversight of approved housing bodies.  Both local authorities and approved housing bodies are outside my audit remit.  As Members are aware, the local authorities are subject to audit annually by the Local Government Audit Service.  I felt it might be useful to examine how the Department gains assurance about the effectiveness of the use of the resources being channelled through the local authorities to the approved housing bodies.  That examination resulted in the chapter that is before the committee today.<\/p> <p>  The report sets the context for operation of the approved housing bodies by outlining the range of schemes used to provide social housing or to support households in rental accommodation, and the associated costs in 2017.  When we tried to match the scheme expenditure with output data, we found the Department does not currently report outputs on a scheme-by-scheme basis.  We also found that the Department does not report the size of the social housing stock.  It has figures for local authority stocks but not for social housing held by the approved housing bodies.<\/p> <p>  In 2017, the Department provided capital funding of just over &euro;180 million to the approved housing bodies through four schemes.  The schemes involve varying degrees of complexity in terms of flow of funds between the Department, the local authorities, the Housing Finance Agency and the housing bodies.  We have tried to summarise those fund flows in diagrams in the chapter.  The key message from this analysis is that the bulk of the capital funding for the housing bodies' stock of properties comes from public sources.<\/p> <p>  We found there is currently no statutory regulation of the housing bodies.  An interim regulation office was set up within the Housing Agency which launched a voluntary regulation code for such bodies in July 2013.  By mid-2018, 246 bodies had signed up to that code, which represents less than half of the housing bodies registered with the Department.  However, the Department has pointed out that the bodies that have signed up for the voluntary code account for an estimated 95% of the housing stock of the sector.<\/p> <p>  The chapter recommended introducing a process for identifying inactive housing bodies so that they do not retain approved status indefinitely.  The Department has committed to tidying up the register prior to the introduction of statutory regulation.<\/p> <p>  In December 2015, the Local Government Audit Service published a report on the oversight role of local authorities in the provision of social housing by approved housing bodies.  That report recommended that a review and reconciliation of all mortgages charged on housing body properties should be carried out and that a comprehensive management information system should be put in place in local authorities to record details of properties and their tenants.  As we were completing the chapter in September 2018, the Local Government Audit Service was reviewing the implementation of its recommendations.<\/p> <p>  The chapter also makes a recommendation aimed to ensure that the standard requirements in regard to the management of Exchequer grants are met in regard to the oversight of public funds provided to approved housing bodies.  The Department is undertaking a review of all circulars relating to approved housing body activity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018102500002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540454400,"counter":191,"content":"<p>Chairman and members, I am pleased to be here this morning, as Accounting Officer, to assist the committee in its examination of Vote 34, insofar as it relates to housing supply issues, and its consideration of chapter 10 of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s annual report 2017, concerning the funding and oversight of approved housing bodies, AHBs.<\/p> <p>  I am joined by a number of colleagues who the Chairman has already introduced.  As requested, I have provided some advance briefing on housing expenditure and delivery, as well as a range of notes on specific issues of interest that had been raised by the committee, so I will keep these opening comments brief.<\/p> <p>  In terms of Vote 34, the Department&rsquo;s gross voted expenditure on housing programmes, as set out in the subheads of the appropriation account before the committee today, totalled some &euro;1.3 billion in 2017.  This includes an additional &euro;100 million that was provided to the local authority housing and regeneration subheads by way of Supplementary Estimate towards the end of 2017, to meet costs arising from the level of housing-related activity then under way across the country.  A further &euro;98 million was also made available in 2017 from surplus local property tax, LPT, receipts to fund housing programmes, bringing the overall total resourcing for the Department&rsquo;s housing programmes to over &euro;1.4 billion in 2017.<\/p> <p>  The implementation of the Government&rsquo;s Rebuilding Ireland action plan is the core focus of our daily work in the Department and, indeed, across central and local government, as we strive to make meaningful, tangible and sustainable progress towards a better housing landscape.  I and my colleagues in the Department, together with our Ministers, are firmly committed to achieving the maximum outputs possible from State investment, both current and capital, while ensuring that close attention is paid to delivering value for money and tangible housing outcomes for citizens.  We are committed to regular review of policy and delivery and work very closely with colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in this regard.<\/p> <p>  Rebuilding Ireland is a six year action plan, with a very firm emphasis on delivery across the full range of housing mechanisms.  All stakeholders agree that accelerating the delivery of new build activity is absolutely critical.  At the outset of the programme, however, we knew that establishing viable pipelines and building local authority and AHB capacity to expand new build delivery would take time, taking particular account of the significant extent to which house building, both in the general market and of social housing, had contracted.  Therefore, in parallel with driving increased capacity building, we focused also on harnessing the potential of the available housing stock.<\/p> <p>  In summary, Rebuilding Ireland seeks to achieve the delivery of some 50,000 additional social housing homes through build, acquisition and leasing schemes, out to 2021.  A further 87,000 households will have their needs met under the housing assistance payment, HAP, and rental accommodation, RAS, schemes.  The relative contributions of individual programmes to overall delivery is to shift significantly over the course of the six years, taking particular account of the substantial increase in the delivery of new build social housing homes as the programme progresses.<\/p> <p>  During 2017, significant progress was made to deliver on the commitments in Rebuilding Ireland.  In overall terms, housing supports were delivered to some 25,900 households last year, through the range of social housing measures in Rebuilding Ireland, which were significantly ahead of the target of 21,050.  Within this, almost 2,300 new build social housing homes were delivered, more than three times the level in the previous year.  In addition, wider housing supply continued to grow, with the number of new homes becoming available for use reaching 18,222 in 2017, an increase of 29% on 2016.<\/p> <p>  Significant progress was made in 2017 in advancing many social housing projects, through the range of delivery mechanisms and programmes.  By the end of last year, a substantial construction pipeline was in place, which will result in further increases in the number of new social housing homes being built this year and in the coming years.<\/p> <p>  This year is a critical year for delivery.  Pipelines established over the last two years, in particular, are yielding fruit, with the number of private and social homes on-site and completions increasing quarter on quarter.  While this is welcome, there remains very significant further progress to be made right through to the end of the Rebuilding Ireland action plan.  There is absolutely no room for complacency and we continue to actively monitor, refocus as necessary and mobilise the range of players involved in order to achieve our ambitions in what is a very challenging landscape.<\/p> <p>  Nowhere is this more evident than with regard to homelessness.  It is essential that supply continues to increase if we are to address both the backlog of housing demand in the system, and also new demand arising.  While Rebuilding Ireland is heavily focused on this, in the interim we must, and are, continuing to work to provide the most appropriate accommodation possible for those of our citizens who find themselves in immediate housing need.  The programme of family hubs is intended to provide more family-friendly transition accommodation, and the implementation of the HAP placefinder service will further assist families in various types of emergency accommodation to transition into more long-term housing solutions.  One of our key areas of focus is on prevention and avoiding the use of emergency accommodation wherever possible by matching families and individuals in need with appropriate accommodation.<\/p> <p>  While the numbers presenting to homeless services continue to be very challenging, the numbers for whom pathways to more sustainable housing solutions are secured are also increasing significantly.  A record 4,729 adults exited homelessness into an independent tenancy in 2017, with a further 2,332 adults in the first 6 months of this year.<\/p> <p>  Overall, in the first two and a half years of Rebuilding Ireland up to the end of the second quarter of 2018, housing solutions have been delivered for over 57,000 households across all delivery streams.  The impact of this delivery can be seen in the year on year reduction in local authority housing waiting lists.<\/p> <p>  In addition to highlighting outputs, it is critical to mention the pipelines for future delivery, particularly new build homes, that are now being put in place.  The latest social housing construction status report published on the Department&rsquo;s website provides significant detail on projects at various stages of advancement across a range of delivery schemes led by local authorities and AHBs as at the end of the second quarter of this year.  Overall, we can see a substantial increase in the scale of the build programme since end 2016, when it included over 500 projects, delivering more than 8,400 homes.  By end of the second quarter of 2018, the programme had virtually doubled in size to over 1,060 projects and 16,350 homes.  Some 3,518 of these homes have already been delivered, 4,602 more were on site and under construction, and a further 1,577 were at the final pre-construction stage, with the remainder progressing through the various stages of planning, procurement and design.<\/p> <p>  In the second quarter of 2018 alone, projects delivering almost 1,100 homes went on site, an increase of 27% on the previous quarter and an increase of 239% on the second quarter in 2017.<\/p> <p>  Table 1, which I have circulated in the briefing paper, sets out for the information of the committee the key Rebuilding Ireland targets for the period 2016 to 2021 and details the progress that has been made to mid-2018.  Delivering on this scale, and committing to doing even more, is crucially dependent on effective cross-organisational co-operation.  Within the policy and legislative decisions made at political level, the Department provides the funding streams to support delivery.  However, on the ground activity and delivery can only be accelerated by local authorities, the Housing Agency and AHBs working in partnership.<\/p> <p>  Turning to chapter 10, as I have highlighted, AHBs play an important role in our work to address housing need.  Indeed in terms of social housing delivery, it is expected that AHBs will deliver up to one third of all build, acquired and leased social housing homes out to 2021.  Given that the sector has been mandated to deliver on this scale, it is imperative that appropriate structures and oversight mechanisms are in place.  Chapter 10 of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s annual report provides an account of the range of the housing programmes generally, including detail on AHB delivery and the associated funding and oversight arrangements for local authorities to deliver social housing supports in partnership with AHBs.  Funding under these programmes is provided by<\/p> <p>my Department directly to local authorities, which in turn advance the funding to AHBs, as appropriate, with robust arrangements and agreements in place in order to ensure value for money and quality delivery.<\/p> <p>  A number of years ago, the Department recognised the need to put in place a more comprehensive regulatory regime for the AHB sector, beyond that which had been put in place historically under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992.  Rather than wait for the development of legislative proposals for this purpose, in parallel, a voluntary regulation code, entitled, Building for the Future - A Voluntary Regulation Code for Approved Housing Bodies in Ireland, was put in place as an interim step.  The implementation of the code is overseen by the interim regulation committee, IRC, based in the Housing Agency.  Since the code was put in place, any AHB applying for housing funding from the Department and local authorities must furnish proof of compliance with the code.  This interim arrangement will be built on by a new statutory regime, which will include placing the code on a statutory basis.  The Department is at an advanced stage in preparing the necessary legislation under which the regulator will be responsible for approving and registering housing bodies, setting standards for the sector and ensuring AHB compliance with the standards, and will be provided with the necessary powers to fulfil that role.  Subject to Government approval, it is expected that the Bill will be published in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>  In these opening remarks, I have touched on the important work of my Department, local authorities, the AHBs and other partner bodies to address the housing challenges that we face and to support our most vulnerable citizens, while managing long-term programmes to create a clear pathway to a more stable and sustainable housing sector.  I and my colleagues will be happy to respond to questions or issues that emerge in the course of the committee&rsquo;s work today.

The Housing Agency works with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, local authorities, approved housing bodies and others in the public and private sectors in meeting the current and future housing needs and demands.  For example, in the last few weeks, the Housing Agency has provided an apartment building to one of the homeless charities; has concluded an agreement to deliver a large housing project for Dublin City Council; and has finalised an agreement to deliver 155 housing and apartments for social and affordable rental housing on Housing Agency land in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.<\/p><p>The Housing Agency supports direct delivery initiatives such as the acquisition of vacant properties from banks centrally through the use of a &euro;70 million revolving fund.  A total of 487 properties have been acquired to date.  The agency also sources properties and potential developments for local authorities and AHBs.  It addresses homelessness by acquiring and refurbishing vacant properties for permanent accommodation, including suitable homes for families and for the Housing First initiative.  The agency sources properties for family hubs and supported temporary accommodation.  It works with NAMA and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in the acquisition of properties from NAMA's loan portfolio.  A total of 2,475 houses and apartments have been delivered to date.  The agency provides procurement services for local authorities and AHBs.  It manages and develops sites that it owns.  It centrally supports the implementation of the housing strategy for people with disabilities.<\/p><p> The Housing Agency undertakes a significant amount of work in research and supporting policy development.  Specifically, it prepares the annual summary assessment of housing need report and the national statement on housing supply and demand.  The agency works on supporting affordability measures through the central management of specific schemes such as the mortgage to rent scheme, the underwriting of local authority Rebuilding Ireland home loan applications and the provision of support for the Department as it develops affordable housing purchase arrangements and a cost rental scheme.  It provides the interim regulatory function for AHBs and is working in partnership with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government towards the transition to a statutory regulation.  The agency remediates homes under the pyrite remediation scheme and has remediated 1,237 homes to date.<\/p><p> The primary objective of the Housing Agency is to promote the building of sustainable communities that last in places that are well planned.  We promote the development of good quality housing in places where people want to live and have opportunities.  The four key features of good housing are security, quality, affordability and appropriateness.  Our housing stock needs to be appropriate in size and accessible.  The location of housing should meet current and future needs.  The Housing Agency has undertaken a great deal of additional work in the past two years to assist in dealing with the significant housing challenges we face.  We are committed to ensuring financial probity, good governance structures and efficient measures are in place to meet the remit and objectives of the Housing Agency.  <\/p><p> I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff for their assistance and courtesy during the conducting of the audit.

It states there has been a surplus of local property tax receipts to fund housing programmes and gives figures for 2016 to 2018, inclusive.  This year's figure is &euro;92 million, for example.  The Department confirmed to us not that long ago that a review of its baselines was under way.  The amount of money involved could change significantly.  Population has not been accounted for in determining the baselines since they were established in 2000 or thereabouts.  There is a significant shortfall in some of the larger local authorities, which are the ones contributing to the local property tax pool.  Not all local authorities make a contribution to it, only those in the likes of Dublin, some commuter belt counties, Galway and Cork, which are the likely winners in a reconfiguration if the baselines change.

Very often there is a degree of spin, not necessarily from the Department but politically, on the number of houses built, as opposed, for example, to housing assistance payments, HAP, leasing and various other schemes.  One of the things that is referenced in the report is the lack of clarity.  A recommendation was made on foot of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report that there was a need to have a more transparent approach.  The Comptroller and Auditor General said that, in addition to the current output report, the Department should consider reporting on the output of social housing support schemes on a scheme by scheme basis, both to assist its oversight and increase transparency.

In fact, when we started out initially, we would probably have had more scheme by scheme-type specific reporting of the kind to which the Comptroller and Auditor General referred.  We would have said so many homes had been delivered using the capital advance leasing facility and so many under the capital assistance scheme, but the view we were getting back was that they were terms we understood but that people generally did not.  We moved from it to a programme of reporting.  We publish data every quarter, fundamentally built around the build, acquisition and lease scheme, the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and the HAP scheme.  In terms of the recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General, the form of reporting we have and what he is recommending are not incompatible because we can tell behind these broad categories what the individual schemes are.

Clearly, on the basis of capital cost, it would not have been possible to fund that because the capital resources were not available.  It would also not have been deliverable in the timeframe required because construction takes time and, as we know, construction had virtually ground to a halt.  The mix of approaches between construction, acquisition, lease, RAS and HAP, that are in Rebuilding Ireland reflect a policy balance between getting as many units as possible through the capital side while also determining what was needed on the current programme side to be able to achieve the 50,000 by 2021.<\/p> <p>  Historically, we got into the business of leasing-type programmes in 2008 or 2009, when the market had crashed.

The conclusion that the service came to was that in certain parts of the country, it may be more expensive, while in other parts of the country, it is less so.  The broad conclusion arrived at was that the change in the mix of housing delivery mechanisms more towards capital delivered mechanisms over the course of Rebuilding Ireland was the way to go.  When we get to 2021, for example, we will deliver more housing solutions in that year through build, acquisition and lease rather than through RAS and HAP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018102500002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1540454400,"counter":252,"content":"<p>Is that the totality of the documents to which we can refer in terms of answering the questions I asked about evaluations having been done from a value for money perspective?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018102500002#P00300","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540454400,"counter":253,"content":"<p>We would do various value for money tests according as different programmes are being rolled out, but in terms of the broad current versus capital question, there would have been the analysis in 2011 and the more recent analysis as part of the budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018102500002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1540454400,"counter":254,"content":"<p>We are continually being told that it takes time to build houses, that there is a pipeline and a lead-in time and so forth.

My focus since I came into the D&aacute;il has mainly been on health, and HSE representatives tend to get a fair beating in the media when things are not going well.  I am very conscious of the fact that many of the witnesses here today also get the raw end of the stick sometimes, even though they are doing their very best.<\/p> <p>  I will start with Brexit.  I believe the Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government has commissioned a report on the impact of Brexit on the housing and homelessness situation in this country.  This is coming down the tracks, possibly very quickly.  It has been suggested that up to 500,000 people in the UK exist in a sort of no man's land and that after Brexit, there is a risk that they may end up here.  This could cause problems and exert serious pressure on our system.  If the witnesses know anything about that or have done any preliminary work on it, I ask them to speak on it and outline how we might deal with it.<\/p> <p>  Last week or the week before, representatives of the OPW were before this committee.  They told us that they use the British standards of the Royal College of Chartered Surveyors when calculating the size of a building.  In terms of buildings, if we photocopy what is done in the UK and use it here, what impact will any changes in regulatory alignment have on our system?  Will there be any issues with regard to materials or products that we import from the UK and the related building standards associated with those products? <\/p> <p>  The second issue I want to raise is Traveller accommodation.  It is my understanding that local authorities have a ring-fenced budget for accommodation for members of the Traveller community but it is often not spent in its entirety.   At the same time, as is evidenced by recent media reports, there are still many people from that community seeking accommodation.<\/p><p>Perhaps Mr. McCarthy could give me some indications of the barriers in the development of Traveller accommodation despite the resources being there?  What are the additional complexities that may be associated with the housing of members of the Traveller community?  Perhaps it is not as simple as giving a house or a bed and there are far more complex issues to consider.  I am thinking of lifestyle issues such as connections with the equine industry.  I am also speaking about complex medical needs that require additional equipment at home.  Will Mr. McCarthy outline that it is maybe not as simple as putting somebody in a bed.  Will Mr. McCarthy answer those questions first and we will go back then?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018102500002#P02200","speaker":"1297","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540454400,"counter":273,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  On the first issue, I cannot attest to the figure of 500,000 people the Deputy referred to.  There is a difference between the UK and Ireland.  In Ireland if families or individuals present as homeless, even though they may not strictly have entitlement to housing services within the law, they are provided with emergency housing supports on a repeated short-term basis.  In the UK, as I understand it, those services are not provided to anything like the same extent.  In a post-Brexit situation, the movements of people both legally and otherwise is an issue that is being looked at.  The Dublin Region Homeless Executive has formed a group to look at the possible implications for homeless services and we are liaising with it.  We are about to engage in a liaison with the Department of Justice and Equality because there are connected issues across the system that we will need to join up.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of standards, the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, is the key accreditation body for products generally in the construction industry and otherwise.  The key thing from a building point of view is that products will continue to have the relevant CE mark, meaning they meet the relevant standards.  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the NSAI have been looking at this.  There have been some inquiries from some certifying bodies - I forget the technical term - looking to relocate to Ireland so they can continue to provide those kinds of CE marking services.<\/p> <p>  In terms of Traveller accommodation, we have certainly had difficulties in recent years in terms of the drawdown of funding from the Traveller accommodation budget.  Looking back as far as the year 2000, not far off 20 years ago, we have invested a total of just over &euro;350 million in Traveller accommodation.  Looking at more recent years, particularly in 2017, for example, the allocation for capital was &euro;9 million, yet &euro;4.8 million was drawn down.  There are problems in particular areas.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, has established an expert group to dig into this to see what issues are giving rise to the poor drawdown of the available funding.  I do not want to start talking about specific cases that have been in the media.  Local authorities will be able to provide plenty of examples of where there can be difficulties getting projects through the planning process.  There can sometimes be local opposition.  As we have seen in some cases when projects are delivered, they can run into issues at that stage.  A group has been established by the Minister of State, Deputy English, to drill into it to see what the issues are that need to be tackled to get the Traveller accommodation programme back delivering at a rate equivalent to the funding that is available for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018102500002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1540454400,"counter":274,"content":"<p>Mr. McCarthy has answered the first number of questions.  With regard to the issue of the delivery of homes and supply, we have a skills shortage as a result of emigration and a drop in the number of people entering the sector.

Will Mr. McCarthy outline any measures his Department or other Departments are taking to deal with this manpower - or womanpower - issue?<\/p> <p>  Targets are set by local authorities.  In the case of Dublin City Council we have had recent examples of councillors voting against projects.  In South Dublin we had 1,000 homes at Kilcarbery voted against.  I do not want to be drawn into the issue of what the average house price is or what is affordable but those houses would have been in or around the property price index average price.  That is 1,000 homes that could have been delivered that were voted against.

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has established a group with relevant Departments, the Construction Industry Federation and others to look at this and to engage with the likes of SOLAS on apprenticeships and skills but also to engage with the construction industry on modern methods of construction and to determine whether the industry is engaging with those to the extent that it needs to.<\/p> <p>  In terms of attracting new workers, from an overall perspective one would nearly prefer people already in the country to be upskilled into the construction industry.  Attracting more people into the country will result in an increased demand for housing.  I am not saying we will get all the skills we need from within our own space but efforts are being made.  That is why the likes of SOLAS and activation measures by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection have to be an important part of the solution as well.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of going from a field being zoned to the appearance of houses, Deputy Catherine Murphy referred earlier to the one-stage approval process.  I am talking purely about social housing projects.  I will come to private ones in a minute.  We have a four-stage approval process for the bigger type social housing projects that do not come within the limits of the one-stage process.  That four-stage process is borne out of the public spending code and the capital works management framework the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has in place for capital projects generally.<\/p><p>I am sure most of the members are blue in the face, as I am blue in the face, from hearing about the four-stage approval process and projects bouncing backwards and forwards.  To try to deal with this, we sat down with the local government system and set timelines for each stage of the process.  We benchmarked getting from the first idea of a project to getting on site with comparable private sector delivery.  It is as good as what can be delivered in the private sector at 59 weeks.  People speak about it as 59 weeks to get approval but it is 59 weeks to do the design, get through the Part VIII process with the local authority, do the procurement and do all of the work on assessments at various stages of the process.

A total of 239 people are homeless and while there are 154 in the west.  Those figures do not cover people living in cars, staying with friends and living in refuges or direct provision.  I am from a city that did not build a single local authority house in the period from 2009.  I am just providing the context.  It was inevitable that there would be a major housing crisis.  I think we have now built 14 houses and I am not sure if they are even available.  That is the length of time it has taken.  We received quarterly reports to which I will refer.  We bought land at astronomical prices partly under the land aggregation scheme to which I will return.  We received quarterly reports.  From 2010, our housing programme was laid out.  The final column contained the word \"suspended\".  There was no construction.  Today, I looked at the empty properties in Galway as of the end of August.  A total of 60 houses were empty.  I can tell Mr. McCarthy that I am most unhappy with the oversight of the Department with regard to these houses.  As the crisis intensifies, less information comes out.  We were told when the houses became vacant in these quarterly reports.  This significant piece of information is now gone.  Reasons why they are empty include \"pre-tenancy works completed\", \"under consideration\" and \"under offer\".  I do not know the difference between the latter two.  Other reasons include under offer or offer accepted pending allocation.  A total of 60 houses are empty, most of which are in the middle of the city or very near the outskirts.  That is the background to my questions.<\/p> <p>  I thank Mr. John McCarthy for all of the information, which has been very helpful in clarifying matters.  There are 547 voluntary bodies, the Department, the Housing Agency, the Land Development Agency and the Housing Finance Agency, which does not come under the committee's remit.  A new agency is about to be set up to lend because the banks are not lending.  In the midst of this, we have the most significant housing crisis, which I am glad Mr. John McCarthy has acknowledged.  I acknowledge that 95% of the 547 voluntary bodies come under a small group.  What did the Department do about regulation?  Why has it taken up until now to talk about it?

Following on from that, I asked the Minister, via a parliamentary question, the reason not all units offered were availed of.  The answer I received was that the Department, the Housing Agency and the local authorities worked systematically through the full list of homes supplied to determine if there was a social housing demand for the properties identified.  There are tens of thousands of people who have been languishing for years on waiting lists.  The average waiting time in my county is around eight years.  I am sure that it is similar in other constituencies.  The word \"systematically\" was used.  Huge resources are being expended on the housing assistance payment, HAP, increasing with every budget.

Of those, 1,843 were sold, so the actual number available from NAMA was 5,108 properties.  It is important to clarify that.  More than half of those properties that were available from NAMA will be provided as social housing.  The properties that were deemed not suitable by local authorities included holiday homes and large houses in golf villages, but more importantly there were some very large developments in parts of the country, for example over 500 apartments in one local authority area in one development, which had already been partially allocated to local authorities under Part V provision.  It was decided that 65 additional apartments was an appropriate number so as not to cause an over-concentration of social housing in that area.  Similar scenarios played out in other locations.  There were large concentrations of social housing and it was decided to only take some of those properties.

The Secretary General has said that he does not want the Department to issue missives or directives in terms of what the local authorities do.  When I asked this question I was told that as part of the process the Housing Agency has been liaising and in direct contact with all the relevant local authorities to discuss the demand requirements, and that it was for the Housing Agency to co-ordinate the response to NAMA.  It seems to me that is exactly what is happening here.  The Secretary General has said that the Department is not issuing directives or missives, but the Housing Agency seems to be acting in a very controlling way, deciding the properties that were picked and were not picked.
