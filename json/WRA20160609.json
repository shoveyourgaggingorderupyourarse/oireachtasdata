It is a time bound co-funding arrangement with resources of &euro;29.7m from 2013 to 2017.  The aim of the ABC Programme is to test and evaluate prevention and early intervention approaches to improve outcomes for children and families living in poverty in 13 areas of disadvantage.<\/p>  <p>  The ABC programme was preceded by the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme (PEIP) (2007-2013) in which three sites participated: Youngballymun, the Childhood Development Initiative Tallaght and the Preparing for Life Programme, Darndale.  Youngballymun received &euro;15m as a participant in the Prevention and Early Intervention programme.  The total funding for Youngballymun under the ABC programme is &euro;5m bringing the total funding received by Youngballymun under both programmes to &euro;20m.<\/p>  <p>  The current contract for Youngballymun is due to conclude in July 2016. My aim is to extend the duration of the Youngballymun programme, together with that of two other sites, to July 2017. This will bring them in line with the other 10 ABC sites.   To ensure continued provision, my Department and The Atlantic Philanthropies have sanctioned an additional &euro;400k to each of the three original sites.  We are seeking to further supplement this base level of funding to each of the three sites, based on the prioritisation of the most effective interventions within their service agreements.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is working to ensure that we take full account of the learning from all the interventions across the 13 ABC sites.  This will offer a clear illustration of the interventions that work best, and will inform our plans to embed prevention and early intervention in services for children.  The future of any individual project cannot be considered in isolation.  Officials are working at a number of levels and through a number of initiatives to capture the learning to further advise me and Government.<\/p>  <p>  I look forward to the continued engagement of Youngballymun with my Department.

While the report deals with bullying in schools, it acknowledges that bullying is a complex social issue and can take place anywhere children and young people are together, including, as we know, on social media. The report highlights the need for parents and young people to understand how to use modern technologies safely and to know how to protect themselves in school, at home and in their communities. <\/p><p>With regard to cyberbullying, the Office for Internet Safety, under the Department of Justice and Equality, takes a lead responsibility for internet safety in Ireland, particularly as it relates to children.  As part of its work it holds an annual Safer Internet Day, which has included a roll-out of a social marketing campaign specifically targeted at young people. In 2013, the then Minister of  Communications established an Internet Content Governance Advisory Group to ensure our national policy represents best practice in offering the same online protections to our citizens as those available in the offline world.

The elements of the Children Act relating to the operation of the Garda Youth Diversion Programme, matters relating to criminal proceedings against children, criminal law issues and the operation of the Children Court under the Act come within the remit of the Tanaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality.  The operation of the children detention school system under Part 10 of the Act is under the remit of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.   The Irish Youth Justice Service, based in my Department and staffed by officials working on an interagency basis from both Departments concerned, oversee the operation of the Act, youth crime policy and all relevant projects and programmes.  A Youth Justice Action Plan was agreed in 2014 for the period up to 2018 and this is implemented by the Irish Youth Justice Service in conjunction with all relevant agencies, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Probation Service, the Oberstown Detention Campus, the Irish Prison Service and Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  The aim of the Action Plan is to create a safer society by working in partnership to reduce youth offending through appropriate interventions and linkages to services. <\/p>  <p>  I assume the context of the Deputy's question refers to the recent report issued by the Jesuit Centre for Faith and Justice, entitled \"Developing Inside - Transforming prison for young adults\".  This report makes a range of recommendations in relation to the operation of prison and custodial regimes for young adults in the age range of 18 - 24 years.  These recommendations include assigning responsibility for this age cohort to the Irish Youth Justice Service, achieving a significant reduction in the number imprisoned, accommodating such persons in separate facilities from older prisoners, ending the use of restricted prison regimes and enhanced training for prison staff.  All of these recommendations have implications for the operation of the adult prison system and some of them have implications for the wider criminal justice system, which is under the remit of the Tanaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality.<\/p>  <p>  At the moment my political priority in this field must continue to be the ending of the practice of detaining children in adult prison facilities.  A programme of investment in the Oberstown campus, combined with necessary legal and operational reforms, has been underway in recent years to this end.  It is my aim to assign responsibility for 17 year old boys who are serving a sentence of detention to the Oberstown campus at the earliest date possible this year, subject to the progress of a recruitment programme which is ongoing at present.  This will end the practice of detaining children in adult prison facilities, which has been called for since at least the 1980s.<\/p>  <p>  When this review is complete, I will review with careful discernment the recommendations of the report issued by the Joint Committee, as well as reports by other respected bodies or independent bodies such as the IHREC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060900045#WRA03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Homeless Accommodation Provision","counter":38,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060900045#WRA03700"},{"type":"question","counter":39,"qnumday":23,"qnumall":"[14847\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060900045#WRA03800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her views on the long-term effect of homelessness on children, their welfare and their educational attainment; the actions she has taken; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1281","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":40,"content":"<p>Homelessness, whether for a child presenting alone or as part of a family, is a distressing experience.  Children under 16 who present as being homeless to emergency services are taken into care.  Children aged 16 and 17 may be taken into care, or provided a service under section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991 (accommodation for homeless children).  Care planning is an integral part of the care process.  The specific needs of any child and the services and supports that they might need to achieve their potential are assessed and planned for.  For young people who were formerly in the care of the State, aftercare services are also put in place in respect of the specific needs of a child, including accommodation and educational supports. <\/p>  <p>  Family homelessness is managed by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive and the local authorities.  Currently, for many families, this means being accommodated on an emergency basis in hotel accommodation.  Living in such accommodation on an extended basis is simply not conducive to normal family life for parents or their children.  This includes the practical difficulties of no cooking facilities; accommodating a family's belongings in hotel room accommodation; being away from the community services and facilities, including schools that the family are familiar with; as well as the inevitable stresses on relationships on living in confined spaces.  Families who are housed outside of their communities may well have little or no access to their social networks and these are most at risk of faring poorly.  The priority of local authorities is to move families, as soon as possible, from emergency accommodation into a more suitable family-friendly setting.<\/p>  <p>  Within my own remit, Tusla &ndash; the Child and Family Agency provides family support and works with relevant services to maximise the supports available to children and families who are homeless.  Tusla and the Dublin Region Homeless Executive are shortly to sign off on a joint protocol which includes guidance on working with families where child protection concerns arise within emergency homeless accommodation.  I anticipate that the protocol will be in full operation this month.  Additionally, Tusla has appointed a Homelessness Liaison Officer to lead on its engagement with homeless services, particularly in relation to child protection issues.  Tusla has also established links with the Dublin Region Homeless Executive around access for children and families to Family Resource Centres.  Regarding Tusla&rsquo;s educational welfare services, guidance has issued to Home School Community Liaison and School Completion staff on assisting children and families experiencing homelessness to maintain regular school attendance.  Additionally, School Completion Programmes have been asked to prioritise homeless children for services such as breakfast and after-school clubs.  <\/p>  <p>  In recent weeks, I have been meeting with representatives from a range of homelessness and other children advocacy organisations.  Those meetings provided me an insight into the key issues facing children who are in emergency accommodation with their families.  In conjunction with my Cabinet colleagues, I am seeking to define a set of measures to better support children with their families in emergency homeless accommodation.

Section 26 of the Act provides that an adoption order cannot be granted unless consent has been given by a child&rsquo;s mother, a guardian or person having charge of the child. In cases where the mother cannot give consent or is unwilling to do so and it is deemed that adoption is in the child&rsquo;s best interest, the case will be referred to the High Court where the dispensing of the mothers consent will be considered.

These children are cared for by staff who deserve to have a safe working environment.  <\/p>  <p>  In recent years it has been Government policy to end the practice of detaining children in adult prison facilities.  This policy has found cross-party support.  In moving towards this goal a series of developments have been put in place.  These have included a substantial capital development to provide new and modern facilities at Oberstown and also a range of operational improvements including measures to integrate and standardise procedures on the Campus, legislative reform under the Children (Amendment) Act 2015 and the first programme of staff recruitment in over ten years.  I acknowledge the contribution of the staff and managers in Oberstown on the progress that has been made in this area.  They have played a key role in delivering this change.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the issues of staff safety and training supports are currently the subject of discussion between Oberstown management and staff representatives at the Workplace Relations Commission, following the industrial action which took place on Tuesday 31 May.  <\/p>  <p>  In Oberstown, there is an emphasis on training in behaviour management programmes that de-escalate and, where possible, avoid crises involving the behaviour of children . I condemn any and all incidents resulting in assault and injury to staff. There is no acceptable level of violent behaviour in a children detention school.  I am advised that children are assessed daily for all forms of risk and in the light of such assessments the residential care plans for children are reviewed accordingly.  The Oberstown Campus has in place a published bespoke behaviour management policy which has been developed in conjunction with the Crisis Prevention Institute of Wisconsin, USA who are internationally recognised for their expertise in this area. Oberstown staff are provided with formal training in the policy with the object of providing staff with the skills to manage the behaviour of children. Policies and procedures are continually reviewed with the aim of ensuring safe and secure custody for children and the safety of staff. <\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the risk of injury cannot be excluded completely given the nature of a children detention school.  A specific employee assistance programme is in place to assist members of staff on foot of any such incident where required.  Staff are fully supported where incidents have to be investigated by the Garda authorities.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that the engagement between Oberstown management and staff is now taking place at the Workplace Relations Commission and understand that industrual action has been suspended during this process.

All pre-schools had to satisfy the minimum qualification requirements as approved on the published list of my Department's Early Years Recognised Qualifications (level 7 or equivalent) and have at least three years' experience working in the early years sector.

Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.<\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.<\/p>  <p>  I would advise if there are concerns in relation to the educational development of any student that these should be raised, in the first instance, with the Principal of the school he\/she is attending, with a view to the Principal discussing the situation with the assigned NEPS psychologist.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060900047#WRC01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staff","counter":133,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060900047#WRC01750"},{"type":"question","counter":134,"qnumday":54,"qnumall":"[15104\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060900047#WRC01800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of an appeal by a school (details supplied).","asker":"1278","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":135,"content":"<p>The staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 2016\/17 school year are set out in Department Circular 0007\/2016 which is available on the Department website.<\/p><p>The staffing circular includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board.<\/p><p>The school referred to by the Deputy submitted an appeal to the May 2016 meeting of the Primary Staffing Appeals Board.

The Programme commits to bring the total number of NEPS psychologists to 238 from the current sanctioned limit of 173.<\/p><p>For the information of the Deputy, the following table sets out the number of educational psychologists employed in NEPS for the past ten years.<\/p><p><b>NEPS Educational Psychologist Numbers 2006\/07 to 2015\/16<\/b><table><tr><th>Academic Year<\/th><th>Nep Psych Count<\/th><th>Full E.W.T No. Of Psychologists (1)<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>06\/07<\/td><td>124<\/td><td>117.8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>07\/08<\/td><td>134<\/td><td>126.7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>08\/09<\/td><td>155<\/td><td>148.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>09\/10<\/td><td>153<\/td><td>146.9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10\/11<\/td><td>165<\/td><td>158.9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11\/12<\/td><td>173<\/td><td>166<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12\/13<\/td><td>171<\/td><td>168.8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13\/14<\/td><td>177<\/td><td>168.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14\/15<\/td><td>177<\/td><td>166.9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15\/16<\/td><td>175<\/td><td>164.99<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>Notes:<\/p><p>Psychologist number is stated in equivalent whole-time posts (E.W.T.) and at 31st December of the year specified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060900048#WRD01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Lansdowne Road Agreement","counter":167,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060900049#WRE00200"},{"type":"question","counter":168,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[15236\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060900049#WRE00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"why he has a notice on his website advising teachers who he deems to be in repudiation of the public service stability agreement 2013-2016, Lansdowne Road agreement, that they will lose the benefits to a contract of indefinite duration after two years, as set out in the report to the Minister for Education and Skills of the chairperson of the expert group on fixed-term and part-time employment in primary and second level education in Ireland (Ward report); his views on this approach and how he will administer it, given that this would be in contravention of data protection legislation; if he retains information pertaining to the union membership of teachers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1340","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":169,"content":"<p>My Department has a responsibility to ensure that ASTI members are fully aware of the implications of their decision to withdraw from the Lansdowne Road Agreement.

In respect of payments my Department provides two main options for payment methods for its customers: payments direct to customer accounts in financial institutions or payments in cash at post offices.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2015 my department made over 38 million cash payments at Post Offices at a cost of &euro;54 million.  These welfare payments through post offices are across all of the department&rsquo;s major schemes: state pension, jobseekers, one parent family payments, widow\/ers or survivors pensions, carers payments, disability payments and child benefit.  <\/p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that for the vast majority of my department&rsquo;s schemes the department&rsquo;s customers are given the choice of what payment method they wish to receive their social welfare payment.  The vast majority of new customers choose to have payments made directly into their accounts in financial institutions which reflects a societal trend towards payment by electronic funds transfer.  For example, 83% of new Child Benefit customers and 70% of new State Pension customers chose this option in 2015.  <\/p>  <p>  Many of my department&rsquo;s customers are in employment.  My department&rsquo;s focus must be on our customers and to this end my department&rsquo;s policy is to make payments to in-work customers directly to accounts rather than customers being inconvenienced by two separate payment methods.  <\/p>  <p>  My department has a cohort of jobseeker customers who are classified as casual jobseekers.  These are in-work customers who can claim a jobseekers payment for 2 to 3 days per week or who work week on\/week-off.  These customers were paid by cheque each week.<\/p>  <p>  Those customers were paid by cheque due to the changing nature of their work\/claiming patterns and the short turn-around time to issue payments.  It is important to note that they were not paid via post offices under the department&rsquo;s existing cash payments contract with An Post.  <\/p>  <p>  My department has developed its payment capacity in respect of changing work and claiming patterns and is offering payments direct to accounts in financial institutions for casual Jobseeker customers thereby increasing customer convenience.  This is in line with wider departmental policy where the focus is on ensuring that in-work customers are paid by the most convenient method possible.<\/p>  <p>  My department has written to all of these casual jobseekers offering the option of a payment to an account.  The vast majority have responded and opted for payment to an account.<\/p>  <p>  If customers wish to continue to be paid by cheque they can make their preference known to their local social welfare office which handles their claim.<\/p>  <p>  The recent &ldquo;Kerr Report&rdquo; sets out the challenges that An Post and Postmasters face as they seek to ensure that the post office network remains relevant in the context of the inexorable shift towards electronic payments.<\/p>  <p>  My department is engaging as appropriate with the Departments of Communications, Climate Change and Natural Resources and Public, Expenditure and Reform in addressing the recommendations of the report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060900051#WRG00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Widow's Pension","counter":240,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060900051#WRG00750"},{"type":"question","counter":241,"qnumday":91,"qnumall":"[15105\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060900051#WRG00800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"to consider increasing the maximum rate of widow's pension.","asker":"1278","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":242,"content":"<p>There are three main schemes operated by the Department which are payable to widows, widowers and surviving civil partners: a contributory pension, a death benefit pension and a non-contributory pension.

The self-harm rate, 200 per 100,000 of the population, was essentially unchanged from 2013.  This levelling off follows three successive decreases in the rate of persons presenting to hospital following self-harm from 2011 &ndash; 2013.  The only significant change in the rate of hospital-treated self-harm by age was among boys aged 10-14 years, where the self-harm rate increased by 44% from 34 to 49 per 100,000.  The upward trend in self-harm among young boys is concerning.  In this regard, the HSE in its National Service Plan for 2016 has prioritised the development of early intervention and prevention services for children and young people.  Funding is also being provided this year for the provision of new Jigsaw youth mental health services in Cork, Dublin and Limerick.<\/p><p>The HSE Mental Health Division has a multifaceted response to people at risk of self-harm and includes referral by GP to Community Mental Health Teams, liaison psychiatry services on-site in Model 3 and 4 and acute hospitals, a comprehensive mental health on-call service in Emergency Departments for people presenting in crisis during the on-call period, and self-harm clinical specialist nurses in a number of Emergency Departments.  In addition, a HSE initiative enables GPs to refer directly to a Suicide Crisis Assessment Nurse for assessment and advice on management of their patients who present with suicidal ideation.  In each of these settings, a comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment is carried out together with an assessment of mental state and a risk assessment for suicide.  On the basis of this, a care plan is drawn up.  Next steps depend on the psychosocial stresses identified along with the presence or absence of a mental illness such as depression.<\/p><p>Community Child and Adolescent Mental Health teams are the first line of specialist mental health services for children and young people.  There are currently 67 such teams and 3 liaison services nationally.  The multi-disciplinary team, under the clinical direction of a Consultant Child and Adolescent psychiatrist, includes junior medical staff, psychologists, social workers, nurses, speech &amp;amp; language therapist, occupational therapist and child care workers.  The assessment and intervention provided by such teams is determined by the severity and complexity of the presenting problem(s).  This range of disciplines and skills offer a care and treatment package geared to individual needs.  The HSE&rsquo;s National Office for Suicide Prevention supports a range of services for teenagers, young people and their families, including Pieta House, SpunOut.ie, ReachOut.com\/Inspire Ireland and BeLongTo.  They also fund the 24-hour call services provided by the Samaritans and 'Childline'.  The National Office also works closely with the Department of Education and Skills in the application of the Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Well-Being in Primary and Post Primary Schools  <i>.<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060900054#WRK00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":314,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060900054#WRK00550"},{"type":"question","counter":315,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[15225\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060900054#WRK00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the extent to which child psychiatric services remain adequate to meet modern challenges; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":316,"content":"<p>The additional ring-fenced mental health funding of &euro;160 million provided over 2012-16 inclusive, has contributed significantly to the implemention of<i>A Vision for Change. <\/i>Implementation of this policy takes place in the context of annual HSE Service Plans, in line with service priorities and resource availability.

The Grocery Goods Undertakings Regulations, 2016 which entered into force on 30 April 2016 provide for statutory regulation of certain practices, sanctions, investigation and enforcement.  The Regulations apply to dealings between grocery goods retailers or wholesalers in the State with an annual worldwide turnover of more than &euro;50 million, and their suppliers. They provide for written contracts to be in place, for payment to suppliers for their goods within 30 days except where otherwise provided in a contract, for retention of records and for submission of an annual compliance report to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, which operates under the auspices of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.

According to CSO figures, in 2015 we exported almost &euro;5.1 billion worth of agricultural products, and imports from the UK were worth &euro;3.8 billion. The prospect of a UK vote to leave the EU therefore has serious implications for the agri-food sector. <\/p>  <p>  This is borne out in the reports that have been produced in recent months on the potential impact of a UK exit on Ireland. An ESRI report last year estimated that the potential reduction in bilateral trade flows could be as high as 20%, with an even higher impact on agriculture, food and beverages. Teagasc, at the request of my Department, has carried out a deeper analysis, which found that, depending on the assumptions made, the minimum impact could be a reduction of 1.4% or &euro;150 million per annum in the value of Irish agri-food exports, with a possible worst-case scenario involving a reduction of over 7%, or &euro;800 million, per annum. <\/p>  <p>However, it is important to note that there would be no dramatic change straight away,   and that the actual impact of a UK exit would depend on the post-exit relationship that will have to be negotiated between the EU and the UK. The Treaty on European Union provides for a period of two years of negotiations, with extensions possible if agreement is not reached in this period. <\/p>  <p>  There are four main areas in which concerns arise from an agri-food perspective. These are tariffs and trade arrangements, the EU budget, standards and customs controls. <\/p>  <p>Potential differences in tariffs after a UK exit could restrict trade in both directions and affect traditional supply practices, particularly for raw materials. Once the exit negotiations have been completed, the UK would be free to negotiate free trade agreements with other third countries. This is particularly relevant in relation to meat imports from South America. This could present a competitiveness challenge for third country suppliers, such as Ireland. However, negotiating such agreements could be a lengthy process.   <\/p>  <p>  The UK is a net contributor to the EU budget. A UK exit could result in a loss of its contribution of between 5 and 10%. Given that the CAP accounts for some 37% of the EU budget, we could expect additional pressure for further contraction in CAP funding in the years ahead. <\/p>  <p>  Currently the EU operates a common regulatory regime, and the rules of the single market allow free movement of goods between Member States. While the EU and the UK may wish to keep such arrangements in place for as long as possible, deviations between UK and EU standards could give rise to trading difficulties and additional costs. <\/p>  <p>  Under most scenarios, a British exit from the EU would see the return of some sort of border controls, customs or administrative procedures that would replace the current free movement of goods. This would add to administrative costs. Similarly, and even with a constructive approach from the UK on market access terms and veterinary certificates, the administrative burden in relation to veterinary and health certification could be considerable.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the possibility of UK exit poses a serious and complex situation for our fisheries sector. While the negative impact on trade could be significant - the UK is our second largest market for seafood after France - the most complex fisheries issues are those related to the possibility of restricted access to fishing grounds and resources. We would face a very uncertain situation related to the management and sharing of large numbers of different fish stocks that we currently share with the UK and other Member States under the Common Fisheries Policy Framework.<\/p>  <p>  I and my Department are continuing to reflect on these matters so that we are prepared, if the UK decision is to exit, to establish our priorities for the negotiations in the agri-food and fisheries sectors, and to engage in these negotiations at an early date. We are also in ongoing consultation with our Government colleagues to ensure that there is a coherent, whole-of-Government approach to the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060900063#WRT00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"GLAS Applications","counter":563,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060900063#WRT00650"},{"type":"question","counter":564,"qnumday":209,"qnumall":"[15269\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060900063#WRT00700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the status of an application by a person (details supplied) under the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":565,"content":"<p>An application under Tranche 1 of GLAS was received in my Department on the 26 May 2015 and the person named was approved into the GLAS 1 with effect from 1 October 2015.

The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 provides for a number of significant reforms, which alongside the strengthening of the statutory code on victimisation to explicitly prohibit inducement to forego trade union representation, reaffirm compliance with recent judgements of the European Court of Human Rights and addresses the issues raised by the ILO Committee of Freedom of Association in the context of a complaint arising from the Supreme Court Ryanair case.<\/p><p>The Act significantly improves the position of workers and trade unions working to improve the terms and conditions of members in instances where collective bargaining is not engaged in by their employer.  In such situations, it ensures that workers, aided by their trade union, can advance claims about pay, terms and conditions and have those determined by the Labour Court based on comparisons with similar companies.<\/p><p>Concerning the issue of collective bargaining rights for freelance workers, you will be aware of the investigation conducted in 2004 by the then Competition Authority (now the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission) regarding possible price fixing among self-employed actors and advertising agencies.  The Competition Authority was the statutorily independent authority in Ireland with responsibility to enforce both Irish and EU competition law at the time.<\/p><p>The Authority found that an agreement between Irish Actors Equity SIPTU, on behalf of the actors, and the Institute of Advertising Practitioners in Ireland, on behalf of advertising agencies, was in breach of competition law in that it set the fees for services rendered.  The self-employed workers in this case were deemed to be &ldquo;undertakings&quot;.  Such setting of prices by an association of undertakings runs counter to EU and national competition law.<\/p><p>The decision of the Competition Authority stated that while it was perfectly legal for a trade union to represent employees in collective bargaining with their employers, its trade union mantle could not exempt its conduct when it acts as a trade association for self-employed contractors in the area of price setting.  However, this does not preclude, nor has it ever precluded, anybody representing the self-employed workers on other working conditions apart from price setting.<\/p><p>Under both Irish and EU Competition law, self-employed persons, including professionals who are not employees, are regarded as &ldquo;undertakings&rdquo;.  There is ample EU case law in the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) which has determined that professionals are regarded as undertakings from an EU Competition law perspective.<\/p><p>It is recognised that there can be instances where self-employed workers could be regarded as being in a comparable situation to employment, often referred to as false self-employment.  A CJEU ruling in December 2014 in the case of FNV Kunsten Informatie en Media v Staat de Netherlanden relates to self-employed substitute orchestral musicians in the Netherlands.  The CJEU ruling emphasised that self-employed service providers are, in principle, &ldquo;undertakings&rdquo; and are therefore subject to competition law.  However, importantly the CJEU also acknowledged that it is important to examine, in each case, whether individuals who appear to be self-employed service providers should, in fact, be categorised as &ldquo;false self-employed&rdquo; because they are, in reality, employees who should not be subject to the provisions of Competition law.  The Court made it clear that it is for National courts to examine the facts of particular cases in order to determine whether an individual should be classified as a &ldquo;false self-employed&rdquo; person - and therefore be deemed to be an employee for competition law purposes &ndash; or as a genuinely self-employed independent contractor.<\/p><p>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the then Minister for Business and Employment asked that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission<s><font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font><\/s>review its 2004 decision in light of the aforementioned decision. he Commission has carefully considered this case and is of the view that the analysis and conclusions of the former Competition Authority in 2004 remain valid in light of the relevant principles of EU Competition law set out in the CJEU<b><\/b>ruling.  It also has acknowledged that had the undertakings in the 2004 case been proven to be &ldquo;false self-employed&rdquo;, then a different conclusion would have emerged.<\/p><p>It is important to state that there are a range of wider considerations that would require detailed examination and consultation to ensure that the basic tenets of both Irish Competition law and EU Competition law and the Treaty of the European Union from which Irish Competition law is derived, are not compromised and that there are no unintended consequences which could have implications for the economy and the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060900064#WRU02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Company Liquidations","counter":616,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060900065#WRV00200"},{"type":"question","counter":617,"qnumday":226,"qnumall":"[15274\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060900065#WRV00300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"as to how or what financial set of accounts relevant period and so on the High Court looked at when giving permission to a company (details supplied) to be wound down with a loss of all jobs; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1350","askee":"1247"},{"type":"question","counter":618,"qnumday":227,"qnumall":"[15275\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060900065#WRV00400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the role that a company (details supplied) was to play when it took over another company (details supplied) as a going concern, when in fact it was winding down the company within six months due to significant losses of &euro;5 million up to June 2015, which was prior to the takeover; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1350","askee":"1247"},{"type":"question","counter":619,"qnumday":228,"qnumall":"[15276\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060900065#WRV00500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if her Department was aware, through the Industrial Development Agency, of a company's (details supplied) &euro;5 million losses prior to a company's (details supplied) takeover of the company in 2015, as this was stated by a director of a company in the High Court as the reason why the company should be allowed to wind down a company; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1350","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":620,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 226 to 228, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  In situations such as this, the legal process for the appointment of a liquidator is fully prescribed in statute and a matter entirely for the Courts.

The other Irish airline has revised its fee structure for baggage replacing a large number of different fees with seasonal variations with six year-round fee bands based on the destination and duration of flights and the weight of the baggage.  While the airline claims that the revised fee structure will lead to reduced baggage charges for most passengers, I am aware that other commentators have questioned this claim.  As the Deputy will be aware, no Government in recent decades has pursued a policy of price control other than for a very small number of regulated sectors where normal competitive conditions do not obtain.  I do not propose to depart from this policy.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission&rsquo;s role is to ensure that markets are competitive and not to regulate prices.  According to the most recent Consumer Price Index figures released by the Central Statistics Office, air fares fell by 8.4 per cent in the year to April 2016.

This is because UK membership of the Union is hugely important both to Ireland&rsquo;s interests, and to the interests of a stable, successful and prosperous EU as a whole.  The Government&rsquo;s overriding focus has been, and remains, on helping to keep the UK in the Union, not preparing for its departure.  Work has been underway across Government Departments, including my own, for some time to ensure we best understand the range of issues at stake.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of the Taoiseach also plays a leading role, given the whole-of-government dimension that is essential in this work. In this context, in May of last year, a unit was established in the Department of the Taoiseach, specifically dealing with British-Irish and Northern Ireland affairs.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Finance, for example, commissioned the research published last November by the Economic and Social Research Institute on Irish-British macroeconomic links in the context of our joint EU membership.<\/p>  <p>  We know from this and various other published assessments that there are very significant strategic and economic risks for Ireland if the UK were to leave the EU.  In order to mitigate these risks, the Government played a constructive role in the negotiations that took place at EU level, including in the context of the discussions leading up to the European Council in February, working with the British Government and all our EU partners towards a consensual basis for the UK&rsquo;s continued membership of the Union.<\/p>  <p>  Given the importance to the enterprise sector of this issue, both IDA and Enterprise Ireland are factoring this issue into their own contingency planning and continue to track where potential impacts may arise.<\/p>  <p>  Clearly, the pace at which any potential exit was achieved, and the terms which the UK might negotiate with the EU across a wide range of domains will be a key determinant of the impact on the economy, and on jobs and trade in particular sectors.  My Department would of course continue to work closely with colleagues in the UK and EU Member States to ensure that any potential disruption to trade and investment is minimised.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland already has a significant number of programmes available to companies who face competitive threats from various sources.  There include Lean Programmes, Market Diversification, Innovation and Management Development.  These will be the tools available to assist companies with planning and preparation.<\/p>  <p>  Further, a key policy priority in recent years both for my Department and for Enterprise Ireland has been to support geographic market diversification, so that Irish owned exports to non-UK markets increase by 50% to reach exports of between &euro;5 and &euro;6 billion by 2020.<\/p>  <p>  As a result, both Service and Manufacturing firms exports have shown a clear reduction in dependency on the UK market.  A growing number of Enterprise Ireland supported exporters are exporting to more than five countries - an indication of a strengthening resilience in market diversity terms.

The report stated that, overall, HIQA found standards across all three areas of residential, foster care and child protection to be good.  There was good social work practice with children and families in foster care and the child welfare and protection services.  HIQA identified that Tusla required more social workers and needed to increase standardisation of services around the country to ensure that all children received an equitable provision of care. The report also noted the need for continuing development of national policies and ICT projects. <\/p>  <p>  HIQA identified a shortage of social workers across many inspections. The level of funding provided to Tusla for 2016 has significantly strengthened Tusla&rsquo;s capacity to recruit more social workers and to deliver a high level of care for children. The Government has provided Tusla with funding of over &euro;676 million in 2016 - this is an increase of &euro;38 million on the provision for 2015 and this increase was widely acknowledged as representing a significant strengthening of Tusla&rsquo;s base funding level. The additional resources provided gives the Agency greater capacity to respond to identified risk and to address areas of unmet need.<\/p>  <p>  It is a positive sign that HIQA inspectors found that staff responded to the needs of children and focussed on their rights and welfare.  Children were encouraged to take part in decisions on their care, had access to advocates and were helped to keep positive attachments with their families.  Children told inspectors that their lives had improved through contact with child protection social workers.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla will continue its recruitment campaign to recruit the social work and social care staff to support families and to protect vulnerable children. The majority of HIQA findings relate to standards that are deemed to require improvement. Tusla reports to my Department on the action plans that they have put in place following each of the inspections to deal with problems and areas needing quality improvement. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla is engaged in a programme of service reform to ensure that a consistent quality of care is available to children and families across the country. I am confident that this process and the major recruitment campaign currently underway, will see a significant improvement in all child welfare and protection services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060900066#WRW01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Agencies Board Appointments","counter":661,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060900066#WRW01350"},{"type":"question","counter":662,"qnumday":242,"qnumall":"[15193\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060900066#WRW01400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her plans to fill the two vacant positions on the Board of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1266","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":663,"content":"<p>The Child and Family Agency Act, 2013, provides for the appointment of a nine person Board consisting of a Chairperson, a Deputy Chairperson and seven ordinary members all appointed by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.<\/p><p>The Board currently consists of seven board members with two vacancies.

Cyberbullying is just one aspect of bullying, but one which, given the rapid expansion of access to technology by young people, has come much more sharply into focus.  The report highlights the need for parents and young people to understand how to use modern technologies safely and to know how to protect themselves in school, at home and in their communities.  There is a range of services, supported by various Departments and their agencies which can assist children and young people in coping with bullying situations.<\/p>  <p>  - The parents' role is key in supporting their children who may be victims of bullying - www.webwise.ie &ndash; an initiative of the Department of Education and Skills &ndash; provides information and advice for parents and teachers about risks and how to protect children against cyber bullying.<\/p>  <p>  - At community level, many of the voluntary youth services funded by my Department provide education programmes, run awareness campaigns about bullying and provide programmes for young people to give them the knowledge and skills to build supportive links and counter bullying behaviours.  Specifically, my Department supports the National Youth Health Programme which is in partnership with the HSE and the National Youth Council of Ireland.  The programme's aims are to provide a broad-based, flexible health promotion \/ education support and training service to youth organisations and to all those working with young people in out-of-school settings, and includes programmes aimed at exploring bullying and cyberbullying with young people.<\/p>  <p>  - Schools are also strengthening collaboration and interaction with youth services and promote the active participation by pupils in youth focused services within their local communities.<\/p>  <p>  Bullying in the workplace is a matter for the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The Health and Safety Authority provides guidance to employers regarding the requirement for a written Anti Bullying Policy.  The HSA guidance states that the policy should be drawn up in accordance with the Health and Safety Authority's Code of Practice on the Prevention and Resolution of Bullying at Work, the Labour Relations Commission's Code of Practice Detailing Procedures for Addressing Bullying in the Workplace and the Equality Authority's Codes of Practice on Prevention of Workplace Bullying and Harassment, where harassment under the nine grounds identified in the document is the issue.  The guidance states that bullying should also be referred to in the safety statement as a hazard and should state the management ethos and ensure that there is a clear procedure for managing complaints and ensuring that all staff, whether permanent or temporary, should have access to a copy.  Organisations should raise awareness of the issue by inclusion in staff bulletins, training, at recruitment stage and using any other appropriate method.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to cyber bulling, the Office for Internet Safety, under the Department of Justice and Equality, takes a lead responsibility for internet safety in Ireland, particularly as it relates to children.  As part of its work it holds an annual Safer Internet Day, which has included a rollout of a social marketing campaign specifically targeted at young people.  In 2013, the then Minister of Communications established an Internet Content Governance Advisory Group to ensure our national policy represents best practice in offering the same online protections to our citizens as those available in the offline world.  The Group&rsquo;s report published in May 2014 made several recommendations aimed at protecting children and young people without unduly limiting their opportunities and rights online.  I hope to advance these issues in conjunction with my colleagues the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Communications as part of the Programme for Government's specific commitment in relation to ensuring that robust protections are in place to fully protect children while on line.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060900067#WRX00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Services Funding","counter":683,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060900067#WRX00650"},{"type":"question","counter":684,"qnumday":249,"qnumall":"[15223\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060900067#WRX00700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the extent to which she continues to support Kildare Youth Services; if she expects to be in a position to continue supports to the services in the future; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":685,"content":"<p>My Department administers a range of funding schemes and programmes to support the provision of youth services to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities.

I understand that the purpose of Wardship is to look after the welfare and to protect the property of a person where this is considered necessary.  There are two types of Wardship: one covers adults who may require the Court's protection because of mental incapacity and the second concerns children, i.e. persons under 18 years of age, who require protection for particular reasons.  A child's mental capacity is not a relevant consideration in this particular area of Wardship jurisdiction.<\/p>  <p>  For the information of the Deputy, the Child and Family Agency, Tusla, may be called on to provide a report under section 20 of the Child Care Act 1991, as amended, in relation to proceedings that may involve the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, the Judicial Separation and Family Reform, the Family Law Act 1995 or the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996.  Tusla has previously provided data on the numbers of reports requested by the Courts under this section, and this is included in my reply to parliamentary questions 929 and 930 on Tuesday, 31 May 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060900067#WRX01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Awareness","counter":692,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060900067#WRX01250"},{"type":"question","counter":693,"qnumday":252,"qnumall":"[15227\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060900067#WRX01300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the extent to which research has been undertaken to identify the most common causes of concern and stress among young persons in modern times; the extent to which any corrective measures can be put in place; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":694,"content":"<p>I am aware that there is a great deal of research in the public domain in relation to the issues raised by the Deputy.<\/p><p>My Department funds and oversees the &lsquo;Growing Up in Ireland&rsquo; national longitudinal study, which collects a wide range of data across a number of key domains of children&rsquo;s lives, including data relating to issues of concern and stress.  The study monitors the development of almost 20,000 children.  It examines the factors that contribute to or undermine the well-being of children in contemporary Irish families, and through this, contributes to the setting of effective and responsive policies relating to children and to the design of services for children and families.  Information on causes of concern and stress amongst young persons is collected through a number of questions and validated scales on several aspects of the child&rsquo;s socio-emotional development including behaviour, social skills and interactions with parents.<\/p><p>My Department has also commissioned a number of research reports which focus on the issues of mental health, feelings, mood, and socio-emotional behaviours and outcomes.  Stressful events for 5 year olds include the death of a family member, moving house, serious illness of a family member and conflict between parents.  The lives of 13 year olds are affected by less positive self-concepts in the areas of 'physical appearance', 'popularity' and 'intellectual\/school'.  It is also known that persistent economic vulnerability has negative consequences for the socio-emotional development of children.<\/p><p>My Department provided funding for a May 2015 report by young people entitled &ldquo;Picture Your Rights &ndash; A Report to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child from Children Living in Ireland&rdquo;.  Among other areas, the report focused on the topic of &lsquo;Mind and Body &ndash; Learning to take care of ourselves.&rsquo;  Within this area the spotlight issues of bullying, mental health, and stress were identified.  In that regard the report noted that mental health and physical safety are the two main issues that young people are concerned about in Ireland.  The report identified bullying as the number one issue that worries young people, followed closely by stress and the pressure of school and home life.  Concerns were also expressed about body image and physical health.<\/p><p>Regarding the wellbeing of children and young people in general, I refer the Deputy to the extensive policy frameworks '<i>Better Outcomes Brighter Futures: <\/i>the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People (2014-2020)', and 'Healthy Ireland: A Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing (2013-2025)'.  Issues of concern and stress impact on the areas of responsibility of a number of Government departments.  There are various strategies and initiatives that are relevant to tackling challenges of the kind identified by young people.  Examples include the Action Plan on Bullying launched by the Minister for Education and Skills; the Prevention, Partnership and Family Support Programme (2015-2018) undertaken by Tusla; Ireland&rsquo;s first National Sexual Health Strategy (2015-2020), launched by the Minister for Health; &lsquo;Connecting for Life&rsquo;, the new national strategy to reduce suicide (2015-2020); Ireland&rsquo;s first National Physical Activity Plan, launched in January 2016; and a new Obesity Policy and Action Plan, under development by the Department of Health.<\/p><p><i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures <\/i>recognises the importance of good mental health to children and young people, as reflected in the national outcome that children are active and healthy with physical and mental wellbeing.  The framework contains a number of commitments in the area of mental health for progression in 2016.<\/p><p>In relation to children in detention, the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS) is committed to a research programme on youth crime under the Youth Justice Action Plan 2014-2018.  The IYJS and Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, have together developed a national clinical service for children in special care and detention, known as the Assessment, Consultation and Therapy Service (ACTS), which also engages in short term interventions, when children return to their communities, to support them to re-engage with mainstream services as appropriate.<\/p><p>Finally, given that exam time can be a very stressful time for children, I want to acknowledge the important role played by parents and teachers in guiding children through this and other challenging periods in their lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060900067#WRX01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Play and Recreation Policies","counter":695,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060900067#WRX01450"},{"type":"question","counter":696,"qnumday":253,"qnumall":"[15259\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060900067#WRX01500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"for details of funding available, to be administered via local authorities, from the capital grant funding scheme 2016; for details of any additional funding she may be considering making available to support new and existing play and recreation facilities for children and young persons, in particular in the Kildare North area; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1324","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":697,"content":"<p>The provision of play and recreation facilities is primarily a matter for Local Authorities.
