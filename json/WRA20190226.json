Patients presenting to Defence Forces Primary Carers (Medical Officers or contracted civilian GPs), with a requirement for urgent psychiatric assessment are referred to HSE Accident &amp;amp; Emergency Departments.  Those requiring hospitalisation are admitted immediately. For non-urgent outpatient cases the waiting time for a HSE appointment is approximately 3 months. Therefore, in order to provide Defence Forces Primary Carers with the broadest range of options possible in dealing with the spectrum of cases that present to them, they have also been authorised to refer cases to local external private psychiatrists for outpatient treatment where deemed appropriate. <\/p>  <p>  An in-house psychiatrist has not yet been appointed to the Defence Forces. By way of background, a 2017 review of the Defence Forces psychiatric service recommended the employment of a full-time military psychiatrist. The previous incumbent providing these services to the Defence Forces on contract retired in May 2018 while arrangements were being made to implement this recommendation.  To continue to provide an interim in-house service until such time as the military psychiatrist position could be filled, efforts were made to engage a locum. However, this proved to be unsuccessful. <\/p>  <p>  A direct entrant competition for the position of military psychiatrist was launched on 26th July 2018 and closed on 30th September 2018. No applications were received for this competition.  <\/p>  <p>  To explore every option to facilitate an in-house appointment, I recently gave approval for my Department to conduct a competition for a contracted civilian consultant psychiatrist on a temporary 24-month contract at pay rates equivalent to those available in the HSE. As this is a civilian appointment, sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) is required and has been formally requested. My Department is actively pursuing this matter with DPER. <\/p>  <p>  As I have outlined on a number of occasions, there is a nationwide shortage of trained psychiatrists, with recruitment issues in a number of sectors of the health service.

The subvention given to O.N.E. was increased from &euro;44,000 to &euro;100,000 per annum last year.  This significant increase in the grant will make a substantial contribution to the work of O.N.E. which provides accommodation to homeless, elderly and disabled ex-members of the Defence Forces in Smithfield, Dublin, Athlone and Letterkenny.

The White Paper on Defence is clear that there is a continued requirement to retain and develop the RDF and it is currently on a development path arising from the recommendations of the White Paper. <\/p><p>As of 31st January 2019 the strength of the Reserve is as follows:<\/p><p>First Line Reserve:  288 personnel<\/p><p>Army Reserve: 1761 personnel<\/p><p>Naval Service Reserve: 138 personnel<\/p><p>A key ongoing challenge for the RDF is to recruit and retain personnel.  I am very much aware that there continues to be a shortfall between the current strength figures and those of the establishment, which provides for 4,069 personnel and recruitment is ongoing.A total of 129 new recruits were inducted to the RDF in 2018.  The Defence Forces will run two recruitment campaigns for the Army Reserve and the Naval Service Reserve this year, one in March and a second in October.  Supports being provided to maximise recruitment to the Reserve include the use of social media and outreach activities by RDF members.  PDF recruit exit interviews now contain information on applying for membership of the RDF. <\/p><p>Under the current phase of implementation of White Paper actions, two White Paper projects have been identified which are important precursors to the establishment of a Specialist Reserve.  A gap analysis of skills sets in the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) will identify potential roles for Reserve members who possess specialist skills.  Options to develop the First Line Reserve are also currently being examined.  <\/p><p>In 2018, the Chief of Staff assigned the responsibility of Director of Reserve Defence Force to the Director of Combat Support &amp;amp; ISTAR.  In this context, plans for 2019 provide guidance, across all units and formations with RDF assets, in developing their capabilities.  This is in line with the single force concept and the role of the Reserve as described in the White Paper on Defence.  The focus will be to harness RDF skills and talent, maximising its development on the basis of mutual engagement with the PDF.  Specific project areas will focus on training, regulation, recruitment, retention and promotions and will be supported through RDF and PDF reciprocal training, mentoring and education.<\/p><p>Engagement continues with the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association (RDFRA) on key issues of import to them.  My officials are scheduled to meet RDFRA in the coming weeks.  RDFRA have been identified as key stakeholders in the RDF relevant White Paper projects and their views will be sought on appropriate matters as the need arises as projects mature and progress.  To that end, RDFRA have been invited to attend a White Paper briefing with my officials on the 11th March 2019.Practical supports to RDFRA consist of quarterly payments by my Department per annum and an annual telephone allowance.  A total of 750 Reserve Mandays are also made available specifically to RDFRA to allow its members conduct association business.<\/p><p>I would like to assure the Deputy and RDFRA that I remain committed to the ongoing development of the RDF within the framework set out in the White Paper and having regard to resource availability.  It is my intention to ensure that the momentum on its development is maintained throughout 2019 and the coming years. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600052#WRA04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Army Barracks","counter":46,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600052#WRA04500"},{"type":"question","counter":47,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[9419\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600052#WRA04600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if the former D&uacute;n U&iacute; N&eacute;ill Barracks, Cavan town, County Cavan will be available for use by the Permanent Defence Forces should security needs require the deployment of additional personnel to the central Border area, namely counties Cavan and Monaghan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":48,"content":"<p>Primary responsibility for the internal security of the State rests with the Minister for Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The focus of these increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay. <\/p>  <p>  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, provides for increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the Agreement. Increases due from 1 January 2018 and 1 October 2018 have been paid to Permanent Defence Force personnel.

However, there are a number of factors, some of which are hard to predict, which will impact on the timeframe for achieving the 9,500 target. <\/p>  <p>  One such factor is the number of personnel departing in any given year.  Given the unique and demanding nature of military life, there is understandably a relatively high level of turnover among Defence Forces personnel. This is not new.<\/p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence recognises that continuous recruitment is the lifeblood of the Defence Forces and significant on-going targeted recruitment to the Permanent Defence Force will continue in 2019 with the recruitment plan targeting some 800 new entrants across all services and competition streams throughout the year. As outlined, the precise net gain in strength will be dependent on a variety of factors. This includes the number of trained personnel that depart, the achievement of recruitment targets and the number of trainees that successfully complete training, all of which can vary year on year.  The recruitment process itself is monitored and appraised on a continuous basis to ensure it remains fit for purpose. <\/p>  <p>  I have previously acknowledged that challenges exist in recruiting and retaining some specialists such as Pilots, Air Traffic Controllers, and certain Technicians.

The Defence Forces conduct training and education under four broad categories namely; Leadership, Skills, Career, and Collective. Leadership Training is the medium through which the Defence Forces ensure that personnel are prepared for exercising command authority across the full range of military functions both at home and overseas in international operations. Skills Training ensures that Defence Forces personnel have the requisite individual, specialist, and crew skills. Career Training, and education, provides the organisation with the necessary pool of leaders and commanders at all levels. Collective Training allows military personnel to use their individual, crew, specialist and career training together, to develop integrated and coherent combat forces.<\/p><p>The scheduling of training in the Defence Forces, including the Reserve, is underpinned by an analysis of training required to meet operational output and capability development requirements. A long term strategy is adopted with current planning horizons set out to 2021. <\/p><p>The Defence Forces seek to constantly benchmark training across all three arms of the organisation against best military and academic practice.

Multilateral engagement, both in a national capacity and through the EU, is fundamental for adhering to this objective. Ireland works closely with our EU and UN partners in the multilateral fora to monitor compliance with international human rights standards.<\/p><p>Human Rights concerns are an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s and the EU&rsquo;s relations with all of the states across the Middle East region. Discussions at the EU Foreign Affairs Council (FAC), whether on the Middle East or other areas, frequently touch on human rights concerns. For example, recent FAC discussions on Syria in February 2019, Iran in December 2018 and Libya in October 2018 all touched on these issues. In February 2019, the FAC adopted Council Conclusions on EU Priorities in UN human rights fora, which reaffirmed the EU commitment to the UN Human Rights system and made specific mention of human rights concerns in countries throughout the Middle East.<\/p><p>Ireland frequently raises issues of human rights abuses, in a national capacity, through the human rights mechanisms of the UN including the Human Rights Council and Universal Periodic Review (UPR) in Geneva and the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly in New York.<\/p><p>At the UN Human Rights Council&rsquo;s most recent completed session in September 2018, Ireland raised many concerns under Item 4, as being human rights situations requiring the Council's attention. The situations about which we expressed Ireland's concern included reports of attacks in Yemen resulting in civilian casualties; the continued expansion of Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and efforts to prevent outside observers from scrutinising Israel's conduct of the occupation; and restrictions on civil society space and the treatment of human rights defenders in Bahrain. During this HRC session, Ireland also made a national intervention during the Interactive Dialogues with the Commissions of Inquiry on Syria. Ireland will raise a number of human rights concerns in relation to the Middle East in the current session of the Human Rights Council, which opened this week.<\/p><p>The UN Human Rights Council's Universal Periodic Review (UPR) is another important mechanism for taking action to highlight human rights violations. Ireland used the UPR session on Yemen in January 2019 to highlight grave breaches of international humanitarian law and challenges to humanitarian access. Ireland made several recommendations to the Government of Yemen including: to engage with the work of the Group of Eminent and Regional Experts appointed by the Human Rights Council; to monitor and report on the situation of human rights in Yemen; and to take all steps necessary to ensure safe and unhindered humanitarian access to conflict-affected areas.<\/p><p>Human rights will continue to be a key element in Ireland's policy on the Middle East, as they are elsewhere in the world.

We strongly condemn all forms of persecution on the basis of religion or belief, irrespective of where it occurs or who the victims are. We attach great importance to combating discrimination based on religion or belief, and incitement to religious hatred.<\/p>  <p>  We strive to protect and promote human rights through our work at the EU, the UN, and other international fora. In addition, Ireland frequently raises and will continue to raise the issue of the persecution of minorities through its official bilateral contacts, stressing the responsibility of governments to protect all citizens and minorities, irrespective of their religion or belief.<\/p>  <p>  At EU level, Ireland played a key role in the adoption by the EU of guidelines on freedom of religion or belief during our Presidency in 2013. These guidelines provide a framework for the promotion of this right in the EU's external human rights policy. My EU counterparts and I regularly discuss conflicts in the Middle East at the Foreign Affairs Council, and the need to protect the rights of minority groups is frequently underlined. For instance, the Council adopted conclusions on the Syrian conflict in April 2018, underlining the need for accountability, including for crimes committed against religious, ethnic and other groups and minorities. In addition, the January 2018 Council conclusions on Iraq reiterated the EU&rsquo;s firm and active commitment to the preservation of the multi-ethnic, multi-religious, and multi-confessional nature of Iraqi society, including the protection of its minority groups.  Last week, the Foreign Affairs Council adopted conclusions on the EU priorities in UN Human Rights Fora which commit the Union to continue to promote and protect freedom of religion or belief and to condemn persecution of religious minorities across the world.<\/p>  <p>  During the 36th session of the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) in September 2017, Ireland strongly condemned all forms of persecution and violence committed on the basis of religion or belief and called on all States to prevent such acts, highlighting our concern, in particular, regarding the persecution of religious minorities in the Middle East. Addressing the high-level segment of the 37th session of the HRC in February 2018, my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, highlighted threats to freedom of religion and belief and minority religious communities worldwide, including those of Christian, Muslim and Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; faiths.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland also uses the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), a mechanism of the HRC, to remind countries under review of their obligation to advance fundamental freedoms, including the right to freedom of religion or belief, under international human rights law.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is deeply concerned by the persecution of Christians and other minorities in the Middle East. These communities are part of the historic fabric of their societies and countries, and in most cases they have lived peacefully alongside neighbours of different faiths for many centuries. The political turmoil which has overwhelmed many countries in that region in recent years has led to increased concerns about the safety of several religious minorities and other minority groups. ISIS, in particular, has brutally attacked and murdered many communities and groups of people for their religious beliefs. In response to this, Belgium hosted the third international Ministerial Conference on the Victims of Ethnic and Religious violence in the Middle East in May last, year, at which I spoke.<\/p>  <p>  We believe that the interests of minority groups are best served by pursuing the general goal of pluralism, and we are wary of singling out specific groups in a way which may inadvertently put them at risk. The only sure means of securing the protection of Christian communities and other minorities across the Middle East is through the promotion of sustainable political solutions to the conflicts which have for so long destabilised the region, and have been the key factor in the promotion of radical and extremist ideologies.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to actively support freedom of religion or belief in the Middle East, and across our foreign policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600054#WRC02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Syrian Conflict","counter":166,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600054#WRC02500"},{"type":"question","counter":167,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[9097\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600054#WRC02600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the efforts being made to assist persons in Rukban, Syria; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":168,"content":"<p>I am deeply concerned by the humanitarian situation inside Syria, with an estimated 13.1 million people in need of humanitarian assistance.

Typically these opportunities involve placement with, or by, third party organisations and are facilitated by the Department through a range of rosters, registers, initiatives and programmes. Depending on the role and local context, volunteers may need to be able to operate in challenging circumstances. It should be noted that volunteer roster members are neither members of the Department&rsquo;s staff, nor persons to whom the Department provides a service.<\/p>  <p>  Where prospective volunteers with a disability request a reasonable accommodation arrangement, including to facilitate their mustering as a volunteer, my Department will liaise with the individual and the third party organisation concerned with a view to determining whether a reasonable accommodation can be made having regard to the specific circumstance of the individual and the nature of the volunteering role envisaged.<\/p>  <p>  In the event that a member of the election observation roster with a disability asks that arrangements be made to faciltate participation in a particular mission, the Department would contact the EU or OSCE, as appropriate, to discuss the request. The decision to make that facilitation would be for the body concerned.  My Department would request that the relevant body take consideration of the individual's skills and specific needs, and also the whether the arrangements sought could reasonably be provided, taking into account the security, infrastructure and logistical environment.  This would need to be done on a mission-by-mission basis.  While Ireland nominates observers, the final selection decision rests with the relevant third party organisation.<\/p>  <p>  More broadly, Ireland's policy on overseas volunteering is set out in the Volunteering Initiative, which promotes skills-based, sustainable volunteering overseas, working in partnership with third parties. The forthcoming launch of a new White Paper on International Development provides an opportunity to review our approach to overseas volunteering to ensure that it keeps pace with the evolving discourse on volunteering for development, and also with the development of best practice on promoting equality and diversity at home and abroad. The Department will consult with relevant stakeholders to take this work forward.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is not aware that any member of the Rapid Response Corps roster or any member of the previous election observation roster, who was nominated to participate in an overseas mission in 2017 or 2018, requested an accommodation or dispensation regarding a disability. To date in 2019 no such requests have been received from those shortlisted to either roster. In the event that a request is received the Department will consult with the EU, OSCE or UN as appropriate, to determine the reasonable accommodations which can be made in the mission concerned, having due regard to the individual's needs and also the security, logistical and other conditions of the mission.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the recent election roster selection process, as has been outlined in the responses to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 59 of 23 January and 61 and 65 of 6 February 2019, no applicant in that process raised the issue of disability at the time of applying. Had any applicant done so, the issue would have been given our full consideration. In such an event, and notwithstanding that this is a volunteer roster, the Department's approach would have been informed by the reasonable accommodation procedures followed by the Public Appointments Service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600054#WRC05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1241"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":200,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 101 and 102 answered with Question No. 84.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Funding","counter":202,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600055#WRD00200"},{"type":"question","counter":203,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[9572\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600055#WRD00300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the breakdown of funds received by his Department or channelled through his Department from EU funds in 2017; and the programmes these funds supported.","asker":"1312","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":204,"content":"<p>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is not in receipt of and does not have EU funds channelled though the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600055#WRD00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Rights","counter":205,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600055#WRD00500"},{"type":"question","counter":206,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[9594\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600055#WRD00600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if a review of legislation will be considered to allow employees who work at an embassy here to avail of rights under employment law here, including the pursuance of their cases through the appropriate workplace relations bodies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1433","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":207,"content":"<p>The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961 (&ldquo;the Vienna Convention&rdquo;) is an international treaty that provides a framework for diplomatic relations between States.  The Vienna Convention was ratified by Ireland in 1967 and incorporated into Irish law by the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act 1967. The Convention, which enjoys almost universal ratification, provides for various privileges and immunities for diplomats and certain other persons working at a Diplomatic Mission and the Missions themselves. Under the Convention, it is the duty of all persons enjoying diplomatic privileges and immunities to respect the laws and regulations of the host State, which includes applicable employment law. <\/p>  <p>  Persons working for Diplomatic Missions &ndash; i.e. for foreign governments &ndash; may in certain circumstances bring legal proceedings in relation to their employment against that government, subject to the Vienna Convention and the rules of state immunity, also known as sovereign immunity. Sovereign immunity is a longstanding principle of international law which applies automatically and is not regulated by the Vienna Convention or domestic legislation. Cases of this nature are on occasion brought to the Workplace Relations Commission. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to workers employed directly by Missions, there are instances in which diplomatic personnel assigned to Missions in Ireland employ private domestic employees.

The United Kingdom is to set out its commitments in this respect, as well as on the operation of the dedicated mechanisms which form part of its implementation of this commitment. <\/p>  <p>  The Protocol also confirms that Irish citizens in Northern Ireland \"will continue to enjoy, exercise and have access to rights, opportunities and benefits\" that come with EU citizenship. Further engagement is needed on which EU rights, opportunities or benefits can be exercised by the people of Northern Ireland who are Irish and therefore EU citizens, when they are resident in Northern Ireland, which will be outside the territory of the European Union after the UK departure. The negotiations on the future relationship of the UK with the European Union will be an important factor in this regard. There is an onus on the UK Government to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts in any scenario and it should ensure relevant issues, including possible future UK participation in EU funds and programmes, are part of its detailed position and pursued in the discussions on the EU-UK future relationship.<\/p>  <p>  However, under any scenario for the UK&rsquo;s exit from the European Union, the obligations and commitments of the Irish and UK Governments under the Good Friday Agreement remain and the Government will continue to work with the UK Government as co-guarantor to secure the full implementation of the Agreement. <\/p>  <p>  In this context, the Government has noted and welcomes the commitment by Prime Minister May in her speech in Belfast on 5 February, that the British Government \"will uphold the rights enshrined in the Belfast Agreement for all the people of Northern Ireland, right across the whole community.  This includes upholding commitments around mutual respect, religious liberties, equality of opportunity, tolerance and rights.\"  The Government also noted and welcomes the Prime Minister's acknowledgement that \"the birth right to identify and be accepted as British, Irish or both, and to hold both British and Irish citizenship is absolutely central to the Agreement.\"<\/p>  <p>  These are welcome commitments and acknowledgements by Prime Minister May.  I have raised with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland the need for the citizenship and identity provisions of the Good Friday Agreement to be fully taken account of in all relevant policy areas, and there has been ongoing engagement between our officials, including through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Secretariat. <\/p>  <p>  The Government will continue to engage with the UK Government as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement on this important issue in any scenario.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600055#WRD02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":223,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600055#WRD02400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pension (Contributory) Data","counter":222,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600055#WRD02300"},{"type":"question","counter":223,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[9150\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600055#WRD02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the efforts he has made to ascertain the number of persons in receipt of the qualified adult dependant increase on the State pension (contributory) affected by a ruling of the High Court of 29 June 2018 who are the beneficial owners of the income and therefore entitled to PAYE tax credit and increased rate band; if all recipients are being contacted in relation to same; and if his Department has issued refunds.","asker":"1250","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":224,"qnumday":122,"qnumall":"[9148\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600055#WRD02500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of persons who had pension statements amended and refunds issued for qualifying years (details supplied).","asker":"1250","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":225,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[9149\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600055#WRD02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the rationale for amending section 126(2)(b) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 with effect from 1 January 2014 in view of the fact the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection regarded a qualified adult dependant as income of the beneficiary of the State pension and therefore neither the PAYE credit nor increased rate band were due to the dependent in respect of the income from this date.","asker":"1250","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":226,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 111, 122 and 123 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 provides for the payment of an increase in the amount of weekly state pension where the beneficiary has a qualified adult dependent.  <\/p>  <p>  Section 126 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 deals with the tax treatment of certain benefits payable under the Social Welfare Acts.  <\/p>  <p>  By way of context, I am advised by Revenue that although the qualifying adult portion of a pension is paid directly to the qualified adult, this payment is premised on there being an entitlement to the pension in the first instance.  As stated in section 112 of the Social Welfare Consolidation 2005 Act, the qualified adult portion is an &ldquo;increase&rdquo; in the pension and is payable in respect of a spouse\/civil partner\/cohabitant who is being financially maintained and whose income is not greater than a specified amount. Finance (No.2) Act 2013, inserted subsection (2B) into section 126 with effect from 1 January 2014.  Subsection (2B) provides that for all the purposes of the Income Tax Acts, any increase in the state pension in respect of a qualified adult dependent is treated as if it arises to and is payable to the beneficiary of the pension, that is, the person who qualifies for the pension. The intention behind the change to s. 126 in s. 12 of Finance Act (No. 2) 2013 was to put beyond doubt that the beneficiary of a Department of Social Protection pension is assessable on the aggregate of the pension and the amount by which the pension is increased for a qualified adult. Consequently, for the tax years 2014 onwards, one employee (PAYE) tax credit only is available in respect of the pension, including the qualified adult dependent increase, and there is no entitlement to any increase in the amount charged to income tax at the standard rate as a result of the qualified adult dependent increase. <\/p>  <p>  In the details supplied, the Deputy refers to the ruling of the High Court on 26 June 2018, which determined that (prior to the enactment of Finance (No.2) Act 2013) a qualified adult dependent for the purposes of the old age contributory pension was beneficially entitled, in his or her own right, to the amount of the increase of the pension payment. The High Court case in question was a Case Stated of a determination of the Tax Appeals Commission which found in favour of the taxpayer&rsquo;s claim that an additional, second employee (PAYE) tax credit and extended standard rate income band were due to the taxpayer for 2012 and 2013 in relation to the receipt of the qualifying adult dependent increase in the pension.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by Revenue that there was a review of Revenue&rsquo;s systems for the relevant years prior to 2014 to identify valid claims for refunds. In accordance with Section 865 of the TCA 1997, a valid claim is made where a person furnishes a statement or return within a period of four years following the tax year to which the claim relates. Some 370 cases with valid claims were identified in respect of the issue determined by the High Court. The cases in question were reviewed and refunds of the order of &euro;0.7m, including interest, were processed.  A small number of cases are still being finalised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600055#WRD02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Investment Bank Loans","counter":227,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600055#WRD02800"},{"type":"question","counter":228,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[9151\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600055#WRD02900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if Ireland, through its appointed director to the European Investment Bank, will support the cessation of lending to fossil fuel projects through the new energy lending policy of the bank in 2019 in view of commitments (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1366","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":229,"content":"<p>On 10 January of 2019, the European Investment Bank launched a three-month public consultation to develop a new Energy Lending Policy that supports EU 2030 energy policy and climate targets. During this consultation period, the EIB will engage with a wide range of stakeholders, including shareholders, industry associations, civil society and the private sector. The EIB held a consultation meeting yesterday (25 February) in Brussels to engage directly with all stakeholders interested in a direct exchange with the Bank about the review. I understand that written contributions on the consultation document can be sent to the Bank before a deadline of 29 March.<\/p>  <p>  The new Energy Lending Policy is expected to come before the EIB Board of Directors for approval during this coming Autumn. In advance of this, it is not possible to pre-empt the outcome of the consultation process or Board discussions with regard to the Bank&rsquo;s stance on funding fossil fuel projects under its new Energy Lending Policy.<\/p>  <p>  The Bank&rsquo;s existing approach towards supporting the energy sector is set out in its Energy Lending Criteria (ELC) which was adopted in 2013. As part of the ELC, the Bank introduced an Emissions Performance Standard (EPS) &ndash; a safeguard designed to ensure that the Bank only supports plants that contribute to reducing average emission levels. While the ELC notes that &ldquo;the current and, in all likelihood, future EU energy policy does not prohibit the construction of any new fossil fuel fired power stations&rdquo;, the Bank&rsquo;s use of the EPS effectively rules out the possibility of financing of new coal or lignite fired power stations and potentially other fossil fuel power stations. A recent evaluation of the current policy therefore concluded that the ELC and, particularly, the application of the EIB EPS, has resulted in the Lending Criteria being more stringent than wider EU Energy Policy. <\/p>  <p>  Under the ELC, fossil fuel related projects are only considered by the EIB in exceptional circumstances. Projects which contribute to the security of supply of isolated energy systems such as small islands with no feasible mainland energy connection and only where there is no economically viable alternative, or in the poorest countries outside the EU where it can be demonstrated that projects with carbon emissions above the threshold will have a significant and material positive impact on poverty alleviation and economic development would define such rare cases.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s position on the new energy lending policy in the EIB will be guided by Government policy in relation to climate change and energy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600055#WRD03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carbon Tax Implementation","counter":230,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600055#WRD03100"},{"type":"question","counter":231,"qnumday":113,"qnumall":"[9469\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600055#WRD03200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the carbon tax that applies to peat extracted for fuel, horticultural or other purposes will be extended in view of the fact that the emissions of greenhouse gases are the same irrespective of the way in which the peat is oxidised.","asker":"1259","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":232,"content":"<p>Section 77 of the Finance Act 2010 provides that for the purposes of the solid fuel carbon tax, &lsquo;solid fuel&rsquo; means coal or peat.

However, I have been informed that the Garda Commissioner has indicated his preference that, in principle, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should not be funded by any source other than the exchequer for the purposes of tackling such matters.  He has however indicated his willingness to continue to look at establishing an improved investigative capacity within the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) in the area of insurance fraud overall. The Deputy will, of course, appreciate that it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the allocation of resources within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and neither I nor the Minister for Justice and Equality has a role in such operational matters.<\/p><p>It is important to note that an industry-funded Garda unit was a single mechanism proposed as a potential means by which to implement the intent behind the relevant recommendation, the wording of which calls for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to explore the potential for further cooperation between it and the insurance sector in relation to insurance fraud investigation.  In this regard, much constructive engagement has taken place through the Fraud Roundtable, which was formed by the CIWG primarily to implement Recommendation 13 of the <i>Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance<\/i>, work which culminated in the publication by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of the <i>Guidelines for the Reporting of Suspected Fraudulent Insurance Claims by Insurance Entities to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na<\/i>in October 2018.  A particularly positive &lsquo;spin-off&rsquo; development from the Roundtable has been that the GNECB and Insurance Ireland&rsquo;s Anti-Fraud Forum &ndash; which is drawn from the fraud sections of the major individual insurers &ndash; have committed to meet on a regular basis in order to discuss and act upon current and ongoing general issues which arise in the area of insurance fraud.<\/p><p>In relation to the proposal that insurance companies provide (which it is presumed was the intended word in the Deputy&rsquo;s question, instead of &ldquo;receive&rdquo;) a guarantee to reduce premium levels, I believe there is a need to be careful about requesting such commitments, particularly in the context of competition in the sector, as it may send a signal to other insurers about what pricing levels might be.  This is particularly the case in the context of ongoing investigations into the insurance sector by both the European Commission and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  <\/p><p>However, the above said, I would expect that insurers&rsquo; pricing of premiums in general would take account of the measures which have been, and are being, implemented as a result of the CIWG recommendations more broadly and I believe that insurers themselves recognise this.  In this regard, I would recall that Justice Nicholas Kearns, the Chairperson of the Personal Injuries Commission (PIC), noted in the foreword of its second report that insurance industry representatives on the PIC repeatedly stated that, as award levels and associated costs account for the bulk of the cost of insurance, if claims costs come down and are maintained at a consistent and predictable level, then premiums will also reduce accordingly.  <\/p><p>Overall, it is envisaged that the full implementation of all the recommendations taken cumulatively, with the appropriate levels of commitment and cooperation from all relevant stakeholders, can achieve the objectives of delivering fairer premiums for consumers and businesses, and a more stable and competitive insurance market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600055#WRD03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":239,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600055#WRD04000"},{"type":"question","counter":240,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[9041\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600055#WRD04100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if VAT on natural gas bills is calculated including the carbon tax or minus the carbon tax; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Central Bank can take action against a regulated entity which does not comply with the CCMA (for example by imposing a direction on such entity or taking enforcement action under the Central Bank&rsquo;s Administrative Sanctions Procedure).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600055#WRD04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Customs and Excise Staff","counter":246,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600055#WRD04700"},{"type":"question","counter":247,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[9100\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600055#WRD04800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of operational customs officials; the number that will be operational on 29 March 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1336","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":248,"content":"<p>Revenue is a fully integrated tax and customs administration.

From these engagements, it would appear that the main difficulty in these sectors is a lack of capacity in the market which I understand has been driven to some degree by the overall claims level in these sectors.<\/p>  <p>  In determining their willingness to enter into or remain in a particular sector of the market, insurers will generally make an assessment of what they consider the overall risk to be. Therefore, part of their assessment of what premium level to charge, or whether to offer cover will be based on what they consider the general likely trend for claims in the sector will be, based on their overall past experience. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that as Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation and neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Therefore I cannot compel insurers to provide cover to businesses such as play centres or marts.<\/p>  <p>  The above said however, it was recognised with the establishment of the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) that the environment within which insurers conduct their business can be better shaped, in order to make the Irish insurance market a more competitive one and also make it more attractive for new entrants.

There are currently over 117,500 children, including over 13,000 children with special educational needs, transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres annually. The safety of children and those on board school transport vehicles is the number one priority for the Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann. <\/p>  <p>  The school transport fleet is made up of both Contractors Vehicles and Bus &Eacute;ireann vehicles. Bus &Eacute;ireann procures vehicles to operate school transport services on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.  The categories of vehicles procured are as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - Taxi  &ndash; up to 8 seats<\/p>  <p>  - Minibus &ndash; 9 to 18 seats<\/p>  <p>  - Medium bus &ndash; 19 &ndash; 34 seats <\/p>  <p>  - Large bus &ndash; 35 + seats<\/p>  <p>  The vehicle sourced for any given route is dependent on the route travelled, the number of pupils requiring transport, and the individual requirements of the child, as in the case with transport for children with Special Educational needs. <\/p>  <p>  Contracts for School Transport Services are awarded based on the most economically advantageous tender.  The most economically advantageous tender is evaluated based on the weighted criteria set out in the Conditions of Tendering document.  A total of 1000 marks (100%) is available. The Quality\/Price ratio is 40:60.  A minimum quality threshold of 60% applies to each of the quality criteria.  Only tenders which meet each Minimum Quality Threshold will be evaluated on Price.  Scoring tables are provided in the Conditions of Tendering document with details on how marks are awarded for each of the quality criteria.  <\/p>  <p>  In regard to safety, in order to be considered roadworthy a bus must pass an annual Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness Test (CVRT), conducted under the auspices of the Road Safety Authority (RSA) at approved test centres around the country.  Bus &Eacute;ireann school transport providers are contractually obliged to ensure that their vehicle has an up to date roadworthiness certificate issued by an RSA accredited test centre when a contract is signed. The contractor is obliged to keep their roadworthiness certificate current and up to date at all times and provide Bus &Eacute;ireann with evidence of this. All school buses in service - procured by Bus &Eacute;ireann to provide services under the School Transport Scheme - that are subject to roadside inspections must have current roadworthiness certification at the time of inspection.  <\/p>  <p>  A detailed contract is put in place for all contracted services &ndash; which includes numerous safety-related items. There is a strict process in place before any vehicle or driver is added to the approved list for provision of services under the School Transport Scheme. Required documentation is checked and copies are held by Bus &Eacute;ireann offices. This documentation includes insurance and insurance indemnity, valid Road Passenger Transport Operator Licence (with required vehicles added), valid Certificate of Roadworthiness (CRW), appropriate valid Public Service Vehicle licence (large\/small) (PSV) and evidence of Tax Clearance. Bus &Eacute;ireann contracts also include a stipulation that requires all contractors to have planned maintenance programmes, with checking intervals of not more than six weeks.<\/p>  <p>  Every Contractor is also responsible as an individual bus operator, licensed by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, to ensure they comply with legislation in all respects.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to statutory requirements, Bus &Eacute;ireann arranges for additional sample auditing of contractors vehicles operating under the Scheme, throughout the year.  These additional quality assurance checks are carried out by independent vehicle inspection auditors, on both a targeted and random basis. Almost one in five buses contracted to the School Transport Scheme are audited under these quality assurance checks, which are designed to monitor the condition and roadworthiness status of each vehicle checked.  Vehicles that fall short of the standards required during the audits are immediately withdrawn from further service until all identified issues are rectified by the contractor. If contractors are found not to have carried out the required improvements to their fleet and systems, they face penalties up to and including termination of contract. <\/p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann vehicles are brought into the garage every six weeks for a full maintenance checks. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600057#WRF05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":362,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600057#WRF05400"},{"type":"question","counter":363,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[8971\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600057#WRF05500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the steps he has taken to communicate with substitute teachers regarding the pay and tax issue; and when he expects to have the matter resolved.","asker":"1225","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":364,"content":"<p>My Department issues salary and pension payments to approximately 120,000 payees a fortnight on four payrolls: primary teachers, post primary teachers, non-teaching staff and retired teachers, spouses and children.<\/p><p>The Revenue Commissioners have introduced real time PAYE (PAYE modernisation) which went live on the 1<sup>st<\/sup>January 2019.

Informed by the outcomes of that audit, the Council selected five jurisdictions for a more in-depth curriculum investigation.  A review of literature on computational thinking was also completed.  These research reports are available at <i>www.ncca.ie\/en\/primary\/primary-developments\/coding-in-primary-schools.<\/i><\/p><p>The research informed the design of the <i>Coding in Primary Schools Initiative<\/i>which began in 2017.  Phase 1 of the initiative involved working with 15 primary schools which had invested significant time and financial resources alongside building staff expertise in the area of coding and computational thinking.  The NCCA&rsquo;s work focused on gathering information from the schools about their work with coding.  These &lsquo;classroom stories&rsquo; help to answer questions such as, what types of coding experiences are teachers currently providing?  Where in the primary curriculum is this work happening?  Which classes are involved?  Why did the teacher\/school start work on coding?  What are the benefits and challenges? <\/p><p>Examples from this work are also  published at <i>www.ncca.ie\/en\/primary\/primary-developments\/coding-in-primary-schools<\/i>and have informed the development of materials to support other schools in introducing coding and computational thinking as part of Phase 2 in the initiative.  This second phase began in May 2018 and involves 25 additional schools which, prior to the initiative, had little, if any, experience with coding.  The purpose of Phase 2 is to explore how, where and to what extent coding and computational thinking should be integrated into a redeveloped primary curriculum.  The initiative will conclude in the coming weeks and a report will be finalised and submitted to me for consideration.<\/p><p>The Deputy may be interested to know that at Post-Primary level an optional short course in Coding is available to all schools as part of the recent developments at junior cycle and coding is also a central element in the new Leaving Certificate Computer Science subject introduced in schools since last September.

As set out in the NDP, part of the Construction Group's remit is to consider the supply of necessary skills and enhancing the capacity of the sector.  The NDP also highlights the importance of examining the role of Building Information Modelling and adopting other technologies and innovative practices in driving improving productivity and efficiencies.  The work of the Group will, therefore have an important role to play in ensuring that the construction sector enhances its capacity to meet infrastructural priorities over the next decade. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is also closely monitoring all aspects of construction skills and labour supply, through the national skills database and through the work of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), the National Skills Council and the Regional Skills Fora.  A study of the construction sector will be undertaken by the EGFSN in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  In responding to specific skill needs for the construction sector, a particular focus of my Department and the education and training sector more generally has been an expansion in apprenticeship recruitment.  Apprenticeship is a demand driven educational and training programme, which aims to develop the skills of an apprentice in order to meet the needs of industry and the labour market. Consequently, the number of construction related apprentices being registered is determined by employers within the construction sector. My Department and SOLAS are committed to supporting the registration of apprentices in the construction sector. <\/p>  <p>  There were 3,398 construction related apprenticeship registrations in 2018 which represents an increase of 14% on the 2017 figure of 2,971 and almost 47% on the 2016 figure of 2,316.  Registrations on craft apprenticeships are forecast to increase further up to 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The range of apprenticeships on offer is also being expanded to meet the identified skill needs of the sector.  Arising from the Apprenticeship Council&rsquo;s two calls for apprenticeship proposals apprenticeships in Engineering Services Management, scaffolding and senior quantity surveyor apprenticeship are currently being developed into national apprenticeship programmes.

These contracts are generally awarded on the basis of lowest tender.<\/p><p>For larger or more complex school building projects, where it is considered that pre-qualification of contractors is warranted, the Restricted Procedure is normally used. In the Restricted procedure, there is an intermediary qualification stage during which the numbers of applicants is reduced (or restricted) to a specified amount (normally 8 - 10).  The pre-qualification process uses a combination of pass\/fail criteria and qualitative criteria to establish the tender short-list.  All criteria have minimum standards which must be met.

Schools should supervise and support children who are distressed or out of control until they have recovered and are able to re-engage in the classroom. In some circumstances this may mean the temporary removal of a child from the environment where the problems have arisen. Schools are not required to report on such interventions. <\/p>  <p>  Schools owe a duty of care to all their students and any action taken in relation to managing behaviour must be proportionate.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla's Educational Welfare Service, under the aegis of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, has published guidelines for schools on Codes of Behaviour which all schools are required by law to have in place. The guidelines advise that specialised behaviour management strategies, such as the use of restraint, should not be used without expert advice, training and monitoring. In particular, the guidelines point to certain sanctions which are regarded as inappropriate, including leaving a student in an unsupervised situation while in the care of the school. All parents must be made aware of behaviour management strategies employed by the school.<\/p>  <p>  Schools may seek advice from their local National Educational Psychological Services psychologist, from the NCSE&rsquo;s Support Service which includes Special Educational Needs Organisers, the National Behavioural Support Service and the Special Education Support Service, as to how children with behavioural needs can best be supported in school.<\/p>  <p>  A range of guidance is available for schools in relation to the management of student behaviour. The Department published Guidelines for Supporting Pupils with Behavioural, Emotional, and Social Difficulties, which is available on the Department&rsquo;s website, www.education.ie. The National Educational Psychological Services document Behavioural, Emotional and Social Difficulties &ndash; A Continuum of Support also provides advice for teachers, including some advice on the use of &ldquo;time out&rdquo; procedures in the classroom.<\/p>  <p>  Training is available for schools in relation to the provision of support for children with special educational needs from the NCSE&rsquo;s Regional Service. The Special Education Support Service can, as part of their designated training modules, provide guidance for schools in relation to the management of difficult behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE&rsquo;s Policy Advice Supporting Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder in Schools (2015) recommended that the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills develop guidelines for schools on the prevention and management of crisis student behaviour situations in schools.  <\/p>  <p>  Having considered the matter, my Department has undertaken to develop new guidelines for schools on the prevention and management of challenging behaviours (including the use of physical interventions) where such behaviour is considered as likely to present serious risk of physical harm to the student concerned and\/or others within the school environment.<\/p>  <p>  A Working Group has been established to develop the guidelines and work is ongoing in this regard. The Department will engage with education partners on the guidelines in the coming months. <\/p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the guidelines will be finalised by the end of this school year. <\/p>  <p>  The guidelines will be underpinned by the principles that such intervention is never used for the purposes of discipline; that it should be applied proportionately and should last only as long as is necessary to de-escalate the situation. The guidelines will also underline the importance of continued supervision of children during a crisis period including matters related to behaviour. It is also expected that the guidelines will underline the importance of recording such incidents and how they are managed.<\/p>  <p>  The guidelines will apply to all recognised schools. They will place a strong focus on prevention and early intervention strategies for the management of crisis student behaviour in which physical intervention may be employed only as the last part of a comprehensive, positive and planned behavioural approach by the school. Implementation of the guidelines will be supported through the provision of information and training supports.<\/p>  <p>  The guidelines will be informed by the evidence which shows that whole school positive behavioural approaches and early and ongoing engagement with the school community, including parents, are necessary for the development of effective school policy and practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600059#WRH03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Globalisation Fund","counter":456,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600059#WRH03400"},{"type":"question","counter":457,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[9296\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600059#WRH03500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if clarification on the application process to the European globalisation fund in the context of the decarbonisation restructuring strategy of Bord na M&oacute;na and the significant job losses in the midlands will be provided; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1339","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":458,"content":"<p>Under the current EGF Regulation, when making an application for EGF support to the European Commission, a Member State must provide a reasoned analysis of the link between the redundancies and major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation, demonstrated by: <\/p><p>- A substantial increase in imports into the EU; <\/p><p>- A serious shift in EU trade in goods or services;<\/p><p>- A rapid decline of the EU market share in a given sector; or<\/p><p>- A delocalisation of activities to third countries.<\/p><p>The Regulation ordinarily restricts eligibility to redundancy situations involving at least 500 redundancies in a specific company (including suppliers and downstream producers) within a 4 month period, or at least 500 redundancies in a specific sector in a 9 month period.

At primary level, there was a survey of school principals using the following socio-economic variables: %unemployment; %local authority accommodation; %lone parenthood; %travellers; %large families (more than 5 children); %pupils eligible for free books.  At post primary level a combination of data from the Departments pupil database including school level retention rates together with exam achievement data and exam fee waiver data, which indicated that students had medical cards, was used.  <\/p><p>Following a review of DEIS in 2016 and an extensive consultation process, a new identification process was developed for assessing schools levels of concentrated disadvantage. The key data sources used in the new DEIS identification process are the DES Primary Online Database (POD) and Post-Primary Online (PPOD) Databases, and CSO data from the National Census of Population as represented in the Haase Pratschke Deprivation Index  (HP Index).  The HP Index combines three underlying dimensions of affluence\/disadvantage, identified as Demographic Profile, Social Class Composition and Labour Market Situation, to achieve a balanced measure of relative affluence and deprivation, which evenly applies across the urban-rural continuum.Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, single parent rates, education levels, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates. This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.  This data is applied uniformly to all schools in the country in a fair and objective way, to identify the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in each school.The calculation of the level of disadvantage in each school is based on the socio-economic background of their pupil cohort using centrally held data as previously outlined and is not based on the location of the school but on the geographical CSO Small Areas where the pupil cohort resides.<\/p><p>A detailed document explaining the methodology used in the Identification process under DEIS plan 2017 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at<i>.<\/i><\/p><p>Following an initial application of this new methodology, 79 new schools were brought into the DEIS programme in 2017 with a further 30 being upgraded from Band 2 to Band 1 status.  These schools were assessed as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage.  <\/p><p>DEIS Plan 2017 states that the improved data on the socio-demographic of schools resulting from the new identification model will have an impact not only on the assessment of schools for inclusion in the programme but also on the scaling of resources to allow for more graduated levels of support.  This in turn allows for the ultimate objective of allocating resources to best meet the identified need of individual schools.<\/p><p>In order to achieve this, the current identification model needs to be as accurate as possible and this will be facilitated by the use of Eircode to ensure correct inputting of addresses. Further analysis is also required to examine other variables known to be strong predictors of educational disadvantage in the context of resource allocation.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600061#WRK01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":556,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600061#WRK02000"},{"type":"question","counter":557,"qnumday":229,"qnumall":"[9619\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600061#WRK02100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the position regarding the appointment of a project manager for a project (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":558,"content":"<p>A building project for the school referred to by the Deputy is included in my Department&rsquo;s 6 year Construction Programme.  <\/p>  <p>  A project brief has been finalised and the project will be delivered via the ADAPT programme.

As the Minister for Health also conveyed on that occasion, in liaison with my Department, Part 15 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, which provides for a pre-action protocol for use in clinical negligence cases, is also set to amend the limitation period in respect of such actions, by increasing the current 2 year limitation period to that of three years.

The Working Group took the view, having looked at other jurisdictions and supported by a number of submissions made to it in the course of its consultation exercise, &quot;that the current limitation period of two years applicable to personal injuries actions generally, is too restrictive and does not take account of the particular complexities associated with clinical negligence claims and the extent of their reliance on expert evidence of various types&quot;. The Group therefore considered that &quot;an extension of the limitation period to three years for clinical negligence claims would strike the appropriate balance between the legitimate interests of claimants and respondents to such claims&quot;.  The policy decision to introduce this extension under Part 15 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 is, therefore, considered to strike the appropriate balance while also providing reasonable time to enable clients engage in the pre-action protocol process as a reforming measure that can help to reduce the number of time-consuming and costly clinical negligence actions that come before the courts. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600061#WRK03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":574,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600061#WRK03800"},{"type":"question","counter":575,"qnumday":235,"qnumall":"[9008\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600061#WRK03900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if a non-EU spouse who holds a stamp 4-EUFAM residency permit will be permitted to remain living with their spouse with British citizenship here post-Brexit (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":576,"content":"<p>I have been informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that its officials are preparing for a variety of Brexit scenarios, including the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.

In regard to sentencing, the approach of the Oireachtas has generally been to specify in law a maximum penalty for an offence, so that a court, having considered all the circumstances of a case, may impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum. <\/p>  <p>  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but also to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present. An important safeguard rests in the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to the Court of Appeal to review a sentence she regards as unduly lenient. <\/p>  <p>  The Superior Courts have developed a substantial body of case law setting out general principles of sentencing. As the Deputy is aware, sentencing practice was also developed by a steering committee of the judiciary which developed the Irish sentencing information system, a pilot initiative designed to gather information about the range of sentences and other penalties that have been imposed for particular types of offences across court jurisdictions. <\/p>  <p>  Looking to the future, the Deputy will also be aware that the Judicial Council Bill is currently awaiting Committee Stage in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.

To facilitate it in carrying out its functions, it is envisaged that the Committee will have access to court documents relating to criminal proceedings. In addition to the collation and dissemination of sentencing decisions and information on those decisions, it will be empowered to conduct research and organise conferences, seminars and other events. As a general principle, the information will not disclose the names of the parties to the proceedings covered by the decisions.

However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has advised that it is progressively improving the facilities and technology available for the use of victims of crime in courthouses around the country. The funding for these developments, while not ring fenced, is provided for from within expenditure heading allocations for Courthouse Capital, Courthouse Maintenance and Information and Communication Technology (ICT). <\/p>  <p>  I am informed that from its allocated funding in 2019 the Courts Service is planning to provide video conferencing technology in the District Court Family Law Courts in Dolphin House in Dublin.

Section 25 of the 2018 Act provides for victims of domestic violence to give evidence by live television link, both in civil cases and in criminal cases for breaches of orders, so as to avoid the risk of intimidation by the perpetrator or an associate. Evidence given by live television link shall be video-recorded or audio-recorded. Section 25(3) of the 2018 Act provides that where live television link facilities are not in operation in a circuit court or district court district, and the court considers it desirable that evidence be given in this manner, the court may order the transfer of the proceedings to a circuit or district court district where those television link facilities are in operation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600061#WRK05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Programmes","counter":587,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600061#WRK05100"},{"type":"question","counter":588,"qnumday":239,"qnumall":"[8985\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600061#WRK05200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of the development of the criminal justice operational hub, in particular the development of agreed definitions and methods of data collection in line with best international standards by the stakeholders involved.","asker":"1259","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":589,"content":"<p>The Department of Justice and Equality is managing a program of work to deliver a &ldquo;Criminal Justice Operational Hub&rdquo; (CJOH).

The 2015 Act has also made it easier for relatives of a child, such as grandparents, to apply to court under section 11B of the 1964 Act to have access to children.  <\/p>  <p>  Section 25 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 requires the court, as it thinks appropriate and practicable, to take into account the child's wishes in custody and access matters, having regard to the age and understanding of the child. <\/p>  <p>  Section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 provides that the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration for the court to take into account in any proceedings where access to a child is in question.  It is a matter for the courts, when making decisions on access, to determine the best interests of the child and to decide whether or not to make an order regarding access to the child.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600062#WRL00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Naturalisation Applications","counter":604,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600062#WRL00500"},{"type":"question","counter":605,"qnumday":244,"qnumall":"[9152\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600062#WRL00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 285 of 18 December 2018, when a decision will issue in relation to the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1349","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":606,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the processing of the application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to by the Deputy is currently at an advanced stage and on completion of the necessary processing the application will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.

The changes were considered and approved, in the light of two years' experience in the operation of the scheme.  They were notified to barristers and solicitors by the Legal Aid Board at the end of January 2019.  <\/p><p>As outlined in the reply to Questions 299 and 300 of 19 February, the adjustments to the Legal Aid Board fees do not constitute an overall review of the terms and conditions for legal aid under Abhaile.  As the Deputy is aware from previous replies, the normal fees for a PIP or solicitor for a defended legal aid case under Abhaile remain unchanged.  There has been no change to the eligibility criteria for borrowers, and no change to the provision of legal aid under Abhaile free of charge to the borrower. <\/p><p>As previously outlined, in relation to representation by counsel: a borrower will continue to be represented in s.115A cases by a personal insolvency practitioner, a solicitor, and as needed, by junior and senior counsel. <\/p><p>The Board has indicated that barristers will not be approved <i>automatically<\/i>in every case.  There is no other area of civil legal aid where that is the case &ndash; and it is obvious that it may not always be necessary to approve counsel, for example, in a personal insolvency review case which is undefended. <\/p><p>However, the revised terms and conditions set out by the Legal Aid Board expressly indicate that in personal insolvency review cases, junior and (as needed) senior counsel will continue to be approved &lsquo;where there are legal complexities that require the involvement of counsel&rsquo; and this is expressly explained as including where a creditor raises legal issues that need to be argued by a barrister in court.  Counsel may also be approved on a case by case basis if there are exceptional circumstances, at the Board&rsquo;s discretion.  <\/p><p>Many personal insolvency review cases raise complex questions of law.  I and my Department are fully aware of the nature of the cases brought and decided over the past three years. Indeed, in January this year, on the launch of the Abhaile second year Report, I specifically underlined the priority that I attach to the good work being done under Abhaile, and to ensuring that the personal insolvency review can function effectively.<\/p><p>As outlined in the reply of 19 February, two reasonable changes are being introduced to the fees payable for all professionals.  First, the full fee will not be payable in undefended cases, where no creditor opposes the court review.  Secondly, personal insolvency cases often involve parallel applications by both partners, where a couple has the same home mortgage.  In practice, the vast majority of parallel applications are treated by the courts as one single case.  There is no reason for taxpayers to cover two full fees in such cases, and they will be payable at a full fee for one spouse and a reduced (10%) fee for the second spouse, representing the actual extra work involved. <\/p><p>These are manifestly reasonable changes. <\/p><p>Finally, barristers&rsquo; fixed fees are being reduced, but only to bring them into line with fees payable in other areas of civil legal aid where complex legal or procedural issues also arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600062#WRL02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Stations","counter":620,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600062#WRL02100"},{"type":"question","counter":621,"qnumday":250,"qnumall":"[9307\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600062#WRL02200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the arrangements in place in which Garda stations are not open and a person makes a phone call to that local Garda station; if these calls will be automatically transferred to a further Garda station in the region that is opened on a 24-hour basis and can answer the phone calls; if they are not directed to another Garda station that is also closed, the arrangements in place to ensure this happens; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":622,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is primarily responsible for the effective and efficient use of the resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in accordance with operational need and policing priorities.

Under this architecture the Commission makes legislative proposals concerning trade defence and engages with Member States through various Committees, including the Trade Defence Instruments Committee where Member States vote to support or oppose the measures proposed by the Commission. <\/p><p>Following a complaint by the European Biodiesel Board on behalf of EU producers, the European Commission launched an anti-subsidy investigation into imports of Argentine biodiesel on 31 January 2018. The Commission issued its final subsidy determination on 3 December 2018, finding that the Government of Argentina provided certain subsidies to its biodiesel industry and that such measures posed a threat of injury to the EU biodiesel industry. To regulate the importation of subsidized Argentine biodiesel into the EU and level the playing field for EU biodiesel manufacturers, the Commission recommended the imposition of definitive <i>ad valorem<\/i>anti-subsidy duties on imports of Argentine biodiesel of between 25% and 33.4%. In response, Argentine exporters offered a voluntary price undertaking proposal consisting of a Minimum Import Price (MIP) applicable to all Argentine biodiesel imports to the EU below a specified annual threshold; imports above that threshold would be subject to the EU&rsquo;s anti-subsidy duties.<\/p><p>At a meeting of the Trade Defence Instruments Committee, chaired by the Commission and representative of all Member States, on 30 January 2019, Member States voted to accept the Commission&rsquo;s proposal to introduce anti-subsidy measures on imports of Argentine biodiesel. Member States also voted to accept the voluntary price undertaking proposed by the Argentine exporters. The measures entered into force on 13 February 2019 (Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019\/244 of 11 February 2019 imposing a definitive countervailing duty on imports of biodiesel originating in Argentina). <\/p><p>The Minimum Import Price will be calculated on the basis of the international price of soybean oil, to which a fixed amount will be added. The Commission will monitor the situation on a quarterly basis, adjusting the MIP as necessary and ensuring that the undertaking given is not violated. Any breach of the undertaking will result in its withdrawal and the full application of the anti-subsidy duties.<\/p><p>The annual threshold for tariff-free imports of biodiesel from Argentina has been set at a volume roughly corresponding to its overall market performance and at around 10% of the average annual EU consumption of biodiesel between 2014 and 2017. While this is an annual allocation, Argentina has undertaken not to issue more than 37% of export certificates in any quarter in an effort so as not to create an imbalance in trade flows. Imports will be monitored by the European Commission in conjunction with Member States&rsquo; Customs authorities. Once this threshold has been exceeded, imports of Argentine biodiesel will be subject to the anti-subsidy duties laid out in the aforementioned Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019\/244.<\/p><p>Insofar as &lsquo;EU levies on domestic biofuels&rsquo; are concerned, I assume the Deputy is referring to a sustainability premium, and my Department remains in dialogue with the European Commission and colleague Member States on the interplay of this premium with this dossier.<\/p><p>The Commission considers that the combination of the MIP with the proposed annual level plus the <i>ad valorem<\/i>duty applicable to imports of biodiesel exceeding the annual level will offset any injurious effects to the EU biodiesel industry resulting from the subsidisation of Argentine exports. <\/p><p>As my Department has had ongoing engagement with Irish producers of biodiesel and the European Biodiesel Board, in relation to this case, as well as to the earlier related anti-dumping investigation (now terminated), we are fully seized of their interests in these matters.<\/p><p>On balance, I am satisfied that industry&rsquo;s concerns have been addressed by the price undertaking and anti-subsidy duties which entered into force on 13 February. I am further satisfied that these measures do not put EU manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage and that they are WTO-compliant.

In addition, my Department has carried out further detailed analysis work to determine the optimal geographical alignment of CHOs and Hospital Groups which can be achieved with minimal disruption, and which will ultimately be the geographical areas of the proposed new regional integrated care organisations. My Department is finalising proposals in this regard, and I hope to bring proposals to Government shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600064#WRN05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Care Packages Provision","counter":768,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600064#WRN05600"},{"type":"question","counter":769,"qnumday":301,"qnumall":"[9052\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600064#WRN05700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when an application for a home care package by a person (details supplied) will be processed to completion;

This decision was made in good faith to address the considerable fears of the many anxious women in Ireland, following issues which had emerged in relation to the CervicalCheck screening programme. <\/p>  <p>  In the months since then, there has been a significant increase in the volume of women presenting for smear tests. This includes women who have availed of the out of cycle tests, but also a greater number of women presenting for scheduled screening. This increased level of engagement with the programme is welcome. However, the increased demand has undoubtedly put pressure on lab capacity and turnaround times. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE has been working actively with the labs to manage this issue and to improve turnaround times for smear tests. In addition, the HSE is aiming to source additional screening capacity, which would improve the turnaround time of results.  However, sourcing capacity and resources is a global challenge as countries start to move to primary HPV screening, which vastly reduces the requirement for cytology screening staff.  The HSE is currently developing a capacity plan, which will take account of available capacity and expected demand, with the aim of bringing the programme into stabilisation this year.  This is a priority concern for my Department and the HSE. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE advises that the CervicalCheck Programme has recently agreed with laboratories to prioritise those slides which originate from women who attended colposcopy, as this cohort of women are considered to have the most serious need. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE also advises that the natural history of cervical cancer would indicate that the disease would normally develop over a period of 10 to 15 years.  Due to this very fact, it is important that any woman of screening age attends for cervical screening each and every time she is invited to participate.  The HSE has advised that in this context, a delay in the return of cervical screening results, whilst undesirable, is not necessarily dangerous and poses a very low risk to women.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600066#WRP01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Patient Safety","counter":840,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600066#WRP01100"},{"type":"question","counter":841,"qnumday":327,"qnumall":"[9228\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600066#WRP01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will address a matter in relation to patient safety (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":842,"content":"<p>There are no legally binding regulations governing the physical size of tablets\/capsules for human consumption to reduce the risk of choking.

There are already additional stocks of medicines routinely built into the Irish medicine supply chain, and these additional stocks, together with planning by Revenue to allow the fast-tracking of essential drugs into Ireland, where necessary, will help deal with any delays that may arise.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that there is no need for hospitals, pharmacists or patients to order extra quantities of medicines, or for doctors to issue additional prescriptions. To do so could disrupt existing stock levels and hamper the supply of medicines for other patients.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018, the HPRA developed and launched a multi-stakeholder Medicine Shortages Framework to anticipate and manage medicine shortages when they occur. The health system is therefore well placed to anticipate and respond to any additional shortages, should they arise because of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  As an additional safeguard, my Department requested that consideration be given to those categories of medicines which are considered most essential to public health. As a result, HSE and HPRA technical experts are undertaking a process to verify the contingency planning in place for the continuity of supply of medicines essential to public health, in order to determine those medicines that have the potential to be vulnerable to supply disruption and, where necessary, identify clinically appropriate alternatives. Work on this process is ongoing and will continue in the months before and after Brexit.  <\/p>  <p>  Both the HPRA and HSE have requested that medicines manufacturers and suppliers highlight any issues regarding the availability of specific products associated with Brexit and, to date, no major issues have been identified through this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600067#WRQ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Transfers","counter":891,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600067#WRQ00500"},{"type":"question","counter":892,"qnumday":345,"qnumall":"[9340\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600067#WRQ00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) is waiting on a bed in the Mater Hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":893,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

Working with youth groups and community groups, service providers have been asked to try to include youth friendly spaces so that mental health can be supported. The thrust of Government policy has been towards enhancing mental health support in the  community since &lsquo;A Vision For Change&rsquo; was adopted in 2006. This policy will be continued when the refreshed policy is published later this year.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Accessibility and Alignment<br \/><br \/>8.1 - Pathfinder should carry out a detailed assessment of the services and supports currently available in relation to youth mental health, in order to identify gaps in service provision and to scope what improvements could be achieved through greater coordination<br \/><br \/>8.2 - The HSE should improve provision of mental health supports to young people at the primary care level to reduce the pressure on the tertiary referral services and improve waiting times<br \/><br \/>8.3 - The HSE should establish a National Lead for Youth Mental Health and a Lead for Youth Mental Health in each Community Health Organisation (CHO) to co-ordinate the provision of services and address gaps in service provision, including out of hours services. The CHO Leads will liaise with relevant agencies to develop appropriate communication protocols, standardised assessment processes and coordination of service provision. This joint working will bring together expert stakeholders to identify and address potential blocks to service provision and seek to reduce current wait times nationally with the introduction of other more appropriate interventions in primary care.<\/td><td>Assessments of current services are being discussed by TUSLA as part of their service provision in agreement with DCYA. They have initially suggested that overview of services would need to take place for all of their services, but that this would need to include mental health services and that therefore they may be in a position to complete this recommendation. I will have more detail once I meet with Tusla. <br \/><br \/>Part of the recommendation refers to recruitment of HSE leads but the job specifications for full time staff are hard to define.

This means that the product manufacturers have not applied for an authorisation to market their products as medicinal products. This is because these products are unlikely to meet the same rigorous safety, quality and efficacy standards that authorised medicines must meet before being placed on the market, nor are the production processes likely to meet the same level of regulatory requirements as the marketing authorisation holders for authorised medicines. <\/p><p>However, whilst efficacy and safety data are not available for these products, it is crucially important that patients and prescribers can be assured, as far as possible, of the quality of these products.

To the Department&rsquo;s knowledge only two countries, Canada and the Netherlands, currently permit export of such cannabis products, which meet acceptable quality control standards, beyond their borders. The Netherlands permits exports of cannabis dried herb, but does not permit commercial export of their oil-based cannabis formulations, which is the formulation preferred by the clinical community.<\/p><p>Department officials are working intensively on finding solutions to the supply of appropriate quality assured products for Irish patients, in parallel to their ongoing work on other significant projects.

It will address the social determinants of health and outline models to provide integrated and comprehensive healthcare services, in line with Slaintecare.<\/p>  <p>  The Department has undertaken significant measures across the health service to address the health needs of Travellers, including funding for the All Ireland Traveller Health Study. There is ongoing and extensive engagement with Traveller organisations on their health needs.    <\/p>  <p>  The Department provides funding in the region of &euro;10m per annum to the HSE for targeted measures to improve the health status of the Travelling community.  These include:<\/p>  <p>  - primary healthcare projects, counselling services, family support programmes and men's health projects; dedicated public health nurses and related staff;<\/p>  <p>  - mental health promotion and suicide prevention services in a culturally sensitive manner, to reduce the stigma associated with mental health.<\/p>  <p>  A further &euro;500,000 initiatives aimed at improving Traveller mental health is provided through the Dormant Accounts Fund. Additional funding for Traveller mental health initiatives is provided in the HSE National Service Plan 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  The provision of additional resources for Traveller health is a matter for consideration in the preparation of the Estimates for Budget 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy (NTRIS) sets out over 30 actions to address the health needs of Travellers and Roma. The Department and the HSE report regularly on the implementation of these actions to the NTRIS steering group, chaired by Minister David Stanton. One of the NTRIS actions is for the HSE to develop and implement a detailed action plan to continue to address the specific health needs of Travellers, using a social determinants approach.    <\/p>  <p>  As Minister for health promotion, I am fully committed to improving the health outcomes for Travellers and I look forward to receiving from the HSE its Traveller health action plan in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600070#WRT03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1307"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Transport","counter":1075,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600070#WRT03413"},{"type":"question","counter":1076,"qnumday":416,"qnumall":"[9626\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600070#WRT03425","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he has examined the possibility of introducing free public transport;

To this effect, I recently launched the Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot (BEEP) a targeted support of &euro;20 million for suckler farmers specifically aimed at further improving the economic and environmental efficiency of beef production.  As well as clear environmental and climate benefits, the BEEP will provide farm gate investment at a time of market volatility and uncertainty relating to Brexit.  The pilot has been designed to be as straightforward as possible. <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) is currently the main support specifically targeted for the suckler sector, which provides Irish beef farmers with some &euro;300 million in funding over the current Rural Development Programme (RDP) period. This scheme is an agri-environmental measure to improve the environmental sustainability of the national suckler herd by increasing genetic merit within the herd. Also, it should be noted an additional &euro;23 million was secured for the ANC scheme in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  I am, however, very conscious that the beef sector is currently facing a difficult period.  I am deeply committed to fully supporting and developing Ireland&rsquo;s beef sector. I am strongly of the view that the existing range of supports available to suckler farmers, together with ensuring access to as many markets as possible, both for live animals and beef exports, are appropriate for the continued development of the sector.  According to National Farm Survey data, suckler farmers receive support equivalent to approximately &euro;500 per suckler cow on average. <\/p>  <p>  I will continue to argue for as strong a CAP budget as possible, post-2020.  In particular, I am committed to ensuring that suckler farmers continue to receive strong support in the next CAP.  My view is that such payments should support and encourage suckler farmers to make the best decisions possible to improve the profitability, and the economic and environmental efficiency, of their farming system.  The Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot is a positive step in that direction.<\/p>  <p>  One of the unique strengths of the agri-food sector has been the shared vision for the sustainable development of the sector in Food Wise 2025.  It is crucial that we all continue to work together.

It is my intention that a renewed TB eradication strategy which takes into account the recommendations of the Forum will enjoy the support of stakeholders and make a real difference to Irish farmers by reducing the levels of bovine TB.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600071#WRU04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Meat Processing Plant Inspections","counter":1147,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600071#WRU04700"},{"type":"question","counter":1148,"qnumday":443,"qnumall":"[9026\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600071#WRU04800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Question Nos. 200 to 202 of 7 February 2019, when a mechanical grading machine is found to be out of sync, the person or body that carries out the service on the machine before a subsequent classification check can be carried out by officials from his Department; the adjustments or corrections made and taken; the location in which they are recorded in order to document the root cause of the issue which led to the machine falling out of sync; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1341","askee":"1285"},{"type":"question","counter":1149,"qnumday":444,"qnumall":"[9027\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600071#WRU04900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the service audit trail that exists to ensure that adjustments made to mechanical grading machines to bring them back within EU defined tolerances are not intentionally or accidentally changed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1341","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1150,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 443 and 444 together.<\/p><p>Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017\/1184 of 20 April 2017 governs the monitoring of carcass classification, carcass presentation and weighing. <\/p><p>Inspections carried out by my Department identify when the grading machines are operating outside of tolerance.Machine servicing is part of the factories' standard operating procedures.<\/p><p>The servicing of a mechanical classification machine  is a matter between the factories who own the machines and the company that carries out the service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600071#WRU05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Beef Data and Genomics Programme","counter":1151,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600071#WRU05200"},{"type":"question","counter":1152,"qnumday":445,"qnumall":"[9028\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600071#WRU05300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 495 of 5 February 2019, the number of herds in receipt of the beef data and genomics programme payments that have more than one animal registered in their herd that is not identified as a beef breed as defined by the scheme guidelines; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1341","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1153,"content":"<p>The Terms and Conditions(T&amp;Cs) of the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) defines eligible suckler cows, inter alia, as being of a beef breed or sired by a beef breed, is not a cow used to supply milk commercially, is part of a herd intended for rearing calves for meat production and rears a calf by suckling.

The Consultation attracted over 900 submissions which comprised a wide diversity of views.  These submissions have been published on my Department's website.<\/p><p>I carefully considered the issues raised during the public consultation process and following a detailed evaluation, decided to exclude trawling by fishing vessels over 18 metres length overall from inshore waters inside the six nautical mile zone and the baselines from 1 January 2020. <\/p><p>Based on my assessment, I consider that there is a compelling case for excluding trawling by large vessels in coastal waters inside six nautical miles.  I am satisfied that there are sufficient fishing opportunities for these vessels outside of six nautical miles.  I also believe that these actions will provide wider ecosystem benefits, including for nursery areas and juvenile fish stocks.  I am very conscious of the exclusive reliance of small scale and island fishermen on inshore waters and the benefits this change will bring for these fishermen and I firmly believe that this will, in the medium term, provide ecosystem and nursery stock benefits for all fishermen.<\/p><p>I am also mindful of the opportunity these measures will provide for further sustainable development of the small scale inshore and sea angling sectors, which the Government has committed to in the Programme for a Partnership Government.<\/p><p>I also announced that there will be a transition period to 2022 for vessels over 18 metres targeting sprat.

All 11 measures have been implemented. <\/p><p>Following the completion of the mid-term review of the Forestry Programme in February 2018, premiums and grants for the planting of native broadleaves and in particular for the Forestry for Fibre scheme to supply timber for the energy sector were increased. My Department also introduced, among other things, additional funding for building forest roads to encourage greater mobilisation of timber and  a National Forestry Knowledge Transfer Scheme for private forestry owners to develop forestry management skills. <\/p><p>Other measures to promote the mobilisation of timber are also in place as follows:<\/p><p>- the new <i>All Ireland Roundwood Production Forecast 2016-2035 <\/i>and the associated GIS Portal,<\/p><p>- enhanced efficiencies in dealing with felling licence applications,<\/p><p>- roundwood price information being provided to the public domain,<\/p><p>- an excellent programme of advice on woodland management and wood sales from Teagasc  aimed at all private growers.<\/p><p>The total expenditure for developing and promoting the forestry sector since 2014 is contained in the following table. The current programme was introduced in January 2015:<table><tr><th>2014<\/th><th>2015<\/th><th>2016<\/th><th>2017<\/th><th>2018<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;109.6m<\/td><td>&euro;104m<\/td><td>&euro;103.8.<\/td><td>&euro;101.5m<\/td><td>&euro;94.55m<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>My Department funded a pilot Forestry Certification project to address the barriers to forest certification for private forest owners, which include the cost and complexity of achieving this accreditation. This project funded the establishment of two certification groups and the development of a template to assist foresters in helping their clients achieve certification.  The key contributors to the project were the two participating forestry groups, the North East Forestry Group and the Forest Owners Co-operative Society. The pilot project was completed successfully in 2018. The next challenge in forest certification is  for the number of private owners to grow and this is matter for all stakeholders including representative groups, producers and the processing sector. Certification is primarily a market requirement and it is therefore a matter for those engaged with the market to design and implement the solutions which best meet their needs.  It should be noted that the entire Coillte estate of 439,000 hectares is certified by the FSC and PEFC certification bodies.<\/p><p>The level of aid available to private forest owners under the current Forestry Programme, both establishment grants and 15 year premiums, is shown by Grant and Premium Category (GPC) in the following table:<table><tr><th>GPC<\/th><th>Total Grant   Available&euro;\/ha<\/th><th>Annual Premium  Rate&amp;lt;10ha<\/th><th>Annual Premium Rate&amp;gt;10ha<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>GPC 1 &ndash; Unenclosed<\/td><td>&euro;2,740<\/td><td>&euro;185<\/td><td>&euro;190<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>GPC 2 - Sitka spruce\/Lodgepole pine<\/td><td>&euro;3,705<\/td><td>&euro;440<\/td><td>&euro;450<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>GPC 3 &ndash; 10% Diverse Conifer e.g. Sitka spruce and 10% broadleaves<\/td><td>&euro;3,815<\/td><td>&euro;510<\/td><td>&euro;520<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>GPC 4 &ndash; Diverse Conifer e.g., Scots pine, Douglas Fir<\/td><td>&euro;4,310<\/td><td>&euro;590<\/td><td>&euro;600<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>GPC 5 &ndash; Broadleaf e.g. sycamore<\/td><td>&euro;5,880<\/td><td>&euro;605<\/td><td>&euro;620<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>GPC 6 &ndash; Oak<\/td><td>&euro;6,220<\/td><td>&euro;645<\/td><td>&euro;660<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>GPC 7 &ndash; Beech<\/td><td>&euro;6,220<\/td><td>&euro;645<\/td><td>&euro;660<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>GPC 8 &ndash; Alder and Birch<\/td><td>&euro;4,195<\/td><td>&euro;605<\/td><td>&euro;620<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>GPC 9- Native Woodland Establishment (oak-birch-holly-hazel)<\/td><td>&euro;6,220<\/td><td>&euro;665<\/td><td>&euro;680<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>GPC 10- Native Woodland Establishment (alder-oak woodland)<\/td><td>&euro;5,880<\/td><td>&euro;665<\/td><td>&euro;680<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>GPC 11 - Agro-forestry  <\/td><td>&euro;6,220<\/td><td>&euro;645<\/td><td>&euro;660<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>GPC 12 &ndash; Forestry-for-Fibre <\/td><td>&euro;3,815<\/td><td>&euro;510<\/td><td>&euro;520<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>Considerable progress has already been made in tackling the challenge of timber mobilisation since the introduction of the current programme and my Department will continue to engage with all stakeholders to ensure a greater supply of timber to meet industry demands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600073#WRW00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bord Bia Expenditure","counter":1220,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600073#WRW00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1221,"qnumday":468,"qnumall":"[9617\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600073#WRW00900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the marketing and promotional expenditure of Bord Bia; if he is satisfied that this spend represents value for money; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1222,"content":"<p>A total Grant sum is allocated annually to Bord Bia by my Department and voted on by the Oireachtas during the estimates process. <\/p>  <p>  In the context of Budget 2019, I was pleased to announce the allocation of a further &euro;5.3 million to Bord Bia , bringing its total grant  to &euro;46.6 million.

Consideration was given to amending secondary legislation around the level of permit fees payable by a waste operator, which are currently &euro;1,000, &euro;2,000 or &euro;5,000 depending on whether the application to collect waste is in a single local authority functional area, a region or nationally. However, advice was received that fees collected from waste operators to support activities, such as enforcement, may constitute a levy and was not proceeded with. In that context, the issue of a contribution to enforcement from the sector will be revisited in the context of the review of \"A Resource Opportunity\" taking place in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Issues concerning the enforcement of waste legislation are statutory matters for local authorities or the Environmental Protection Agency as appropriate, who both have significant powers under waste legislation to secure compliance from waste operators. The role of my Department is to provide a comprehensive legislative and policy framework through which the enforcement authorities operate. <\/p>  <p>  Waste enforcement activities on the ground have received significant support through the continued annual investment of &euro;7.4 million in the network of 150 local authority waste enforcement officers and the further development of the Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authority (WERLA) Offices with an annual budget in excess of &euro;1 million. I regard the introduction of the WERLA model in 2015 as one of the most significant reforms introduced in the local authority sector in a decade. Through this structure and with the cooperation of local authority waste enforcement personnel, a more co-ordinated and consistent approach to tackling waste crime in Ireland is being achieved.

Technically, the port forms part of the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Company, which is a 19th-century joint-venture company, consisting today of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann on the Irish side and Stena Line on the Welsh (Fishguard) side. <\/p>  <p>  The status of the port, and whether its current status potentially inhibits its development, was considered in a strategic review, commissioned by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and carried out by Indecon Economic Consultants. Their report concluded that the creation of an independent port authority would be extremely difficult, given the port's complex legal structure. Instead, it was recommended that the port remain in public ownership and that the possibilities for increased private sector involvement be investigated. <\/p>  <p>  In order to assist Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's overall consideration of how best to move forward, the company then engaged consultants to assess market interest. The assessment was largely positive in terms of the potential for increased private sector investment in the port; however, it did identify possible implementation issues due to the complicated legislative basis of the port.<\/p>  <p>  Following that assessment, the Department sought and received detailed advice from the Office of the Attorney General on the matter. That advice identified a number of legal issues with any such proposal and those issues remain under consideration by the Department. <\/p>  <p>  As such, there is currently no plan to publish the report to which the Deputy's question refers although a redacted version of the report was released under Freedom of Information in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  I am however satisfied that Rosslare Europort as a division of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is effectively managing operations at the port and looking at the potential of the Port to develop further and take advantage of any new opportunities. The port is targeting growth and new business opportunities, and recently received the approval of the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann Board for a strategic plan to grow the port's business.  This includes investment plans for up to &euro;25 million in customer facilities and port infrastructure, port assets, and new technology.  The Port is engaging with a number of potential new shipping customers to supplement existing operators and offer greater choice to freight and passenger business.

Subject to reciprocity from the UK, it is anticipated that the vast majority of flights to\/from Ireland to the UK, including from the regional airports, would still be able to operate post-Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  However, under all possible scenarios, the UK's withdrawal from the EU will bring change to the Aviation sector and while much is being done by Government, it is also very much up to the all those doing business in Ireland, including the regional airports themselves to prepare for a 'no-deal' scenario, and to engage in their own specific contingency planning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600076#WRZ05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Supports","counter":1441,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600077#WRAA00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1442,"qnumday":546,"qnumall":"[9327\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600077#WRAA00300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his plans to support tourism businesses and visitor attractions in County Kildare ahead of Brexit; the financial support provided by his Department and agencies under the aegis of his Department to visitor attractions in County Kildare in 2017, 2018 and to date in 2019; the locations of those attractions; the number of tourists to County Kildare in 2016, 2017 and 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":1443,"content":"<p>My Department has supported a number of measures aimed at mitigating the impact of Brexit on tourism businesses operating in Ireland, such as F&aacute;ilte Ireland's Get Brexit Ready programme and targeted tourism marketing campaigns in the UK.<\/p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland also continues to provide a wide range of supports for tourism businesses and attractions throughout the country to help create new experiences and enhance existing ones; extend the season; and enhance the skills and business capability of tourism enterprises.<\/p>  <p>  Tourism businesses and attractions also stand to benefit from F&aacute;ilte Ireland's continued development and promotion of the established tourism experience brands, targeted capital investments and programme supports aimed at further enhancing, animating and promoting these brands.

However, the default position is that Green Cards are required for vehicles entering the EU from Third Countries, unless the EU Commission declares otherwise.<\/p>  <p>  If the UK were to exit the EU without a deal, the default position would be that Green Cards would be required for EU-registered vehicles entering the UK and for UK-registered vehicles entering the EU.  While the Government remains of the view that the best and only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU - including avoiding the necessity for Green Cards - is the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement reached between the EU and the UK, the Government recognises that it is prudent to plan for the possibility of a 'no deal' exit.  <\/p>  <p>  The motor insurance industry is therefore behaving prudently in being prepared for the possibility that Green Cards will be required, even though this is not a desirable outcome.   In line with the current expected Brexit date of 29th March 2019, the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) has indicated that insurers and insurance brokers will begin issuing Green Cards to policyholders from March if no agreement has been reached between the UK and the EU on Brexit or the process has not been further delayed.  At that point anyone who plans on driving their Irish registered vehicle in Northern Ireland or Britain should contact their insurer or insurance broker one month in advance of their expected travel date to ensure they receive their Green Card in sufficient time. <\/p>  <p>  As part of its contingency planning, the Government has raised this matter directly with the European Commission seeking agreement from it to set a date from which green cards would not be required.

Given the large amount of public money that is used in funding these programmes, there needs to be an appropriate level of oversight and accountability. The Department of Children and Youth Affairs believes that our approach to compliance and  supporting services  strikes a necessary and appropriate balance. Our approach involves setting out the rules for the receipt of State funding, supporting providers to deliver services, and at the same time, the approach offers assurances to the taxpayer that the funding assigned is being spent as it was intended.<\/p>  <p>A high level of compliance with the rules of the various childcare schemes  is vital to maintaining existing investment as well as ensuring future investment. It is a requirement that services operating the early learning and care and school age childcare programmes funded by my Department must be compliant with the &lsquo;Rules for DCYA childcare funding programmes&rsquo; , the most recent of which was published on 9th   August 2018. Compliance with these Rules is overseen by Pobal on behalf of my Department. Because subsidies for the early learning and care and school age childcare programmes are paid based on attendance (and not just enrolment), this is a vital governance component of the funding for which my Department is responsible. <\/p>  <p>  I very much appreciate that community childcare settings, such as that referenced, provide a valuable service to children and families across the country. I also appreciate their stated concerns regarding their sustainability. Hence, significant support is available to them to bring their service onto a more sustainable footing, whilst being necessarily compliant with scheme rules. <\/p>  <p>  My Department oversees an integrated Case Management system operated by Pobal through which a dedicated team assesses services facing challenges. This Case Management service provides non-financial assistance or support in the first instance. Financial supports are also available for services facing certain challenges which may also be accessed through Case Management following a financial assessment. <\/p>  <p>  Results from Pobal compliance visits for the first part of the programme year 2018\/2019 show some issues in relation to non-compliance which needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency. I am encouraged however that most services have engaged constructively with the process so far. I would recommend all other services to get in contact with Pobal or their local City \/ County Childcare Committee if they need support or advice, or if they believe a sustainability issue arises.<\/p>  <p>  I should also emphasise that as an FRC, some activities may be eligible for funding from elsewhere, rather than from childcare programmes per se, for example after school work related to literacy and numeracy may be eligible for funding under the Schools Completion Programme . <\/p>  <p>  The existing targeted childcare schemes will be replaced later this year with the Affordable Childcare Scheme. In the coming weeks my Department will begin to roll out a major national information campaign in relation to how this new scheme will operate. A significant amount of time will be invested in working with services to ensure that they are ready for it. The new scheme will not have a snapshot window. Its attendance rules will seek to reflect the reality of children and parents' lives and the need for services to operate as businesses. The attendance rules will reflect a certain degree of flexibility whilst honouring the requirement to ensure that Exchequer funding is used for the purposes it was intended. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that investment in childcare has increased by an unprecedented117% over the last four budgets, now totalling  &euro;575m per year. Community services access much of this growing investment. Turnover for many services has increased quite substantially (given that the number of servicers operating has increased only slightly) assisting services to review their business model to meet compliance requirements. The Affordable Childcare Scheme will mark another significant milestone for early learning and care and school age childcare in this country, creating an infrastructure from which Government can further increase investment in services over the next decade, This is in line with the commitment made in First 5, the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies , Young Children and their Families, I published last November.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600078#WRBB05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Funding","counter":1558,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600079#WRCC00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1559,"qnumday":586,"qnumall":"[9565\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600079#WRCC00300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the breakdown of funds received by her Department or channelled through her Department from EU funds in 2017; and the programmes these funds supported.","asker":"1312","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1560,"content":"<p>The PEACE IV Programme is an initiative of the European Union, managed in Northern Ireland by the Special EU Programmes Body, SEUPB, which is designed to support peace and reconciliation through youth work in Northern Ireland and the Border Counties of Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme is run primarily by SEUPB on behalf of the European Commission in conjunction with the Accountable Departments from both jurisdictions.

Because subsidies for the early learning and care and school age childcare programmes are paid based on attendance, and not just enrolment, this is a vital governance component of the funding for which my Department is responsible. <\/p><p>I very much appreciate that community childcare settings, such as that referenced, provide a valuable service to children and families across the country. I also appreciate their stated concerns regarding their sustainability. Hence, significant support is available to them to bring their service onto a more sustainable footing, whilst being necessarily compliant with scheme rules. <\/p><p>My Department oversees an integrated Case Management system operated by Pobal through which a dedicated team assesses services facing challenges. This Case Management service provides non-financial assistance or support in the first instance. Financial supports are also available for services facing certain challenges which may also be accessed through Case Management following a financial assessment. <\/p><p>Results from Pobal compliance visits for the first part of the programme year 2018\/2019 show serious issues in relation to non-compliance which needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency. I am encouraged however that most services have engaged constructively with the process so far. I would recommend all other services to get in contact with Pobal or their local City or County Childcare Committee if they need support or advice, or if they believe a sustainability issue arises.<\/p><p>I should also emphasise that as an FRC, some activities may be eligible for funding from elsewhere, rather than from childcare programmes <i>per se,<\/i>for example after school work related to literacy and numeracy may be eligible for funding under the Schools Completion Programme . <\/p><p>The existing targeted childcare schemes will be replaced later this year with the Affordable Childcare Scheme. In the coming weeks my Department will begin to roll out a major national information campaign in relation to how this new scheme will operate. A significant amount of time will be invested in working with services to ensure that they are ready for it. The new scheme will not have a snapshot window. Its attendance rules will seek to reflect the reality of children and parents' lives and the need for services to operate as businesses. The attendance rules will reflect a certain degree of flexibility whilst honouring the requirement to ensure that Exchequer funding is used for the purposes it was intended. <\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that investment in childcare has increased by an unprecedented 117% over the last four budgets, now totalling &euro;575 million per year. Community services access much of this growing investment. Turnover for many services has increased quite substantially - given that the number of servicers operating has increased only slightly - assisting services to review their business model to meet compliance requirements. The Affordable Childcare Scheme will mark another significant milestone for early learning and care and school age childcare in this country, creating an infrastructure from which Government can further increase investment in services over the next decade. This is in line with the commitment made in First 5, the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families, I published last November. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600079#WRCC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Childhood Care and Education Data","counter":1564,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600079#WRCC00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1565,"qnumday":588,"qnumall":"[9622\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600079#WRCC00900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the estimated proportion of children born in 2015 that are assumed to make use of the second year of the early childhood care and education scheme.","asker":"1253","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1566,"content":"<p>The Early Childhood Care and Education, ECCE, programme is a universal programme available to all children within the eligible age range.

This meant that they and their employers paid a lower rate of PRSI and, as such, were insurable for a limited range of social welfare benefits.  Currently Class D contributors are insured for widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's (contributory) pension, Occupational injuries benefits, carer's benefit and guardian's payment (contributory). <\/p>  <p>  Civil and public servants appointed since 6 April 1995 are insurable at Class A.  They and their employers pay a higher rate of PRSI and they are eligible for all social welfare benefits.  It is not possible for modified rate contributors to opt to pay the full Class A contribution. <\/p>  <p>  In general, teachers retiring with only a PRSI Class D contribution paid receive a pension benefit from the Department of Education and Skills based on  pensionable service and this is called an uncoordinated pension.  <\/p>  <p>  Teachers retiring with only a PRSI Class A  paid receive a pension benefit from the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills based on their retirement salary up to a threshold of 3.33 times the single rate of the State contributory pension.  This is called a co-ordinated pension.  Teachers who pay Class A PRSI contributions do not receive separate State and occupational pensions based on those same contributions.<\/p>  <p>  It is also possible for a teacher to have at the time of their retirement a mixture of both PRSI classes of A and of D.  This is called a \"split pension&ldquo;.<\/p>  <p>  The State pension (contributory) is a pension paid to people who reach state pension age (currently 66, rising to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028).  Since its introduction in 1961, entitlements have been based on a Yearly Average calculation, where the number of reckonable weekly PRSI contributions are divided by the number of years between entering social insurance and state pension age.  Provisions also exist for the award of a mixed insurance pro rata state pension, where a person has substantial periods of PRSI coverage that are not reckonable for pension purposes.  Whether or not such a pro-rata pension is more advantageous to a person with significant Class D contributions will depend upon their individual circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  The Government intends to change the calculation method used for the State Pension (Contributory) by introducing a Total Contributions Approach (TCA) to establishing the level of entitlement for all new state pension contributory claims from 2020 onwards (TCA2020).<\/p>  <p>  I launched a public consultation on the design of the full TCA to be introduced from 2020 on the 28 May last year to which a wide variety of stakeholder groups were invited.  A number of workshops were also held on the day to elicit views and feedback.  All Oireachtas members were invited to a detailed briefing in Leinster House by my officials shortly afterwards.  The consultation was open for over 3 months and the Department received almost 300 responses from individuals and organisations including open written submissions.  Those submissions outlined the views of respondents on a number of issues, including the number of years required for a full pension, as intended as part of the consultation process.  An analysis of the views expressed in this consultation was recently submitted to me.  When I have considered this analysis, I will bring a proposal for the full design of a Total Contributions Approach to Government for its consideration.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600079#WRCC03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pension (Non-Contributory) Appeals","counter":1593,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600079#WRCC03700"},{"type":"question","counter":1594,"qnumday":598,"qnumall":"[9105\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600079#WRCC03800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the status of an application for the State pension (non-contributory) by a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1323","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1595,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that an Appeals Officer, having fully considered all of the available evidence, has decided to allow the appeal of the person concerned by way of a summary decision.

CE supervisors, as employees of these organisations, are an integral part of that good work.<\/p>  <p>  However, it is important to emphasise the fact that CE scheme supervisors are employees of private companies in the community and voluntary sector that receive public funding.  They are not employees of my Department or public servants, and as such were not subject to pay reductions, pension contributions or the Pension-related Deduction, PRD, under the provisions of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, which only applied to public servants. <\/p>  <p>  The State is not responsible for funding pension arrangements for employees of private companies, even where the companies in question are reliant on State funding.  Pension arrangements are a matter to be agreed between employees and their employers.  All employers, including CE sponsoring organisations, are legally obliged to offer access to at least one Standard Personal Retirement Savings Account, PRSA, under the Pension (Amendment) Act 2002.  <\/p>  <p>  The issue was examined by a Community Sector High Level Forum, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  A number of Departments including my own Department were represented on this group, as were the unions and Pobal. <\/p>  <p>  Exchequer funded pension entitlements for CE supervisors presents very significant issues for the Exchequer.  These supervisors comprise just one small group within the wider Community and Voluntary sector.  Nevertheless, on foot of the Labour Court recommendation, a detailed scoping exercise was carried out with input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES, on the potential costs of providing Exchequer support for the establishment of such a pension scheme for employees across the Community and Voluntary sector in Ireland.  This exercise estimated a potential cost to the State of between &euro;188 million per annum and &euro;347 million depending on the numbers involved, which is hard to establish. This excludes any provision for immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million.<\/p>  <p>  CE supervisors may qualify for the State Pension (Contributory) if they have accrued sufficient PRSI contributions. The State Pension (Contributory) is not means-tested.  This pension has a maximum personal rate payable of &euro;12,695 per annum, increasing to &euro;12,956 in March 2019. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600079#WRCC04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals","counter":1602,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600079#WRCC04600"},{"type":"question","counter":1603,"qnumday":601,"qnumall":"[9159\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600079#WRCC04700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if an appeal by a person (details supplied) will be expedited; the status of this matter; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1604,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 20 September 2018.

These payments are being reviewed under a new Total Contributions Approach (TCA) to pension calculation which includes provision for homecaring periods.  My Department has already written to these pensioners to explain the process.<\/p>  <p>I have last week signed the necessary regulations, which together provisions in the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registrations Act 2018, allows the increased payments to be made on foot of the reviews.

In some, but not all, cases additional information is required from pensioners about unexplained gaps in their social insurance record to complete their review.

In recent years, as the economy has been recovering, the Government has concentrated resources in improving the core rates of payments, particularly for pensioners, resulting in considerable increases in these rates. <\/p>  <p>  The Bereavement Grant was a payment of &euro;850 made where the deceased or his\/her surviving partner was an insured contributor to the social insurance fund.  Any decision to reinstate it would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  It&rsquo;s worth noting that there are a range of supports available for people following bereavement which provide more significant support than the grant.  These include weekly-paid widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s (contributory and non-contributory) pensions, which are based on contributions or a means test, and a once-off widowed or surviving civil partner grant of &euro;6,000 where there is a dependent child.  A number of social welfare payments, including State pension, continue in payment for six weeks following a death.  In Budget 2016, the Government increased the payment after death period to 12 weeks for carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Guardian payments are available where someone cares for an orphaned child.  A special funeral grant of &euro;850 is paid where a person dies because of an accident at work or occupational disease.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Allowance scheme, the Department may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income, which may include help with funeral and burial expenses.  This is a more targeted and efficient manner of assisting people with bereavement expenses. In 2018 ENPs were made in respect of 2,812 funerals at a cost of &euro;5.317 million and 69 burial expenses at a cost of &euro;140,674. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600080#WRDD04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals Waiting Times","counter":1661,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600080#WRDD04400"},{"type":"question","counter":1662,"qnumday":622,"qnumall":"[9498\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600080#WRDD04500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the waiting times in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown local authority area for appeals for disability allowance, illness benefit, invalidity pension, carer's allowance and domiciliary care allowance, respectively for each month from January 2018 to date; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1301","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1663,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that statistics are not maintained on a local authority or on a county by county basis, and it is not in a position to supply the information sought by the Deputy in relation to the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown local authority area.<\/p><p>The average appeal processing times for each month in 2018 and January 2019 for disability allowance, illness benefit, invalidity pension, carer's allowance and domiciliary care allowance are outlined in the following tables.<\/p><p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.<\/p><p>All claim decisions taken by the Department&rsquo;s Deciding Officers and Designated Persons are appealable to the Chief Appeals Officer.  In any year about 85% of all claims are awarded by the Department and just 1% are appealed.  Nevertheless, the Department is concerned that these cases are dealt with as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>Accordingly, significant efforts and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeal process in recent years.  As a result, appeal processing times in respect of all schemes improved between 2011 and 2017 from 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2011 to 26.4 weeks in 2017 and from 25.1 weeks for a summary decision in 2011 to 19.8 weeks in 2017.  The corresponding processing times for the year 2018 were 30 weeks for an oral hearing and 24.8 weeks for a summary decision.<\/p><p>The time taken to process an appeal reflects a number of factors including that the appeals process is a quasi-judicial process with appeals officers being required to decide all appeals on a &lsquo;de-novo&rsquo; basis.  In addition, appeals decisions are themselves subject to review by the High Court and decisions have to be formally written up to quasi-judicial standards.  Other factors that influence appeals processing times include the quality of the initial decision &ndash; in this respect the Department has changed the decisions process in respect of medical schemes, in order to provide more information to the claimant.  I expect that this will help to reduce the number of appeals over time.<\/p><p>In addition, a number of new Appeals Officers have joined the Appeals Office over the past 12-18 months, to replace staff leaving on retirement.  Given the complexity of the appeals process it takes some time for new staff to be trained up and develop expertise and this has led to somewhat longer processing times during this period.  The Chief Appeals Officer has advised me that appeal processing times continue to be a priority for her Office.<\/p><p>Finally, where a claimant has been refused a social welfare payment, regardless of the scheme involved, and is appealing that decision, if their means are insufficient to meet their needs it is open to them to apply for supplementary welfare allowance in the interim.  <\/p><p>If their application for supplementary welfare allowance is refused, they can also appeal that decision.  The supplementary welfare allowance appeal will be prioritised for attention within the Appeals Office as soon as the appeal file and submission is received from my Department.<\/p><p>I trust this

The Report examines a number of issues in relation to inequality, including inequality in wealth, education, health and employment.  In response to the Deputy's specific question regarding high incidence of low pay and weak labour protection, I would point out that the Government continues to work to protect vulnerable employees.  Ireland has a robust suite of employment legislation to ensure this is the case. <\/p>  <p>  The most recent figures published by Eurostat (January 2019) show that Ireland has the second highest national minimum wage of any country in the EU at &euro;1,614 per month, behind only Luxembourg whose minimum wage is &euro;1,999 per month (for comparison purposes Eurostat converts countries&rsquo; hourly or weekly rates into monthly rates).  It ranks in sixth place when allowing for purchasing power standards.  However, it is important to note that these figures do not take into account the recent increase in the minimum wage to &euro;9.80 per hour from 1 January 2019.  While the percentage of earners on the national minimum wage in Ireland is higher than some other EU Member States, this is due, at least in part, to the presence of a large number of Multi-National Corporations which, typically, drive up the median wage rate.<\/p>  <p>  The results of the ESRI research study &ldquo;The Impact of a Change in the National Minimum Wage on the Distribution of Hourly Wages in Ireland&rdquo;, published in July 2018 indicate that without the minimum wage change, approximately 10 percent of workers in 2016 would have earned on or below &euro;9.15 per hour.  However, following the increase in the minimum wage, just 6 percent of workers had an hourly wage in this range.  Therefore, the minimum wage change resulted in a four percentage point reduction in the number of workers earning on or below &euro;9.15 per hour.<\/p>  <p>  The setting of wages is a matter between employers and employees, which takes place in the context of the market, and Government does not interfere unduly in the process.  More generally, this area comes within the remit of my colleague the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, through her Department&rsquo;s responsibilities for industrial relations issues generally and wage-setting mechanisms such as Registered Employment Agreements (REAs), Joint Labour Committees (JLCs) and Sectoral Employment Orders (SEOs).<\/p>  <p>  At an individual level the resources required to achieve a minimum essential standard of living is very dependent on family circumstances and the interaction of individual earnings with household income. State-provided supports such as Child Benefit, Working Family Payment (WFP) as well as supports available in relation to housing, education and health, all contribute to an individual&rsquo;s standard of living. <\/p>  <p>  Specifically, the WFP is an in-work support, which provides an income top-up for employees on low earnings with children.  WFP is designed to prevent in-work poverty for low paid workers with child dependants and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment.  There are currently over 54,000 families with more than 122,000 children in receipt of WFP.  The estimated spend on WFP in 2018 is in the region of &euro;431 million.  The Department also provides an extensive system of social welfare support which facilitates recipients taking up some employment while permitting them to maintain their social welfare payment. These include the Back to Work Family Dividend, Jobseekers Allowance, Jobseekers Transitional Payment, and the One-parent Family Payment.  <\/p>  <p>  The evolution of the main elements of labour law in Ireland relating to employment rights, employment protection and non-discrimination, reflects a strong focus on the enactment of legislation based on clearly identified needs at the national level and arising from wider European Union developments.  In the formulation and development of labour law there has been a clear policy focus aimed at finding the appropriate balance between the security which employees require on the one hand, in terms of conditions of employment etc., and the flexibility required by employers on the other, in terms of organisation of work, work practices etc. <\/p>  <p>  Employment rights legislation was recently strengthened by the addition of the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2018, which is one of the most significant pieces of employment legislation in a generation.  The Act delivers on the Programme for Government commitment to address the challenges of increased casualisation of work and to strengthen the regulation of precarious employment. The key objective of the Act, which comes into effect on 4 March, is to improve the security and predictability of hours for those working in less secure employment arrangements and those working variable hours. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Workplace Relations Act 2015, the State's workplace relations structures were streamlined, resulting in a new two-tier system involving the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) and the Labour Court.  This greatly improved the complaint adjudication and appeal process for both employees and employers alike, in addition to the excellent service provided by the WRC conciliation, mediation and Inspectorate functions. <\/p>  <p>  The WRC is mandated to secure compliance with employment rights legislation.  Where an individual believes they are being deprived of their employment rights, they may refer a complaint to the WRC where the matter can be dealt with by way of mediation or adjudication, leading to a decision enforceable through the District Court.  WRC Inspectors can also be asked to investigate certain breaches of the legislation.  <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600081#WREE00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Living Wage Implementation","counter":1683,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600081#WREE00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1684,"qnumday":629,"qnumall":"[9642\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600081#WREE00900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her views on implementing a living wage; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1685,"content":"<p>The most recent figures published by Eurostat (January 2019) show that Ireland has the second highest national minimum wage of any country in the EU at &euro;1,614 per month, behind only Luxembourg whose minimum wage is &euro;1,999 per month (for comparison purposes Eurostat converts countries&rsquo; hourly or weekly rates into monthly rates).

These figures do not take into account the recent increase in the minimum wage to &euro;9.80 per hour from 1 January 2019.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that Ireland&rsquo;s statutory National Minimum Wage and the Living Wage concept are not conflated.  The Living Wage is a voluntary societal initiative centred on the social, business and economic case to ensure that, wherever it can be afforded, employers will pay a rate of pay that provides an income that is sufficient to meet an individual&rsquo;s basic needs, such as housing, food, clothing, transport and healthcare.

Under the Valuation Acts, 2001-2015, local authorities are obliged to levy rates on any property, used for commercial purposes, in accordance with the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation.  <\/p>  <p>  There is legislative provision for the refund of rates paid on vacant commercial properties in certain circumstances. While the Local Government Act 1946 provides that rates generally apply to vacant properties there is provision for a refund if the property is vacant for specified purposes. The specified purposes include additions, alterations or repairs to the property or where the premises are vacant pending redevelopment. The operation of the refund provisions is a matter for individual local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  Under the 1946 Act, the owner was entitled to a 100% refund in most local authority areas. However, under separate legislation governing refunds in the cities of Dublin, Limerick and Cork, only 50% of the rates paid were refundable. With effect from 1 June 2014, the Local Government Reform Act 2014 gave discretion to the elected members of individual local authorities to vary the level of rates refunds that apply in individual local electoral areas within the authority&rsquo;s administrative area. <\/p>  <p>  The Local Government (Financial and Audit Procedures) Regulations 2014 provide that the decision to alter the rate of refund should be taken at the annual budget meeting and that the rate of refund decided, in respect of the relevant local electoral area, shall apply to eligible persons for the year to which the budget relates. The absence of a decision to vary the refund means that the existing legislative provisions regarding the rate of refunds, as set out above, apply.  Further, guidance in this area has been provided to local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  The Local Government (Rates) Bill 2018 is currently before the Oireachtas and completed Second Stage recently.

A local authority may, as a reserved function and following at least 65% support at a tenant plebiscite, designate for tenant purchase an apartment complex comprising at least 5 apartments, which does not contain apartments designed for elderly persons or retail units and which meets statutory criteria.<\/p>  <p>  Under Section 50 of the 2009 Act, &ldquo;apartment complex&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;land on which there stands erected a building or buildings, comprising or together comprising not less than 5 apartments (but not including any community apartment) and the common areas, structures, works and services&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  The local authority must consult the tenants in relation to a proposal to designate an apartment complex and must hold a plebiscite on the proposal. If at least 65% of the tenants vote in favour of the proposal, then the elected members of the local authority may designate the complex for tenant purchase. However, under Section 54 of the 2009 Act, where an apartment has been sold by the local authority under section 90 of the Housing Act 1966, whether before or after the coming into operation of this scheme, the apartment shall not be included for the purposes of the tenant plebiscite.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to sale, the authority will transfer ownership of the complex to an apartment owners&rsquo; management company established under the Companies Acts, in which the authority is, in most cases, the sole member. The apartments would then be sold to tenant applicants at discounts of 40% - 60%, depending on their level of income. An incremental purchase charge is placed on the property by the authority that withers away over a period related to the level of discount received, subject to compliance with the conditions of the sale, notably that a member of the purchaser&rsquo;s household must live in the apartment for the duration of the charged period and that the purchaser pays the management company annual charges in respect of the apartment. <\/p>  <p>  The membership of the management company associated with the apartment transfers from the authority to the tenant purchaser. The authority will continue to let apartments in the complex in the normal way to tenants who do not wish to purchase and participate in the affairs of the management company as owners of those apartments. <\/p>  <p>  The tenant purchaser of an apartment has all the normal responsibilities of a dwelling owner, including decorating, maintaining and repairing the apartment, and insuring its contents, at his or her own expense.  In addition, by virtue of his or her membership of the management company, the apartment owner is part-owner of the common areas, etc., with an obligation to play a part in managing and maintaining them, including the payment of the management company annual charges levied on the apartment, attending and participating in meetings of the company, and serving as a director of the company from time to time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600081#WREE03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":1710,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600081#WREE03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1711,"qnumday":638,"qnumall":"[9172\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600081#WREE03600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of conferences staff of his Department have attended in each of the years 2017, 2018 and to date in 2019, in tabular form; the number of staff that attended each conferences; the cost of same in each year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":1712,"qnumday":640,"qnumall":"[9206\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600081#WREE03700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of staff in his Department, that attended a summit (details supplied) in Dublin in 2017 and 2018, respectively; the cost to his Department or agency under the remit of his Department; if his Department or an agency under the remit of his Department undertook advertising or sponsorship in respect of the summit; the cost in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1713,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 638 and 640 together.<\/p><p>Details of number of conferences attended by staff in each of the years 2017, 2018 and to date in 2019, together with costs are set out below.

The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants. <\/p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies Acts apply to dwellings let by approved housing bodies (AHBs) to social housing tenants since 7 April 2016, making the RTB dispute resolution service available to the sector and providing tenancy protections.  <\/p>  <p>   The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No.2) Bill 2018, which was published on 19 December 2018, contains amendments to enhance the rental data to be provided to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB), including provision for the annual registration of tenancies. The aim is to gather more accurate and detailed tenancy and rental data on an annual basis to improve the information available to assist with policy formulation in the residential rental sector. Sections 15 and 16 of the Bill amend sections 137 and 137A of the Residential Tenancies  Act,  respectively, and provide for the RTB to charge fees, without exemptions, for annual registrations of tenancies - including a &euro;40 fee per tenancy registration by private providers and &euro;20 per tenancy registration by an AHB.  Under the new annual registration requirements, a fee can only be charged in respect of the same dwelling once per year and a discounted single registration fee (&euro;170 for a private landlord, &euro;85 for an AHB landlord) can be applied where the same landlord registers not more than 10 tenancies of dwellings comprised in the same property. <\/p>  <p>   The key change from the existing registration fees is that AHBs will be charged fees that are half those applicable to private providers &ndash; currently, all landlords pay the same registration fee. The reduction in AHB fees is proposed in recognition of the public service that they provide in meeting the housing needs of those in receipt of social housing supports, and of AHBs'  charitable (or similar) status.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600081#WREE05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Funding","counter":1731,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600081#WREE05700"},{"type":"question","counter":1732,"qnumday":646,"qnumall":"[9574\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600081#WREE05800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the breakdown of funds received by his Department or channelled through his Department from European Union funds in 2017; and the programmes these funds supported.","asker":"1312","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1733,"content":"<p>Information on relevant programmes and associated EU funds in relation to my Department in 2017  is set out in Notes 6.1 and 7 to the Department's Appropriation Account for 2017 (Vote 34) which is published by the Comptroller and Auditor General and is available at , by clicking on &quot;Appropriation Accounts&quot;. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600081#WREE05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Eligibility","counter":1735,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600082#WRFF00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1736,"qnumday":647,"qnumall":"[9589\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600082#WRFF00300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the reason local authorities are not provided with discretion on eligibility for those marginally above the income threshold when applying for social housing or applying for HAP; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1366","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1737,"content":"<p>For the purpose of assessing households under the income eligibility criteria and to ensure consistency in approach, the Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 prescribe maximum net income limits for each local authority, in different bands according to the area concerned, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy.

The Office of Public Works is responsible for the conservation and maintenance of these monuments on a day-to-day basis in co-operation and consultation with my Department. <\/p><p>As in previous years, alongside its Office of Public Works and local authority partners, my Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service will make available such funding as may be required over the course of 2019 in relation to the discharge of my functions under the National Monuments Acts to support rescue excavations and post excavation research at archaeological sites where there is an urgent risk to such being irreparably lost or damaged.<\/p><p>My Department also provides financial support for the protection of heritage buildings and historic structures through grant schemes which are generally administered by the local authorities. In November 2018, I announced a total of &euro;4.3 million in funding for the <i>Built Heritage Investment Scheme<\/i>and <i>Historic Structures Fund<\/i>for 2019.<\/p><p>The <i>Built Heritage Investment Scheme <\/i>is a scheme for the repair and conservation of structures on the local authority Record of Protected Structures. It is designed to leverage private capital for investment in small scale conservation projects across the country and to support the employment of skilled conservation professionals, trades persons and craftsmen and women.  The <i>Historic Structures Fund<\/i>is for conservation and enhancement to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, for the benefit of communities and the public.<\/p><p>Both schemes were open for applications to local authorities until 31 January 2019; full details are available on my Department&rsquo;s website and on each local authority website.  While it would be premature to provide information on applications received at this point,  I will be announcing the successful projects under these schemes in the coming weeks. <\/p><p>The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage. It is primarily a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how its funding should be allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports.  Grant schemes are advertised by the Heritage Council on its website . Among the initiatives supported by the Heritage Council is The Irish Walled Towns Network, of which Drogheda is a member. I understand that some of the structures referred to by the Deputy have been in receipt of Heritage Council assistance, including financial, in the past. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600082#WRFF04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":1776,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600082#WRFF04500"},{"type":"question","counter":1777,"qnumday":662,"qnumall":"[9655\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600082#WRFF04600","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if an application has been made by Louth County Council or another body, organisation or person regarding funding for a proposed maritime museum in Drogheda; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1329","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":1778,"content":"<p>I am informed that my Department has no record of receiving any such request.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022600082#WRFF04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"}]
