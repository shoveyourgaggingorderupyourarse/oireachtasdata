FLAC plays a key role in the provision of legal information, advice and advocacy work and regularly engages with my Department on access to justice matters.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department also provides substantial annual funding to FLAC to ensure that it can continue its important work helping people with legal problems. In Budget 2021 I trebled the funding for FLAC's telephone information referral line and I maintained that level of funding for this year. Their Annual Report notes that last year the highest number of calls were made to the referral line since 2015, with over 13,000 calls. <\/p>  <p>  The Annual Report also highlights an unmet legal need particularly in the areas of family and employment law. As the Deputy will be aware, I recently announced a review of the civil legal aid scheme, which FLAC has called a very significant moment in the history of access to justice. <\/p>  <p>  FLAC is an important member of the Review Group and its insights from working to promote equal access to justice for all will be invaluable to the Group as its work progresses.<\/p>  <p>  The review will allow for an assessment of how well access to justice is facilitated by our Civil Legal Aid Scheme, particularly for those on low incomes. The Review Group will make recommendations for its future, including in relation to eligibility.<\/p>  <p>  The Review Group is chaired by the former Chief Justice, Frank Clarke, and follows on from the work he has previously led under the Chief Justice's Access to Justice Working Group. The Review Group has commenced its work, which is expected to take a period of 12 months. It will report periodically on the progress of its work, before submitting its final report to me once its work is completed.<\/p>  <p>  The Review of the Civil Legal Aid Scheme is part of a broader civil justice reform programme that I am spearheading across my Justice Plan 2022.<\/p>  <p>  FLAC&rsquo;s Annual Report highlighted that in 2021 almost a third of all queries to its Telephone Information and Referral Line related to family law matters. I am determined to overhaul the operation of the Family Justice System, to ensure we have a more efficient and user-friendly family court system that puts the family at the centre of its work. Work on drafting the Family Court Bill is progressing with a view to publishing the Bill as soon as possible in 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500058#WRA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":9,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 6 to 8, inclusive, answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":10,"content":"<p>Question No. 9 answered with Question No. 5.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":11,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 10 and 11 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Data Protection","counter":12,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500058#WRA01100"},{"type":"question","counter":13,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[35657\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500058#WRA01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will be progressing the recommendations of the 2021 report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice on the general data protection regulation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1583","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":14,"content":"<p>I have noted the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the General Data Protection Regulation.

As Minister I have no role in these independent functions.  <\/p>  <p>  I am advised that the Commissioner has no current plans to introduce a dedicated transport police unit, as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's mission of 'Keeping People Safe' extends to all areas of our communities, including public transport. Garda management engages extensively with transport operators, including the National Transport Authority, Irish Rail (DART and InterCity rail) and Transdev Ireland (Luas) to provide a high visibility presence through a coordinated approach. <\/p>  <p>  I am further informed that there is ongoing communication between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the respective control centres, and access to good quality CCTV can provide assistance to Garda&iacute; when investigating serious incidents.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed that a range of regional and local operations have been put in place to prevent, pre-empt and detect incidents arising.<\/p>  <p>  For example, Operation Twin Tracks, a community engagement and rail safety policing initiative, is being conducted by Garda&iacute; in partnership with other public transportation stakeholders with the purpose of providing high visibility policing of rail and light rail transport within the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) and the rail networks and train stations nationwide, and to deliver crime prevention advice to rail and light rail users. A day of action was held on 3 June, with a second day planned for 29 July. <\/p>  <p>  High visibility patrolling operates between the hours of 3pm and 11pm on each day within the Dublin Region (Connolly and Heuston Stations) and nationwide on eight intercity routes. Local Crime Prevention Officers and Community Policing Garda&iacute; are available to deliver crime prevention advice at community engagement\/crime prevention stands at a number of stations from 3pm to 8pm on each of the days. <\/p>  <p>  In January this year, the Garda authorities also launched Operation Saul to further support, enhance and strengthen the strategic and operational objectives of Operation Citizen, the Garda operation to reassure people that Dublin City Centre is a safe place to visit.  Operation Saul aims to provide a safe environment for commuters using public transport services in the City.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, Operation Irene commenced in the DMR on 1 June 2022 and continues until 31 August 2022.

The success is evident by the nationwide results of Operation Tara, which has a focus to disrupt, dismantle and prosecute drug trafficking networks at all levels - international, national and local - involved in the importation, distribution, cultivation, production, local sale and supply of controlled drugs. The Bureau&rsquo;s work is supported by Divisional Drugs Units nationwide, and by all Garda&iacute; working in local communities.

While implementation of the strategy is led by the Department of Health, the strategy includes actions for all stakeholders, including my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  <\/p><p>The strategy recognises the need for a balanced health-led approach - reducing demand, while also reducing access to illegal drugs - and is aimed at reducing the number of people criminalised for the possession of drugs for personal use. While this strategy supports vulnerable people who use drugs, it is also matched with strengthened enforcement measures across Government to tackle the supply of illegal drugs. Sustained action by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continued unabated throughout the pandemic, bringing significant convictions and ongoing seizures of drugs, firearms and ammunition.<\/p><p>Additionally, my Department is also taking a range of actions designed to break the link between criminal gangs and the children they seek to recruit.

Through the implementation of the strategy, we will double the number of refuge spaces over the lifetime of this plan, while we put in place the required structures to deliver the higher Istanbul target after that. Doubling the number of refuge spaces will allow Ireland to meet the minimum standard obligation set out in the Istanbul convention. In parallel we will look at the mechanisms necessary to enable victims to stay safely in their own homes. <\/p>  <p>  Through the implementation of the Second National Strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, Ireland was able to meet the requirements to ratify the Istanbul Convention which was a priority for Government.  The actions delivered under the second national DSGBV strategy enabled this to be done in March 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Guidance provided by the Council of Europe sets minimum and aspirational standards for the provision of shelter places.<\/p>  <p>  As we are starting from a low base, the ambition is to meet the minimum standard obligation in the Strategy&rsquo;s lifetime which would be the fastest expansion of refuges in the history of the State.  I have also committed to going beyond this and reaching the higher standard outlined in the Istanbul guidance, in parallel with looking at mechanisms to enable victims to stay safely in their own homes. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, Tusla completed a review of accommodation services for victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence which identifies priority locations where there is a particular urgency and found that a minimum of between 50 and 60 new refuge places are needed as a priority.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, as a start, the Strategy commits to doubling the number of refuge places over the next 5 years, i.e., 280 refuge spaces, which is one element of the requirement.  I regard the delivery of additional safe homes and step down accommodation as a key part of this so this is also a priority.<\/p>  <p>  Further analysis, as well as the work of an Interdepartmental group on the provision of domestic violence accommodation, has identified 12 locations nationwide where the delivery of 98 family refuge spaces would have the most impact, if prioritised.  These locations represent areas where there is the most significant under-provision and are a starting point to increasing refuge spaces comprehensively and in every county across the country. It commits to the delivery of 24 refuge places currently being developed in Wexford, Dundalk and Navan by 2024 with all units in priority locations to be delivered by the end of the Strategy.<\/p>  <p>  Through the development of a new Domestic Violence agency, as well as new structures and processes, we will be able to scale up the number of refuge spaces which we can deliver each year.<\/p>  <p>  This means that we will be delivering a much higher number of new refuge spaces towards the end of the strategy, than at the beginning of the strategy, with the aim of reaching the minimum standard  by 2026, and I expect this higher rate of delivery would continue beyond this strategy until we have reached our Istanbul targets.<\/p>  <p>  We have to recognise that, despite the best efforts of many dedicated people, historically there has been underprovision in this area resulting in a significant deficit in the availability of safe spaces in Ireland so existing provision is low.  I believe, however, that the targets set out in the Strategy are ambitious but achievable and that the changes we will make to the system for the delivery of refuge spaces which will ensure that women and men who seek safety will have refuge available to them.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500058#WRA08300","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na","counter":85,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500058#WRA08400"},{"type":"question","counter":86,"qnumday":37,"qnumall":"[35627\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500058#WRA08500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will outline the changes in Garda numbers in Tallaght and Rathfarnham Garda stations since 2017; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1572","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":87,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (as amended), the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which includes decisions on the deployment of personnel among the various Garda Divisions.

Two subgroups have been established under the forum to consider the specific issues of knife crime and the misuse of scramblers and quadbikes. Other subgroups may be established to tackle additional specific issues as required.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that there are a range of fora in place in the Cork division for anti-social behaviour to be identified and responded to.<\/p>  <p>  For instance, under the Community Policing Framework, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is in regular contact with community representatives, councillors, residents associations and members of the public. This allows for the gathering and sharing of information around issues of anti-social behaviour. In turn, Community Policing Units target these areas in an effort to alleviate the problem. The Garda Analysis Service also assist in identifying areas of concern.<\/p>  <p>  Members of the public can also highlight anti-social behaviour through Community Safety Forums which are held at least three times a year throughout Cork city. I am informed that any location highlighted as a concern for anti-social behaviour is noted at such meetings and added to a tasking sheet within the relevant Community Engagement Area and station for the implementation of increased patrols.<\/p>  <p>  Liaison with external stakeholders is conducted on an on-going basis by Garda Community Engagement teams, including with Cork City Partnership, Hollyhill Youth Project, Cork City Council, as well as local sporting clubs. Community Policing members also liaise with Muintir Na T&iacute;re and this is designed around safety for the elderly, particularly those living in areas where anti-social behaviour is reported.<\/p>  <p>  The Joint Policing Committee is an additional forum where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na engages with external agencies to identify problem hotspots across the city. This will ultimately be expanded into a Local Community Safety Partnership when the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill is enacted.<\/p>  <p>  More generally, the Department's community safety policy is published on the Gov.ie website and will be delivered through new Local Community Safety Partnerships (LCSPs), currently being piloted in three locations: Dublin&rsquo;s North Inner City, Longford and Waterford. The pilots will run for two years and a robust evaluation is ongoing during this process in order to ensure the proposed structures are fulfilling their objectives.  This process will inform the national rollout of the LCSPs across local authority areas.<\/p>  <p>  The development of the Community Safety Innovation Fund is a key commitment under Justice Plan 2022 which will have a significant impact on the development of community safety projects throughout the country.  The Deputy may wish to note that my Department opened applications on 11 April for the new Community Safety Innovation Fund, which will see the proceeds of crime re-invested in local projects to improve community safety. The fund will have an initial outlay of &euro;2m for this year and will be subject to a robust evaluation at the end of Year 1 to inform future decisions. <\/p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the kind of projects which may be supported will include new activities, not  already covered by existing funding streams, including projects to:<\/p>  <p>  - tackle crime or reduce the fear of crime;<\/p>  <p>  - support the creation of safe and resilient communities; and<\/p>  <p>  - divert vulnerable individuals away from engagement in criminal behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  The fund is open to bodies involved in community safety and will support them in addressing local needs and opportunities for innovation not provided for in other funds managed by Departments and agencies. The call for applications for the fund ran until 8 June 2022 and grants will range from &euro;20,000 to &euro;150,000. <\/p>  <p>  I can confirm that my Department has received 120 applications from a diverse range of organisations seeking to access funding for innovative projects to improve community safety. The process of initial eligibility assessment and scoring of the applications   is ongoing and will continue through the summer. I expect that grants will be made to the successful applicants in the autumn.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the Youth Justice Strategy 2021-2027 also provides a comprehensive developmental framework to support children and young people subject to multiple disadvantage and guide them away from involvement in anti-social or criminal behaviours. <\/p>  <p>  Critically, the strategy commits to broadening the Youth Diversion Project (YDP) service so that every child or young person who could benefit from this service may do so, primarily through the expansion of the geographical coverage of the existing network of 105 Youth Diversion Projects, but also through the establishment of a small number of new projects where a need is identified. The YDP service will continue to play a vital role in combatting anti-social behaviour and supporting communities.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2022 provides an additional &euro;6.7 million in funding for Youth Justice services and Minister Browne announced on 22 June that over 50 YDPs will benefit from this additional funding. This funding goes a long way to making full YDP coverage in all parts of the country possible because it will allow for current YDPs to expand their boundaries. This includes over &euro;129,000 allocated for a boundary extension in the Watercourse Road, Greenmount area of Cork North Inner City.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, one of the two pilots of the Youth Joint Agency Response to Crime (Y-JARC) is currently taking place in Cork, operated out of the Mayfield and Gurranabraher Garda Districts. This pilot seeks relevant State agencies to engage with the young people identified as causing most harm in their locality in a joined-up manner, in order to provide the necessary support to assist them in ceasing their offending behaviour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500059#WRB00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence","counter":101,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500059#WRB00500"},{"type":"question","counter":102,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[35990\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500059#WRB00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if the new policy on domestic violence will ensure each county in the State will have a fully staffed and resourced refuge for victims of domestic violence; if overall numbers of spaces provided will be compliant with the Istanbul Convention; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1486","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":103,"content":"<p>The guidance provided by the Council of Europe sets a recommended standard for the provision of shelter places which Government is committed to reaching.<\/p><p>Under the Third National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence, we will see the fastest ever expansion in the number of refuge spaces.<\/p><p>We will double the number of spaces and will put in place the structures to go on to deliver in full the recommended Istanbul target.

Two subgroups have been established under the forum to consider the specific issues of knife crime and the misuse of scramblers and quadbikes. Other subgroups may be established to tackle additional specific issues as required.<\/p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that there are a number of Garda operations in place in Dublin city centre and the wider DMR.  In October 2021, Operation Citizen commenced in the city centre and was initiated to reassure the citizens, visitors and the business community in Dublin city centre that it is a safe place in which to visit, socialise, conduct business and enjoy its amenities. The aim of this operation is to deliver an enhanced high visibility policing presence in the city centre on a daily basis.  This operation places a particular focus on anti-social behaviour, public order and quality of life issues, assaults and high-volume crimes, and involves increased visible policing, particularly at key locations.  <\/p>  <p>  In January this year, the Garda authorities launched Operation Saul to further support, enhance and strengthen the strategic and operational objectives of Operation Citizen. The aim of Operation Saul is to provide a safe environment for commuters utilising public transport services in the DMR.  <\/p>  <p>  Operation Boardwalk is in place in the DMR North Central Division designed to specifically tackle anti-social behaviour in the environs of the Liffey Boardwalk, Bachelor's Walk and Eden Quay and consists of proactive engagement with groups of youths and people engaged in public consumption of alcohol.<\/p>  <p>  Operation Pier and Operation Spire are also underway within Dublin City Centre, in the DMR South Central and North Central Divisions respectively.  These form the basis of a regional response to city centre street-level drug dealing and possession of drugs, with members performing dedicated patrols in areas known to have a high concentration of such issues. Some key areas targeted are those that have a significant nighttime economy.<\/p>  <p>  Both operations are undertaken by uniformed and plain-clothes members on a full-time basis, with the objective of investigating, detecting, preventing and prosecuting criminal offences committed under the Misuse of Drugs Act. A large proportion of these operations focus on high-visibility and proactive policing and engagement with the residential and business communities.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, Operation Irene commenced in the DMR on 1 June, 2022 and continues until 31 August, 2022. Operation Irene aims to combat under-age alcohol consumption and the consumption of alcohol in public places in the DMR, in a targeted operation through the enforcement of legislation regulating the sale, supply and consumption of alcohol and other associated legislation.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to be aware that Operation Limmat is the DMR&rsquo;s assault in public and public order reduction strategy.  Operation Limmat promotes a pro-arrest and early-investigation approach to incidents of assault, together with driving high-visibility policing in public places to act as a deterrent to prevent and reduce assaults and public order offences in the DMR.<\/p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that a new property on O&rsquo;Connell Street has been identified as a strategically important location to enhance An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s high-visibility policing service in the DMR North Central Division. When opened, this facility will support and enhance the existing policing service in Dublin city centre and will provide a range of Garda services to the public.  The premises will also act as a base for members on a number of key Garda Operations running in the city centre, notably Operation Citizen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500059#WRB02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na","counter":126,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500059#WRB03000"},{"type":"question","counter":127,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[35671\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500059#WRB03100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when Leighlinbridge Garda station will reopen; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1511","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":128,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of Garda business, which includes all operational policing decisions regarding the Garda estate.

I fully acknowledge the need for a significant increase in the provision of refuge spaces and I am committed to achieving this in order to ensure that victims have a safe place when they need it.  <\/p>  <p>  Last week, I brought to Government the Third National Strategy to combat Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based violence. The Strategy has a particular focus on prevention, and on ensuring victims are better supported. It contains actions for nationwide delivery of refuge accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  As a start, the Strategy commits to doubling the number of refuge places. This will be the fastest ever expansion of refuge spaces. By the end of the strategy we will have over 280 refuge spaces, and we will also work to deliver additional safe homes and step down accommodation as a key part of this.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Tusla, the Child and Family Service, completed a review of accommodation services for victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence which identified a number of priority locations where there is a particular urgency. Among Tusla's considerations were population and distance from refuges.  <\/p>  <p>  It is my intention to use the findings of this review as one of the ways to address gaps in the provision of refuge places.<\/p>  <p>  A key recommendation of the Tusla review is to provide more safe accommodation with a focus on short-term safe &lsquo;emergency&rsquo; accommodation. Based on analysis at the time, it found a minimum of between 50 and 60 new refuge places are needed as a priority. Further analysis, as well as the work of an Inter-Departmental Group on the provision of domestic violence accommodation, has identified 12 locations nationwide where the delivery of 98 family refuge spaces would have the most impact, if prioritised.<\/p>  <p>  These locations represent areas where there is the most significant under-provision and are a starting point to increasing refuge spaces comprehensively across the country.<\/p>  <p>  Athlone, which services a significant catchment area within Co Roscommon, and Sligo are identified in the review as priority locations for the development of refuge services. It is expected that developments in Sligo and the wider midlands area would also improve access for those in Co. Roscommon and Co. Galway.<\/p>  <p>  A practical approach will be taken to achieve targets as many factors can influence the speed at which a project is delivered such as, the identification of a suitable site or building, planning processes, tendering processes, appointment of contractors, etc. The areas identified are a priority for the development of refuge accommodation and every effort will be made to ensure this happens as speedily as possible.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the work to implement the Third National Strategy, my Department will advance the recommendations made in the Tusla review to both improve how, and how quickly, we deliver refuge spaces.<\/p>  <p>  The strategy contains actions for doing so both in the immediate and longer term and commits to the delivery of 24 refuge places currently underway in Wexford, Dundalk and Navan by 2024 with all units in priority locations delivered by the end of the strategy in 2026.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500059#WRB05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Reports","counter":151,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500059#WRB05500"},{"type":"question","counter":152,"qnumday":60,"qnumall":"[35982\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500059#WRB05600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will provide an update on the work programme and engagements of the Drogheda implementation board; the status of the recommendations contained in a report (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1498","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":153,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the publication and implementation of the recommendations of the Drogheda scoping report are key actions in my Department's Justice Plan 2022. <\/p><p>  Last year my Department published a report I had commissioned from the former Director of the Probation Service, Mr. Vivian Geiran, who made over 70 recommendations on short and long-term responses to challenges the community faces in Drogheda.

In 2021, my Department committed in the region of &euro;150,000 to local communities who wish to apply for a rebate towards the costs associated with running their local Text Alert Scheme, which is administered by Muintir na T&iacute;re. This is a continuation of the annual funding made available by the Department for the Text Alert Rebate scheme each year since 2016.  <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill will also provide for the establishment of innovative Local Community Safety Partnerships (LCSPs) to develop local safety plans, tailored to the priorities and needs identified by communities themselves. The LCSPs will replace and build upon the existing Joint Policing Committees, and will provide a forum for State agencies and local community representatives to work together to act on community concerns.

In addition, in recognition of the scale and complexity of the work of the North Inner City Dublin Partnership, additional funding was made available from the North East Inner City (NEIC) initiative and from my Department.<\/p><p>  Each Local Community Safety Partnership will develop a Local Community Safety Plan which will identify actions and the Department or Agency with responsibility for fulfilling these actions. Support to implement these actions will come from existing budget allocations. <\/p><p>  Local Community Safety Partnerships may also apply for funding for additional community safety interventions through the new Community Safety Innovation Fund, the establishment of which is provided for in Budget 2022. It is intended that this fund will support investment in projects which propose an innovative approach to improve community safety and which aren&rsquo;t already covered under the costing funding streams. The fund, which is expected to grow in the coming years, has an initial outlay in 2022 of &euro;2m. The call for applications for 2022 closed on 8 June. The process of initial eligibility assessment and scoring of the applications is ongoing and will continue through the summer. I expect that grants will be made to the successful applicants in the autumn.<\/p><p>  Under the criteria of the fund, the applications for capital funding costs will only be considered if they are integral to a proposal itself and appropriately apportioned. Applications for capital costs alone are not eligible. The maintenance and expansion of an existing community CCTV scheme would therefore not be eligible. However, the Department also administers a Community Based CCTV Grand Aid Scheme. The scheme is intended to support local communities wishing to install and maintain CCTV security systems in their area, with the aim of increasing public safety and deterring illegal or anti-social behaviour. <\/p><p>  Further information is available on my Department's website at the following link www.justice.ie\/en\/JELR\/Pages\/Community_based_CCTV_grant_aid_scheme_Information_and_Documentation<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500060#WRC04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prison Service","counter":196,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500060#WRC04300"},{"type":"question","counter":197,"qnumday":76,"qnumall":"[35908\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500060#WRC04400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the reason there has not been a publication of a general prison inspection report of an operational prison since 2014; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1513","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":198,"content":"<p>The Office of the Inspector of Prisons is a statutory body, independent in how it carries out its work, set up under the Prisons Act 2007. <\/p><p>The Inspector's key role is to carry out regular inspections of prisons and the Inspector plays a vital role in ensuring effective independent oversight of our prison system.

Under this Framework, the Inspector will engage with and survey both prisoners and prison staff to gather information on prison conditions and prisoner welfare. <\/p><p>Following this, the Inspector embarked on an inspection of all prisons in Ireland in 2021.

These inspections resulted in twelve inspection reports which, when taken together, provide a general inspection account of the prison estate during the COVID-19 pandemic. These inspection reports, and the COVID-19 Staff Survey report, have all been published and can be found on the websites of the Inspector of Prisons and my Department. <\/p><p>I am advised that the Office of the Inspector of Prisons will conduct two general inspections of Irish Prisons in 2022 and one thematic inspection of a high-risk area.

I fully acknowledge the need for a significant increase in the provision of refuge spaces and I am committed to achieving this in order to ensure that victims have a safe place when they need it.  <\/p>  <p>  Last week, I brought to Government Zero Tolerance: the Third National Strategy to combat Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence. The Strategy has a particular focus on prevention, and on ensuring victims are better supported. It contains actions for nationwide delivery of refuge accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  As a start, the Strategy commits to doubling the number of refuge places. This will be the fastest ever expansion of refuge spaces. By the end of the strategy we will have over 280 refuge spaces, and we will also work to deliver additional safe homes and step down accommodation as a key part of this.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Tusla, the Child and Family Service, completed a review of accommodation services for victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence which identified a number of priority locations where there is a particular urgency.  It is my intention to use the findings of this review as one of the ways to address gaps in the provision of refuge places.<\/p>  <p>  A key recommendation of the Tusla review  is to provide more safe accommodation with a focus on short-term safe &lsquo;emergency&rsquo; accommodation. Based on analysis at the time, it found a minimum of between 50 and 60 new refuge places are needed as a priority.  Further analysis and the work of an Inter-Departmental Group on the provision of domestic violence accommodation identified 12 locations nationwide where the delivery of 98 family refuge spaces would have the most impact, if prioritised.<\/p>  <p>  These locations represent areas where there is the most significant under-provision and are a starting point to increasing refuge spaces comprehensively across the country.<\/p>  <p>  The initial areas identified in the Tusla review include Cavan\/Monaghan, where eight family places are suggested as a starting point for prioritisation.<\/p>  <p>  A practical approach will be taken to achieve targets as many factors can influence the speed at which a project is delivered such as, the identification of a suitable site or building, planning processes, tendering processes, appointment of contractors, etc. The areas identified are a priority for the development of refuge accommodation and every effort will be made to ensure this happens as speedily as possible.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the work to implement the Third National Strategy, my Department will advance the recommendations made in the Tusla review to both improve how, and how quickly, we deliver refuge spaces.<\/p>  <p>  The Strategy contains actions for doing so both in the immediate and longer term and commits to the delivery of 24 refuge places currently underway in Wexford, Dundalk and Navan by 2024 with all units in priority locations delivered by the end of the Strategy in 2026.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500060#WRC05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Policies","counter":205,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500060#WRC05200"},{"type":"question","counter":206,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[35648\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500060#WRC05300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to strengthen bail laws; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1492","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":207,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the restricting of a person&rsquo;s liberty is a serious issue, given the Constitutional presumption that a person is innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.<\/p>  <p>  While the State&rsquo;s bail laws do provide for the refusal of bail in certain circumstances, the presiding judge is entirely independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and the decision to grant bail in a particular case is solely a matter for the judge.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the Bail Act 1997, which followed the 1996 Constitutional Referendum on the issue, enabled a court to refuse bail for a person charged with a serious offence to prevent the risk of another serious offence being committed while on bail.<\/p>  <p>  The State&rsquo;s bail laws have been further strengthened on three more occasions, specifically by the Criminal Justice Act, 2007, the Criminal Justice Act, 2015, and most recently by the Criminal Justice Act, 2017. <\/p>  <p>  In considering whether to refuse bail under the 1997 Act, the Court is required to have regard to persistent serious offending by an applicant and, in specific circumstances, the nature and likelihood of any danger to a person or to the community from granting bail.<\/p>  <p>  The 2017 Act provides for stricter bail terms for repeat serious offenders, including the use of curfews and strengthens Garda powers to deal with breaches of bail.

It is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). Since the start of the scheme in 2000, over 145,000 free upgrades have been supported by the scheme. In 2021, the average cost of the energy efficiency measures provided per household had increased to &euro;17,620.<\/p><p>Activity under the scheme, and the associated expenditure, were significantly impacted in both 2020 and 2021 by the COVID pandemic, when construction activity was paused for approximately 12 months in total.

demand.<\/p><p>Reducing the waiting times on the Warmer Homes scheme waiting list is a top priority for my Department and SEAI and in order to reduce this timeline to completion and target a monthly

The National Transport Authority (NTA) has responsibility for the\u00a0regulation of fares\u00a0charged to passengers in respect\u00a0of\u00a0public transport services provided under public service obligation (PSO) contracts.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In view of the importance of incentivising young people to use public transport, as part of Budget 2022 I secured\u00a0&euro;25m\u00a0of funding to provide\u00a0for the introduction of a young adult card (YAC). The Young Adult Card was launched on PSO services on the 9th of May, with over 1000 applications received by the NTA on launch day alone. We are currently working on broadening the initiative to include commercial bus services, with the aim to have that in place before the return of third level colleges.\u00a0This will mean that nationwide, those aged between 19 and 23 will be able to avail of an average 50% discount in their public transport fares. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The initiative is aimed at supporting our young people to establish strong sustainable mobility habits; setting public transport fares at appropriate levels is key to achieving this objective. I am pleased to say, since April when a further 20% reduction in PSO fares was introduced, all passengers under the age of 24 in possession of a LEAP card now travel on PSO services at significantly reduced rates. The fare reduction will be in place until the end of the year and &euro;54m in Exchequer funding has been secured to allow for the introduction of these discounted fares, this is in addition to the REV22 allocations.\u00a0As such, I would like to see the 20% fare reduction continue into 2023; however, I am acutely aware of the competing pressures across the system and the finite Exchequer resources. The funding implications of all measures must be considered in the round so I will work closely with Minister McGrath and other Government colleagues in the context of the 2023 Estimates process to see what we can do with regard to supporting public transport services.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition, as well as the TFI 90 Minute Fares scheme which means that adults now pay &euro;2, young adults pay &euro;1, and children pay just 65 cent to travel for up to 90 minutes on Dublin Bus, Luas and most DART, commuter rail and Go-Ahead Ireland services in Dublin.\u00a0In May alone, the number of people who had a Child Leap Card, Student Leap Card, or the new Young Adult Leap Card increased by over 16,000, which is very encouraging.<\/p>  <p>  While fare reductions are to be welcomed, investment in additional services is also critical. For this reason, I am committed to progressing core projects like BusConnects, Connecting Ireland and DART+ as well as improving existing services across the country.<\/p>  <p>  The PSO programme represents a significant expenditure of taxpayers' money, and funding has increased in recent years to cater for additional services and growing capacity.\u00a0 Any\u00a0assessment of a proposed change to\u00a0public transport fare structures\u00a0would be a matter for the NTA to consider in the first instance.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, in light of the Authority's responsibility in this area I have forwarded the Deputy&rsquo;s specific question in relation to the estimated full-year cost of extending the youth travel card and associated 50% discount in public transport fares to all young persons aged 24 and 25 years, to the\u00a0NTA for direct reply. \u00a0Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500062#WRE00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Air Services","counter":364,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500062#WRE00800"},{"type":"question","counter":365,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[35543\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500062#WRE00900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the position in relation to passengers who tested positive for Covid-19 before their flight; the position of such persons in relation to the airline refunding credit note vouchers; if the Government still has protocols in place for such cases; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1583","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":366,"content":"<p>The onus is on intending passengers to check the Covid-19 entry requirements of any destination prior to embarking on a flight.

It is the National Transport Authority (NTA) that has responsibility for the regulation of fares charged to passengers in respect of public transport services, provided under public service obligation (PSO) contracts.<\/p>  <p>  Licensed bus and coach operators are an integral part of the overall public transport system, particularly in areas around the country which are not covered by existing public service bus and rail services.\u00a0\u00a0In recognition of the important role these operators play, the Government has continued to provide temporary financial supports throughout the Covid-19 pandemic for certain licensed commercial services, with a view to protecting capacity across the public transport sector throughout the crisis.<\/p>  <p>  In acknowledgment of the continuing difficulties facing this sector, earlier this year, these supports for the commercial sector were further extended up to the 30th of June 2022. To date over &euro;65m has been provided to support the Commercial Bus Operators during this challenging time.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware a 20% average reduction is being introduced on PSO services as part of a suite of Government measures to help combat the rising cost of living. This fare reduction was applied to all services outside the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) from the 11th\u00a0of April and nationwide from the 9th of May. The fare reduction will be in place until the end of the year and &euro;54m in Exchequer funding has been secured to allow for the introduction of these discounted fares, this is in addition to the REV22 allocations.\u00a0The Government decision did not include broadening this initiative to include commercial bus operators.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to see the 20% fare reduction continue into 2023; however, I am acutely aware of the competing pressures across the system and the finite Exchequer resources. The funding implications of all measures must be considered in the round so I will work closely with Minister McGrath and other Government colleagues in the context of the 2023 Estimates process to see what we can do with regard to supporting public transport services.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In view of the importance of incentivising young people to use public transport, as part of Budget 2022 I secured\u00a0&euro;25m\u00a0of funding to provide\u00a0for the introduction of a young adult card (YAC). The Young Adult Card was launched on PSO services on the 9th of May. It is envisaged that the YAC will be broadened to include commercial operators at a later date. However, it is important to note that it is technically more challenging to roll-out fare initiatives such as the Young Adult Card on the commercial bus network than it is on the LEAP enabled PSO network. As such, it will take longer to make this fare discount available to Commercial Bus Operators.\u00a0\u00a0The NTA is in detailed discussions with transport operators and the Department of Transport regarding the range of issues that need to be addressed.\u00a0\u00a0To assist with this process, the NTA has established a joint working group with commercial bus operators to consider options and develop a plan to implement the Young Adult Card on Commercial Bus Operators in as timely a manner as possible, taking account of current ticketing capabilities to ensure a viable scheme is implemented.<\/p>  <p>  The PSO programme represents a significant expenditure of taxpayers' money, and funding has increased in recent years to cater for additional services and growing capacity.\u00a0 Any\u00a0assessment of a proposed change to\u00a0public transport fare structures\u00a0would be a matter for the NTA to consider in the first instance.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, in light of the Authority's responsibility in this area I have forwarded the Deputy's specific question in relation to the fair reduction scheme\u00a0and commercial bus companies, particularly in rural communities  to, to the\u00a0NTA for direct reply. \u00a0Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500062#WRE05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Licences","counter":419,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500063#WRF00200"},{"type":"question","counter":420,"qnumday":151,"qnumall":"[36143\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500063#WRF00300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) needs a public service card to renew their driving licence; and the reason they cannot use another form of identification.","asker":"1569","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":421,"content":"<p>It is not mandatory to have a Public Services Card (PSC) to apply for a driving licence.

Our VAT thresholds were increased to their current values, &euro;37,500 for services and &euro;75,000 for goods, on 1 May 2008.  Under VAT law, traders\/businesses such as B&amp;B&rsquo;s are required to register and account for VAT where their supply of guest or holiday accommodation exceeds the services threshold. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that Ireland&rsquo;s current registration thresholds are some of the most generous thresholds in the EU. Some Member States do not operate any VAT registration threshold, requiring all businesses to register. As an administrative practice, Revenue allow businesses that are approaching the threshold to take account of the VAT element of their Purchases-for-Resale in calculating turnover. This avoids a &lsquo;cliff-face&rsquo; effect when approaching the threshold. There is no data available to suggest a bunching effect below the threshold.<\/p>  <p>  In setting registration thresholds levels, the objective is to strike an appropriate balance between the desirability of reducing the administrative burden on small businesses and the Revenue authorities and the need to avoid undermining tax compliance or causing competitive distortions relative to registered firms. However every business keeps records and the vast majority of businesses keep these records electronically. Therefore, there is not that much additional administration involved in being registered for VAT beyond submitting VAT returns and, for some small businesses, this might only entail an annual VAT return.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500063#WRF03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":450,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[36132\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500063#WRF03300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if consideration will be given to introducing a vacant property tax to reduce the number of vacant properties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1523","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":451,"content":"<p>The Government&rsquo;s strategy &lsquo;Housing For All&rsquo; includes an action for my Department to collect data on vacancy with a view to introducing a Vacant Property Tax. The timeframe for delivery on this commitment is the second quarter of 2022. The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021 enabled Revenue to collect certain information in relation to the occupancy status of\u00a0 residential properties including, where unoccupied, the duration and reason for this, in the Local Property Tax (LPT) return forms submitted by residential property owners in respect of the new LPT valuation period 2022-2025. This information, together with information from other available sources, will be used to assess the merits and impact of introducing a Vacant Property Tax.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In considering the case for such a tax, it is important to have a sound understanding of the quantity, locations and characteristics of long-term vacant properties. It is also essential to identify the reasons for vacancy, and whether this is long or short-term in nature. There may be genuine and acceptable reasons for vacancy such as refurbishment work, the temporary absence of the owner for medical reasons or pending the grant of probate for a deceased person&rsquo;s estate.<\/p>  <p>  The LPT returns included questions such as whether a property is vacant, the reasons for the vacancy and if the period of vacancy exceeds 12 months. It should\u00a0be noted that LPT applies only to habitable residential properties, and derelict or uninhabitable properties are not captured under the LPT system. Revenue have completed a preliminary analysis of the LPT returns received to date which has been shared with my Department. The results of the preliminary analysis suggest that levels of vacancy are low across all counties.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  According to the preliminary Census figures release two weeks ago, 166,752 vacant dwellings were recorded in Census 2022. This is a decrease of 9% compared to 2016 (-16,560, down from 183,312). It is an even further reduction (12%) compared to 2011, when 230,056 vacant dwellings were recorded &ndash; giving a rate of 7.8%. it should be noted that this is a point in time measure of vacancy relating to the weeks either side of Census Night and is not intended to be a measure of long term vacancy or that these properties are available for re-use. These homes may well have been occupied again a few weeks after Census Night.<\/p>  <p>  I note the total number of vacant properties notified by property owners to Revenue is not directly equivalent to the total number of vacant dwellings counted by Census enumerators on Census Night. This is primarily due to the difference in data collection methodology. However, both sets of data are important in considering the case for a tax on vacant residential property.<\/p>  <p>  I will be considering this issue in consultation with colleagues before reverting to Government with proposals on the appropriate response. I understand Revenue intends to publish a profile of the occupancy data from the LPT returns shortly. <\/p>  <p>  Addressing vacancy and dereliction, and maximising the use of the existing housing stock, is a priority objective of the Government, as evidenced in the\u00a0Housing for All\u00a0strategy where one of the four pathways in the plan is specifically dedicated to this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500063#WRF03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Strategic Infrastructure","counter":452,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500063#WRF03500"},{"type":"question","counter":453,"qnumday":162,"qnumall":"[36184\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500063#WRF03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the measures put in place by his Department to guarantee that the monies lent by the Irish Strategic Investment Fund will be used only for aviation development within the State; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1508","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":454,"qnumday":163,"qnumall":"[36185\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500063#WRF03700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the details of the measures in place to monitor the way in which, and the location, of the moneys lent by the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund are spent; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1508","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":455,"qnumday":164,"qnumall":"[36186\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500063#WRF03800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the directors of an airline (details supplied) have given his Department an undertaking to use Ireland Strategic Investment Fund moneys only in the development of routes within and from the State; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1508","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":456,"qnumday":165,"qnumall":"[36188\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500063#WRF03900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the loan given to an airline (details supplied) from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund is to be rescinded if the airline fails on commitments made when receiving the loan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1508","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":457,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 162 to 165, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  The Ireland Strategic Investment Funds mandate is to invest on a commercial basis in a manner designed to support economic activity and employment in Ireland.

The best interests of consumers are protected and confidence and trust in the financial system is enhanced through effective regulation of firms and markets. <\/p>  <p>  In line with the its mandate, the Central Bank intervened with a number of lenders between 2008 and 2015 in relation to tracker mortgages, requiring, among other things, certain lenders to offer affected customers the right to return to a tracker rate and\/or payment of redress and compensation while at the same time strengthening the regulatory protections for tracker mortgage customers. The Central Bank launched the Tracker Mortgage Examination (TME) in December 2015 after it became clear, through combined supervisory and enforcement work and from information from consumer advocates, members of the public and public representatives, that tracker issues could potentially be industry wide.<\/p>  <p>  The TME required all lenders to review their loan book to ensure compliance with both regulatory and contractual requirements in relation to tracker mortgages. Where impacted customers were identified, the Central Bank expected that those customers receive redress and compensation in line with the detriment suffered. Approximately 42,000 customers have been identified as impacted by tracker failures by their lender and &euro;737m in redress and compensation has been paid to those customers by their lenders.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  While the supervisory phase of the TME concluded with the publication of the Central Bank&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tracker Mortgage Examination\u00a0Final Report&rdquo; in July 2019, the Central Bank continues to monitor the outcomes of any complaints, appeals and court cases. Any person who is still not satisfied with the outcome of their engagement with their lender in relation to the tracker mortgage issue may take their individual case to the independent Financial Services and Ombudsman&rsquo; Office.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank&rsquo;s enforcement investigations and actions build on the TME and further demonstrate its commitment to\u00a0its consumer protection mandate.<\/p>  <p>  To date, the Central Bank has concluded five enforcement actions against firms relating to tracker mortgage-related failings identified under the Tracker Mortgage Examination, imposing fines totalling &euro;173.8 million. <\/p>  <p>  The TME and the imposition of significant fines on lenders send strong signals to lenders that misconduct on their part will have serious consequences.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important that our legislative and regulatory framework is fully up to date and that senior banking executives can be held to account.\u00a0 The Central Bank (Individual Accountability Framework) Bill, which will introduce a Senior Executive Accountability Regime (SEAR) for the financial services industry, will be key to this.

The day to day financial management of public swimming pools is a matter for the operators of the facilities themselves. <\/p>  <p>  In response to the Covid-19 pandemic however, my Department provided funding of &euro;2.5 million in 2020 to support publicly accessible swimming pools in responding to the challenges associated with maintaining swimming pools and re-opening within Covid-19 safety protocols. A further amount of &euro;3.2 million was provided in 2021 for this purpose in recognition of the importance of the sector and the positive impact swimming has on the nation&rsquo;s health. The funding was administered by Ireland Active on behalf of Sport Ireland and supported 280 pools throughout the country including the pool referred to by the Deputy. <\/p>  <p>  Recent global events, including the invasion of Ukraine, have led to a rise in energy costs.

Where a construction product, covered by a harmonised standard (includes concrete blocks, aggregates for concrete and cement), is being placed on the EU market, the CPR requires the manufacturer to draw up a &lsquo;declaration of performance&rsquo; and affix a &lsquo;CE&rsquo; marking to the product. In order to do so, manufacturers must test and declare the performance of their construction products using a common technical language prescribed in the harmonised standard.<\/p>  <p>  The National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI), is Ireland&rsquo;s official standards body and is an autonomous body under the aegis of the Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment. NSAI has produced additional guidance to some harmonised (including concrete blocks, aggregates for concrete), and non-harmonised standards (concrete to I.S. EN 206-1:2013+A2:2021), in the form of Standard Recommendations (SRs) and National Annexes which set out appropriate minimum performance levels for specific intended uses of certain construction products in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  My Department recently published &lsquo;A Guide to the Marketing and Use of Aggregate Concrete Blocks to EN 771-3 in Ireland&rsquo; which is available on the Department&rsquo;s website.\u00a0\u00a0This guide aims to facilitate clearer communication within the supply chain regarding the declared performance of essential characteristics of concrete blocks having regard to national provisions in Ireland. Guidance is also provided for specifiers, designers, builders, certifiers and end users who when specifying and choosing aggregate concrete blocks, they should ensure that the construction products are fit for intended use and the conditions in which they are to be used. Appropriate specifications and choices will help secure compliance with the Building Regulations 1997 to 2021.<\/p>  <p>  While the CPR came into force in July 2013 and has direct legal application across the entire European Union, each Member State is responsible for regulating for its own market surveillance activities in accordance with the specific requirements of the CPR and the broader overarching requirements of\u00a0Regulation (EU) 2019\/1020 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on market surveillance and compliance of products and amending Directive 2004\/42\/EC and Regulations (EC) No 765\/2008 and (EU) No 305\/2011.<\/p>  <p>  Under the\u00a0European Union (Construction Products) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No.225 of 2013), each of the building control authorities (local authorities) have been designated as the principal market surveillance authorities for construction products that fall within the scope of the CPR, within their administrative areas. In addition, the\u00a0Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2020 (Construction Products &ndash; Market Surveillance) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 682 of 2020)\u00a0appointed Dublin City Council as a competent authority for the carrying out of market surveillance functions under the \u00a0European Union (Construction Products) Regulations 2013 for all related construction products on a nationwide basis. Dublin City Council-National Building Control and Market Surveillance Office, (NBC&amp;MSO) Market Surveillance Unit has been established for this purpose. Building control authorities liaise with NBC&amp;MSO national market surveillance unit to support compliance with the CPR and to determine appropriate action on enforcement matters, as they arise.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s\u00a0National market surveillance programme 2021\u00a0is published on the website of the European Commission. Section 2.5 provides specific details with the market surveillance of construction products and outlines a market surveillance campaign led by NBC&amp;MSO to perform risk assessments of selected quarrying and pit operations, follow-up inspections, sampling and testing as appropriate to ensure compliance with the CPR. The 2022 programme is currently being finalised and is expected to continue to focus on the extractive industries sector and expand upon the programme commenced in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  In October of last year I requested a Market Surveillance Audit of all quarries in Donegal which was carried out by the National Building Control and Market Surveillance Office in partnership with Donegal County Council and Geological Survey Ireland. I received a report of this audit at the end of June and am currently examining its contents.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the initiatives above, Market Surveillance Authorities respond to complaints raised.\u00a0 Therefore any information on suspected non-compliance should be submitted in writing (detailing as much information as possible) to either the appropriate local Market Surveillance Authority and\/or the National Building Control Office and Market Surveillance Office (NBC&amp;MSO). The Local Market Surveillance Authority may be contacted through the City or County Council. NBC&amp;MSO may be contacted at:\u00a0support@nbco.gov.ie.<\/p>  <p>  Separately,\u00a0 in relation to the manufacture and supply of concrete, while it is covered by a European standard\u00a0\u00a0I.S. EN 206-1:2013+A2:2021, this is\u00a0not a harmonised standard within the scope of the CPR. NSAI has published additional guidance in the form of an Irish National Annex, which specifies among other requirements, the recommended limiting values required for concrete mixes for the various exposure classes. These values are applicable to the specification or use of concrete in Ireland.\u00a0I.S. EN 206-1+A2:2021\u00a0places significant responsibility upon manufacturers of ready-mix concrete to demonstrate conformity to a series of specified requirements.<\/p>  <p>  NSAI has also put in place a product certification scheme covering ready-mix concrete. This entails an initial inspection of the concrete plant focusing on:<\/p>  <p>  -  The production control manual and the degree of conformity to I.S. EN 206&ndash;1 and National Annex;<\/p>  <p>  -  Inspection of relevant documentation,<\/p>  <p>  -  Facilities and equipment,<\/p>  <p>  -  Staff training, experience and knowledge,<\/p>  <p>  -  Issuing a Certificate of Conformity.<\/p>  <p>  All the relevant information from the initial inspection and assessment of the system is documented in an NSAI Assessment Report. This report will be issued after the plant has passed the initial inspection, along with a Certificate of Conformity to I.S. EN 206-1:2002 and Irish National Annex.<\/p>  <p>  To maintain certification, qualified NSAI personnel will continue to carry out regular inspections. As a minimum, the following will be examined:<\/p>  <p>  -  Sampling and testing procedures,<\/p>  <p>  -  Recorded data,<\/p>  <p>  -  Test results obtained for production control during the inspection period,<\/p>  <p>  -  Frequency of required tests or procedures,<\/p>  <p>  -  Scheduled production equipment checks and maintenance,<\/p>  <p>  -  Scheduled test equipment maintenance and calibration,<\/p>  <p>  -  Actions taken with respect to any non-conformity,<\/p>  <p>  -  Delivery tickets, and the Declaration of Conformity where relevant,<\/p>  <p>  -  Maintenance of the production control system.<\/p>  <p>  NSAI also take ongoing spot samples to verify the accuracy of the producer&rsquo;s routine testing procedures.\u00a0 Where significant changes are made to facilities at the production place, system or manual, the producer must notify these changes to NSAI. Following review, NSAI may determine that an on-site re-inspection is appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, in relation to Building Regulations, the overarching requirement under Part D (Material and Workmanship) of the Building Regulations 1997-2021 requires that all works should be carried out:<\/p>  <p>  -  Using proper materials which are fit for the use for  which they are intended and for the conditions in which they are to be used.<\/p>  <p>  -  With a proper standard of workmanship and the appropriate use of any material to achieve compliance with the  requirements of the Regulations.<\/p>  <p>  -  By competent persons with sufficient training, experience and knowledge appropriate to the nature of the work he or she is required to perform and having particular regard to the size and complexity of such works so as to ensure a proper standard of workmanship.<\/p>  <p>  The primary responsibility for compliance with the Building Regulations 1997-2021 rests with the designers, builders and owners of buildings. Interpretation of the legislation is, ultimately, a matter for the Courts and implementation of the Building Control system is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities, who are independent in the exercise of their statutory powers.<\/p>  <p>  The Regulation of Providers of Building Works Bill 2022, which will put the Construction Industry Register Ireland on a statutory footing, is currently going through the legislative process in the Oireachtas and is expected to be enacted shortly.\u00a0 Its main objective is to develop and promote a culture of competence, good practice and compliance with the Building Regulations in the construction sector which will benefit consumers and the general public. The establishment of a robust, mandatory, statutory register is critical for the development of a culture of competence and compliance in the construction sector.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500066#WRL00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Appointments to State Boards","counter":590,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500066#WRL00500"},{"type":"question","counter":591,"qnumday":209,"qnumall":"[33856\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500066#WRL00600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of former civil servants who are currently serving on State boards under his remit; the number of former county managers and chief executive officers of local authorities who are currently on each of the State boards under his remit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1500","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":592,"content":"<p>In making appointments to State boards under my remit, my Department operates in accordance with the\u00a0Department of Public Expenditure and Reform guidelines on appointments to State Boards, published in November 2014.\u00a0<\/p><p>The Public Appointments Service has responsibility for managing an open, accessible and transparent system to support Ministers in making state board appointments and it is open to the public to apply for positions advertised on the stateboards.ie website.<\/p><p>Although the information requested by the Deputy may be available as part of the appointment process, under General Data Protection Regulation guidelines my Department does not have access to this information once the appointment has been made.<\/p><p>The names of individuals currently serving on State Boards under the aegis of my Department are available on the following link:<\/p><p>membership.stateboards.per.gov.ie\/department\/Department%20of%20Housing,%20Local%20Government%20and%20Heritage\/.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500066#WRL00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vacant Properties","counter":593,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500066#WRL00800"},{"type":"question","counter":594,"qnumday":210,"qnumall":"[35268\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500066#WRL00900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the supports that are available for a private citizen to redevelop a derelict building in rural towns for social or affordable housing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1602","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":595,"content":"<p>The repair and leasing scheme provides support to owners of vacant properties to bring the units up to the standard for rental property.

This will end the unsatisfactory reliance on Section 18 of the Local Government Act 2001 (as amended) whereby councillors who take a maternity related absence are not noted on the record for that purpose, as well as the requirement to obtain a Council resolution for a councillor seeking to extend her maternity leave beyond 6 months.<\/p>  <p>  In its decision, Government recognised that the councillor role is both unique and demanding in that it is difficult to step away from the role for a lengthy absence, such as to take maternity leave. Government, therefore, approved the proposal that elected members would have the option to nominate an individual as a temporary substitute when they take a period of maternity-related absence or indeed are absent due to illness or in good faith for another reason.<\/p>  <p>  Provision will therefore be required in the Local Government Act 2001 (as amended) to allow the possibility of the appointment by co-option of an individual as a temporary substitute for an elected member who takes a period of maternity-related absence under the Maternity Protection Act 1994, or is absent due to illness or in good faith for another reason under Section 18 of the Local Government Act 2001 (as amended). The temporary substitution would be initiated using a process of co-option similar to that provided for in Section 19 of the 2001 Act.  The member causing the temporary absence, whether or not they are aligned to a political party, would have an input in the nomination of the temporary substitute.<\/p>  <p>  Preparation of the general scheme is being prioritised.

The aim of the Building Regulations is to provide for the safety and welfare of people in and about buildings. The Building Regulations apply to the design and construction of a new building (including a dwelling) and certain works to an existing building.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0The minimum performance requirements that a building must achieve are set out in the Second Schedule to the Building Regulations. These requirements are set out in 12 parts (classified as Parts A to M). Technical Guidance Documents\u00a0(TGDs) are published to accompany each part indicating how the requirements of that part can be achieved in practice.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0There is an overarching requirement under Part D (Material and Workmanship) of the Building Regulations which requires that all works should be carried out:<\/p>  <p>  - Using proper materials which are fit for the use for which they are intended and for the conditions in which they are to be used.<\/p>  <p>  - With a proper standard of  workmanship and the appropriate use of any material to achieve compliance with the requirements of the Regulations.<\/p>  <p>  - By competent persons with sufficient training, experience and knowledge appropriate to the nature of the work he or she is required to perform and having particular regard to the size and complexity of such works so as to ensure a proper standard of workmanship.<\/p>  <p>  Responsibility for enforcement is delegated to local building control authorities who are independent in the exercise of their statutory powers and any person who believes that an offence has been committed is encouraged to report this to the local building control authority in whose area the offence is alleged to have been committed. Building control authorities have strong powers of inspection and enforcement under the Acts. In addition, local authorities also have similar powers under the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003, the Housing Acts and the Planning and Development Acts, which may be relevant where concerns arise in residential developments.<\/p>  <p>  Authorised officers of each local building control authority have delegated powers to: -<\/p>  <p>  - scrutinise proposals and inspect works in progress;<\/p>  <p>  - serve enforcement notices on owners and builders for non-compliance;<\/p>  <p>  - institute proceedings for breaches of any requirements outlined in the Acts, or any<\/p>  <p>  - regulations made thereunder; and seek High Court orders to mitigate danger to the public where serious non-compliance poses risks to public safety.<\/p>  <p>  Failure by an owner or a builder, at the request of a building control authority, to demonstrate compliance with the Building Regulations or the Building Control Regulations, or to rectify any such non-compliance, may be an offence under the Building Control Acts. If successfully prosecuted in court, such offences may lead to a fine and\/or a term of imprisonment. \u00a0The use of these powers is, however, subject to a statute of limitations of five years from the date of completion of the buildings concerned.<\/p>  <p>  Other significant pieces of redress and producers&rsquo; liability legislation which may apply to construction products are the Sale of Goods Act 1893 and the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980; and the Liability for Defective Products Act 1991.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the stressful circumstances which the owners and residents of buildings face when defects occur in their homes.\u00a0 In this regard, the Programme for Government sets out a number of commitments in respect of the important policy area of addressing building defects.

Under this legislation, the decision to zone land for development is a reserved function of the elected members of each planning authority.  This includes the zoning of lands for residential development in order to meet the housing supply target identified in the administrative area of the local authority.<\/p>  <p>  The statutory Development Plan Guidelines for Planning Authorities published under section 28 of the Planning Act by my Department on 1st July 2022, set out national policies and objectives in relation to the zoning of land.  The guidelines state that land already zoned for residential purposes may be regarded as providing a baseline, or starting point to meet projected population and housing targets, especially in cases where planning permission has already been granted, based on the presumption that land subject to planning permission is already serviced or serviceable.  Where there is a surplus of well-located zoned and fully serviced land already zoned for development, it is recommended best practice that a phased approach be taken to prioritise the preferred sequence of development of such sites.  <\/p>  <p>  It is only in cases where land is zoned and has remained undeveloped and unserviced through one or more development plan cycles, with no prospect of being serviced within the six-year life of the development plan, alternative approaches, including discontinuing the zoning objective, must be considered as it is important that zoned land can be developed as intended, during the life of the plan to ensure that there is sufficient residential land available to meet identified housing needs.  This is supported by the provision in section 10 of the Act that there shall be no presumption that any land zoned for development in a development plan shall remain so zoned in any subsequent plan. <\/p>  <p>  The new Development Plan guidelines also provide that in certain instances a planning authority may provide zoned residential sites in addition to those required to meet the housing supply target for a settlement in order to ensure that sufficient choice for development potential is safeguarded.<\/p>  <p>  The Residential Zoned Land tax (RZLT) introduced by the Finance Act 2021 seeks to encourage the activation of development on lands which are suitably zoned and appropriately serviced and will impose a tax on landowners who fail to bring such lands forward for development.  My Department published section 28 Guidelines for Planning Authorities on the Residential Zoned Land Tax on 29th June 2022.  This tax measure is aligned to the sequential and phased approach to the development of zoned land outlined in the Development Plan Guidelines, with a clear incentive to bring forward land which has had the benefit of investment in the key infrastructure required to support housing. It will also allow other infrastructure providers such as those providing social and community infrastructure to have greater clarity on the likely locations for housing development to take place.<\/p>  <p>  One of the key priorities of the National Planning Framework (NPF) is the compact growth of cities and towns of all sizes.  This objective seeks to support the sustainable development of our cities and towns as attractive and vibrant places.  The NPF targets 40 percent of future growth to take place in the existing built up area of cities and towns.  This target will be met by a combination of development on zoned housing land, and by increasing the proportion of development that takes place on infill and brownfield development sites within existing urban areas.  The NPF recognises that this change will not be achieved from the outset and allows for transition over time.  <\/p>  <p>  Following the adoption of the NPF and the subsequent Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies,, a process of reviewing city and county development plans by individual planning authorities is now underway.  When complete, this will be the first time that there has been an integrated hierarchy of statutory spatial plans, shaping the future pattern and form of development in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500067#WRM03375","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"question","counter":689,"qnumday":243,"qnumall":"[36058\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500067#WRM03500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the position regarding any research carried out by his Department into the repeal of specific planning policy requirements under section 28 (1)(c) of the Planning and Development Act 2000; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1626","askee":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":690,"qnumday":248,"qnumall":"[36076\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500067#WRM03600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the position regarding any research carried out by his Department into the revoking of build-to-rent planning standards for apartments and instead introducing a single build-to-sell standard across all apartment developments; the impact this would have on investment levels and the delivery of homes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1626","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":691,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 243 and 248 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2015 inserted the new section 28(1C) into the 2000 Act, and this provision was substituted by section 20(a) of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The objective of this amendment was to ensure that specific planning policy requirements (SPPRs) included in guidelines issued by the Minister under section 28 would have to be complied with and applied consistently by planning authorities, regional assemblies (since 2018) and the Board.  This had become necessary as some local authorities were introducing requirements and standards that diverged significantly from national policy guidance and legislation (e.g. apartment sizes and building performance standards) in their plans, resulting in a highly variable and inconsistent planning policy framework, in some cases within different parts of the same urban area.<\/p>  <p>  The objective of guidelines issued under section 28 of the 2000 Act, and SPPRs in particular, is to achieve consistency of approach on critical matters throughout the hierarchy of plans at national, regional and local levels, in support of national policy objectives. Their use is limited and specific to clearly articulating Government policy and ensuring a consistency of application across the planning system.<\/p>  <p>  The National Planning Framework (NPF) sets out the vision and strategic objectives to support Ireland&rsquo;s national, regional and local spatial development in economic, environmental and social terms to 2040. Under the Planning and Development Act 2000, regional plans and plans developed by planning authorities must have regard to and be consistent with the objectives of the NPF. <\/p>  <p>  In 2018, my Department published the updated Sustainable Urban Housing Development Guidelines to respond to changing housing need, in light of emerging dynamics in the urban employment market and ongoing demographic trends. The 2018 Guidelines addressed in particular, the relatively new build-to-rent sector and sets out a number of key distinct characteristics of such development. Further, related guidance has been subsequently issued in the form of updates to the Sustainable Urban Housing: Design Standards for New Apartments Guidelines for Planning Authorities, most recently in 2020, which while introducing a presumption against 'co-living' accommodation in most circumstances, has retained 'build-to-rent' (BTR) development as a distinct planning category.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the Apartment Guidelines specifically, the specific planning policy requirements included seek to enable reinforce the national policy objective of providing more compact forms of urban development as outlined in the NPF through increasing the density, scale and heights of buildings, including apartments, in appropriate locations. Those regarding BTR facilitate an element of tenure choice at particular types of location.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that by the end of 2022, the vast majority of city and county development plans will have been reviewed and a greater consistency of approach will be provided in those development plans to achieve more dense patterns of development in appropriate locations, given the need for planning authorities to have regard to these Guidelines and to comply with relevant SPPRs contained within them. This will also coincide with the significant advancement of the Attorney General-led review of the Planning Act.<\/p>  <p>  It is not currently proposed to repeal the provisions, which are considered to provide an important role in the integration of national policy within the planning hierarchy of plans from national to regional and local levels. The Planning and Development Act 2000 is currently being reviewed by the Attorney General, in conjunction with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and any necessary amendments to current legislative arrangements will, where appropriate, be considered in this context. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500067#WRM03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Schemes","counter":692,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500067#WRM03800"},{"type":"question","counter":693,"qnumday":244,"qnumall":"[36061\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500067#WRM03900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if a response will issue to matters raised in correspondence (details supplied) regarding the shared equity scheme and the significant price cap difference between counties Louth and Meath, which adversely affects applications in Drogheda, County Louth; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1598","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":694,"content":"<p>The imminent launch of the First Home Scheme will see first-time buyers helped to purchase new houses and apartments in the private market through the use of an equity share model, similar to that employed in the Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme.

In place of an outright ban or prohibition on metal detecting to search for archaeological objects, such activities are instead subject to a regulatory regime. That regulatory regime was introduced under the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 1987 to address the major damage to archaeological sites and monuments, and substantial loss of important archaeological objects, which had occurred as a result of uncontrolled metal detecting in the 1970's and 1980's. The removal of the existing regulatory structure would be considered a retrograde step that could place our national archaeological heritage in jeopardy.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, under Article 3 of the 1992 European Convention on the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage (which was ratified by Ireland in 1997) parties to the Convention are required to &ldquo;subject to specific prior authorisation, whenever foreseen by the domestic law of the State, the use of metal detectors and any other detection equipment or process for archaeological investigation&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  The proposed Monuments and Archaeological Heritage Bill will continue the approach of regulating the use of detection devices for archaeological purposes, in particular searching for archaeological objects. I am satisfied that this represents a necessary, reasonable and proportionate approach to an activity which, unfortunately, could result in the damage to or loss of our national archaeological heritage.<\/p>  <p>  It should be\u00a0noted that my officials in the National Monuments Service have met with representatives of the Irish Metal Detecting Society (IMDS) on several occasions, and (along with staff of the National Museum of Ireland) have had several detailed discussions with IMDS in 2014 and again in 2019. In these engagements, my officials have indicated that they would endeavour, if requested by IMDS, to facilitate partnership arrangements between interested metal detectorists and professional archaeologists, under which metal detectorists could be involved in appropriately regulated research work under the necessary professional supervision. The National Monuments Service of my Department\u00a0remains available to engage with IMDS to discuss such proposals in further detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500067#WRM05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1512"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Schemes","counter":708,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500067#WRM05400"},{"type":"question","counter":709,"qnumday":250,"qnumall":"[36149\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500067#WRM05500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the details of acceptance and refusal rates for a scheme (details supplied) for each local authority; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1516","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":710,"content":"<p>The Local Authority Home Loan has been available nationwide from local authorities since 4 January 2022. <\/p><p>The Housing Agency provides a central support service that assesses applications for the Local Authority Home Loan on behalf of local authorities and makes recommendations to the authorities to approve or refuse applications.

We believe that the Security Council has an important role to play, given the impact on national and regional peace and security.\u00a0 Since the conflict began in November 2020, there have been 14 meetings of the Council on Ethiopia. Ireland has played a leading role on the Council, particularly in negotiating statements that, despite difficult dynamics, have achieved unanimous support in calling for unhindered humanitarian access, a ceasefire and a national dialogue. Ireland has also repeatedly raised the need for accountability for the widespread human rights abuses and atrocities that have been committed by all sides in the conflict. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Ethiopia was most recently discussed at the Security Council on 14 April, when the focus was on the humanitarian situation.\u00a0 At that meeting, Ireland called for immediate implementation of the recently agreed humanitarian truce, and delivery of humanitarian assistance to those most in need.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Putting Ethiopia on the formal agenda of the Council would require support around the table, and the reality is that some members of the Council do not want this. We will nevertheless continue to raise the situation in Ethiopia as necessary. Responding to the acute humanitarian crisis in Tigray and Ethiopia more generally will remain an urgent priority for Ireland during our term on the Council and beyond. <\/p>  <p>  Minister Coveney continues to engage on the situation in Ethiopia with key interlocutors in the region including African Union Special Envoy Obasanjo, whose role in helping find a solution to the conflict we fully support. Minister Coveney met with Ethiopia&rsquo;s Deputy Prime Minister\/Foreign Minister Demeke Mekonnen in February, and stressed the need for full humanitarian access and an end to hostilities; restoration of basic services; and political dialogue. We continue to advocate for an effective response to the situation through a full range of regular and ongoing contacts with Ethiopia, including in Addis Ababa, the Permanent Missions to the United Nations in New York and Geneva, as well as in EU forums in Brussels.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I welcome some recent positive developments in Ethiopia, including the declaration of a humanitarian truce and ceasefire, and reported willingness by both sides to engage in talks towards finding a lasting peaceful solution to the conflict. This opportunity for peace must be seized. However, despite the increased humanitarian access, we remain concerned that this still falls far short of meeting needs. Essential services such as banking and telecommunications remain cut off &ndash; it is critical that these are restored and that secure, unhindered and complete humanitarian access is ensured urgently. <\/p>  <p>  Horrifying reports of gross human rights violations, including widespread sexual violence, have defined the conflict in Tigray. These are unacceptable and must end while perpetrators must be held to account. The publication on 3 November of the findings of the joint investigation by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) into violations of international humanitarian and human rights law committed in Tigray was a vital first step towards accountability. We must see the full implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations and progress on investigations into these appalling crimes, as well as continued attention on ongoing abuses. Ireland also supports the decision of the Human Rights Council in December to establish an international commission of human rights experts on Ethiopia and welcomes the recent appointment of the members of the Commission. Ireland believes this will be complementary to domestic efforts and encourages all parties to cooperate with the Commission and to allow it full unimpeded access to the country.

This includes the Commission&rsquo;s Annual Rule of Law Report and the Rule of Law budget conditionality regulation. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland supports the continuation of the Article 7 Treaty on European Union process at the General Affairs Council in relation to Hungary and Poland. The process offers a welcome opportunity for peer dialogue on rule of law challenges. Ireland has participated actively in the hearings held to date and will continue do so.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland broadly welcomes the recent agreement between Poland and the European Commission on milestones around the rule of law in relation to approval of Poland&rsquo;s Recovery and Resilience Plan. Ireland also supports the Commission&rsquo;s formal notification that the budget conditionality regulation will be activated in relation to Hungary. Our hope had been Hungary would engage constructively with those specific rule of law concerns identified by the Commission but regrettably this did not happen. <\/p>  <p>  Alongside the promotion of democracy and protection of human rights, strengthening the rule of law is one of the three pillars of the Council of Europe. As part of our current Presidency of the organisation, Ireland has prioritised support for institutions through which the Council of Europe delivers that mandate, above all the European Court of Human Rights. The Taoiseach visited the Court on 7 June 2022 to affirm the importance we attach to rule of law. Ireland also recently announced voluntary financial contributions of over &euro;865,000 to the Council, much of it directed to support the Court&rsquo;s work. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is undertaking many initiatives through its Presidency to reinforce the rule of law across the European continent.

We support a range of General Assembly resolutions dealing with human rights and rule of law issues, some of which specifically address Europe. Ireland is, for example, a longstanding co-sponsor of the annual Ukraine-led resolution on the Situation of human rights in Crimea. Earlier this year, we supported three General Assembly resolutions that were tabled in response to Russia&rsquo;s illegal invasion of Ukraine, including one that suspended Russia from the UN Human Rights Council. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500070#WRP03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights","counter":860,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500070#WRP03900"},{"type":"question","counter":861,"qnumday":310,"qnumall":"[36110\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500070#WRP04000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"to indicate, notwithstanding the tragic experiences in the western Balkans, the extent to which safe havens or other security enclaves can be provided for refugees from various locations of war and conflict; if the vulnerability of such refugees can receive humanitarian reception and treatment regardless of their location; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":862,"content":"<p>Ireland continues to play its part and encourage others to provide a safe haven for people who are fleeing conflict and crises and are in need of protection and humanitarian support.

No change in the level of care need identified (and no change in the resultant SNA\u00a0allocation); <\/p>  <p>  ii. Increase in the level of care need identified (which if significant would see an increase\u00a0in the SNA allocations to the schools) ; <\/p>  <p>  iii.

Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030\/2014 circulars.gov.ie\/pdf\/circular\/education\/2014\/30.pdf.

&euro;254 for each of the first two children and &euro;381 for the third and other children. Remaining farm income and income from off-farm self-employment is then assessed at 70%,\u00a0with 30% disregarded.\u00a0 The approximate estimated annual cost, for every 1,000 recipients, of increasing the income disregard from 30% to 40% would be &euro;0.6 million; to 50% would be &euro;1.1 million; to 60% would be &euro;1.7 million; and to 70% would be &euro;2.3 million.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Further to the commitment in the Programme for Government and in the Rural Development Policy 2021-2025, my Department recently reviewed the means assessment disregards for the Farm Assist.\u00a0 The report is available on the Government's website.\u00a0 One of the key recommendations of the report was to\u00a0provide for an extensive expansion to the list of agri-environmental schemes that qualify for a disregard which I recently introduced effective from June 2022.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In line with the provisions for Jobseeker's Allowance, a disregard of &euro;20 per day, up to a maximum of &euro;60 for up to three days, applies to off-farm earnings from employment in the means test for Farm Assist.\u00a0 The cost of increasing the disregard would depend on the number of farmers in off-farm employment and the number of days worked and this information is not readily available.\u00a0 The impact of this measure on a Farm Assist recipient who works 8 hours for 1 day a week at minimum wage and has means of &euro;38 deducted from their weekly payment would be as follows: the means would reduce to &euro;35 if the disregard was increased to &euro;25 per day, &euro;32 if the disregard was &euro;30 per day and &euro;26 if the disregard was &euro;40 per day.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In line with other means tested social welfare schemes, the first &euro;20,000 of capital is not assessed under Farm Assist.\u00a0 The Review estimated that some 700 Farm Assist recipients would benefit from an increase in the amount disregarded in the capital assessment.\u00a0 Increasing the capital disregard\u00a0 to &euro;36,000 would cost between &euro;0.5 and &euro;1 million per annum. \u00a0There may also be a number of persons who do not currently qualify for a payment as their means are in excess of the maximum amount permitted as a result, inter alia, of capital held who would qualify due to the increase in the initial amount disregarded.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Where capital assets, such as farm machinery or equipment, are purchased outright, an allowance for depreciation relative to their usage is made.\u00a0 There would be a cost to increase the depreciation to a standard rate of 10% which would require a detailed analysis to provide an accurate costing.\u00a0 This information is not readily available.<\/p>  <p>  Any changes to the Farm Assist scheme would have to be considered in a budgetary context, within the scope of the overall resources available for welfare improvements and with consideration to other social welfare schemes.<\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500076#WRV00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1151,"content":"<p>Question No. 413 answered with Question No. 412.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1152,"content":"<p>Question No. 414 answered with Question No. 412.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1153,"content":"<p>Question No. 415 answered with Question No. 412.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":1154,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500076#WRV01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1155,"qnumday":416,"qnumall":"[35926\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500076#WRV01200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she will provide an update on the review in relation to amending the occupational injury and illness scheme or public sector pay in relation to cases of long-Covid contracted in the workplace, particularly in relation to the possible recognition of long-Covid as an occupation illness or disease;

As no evidence of locations was found, the Commission did not consider it feasible to excavate the full available site, which amounts to 60 acres.\u00a0 As the land is in private ownership, it is not open to the Government to procure or carry out investigations there.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission also examined the possibility that former residents may have been buried in other locations. It examined the surviving burial records relating to the eight burial grounds that operated in Cork City and its surrounding hinterland between 1922 and 1998 but was only able to confirm the burial locations of 63 children who were associated with Bessborough.<\/p>  <p>  I have engaged with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage with a view to supporting local authorities, including Cork City Council, in incorporating appropriate policies on protection of\u00a0burial sites into their development plans. <\/p>  <p>  It is a matter for relevant planning authorities, Cork City Council and An Bord Plean&aacute;la in this instance, to make determinations regarding planned developments in the grounds of Bessborough.

Foster carers are paid a weekly allowance, which is a payment to meet the needs of the child in their care. The foster care allowance is currently &euro;325 per week for a child under 12 years of age and &euro;352 per week for a child aged 12 years and over. It is paid in respect of the child and provided in order to allow foster carers to meet all of the child's daily living needs, including food, clothing, basic travel, education costs and hobbies and sports activities. The allowance is not considered as means for social welfare purposes, and is not subject to tax.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  If required, Tusla can also provide additional financial supports to foster carers through either additional or enhanced payments.<\/p>  <p>  Additional payments refers to any payment made to a foster carer that exceeds the standard rate of the fostering allowance.\u00a0 Such additional payments may be made in respect of children or young people who have additional needs that are not covered by the standardised fostering allowance.\u00a0 Additional payments can only be made where a child has additional medical or educational needs and when authorisation has been received from the Tusla Area Manager.\u00a0\u00a0 Each application for an additional payment will be accompanied by supporting documentation evidencing the need.<\/p>  <p>  Enhanced allowances for foster carers can be made when a longer term financial need is identified for additional supports for the child. A maximum of twice the weekly allowance may be paid in respect of children aged between 0-18 years if they require significant care over and above the needs of other children in foster care.\u00a0 This includes children who have been diagnosed with significant special needs and require a high level of personal care and supervision.\u00a0 The purpose of considering an enhanced allowance in these cases is to support foster carers in providing care to these children who have additional needs.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is in respect of and for the benefit of the foster child and therefore must be used to meet the day to day costs associated with looking after the foster child. In considering any enhanced allowance the assessing social worker is required to evidence that the standard fostering allowance does not adequately provide for the cost of caring for the child.<\/p>  <p>  A request for enhanced supports must certified by the Principal Social Worker and approved by the Area Manager following submission of an assessment of the child&rsquo;s needs and supporting documentation.\u00a0 A review arrangement for the enhanced allowance must be part of the submission for approval.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the foster care allowance, foster carers receive a number of targeted supports to ensure they continue to function as a recognised and valued part of the alternative care system. Key elements of this support include a link social worker, access to training and support group meetings and the allocation of a social worker for each child in care. Respite care for children may be arranged if it is part of their care plan.<\/p>  <p>  Pre-assessment and ongoing training are compulsory for foster carers in order to equip them with the skills and knowledge to provide high quality care. Recognising the specific dynamics and the personal nature of relative care, Tusla addresses the training needs of relatives who are foster carers separately. In addition, Tusla provides funding for the Irish Foster Care Association which offers a range of supports to carers, including advocacy, mediation, training and a telephone advice service.<\/p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is one element of the support that Tusla provides to carers when they offer a home and care to children some of whom may have additional, and sometimes significant, needs.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The rate of the foster care allowance is kept under review by officials within the Department and at present there are no plans to change the rate. However, the Department is undertaking an extensive review of the Child Care Act 1991 and will examine foster care arrangements as part of this review. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Further, Tusla has advised that they have recently engaged with foster carers in a consultation to inform the development of a Strategic Plan on Foster Care. Through this consultation, foster carers highlighted their view that the foster care allowance should be reviewed in light of inflation and increases in social welfare allowances. Once the Strategic Plan on Foster Care is finalised by Tusla, it will then be considered by the Department. Any decision to review the current rate of the foster allowance shall be informed by the Tusla Plan and the consultations that have preceded it.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500077#WRW00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Protection","counter":1205,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500077#WRW00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1206,"qnumday":433,"qnumall":"[35294\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500077#WRW00600","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"if he will address a matter raised in correspondence (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1207,"content":"<p>Since the outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine on February 24, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth (DCEDIY) continues to work as part of the whole-of-Government response with a focus on meeting the immediate, temporary accommodation needs of those fleeing the conflict. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is focused on the immediate, short-term accommodation needs of those who have fled here.

Government is committed to providing targeted and bespoke supports for neurodiverse people, which sit harmoniously in the wider context of disability policy and action.

A budgetary allocation of &euro;100,000 was secured under Budget 2022 for the purposes of designing and raising awareness of such a strategy, and on 29 April 2022, to mark Autism Awareness Month, I launched a comprehensive public consultation to inform the design of the Autism Innovation Strategy. The strategy development process is ongoing.<\/p>  <p>  I am very conscious of Ireland&rsquo;s commitments under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Therefore, it is critical that the Autism Innovation Strategy be co-designed and informed by the lived experiences of people with autism, their families and their representatives. <\/p>  <p>  The Autism Innovation Strategy will have as its immediate focus the delivery of real and tangible solutions to the challenges, needs and experiences of people with autism and neurodiversity. It will be a flexible, agile strategy that will be capable of evolving in line with best practice and the wider policy context. The Strategy is anticipated to influence the establishment of a best practice model of service delivery, assessment, diagnosis and intervention for persons with autism.<\/p>  <p>  Given that the consultation process to inform the design of the strategy is ongoing, pre-designating specific elements or ambitions, such as data collection systems or training rollout, would not be appropriate at this time. Nevertheless, I anticipate that actions on data collection and training will be included within it. <\/p>  <p>  A draft Autism Innovation Strategy will be published as soon as possible following consideration of all consultation responses. This will be followed by a second consultation after which the final Autism Innovation Strategy will be presented to Government for adoption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500078#WRX02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1293,"content":"<p>Question No. 461 answered with Question No. 460.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1294,"content":"<p>Question No. 462 answered with Question No. 460.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1295,"content":"<p>Question No. 463 answered with Question No. 460.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts","counter":1296,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500078#WRX03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1297,"qnumday":464,"qnumall":"[36242\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500078#WRX03300","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"if he, his Department or IPAS were aware of a matter before awarding a contract for accommodation services to a vendor (details supplied).","asker":"1488","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1298,"content":"<p>Since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine on 24 February, and the invoking of the temporary protection Directive by the European Union shortly afterwards, my Department has worked intensively as part of the cross-governmental response to the Ukraine crisis.<\/p>  <p>  The operational challenges brought about by responding to the conflict are significant.

The programme is delivered in two settings, Youthreach centres and Community Training Centres (CTCs).  The ESRI&rsquo;s Evaluation of the National Youthreach Programmes in 2019 found that the Youthreach programmes had significant value in re-engaging a vulnerable group of young people with learning, providing courses and a multiplicity of approaches tailored to their individual needs and embedding education and training provision within a broader network of supports.  <\/p>  <p>  The operation of the Youthreach programme in both settings is subject to Operator Guidelines in the case of Youthreach centres dating from 2015 and to Operating Standards for the CTCs dating from 2013.<\/p>  <p>  The primary target group for Youthreach Centres is young people between 16 and 20 years of age. Those aged 15 years of age may, as an exceptional measure, be admitted to the Youthreach centres where they have left school with no possibility of return.  This age group are not admissible to CTCs, who were set up by local community organisations to cater primarily for early school leavers between 16 and 21 years. Youthreach participants aged 16 and 17 in either setting receive an age-related training allowance, currently &euro;45 per week.  Learners over 18 years of age entering CTCs must undergo a Department of Social Protection (DSP) means test before they can qualify and receive their training allowance.   However, learners in Youthreach centres are paid the training allowance once they are not in receipt of a DSP payment. When a learner starts on a Youthreach programme, The DSP are immediately informed to ensure no double payment takes place. This difference is historical in nature.<\/p>  <p>  In its response to the ESRI Evaluation, SOLAS made a series of recommendations which included that ETBs should work together to develop and adopt a uniform approach to programme referral and entry into Youthreach based on existing good practice. SOLAS also proposed that the role of Youthreach programme guidelines be reviewed, given the central role of ETB planning and funding parameters in setting requirements from FET provision, and a cross-FET guidebook on programme practice should be developed to ensure clarity around programme expectations leading to clear pathways of progression opportunities for learners. <\/p>  <p>  A key priority of Future FET: Transforming Learning, the national Further Education and Training (FET) Strategy 2020-2024 is to ensure consistency of support for all learners. SOLAS is pursuing the implementation of its recommendations through the National FET Strategy and as part of the Strategic Performance Agreement process in conjunction with individual Education and Training Boards.<\/p>  <p>  An Operational Guidelines Working Group (OGWG) has been established by ETBI  to review the operational guidelines applying to CTCs, and Specialist Training Provision as well as Local Training Initiatives within the FET Sector.  The Group, comprising of FET Staff from a number of ETBs will review the Guidelines and revise\/update as required. They will look at areas such as deficiencies, common areas, good practices, siloed practices\/outdated practices and ensure the learner is represented in delivering high quality ETB programmes to meet the needs of that learner.  The OGWG is due to report to the ETB FET Directors later in 2022 and I expect that it will address the issues raised by the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500079#WRY03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1493"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1361,"content":"<p>Question No. 485 answered with Question No. 484.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Admissions","counter":1362,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500079#WRY04000"},{"type":"question","counter":1363,"qnumday":486,"qnumall":"[35762\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500079#WRY04100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of students studying at Maynooth University by course since 2018 to date, in tabular form.","asker":"1489","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1364,"content":"<p>The data requested by the deputy is contained at the link.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500079#WRY04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Expenditure Programme","counter":1365,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500079#WRY04300"},{"type":"question","counter":1366,"qnumday":487,"qnumall":"[35763\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500079#WRY04400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the expected date on which the construction of a new technology, society and innovation building at Maynooth University will be completed; and the estimated cost of the project.","asker":"1489","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1367,"content":"<p>I am delighted to advise that the new Technology, Society and Innovation building at Maynooth University is at the final handover and demonstrations stage with the substantial completion cert expected to issue next week.

Over the past two years, we have allocated &euro;10 million to higher education institutions to assist with supports for students. Each college was asked to focus on the recruitment of additional staff and address waiting lists. My Department allocates funding to the HEA for direct disbursement to the HEIs. As autonomous bodies, the internal disbursement of this funding, including the funding of their student services, the employment of counselling staff, and the procurement of counselling, waiting lists and mental health services are a matter for the individual institutions. <\/p>  <p>  However, I have asked the HEA to provide me with further detail on the allocation of that funding and its impact on waiting lists and I can revert to the Deputy. I am advised the funding over the past two years has enabled support services in HEIs to use new platforms and contemporary communication channels to reach out to students, rather than waiting for students to contact their student mental health services. This reaching out assisted in the support of students while COVID restriction were in place and continues to do so. <\/p>  <p>  In 2020 PCHEI, Psychological Counsellors in Higher Education in Ireland, received funding to establish a national office that would, among other objectives, support the development of Student Counselling Services so they best meet the needs of students both now and into the future. In 2021 a consortium consisting of TUS, DkIT and PCHEI received funding for the project, &lsquo;PCHEI Data set &ndash; Evidence base on counselling engagements, referrals and supports.&rsquo; The completion of this project will facilitate the gathering of data regarding the number of students engaged in counselling and with supports in HEIs on a national basis.<\/p>  <p>  In the Further Education and Training (FET) area, learners may have access to internal psychological supports from qualified ETB staff.

To address this and further alleviate the pressures arising from the rise in costs for students and their families I initiated improvements for the academic year 2022\/23 by increasing all student grant maintenance payments, including the special rate of grant, by &euro;200 per year as well as increasing the qualifying income thresholds (except special rate) by &euro;1,000.\u00a0I\u00a0have also introduced changes to the criteria for the higher non-adjacent rate of grant which means that from September 2022, the qualifying distance for the non-adjacent rate of grant has been reduced from 45km to 30km.

The balance of minor applications in the system are made up of applications based on Irish Association (226), applications in respect of minors born in the State but not entitled to citizenship at the time of their birth (827) and applications for Declarations under Section 28 and 28A of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act (71). Almost half of these applications have been in the system 12 months or fewer.\u00a0<\/p><p>For a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time.\u00a0<\/p><p>In addition, the combined impact of the 2019 High Court judgment in the Jones case and the necessary health restrictions arising from the pandemic, has unfortunately resulted in the processing time for standard applications increasing.\u00a0<\/p><p>Regrettably, the current average processing time for naturalisation applications for minors is approximately 26 months. This average processing time is based on the time from receipt of an application to the date of issuing a decision and reflects the efforts made to clear the oldest applications on hand. As the oldest applications are cleared this average will decrease. <\/p><p>In the first six months of this year, 1,005 minor applications have been issued with a decision on their application. Over the last two months, the Citizenship Division of my Department has been specifically focusing on the processing of naturalisation applications for minors, which has resulted in over 1,100 applicants having been contacted directly regarding the further processing of their applications.<\/p><p>The citizenship application process is reviewed on an ongoing basis to continually improve customer service quality. Feedback from applicants is taken on board and, as a result, a much more simplified, customer-focused and streamlined mechanism for applicants to provide their proofs of residence has recently been introduced.\u00a0<\/p><p>To further speed up the processing of applications, a number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times.

It is an ambitious five-year programme of reform to achieve a society which does not accept DSGBV or the attitudes which underpin it.<\/p>  <p>  This follows on from the work I have been doing to implement 'Supporting a Victim's Journey', our plan to give effect to all of the recommendations of the O'Malley Review.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I know from engagement with victims and victims groups, that the issue raised by the Deputy has the potential to cause distress and can lead to feelings of re-victimisation. There are a number of actions in Supporting a Victim's Journey designed to lessen such a possibility.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  One is the need for every professional person involved in a sexual offence case to have proper specialist training in this area. This action will cover the Garda&iacute;, the lawyers for the prosecution and the defence, as well as the judges in these cases.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Also, the right to separate legal representation for victims - when an application is made to question them about sensitive areas such as their sexual experience - will be extended to include trials for sexual assault. Previous to this, victims only had this right in trials for the more serious offence of rape. <\/p>  <p>  Defence lawyers' ability to cross-examine victims about their sexual history and experience, or what clothing they were wearing, is potentially a re-traumatising event. It may also be a contributing factor why rape and other sexual offences are underreported. <\/p>  <p>  I am confident that the legislation I recently introduced, which provides for preliminary trial hearings, will have a significant positive impact in this area. Preliminary trial hearings will be used to examine defence applications to question a victim on such matters and if this is to happen, the legal aid board will be notified accordingly. Other issues - such as the use of an intermediary and any other special measures required - can also be addressed at the preliminary trial hearing.<\/p>  <p>  The implementation of both Supporting a Victims Journey and the Third National DSGBV strategy will create a more supportive criminal justice system where every victim of a sexual offence feels that they can come forward confident in the knowledge that they will be supported throughout the entire process, treated fairly and have their dignity respected at all stages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500080#WRZ05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Traffic Accidents","counter":1440,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500080#WRZ05900"},{"type":"question","counter":1441,"qnumday":512,"qnumall":"[35659\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500080#WRZ06000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of persons who died in road traffic collisions in 2021; the number of persons who were injured in road traffic collisions in 2021 and who later died within 30 days of the road traffic collision; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1489","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1442,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda Commissioner is responsible under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (as amended), for the management and administration of Garda business, including all operational policing matters related to road traffic enforcement.<\/p><p>Road safety remains a high priority for\u00a0An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na\u00a0and for my Department, working closely in cooperation with the Department of Transport.

In coordination with our colleagues in the National Rural Safety Forum, I intend to\u00a0publish a Rural Safety Plan this autumn, which will complement the work of the Forum and consolidate the many excellent initiatives which are already underway on rural safety nationally. Officials in my Department are currently developing the Rural Safety Plan, and are engaging with the Forum in relation to the Plan.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that Minister McEntee intends to publish the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Recording Devices) Bill, previously called the Digital Recordings Bill, shortly. This important Bill makes provision for Garda powers to use modern digital technology including body worn cameras, Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) and CCTV.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department also administers a Community Based CCTV Grand Aid Scheme. The Scheme is intended to support local communities wishing to install and maintain CCTV security systems in their area, with the aim of increasing public safety and deterring illegal or anti-social behaviour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500081#WRAA05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1618"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Antisocial Behaviour","counter":1497,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500081#WRAA05400"},{"type":"question","counter":1498,"qnumday":532,"qnumall":"[35967\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500081#WRAA05500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will outline her consideration for the establishment of additional subgroups under the Forum on Anti-Social Behaviour, including one for vandalism and defacement; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1455","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1499,"content":"<p>The impact of anti-social behaviour is well recognised and is highlighted in the ongoing work of the Expert Forum on Anti-Social Behaviour (ASB) which I am pleased to chair.

It is a wide-ranging piece of legislation which significantly enhances laws to combat the sexual exploitation and sexual abuse of children.\u00a0 Specific offences have been provided for in this Act to target the recognised steps in what is often a gradual process of grooming a victim.<\/p>  <p>  Among the provisions of the 2017 Act are measures to strengthen significantly the existing criminal law in combating child exploitation and, in particular, to address the use of modern communication technologies as a tool which may lead to child sexual exploitation.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that sophisticated grooming often involves seemingly innocent contact with, or befriending of, a child, perhaps through text messaging, social media or messaging apps. This may be followed by the exposure of the child to sexual images or content.\u00a0 Section 8 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 provides for a specific offence of using information and communications technology to communicate with a child for the purposes of sexual exploitation.\u00a0 The offence allows An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to investigate and bring to justice online predators and carries a penalty of up to 14 years imprisonment.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Section 8 of the Sexual Offences Act 2017 also includes an offence of sending sexually explicit material to a child.\u00a0 This is in recognition that the intention behind this type of activity may be to expose the child to material with a view to developing the child&rsquo;s familiarity with such material or activity so as to facilitate the production of pornography or to meet the child for the purposes of sexual exploitation. The penalty for this offence is up to 5 years imprisonment.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that child trafficking and exploitation (including the production of child pornography) are criminalised under the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998, as amended by section 3 of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008.<\/p>  <p>  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 amended the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006 to raise the maximum penalty for engaging in a sexual act with a child who is under the age of 17 years from 5 to 7 years imprisonment.\u00a0 Furthermore, the 2017 Act amended the 2006 Act to raise the maximum penalty for attempting to engage in a sexual act with a child under the age of 17 years from 2 to 7 years imprisonment.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006, as amended, also provides that the maximum penalty for engaging in a sexual act with a child under the age of 15 years is life imprisonment and the same penalty applies to attempting to engage in a sexual act with a child under the age of 15 years.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland ratified the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse (known as the \"Lanzarote Convention\") on 21 December 2020. The Convention entered into force in relation to Ireland on 1 April 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Part 2 of The Criminal Justice (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 which strengthens the law relating to the sexual exploitation of children, including child pornography, and criminalises the use of information and communication technology to facilitate such exploitation, ensures the State&rsquo;s full compliance with criminal law provisions in the Convention.<\/p>  <p>  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) (Amendment) Act 2019 introduces, inter alia, stricter penalties for repeat sexual offenders. The Act provides that where an offender is convicted of a sexual offence listed in a new schedule to the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 (including a number of sexual offences against children) and is sentenced to imprisonment for a period of at least 5 years and is subsequently &ndash; within a period of 10 years &ndash; convicted of a further scheduled offence, the court shall, when imposing sentence for that offence, specify a term of imprisonment to be served by the person, that is no less than three quarters of the maximum penalty for the offence.<\/p>  <p>  Where the maximum penalty is life imprisonment, the court shall impose a sentence of not less than 10 years imprisonment. However, the court has discretion not to apply the minimum sentence if it is satisfied that this would be disproportionate in all the circumstances of the case.<\/p>  <p>  While there are currently no new legislative measures being advanced specifically in relation to child sexual abuse, I am bringing forward the Sex Offenders (Amendment) Bill which will  strengthen the management of convicted sex offenders on release.\u00a0I am of course committed to ensuring the law in this area is comprehensive and effective. As such, it is constantly kept under review and if further changes are identified as being needed, these will be brought forward.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware of the European Commission&rsquo;s new proposal, published in May this year, on tackling child sexual abuse online.\u00a0 This draft Regulation sets out comprehensive new requirements on online companies to assess and mitigate the extent to which their platforms are being misused for the purposes of child sexual abuse, both in terms of hosting material and the exploitation by abusers of their services for the purposes of grooming children.\u00a0 The Regulation will introduce provisions requiring companies to detect and report such material.\u00a0 It will also create a new EU Centre to coordinate the efforts of law enforcement agencies across the Union in tackling online child sexual abuse.\u00a0 I expressed my strong support for this new proposal to the European Commissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson, at the recent WeProtect Global Alliance summit on child sexual abuse in Brussels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500082#WRBB06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na","counter":1565,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500083#WRCC00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1566,"qnumday":554,"qnumall":"[36252\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500083#WRCC00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the extent to which she remains satisfied that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has access to the most modern forensics; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1567,"content":"<p>I have contacted An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the information requested by the Deputy, regretfully this information was not available in time.

The PHN Department supports the sponsorship of approx. 6- 8 standard PHNs annually however as per the National PHN Transfer Agreement (2015) PHNs who train apply for a transfer post their 18 months sponsorship. <\/p>  <p>  Since 2015 40 PHNs have transferred. Despite 3 recent cRGN recruitment campaigns the service has been unsuccessful in attracting candidates to the area. Staff retirement and staff moving to take up promotional opportunities have also reduced the number of PHNs in the area.<\/p>  <p>  From 2021 to 2022, 5 PHNs transferred and 5 PHNs commenced working as ADPHNs. This year the PHN Department has applied for standard PHNs and every effort is being made to recruit nurses.\u00a0 There are 4 PHNs due to qualify in 2022 and these will be assigned to fill vacant PHN areas.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE have confirmed that they will continue to use transfer panels and recruit for Public Health Nurses across the area. The situation is expected to improve in coming months when student PHNs are allocated to the area.<\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2022, the Minister secured annual investment of &euro;195m to enable the continued delivery of the Enhanced Community Care Programme.\u00a0 \u00a0This investment is supporting a programmatic and integrated approach to the development of the primary and community care sector.\u00a0 The ECC programme represents a significant expansion in primary care capacity, and will see some 3,500 additional staff recruited overall, with a particular focus on nursing and health and social care professionals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500083#WRCC04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Appointments to State Boards","counter":1608,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500083#WRCC04800"},{"type":"question","counter":1609,"qnumday":569,"qnumall":"[33855\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500083#WRCC04900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of former civil servants who are currently serving on State boards under his remit; the number of former county managers and chief executive officers of local authorities who are currently on each of the State boards under his remit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1500","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1610,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is not held by my Department. <\/p>  <p>  The nomination and appointment processes for boards of bodies under the aegis of my Department are set out in legislation.

Following extensive engagement with healthcare unions on the matter, on 19th April\u00a0the HSE published eligibility guidelines and FAQs, as apply to the HSE and Section 38 agencies, which are available on its website:\u00a0www.hse.ie\/eng\/staff\/resources\/hr-circulars\/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html  . Payment is currently receiving priority across all Hospital Groups and Community Services in the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE and the Department are currently examining progressing the rollout to the list of 6 non-HSE\/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision. Rolling out the payment to eligible non-HSE and non-Section 38 employees is a complex task, particularly as these employees are not normally paid by the public health service, duplicate payments need to be avoided, and there are many organisations to be covered.<\/p>  <p>  Officials in the Department and the HSE are prioritising the work needed to progress this. It is hoped that information will be published shortly for those certain non-HSE\/S38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in:<\/p>  <p>  1. Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);<\/p>  <p>  2.

This is a public body established in law to protect the health, safety and wellbeing of patients and the public by regulating both pharmacists and pharmacies in Ireland. To qualify as a Pharmacist in Ireland, a student must complete the PSI-accredited Five-Year Integrated Pharmacy Programme (M.Pharm). This is a master&rsquo;s level qualification and on successful completion of the programme, graduates are then eligible to apply to the PSI for registration.<\/p>  <p>  Placements for the five-year programme are managed by APPEL (Affiliation for Pharmacy Practice Experiential Learning), which was established by the three Schools of Pharmacy in Ireland to manage and centralise the learning placements for students from each of the schools. APPEL also offers placement providers a single point of contact, training and support. The structure of the placements may be viewed at:\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  www.thepsi.ie\/Libraries\/Education\/Placement_Structure_for_5Yr_Prog_Final_Post_ISG_Mtg_071014.sflb.ashx .\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The MPharm Programme involves the integration and dispersal of practice placements for students throughout the five years. This includes experiential placements of varying durations in the three main areas of pharmacy practice, i.e., community, hospital and industry during second, fourth and fifth year with placements in industry and other practice areas (health service, regulatory etc.) occurring in the fourth year. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The MPharm Programme offers opportunities for students to be placed in the three main areas of pharmacy practice and is structured as such to benefit both the student learning experience and contribute to improved outcomes in the health system; the placement in the final year however is required to be in a patient facing role. The majority of students currently complete their final placements in a community pharmacy setting where the placement provider covers direct costs on an altruistic basis, and the latter is not supported by subvention to do so.   \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Given the particularities of the current structure by which experiential learning placements are delivered during the course of training to become a pharmacist, it is not currently possible to state the cost of a 10% increase in placements if the number of undergraduate new entrants in pharmacy increased by 10%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500084#WRDD05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Facilities","counter":1677,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500084#WRDD05900"},{"type":"question","counter":1678,"qnumday":592,"qnumall":"[35313\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500084#WRDD06000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of hospitals with catheterisation laboratories; their opening hours; the hospitals in which they are located; the services they provide; and if they are temporary or permanent, broken down by hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1679,"content":"<p>This is a service matter regarding specialist cardiology services.

Taking place within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms, this work encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme; the examination of the options for the financing model for the scheme; and the development of a reformed model of service-delivery.<\/p>  <p>  With the aim of ensuring that all service-users are provided with a standard, high-quality level of care which is safe, effective, and person-centred, it is envisaged that the regulatory framework will comprise: (i) primary legislation for the licensing of public and private home-support providers; (ii) minimum requirements (i.e., regulations); and (iii) HIQA National Standards for Home Support Services.<\/p>  <p>  In April 2021, Government gave approval to draft a General Scheme and Heads of a Bill to establish a licensing framework for home-support providers. This is being progressed by the Department with a view to bringing it through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity. It is expected that the primary legislation will give the Minister for Health the power to make regulations in respect of minimum requirements which will form the criteria against which a provider&rsquo;s eligibility to hold a licence will be determined. A regulatory impact analysis by the Department to ensure effectiveness and mitigate risks has commenced. <\/p>  <p>  In collaboration with HIQA and in consultation with the Health Service Executive and other key informants, the Department developed draft regulations and a targeted stakeholder consultation was undertaken in January 2022. A 6-week public consultation was launched on June 16th in association with the Institute of Public Health (IPA) who will assist with survey testing, data analysis and reporting. A report on the findings of the public consultation will be prepared by the IPA for the Department of Health.\u00a0 Evaluating the survey feedback and the IPA report on the consultation will inform amendments in the draft regulations.<\/p>  <p>  On 24th February, the ESRI published a report on the demand for and cost of home support. This is the final output from a programme of research that the ESRI has undertaken to support the Department of Health to progress the development of the new home support scheme.\u00a0 This research will form an important part of the evidence base for the development of a sustainable funding model for home support services in the context of our ageing population.\u00a0 Government approval will be sought in due course on any proposed legislation to provide for a financial support scheme, taking into consideration the cost associated with the various options.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, work is ongoing in relation to the development of a reformed model of service delivery for the new scheme. As part of this a home support pilot using interRAI assessments is underway in 4 pilot areas (East Westmeath in Community Healthcare Organisation (CHO) 8; Tuam, Athenry and Loughrea in CHO 2; Bandon, Kinsale and Carrigaline in CHO 4; and Ballyfermot and Palmerstown in CHO 7). InterRAI assessments\u00a0will assist in the delivery of a standardised approach to care planning and supports the objective of maintaining clients in the community.<\/p>  <p>  On June 28th\u00a0the Minister of State for Mental Health and Older People, Mary Butler announced the recruitment of 128 interRAI care needs facilitators with a view to having the posts in place by the end of Q3 2022. This will help to progress the national rollout of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs. The interRAI outputs and pilot site evaluation will be critical to the development of the new statutory home-support scheme.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500087#WRGG01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1810,"content":"<p>Question No. 636 answered with Question No. 635.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":1812,"qnumday":637,"qnumall":"[35358\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500087#WRGG01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will outline the work of the pilots rolled out on home support schemes as part of the preparation for a statutory scheme;

As eligibility is still being assessed across sites locally, I cannot provide you with an estimated number of public service workers who are eligible to receive the payment.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>The HSE and the Department are currently examining progressing the rollout to the list of 6 non-HSE\/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision. Rolling out the payment to eligible non-HSE and non-Section 38 employees is a complex task, particularly as these employees are not normally paid by the public health service, duplicate payments need to be avoided, and there are many organisations to be covered. It is hoped that information will be published shortly for those certain non-HSE\/S38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in:<\/p><p>1. Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);<\/p><p>2. Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;<\/p><p>3. Agency roles working in the HSE;<\/p><p>4. Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help \/ home care \/ home support) contracted to the HSE;<\/p><p>5. Redeployed members of the Defence Forces to work in frontline Covid-19 exposed environments for the HSE;<\/p><p>6. Paramedics employed by the Department of Local Government, Housing and Heritage.<\/p><p>As the rollout of payments to the eligible workers highlighted above has not yet begun, and eligibility has not yet been assessed across the private sector, I cannot provide an estimated number of workers who will receive the payment. We expect the rollout to begin shortly and for eligible workers to be paid as soon as possible.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500087#WRGG03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1828,"content":"<p>Question No. 642 answered with Question No. 641.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1829,"content":"<p>Question No. 643 answered with Question No. 641.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1830,"content":"<p>Question No. 644 answered with Question No. 641.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1831,"content":"<p>Question No. 645 answered with Question No. 641.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":1833,"qnumday":646,"qnumall":"[35367\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500087#WRGG03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the method being used to pay directly employed HSE staff the pandemic bonus payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1834,"content":"<p>Firstly I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to all healthcare workers for their efforts during this most challenging period.<\/p>  <p>  As the deputy is aware, on January 19th, the Government announced a COVID-19 pandemic recognition payment for frontline public sector healthcare workers, to recognise their unique role during the pandemic.

There were a lot of valuable lessons learned as the health system deployed the IHI at scale, including the importance of recording mobile numbers, email address and EIRCODE as part of the supporting IHI dataset and the significance of PPSNs as a means for people to readily identify their corresponding IHI number. Indeed the upcoming Health Information Bill will promote the PPSN as the primary identifier for citizens using the health service with the IHI embedded within the healthcare records themselves, as recommended by HIQA. Experience from the pandemic, and the national vaccination programme, has proven that the PPSN (along with name and date of birth) is the simplest way for health service providers to allocate an IHI to a clinical record. PPSNs and photo identification were used to identify users of the national vaccination programme.\u00a0 It provided a robust mechanism of allocating Individual Health Identifiers and subsequently issuing Digital COVID-19 Certificates (DCCs), to all those who received a vaccination.

The implementation of an EHR at CHI follows previous deployment of EHR system in Ireland and builds on the success of the electronic health record programmes at the country&rsquo;s largest maternity hospitals and at St James&rsquo;s Hospital in Dublin. <\/p>  <p>  Since 2022, contracts are also in place for the delivery of clinical management systems capable of delivering electronic health records for patients at the new National Rehabilitation and National Forensics Hospitals. <\/p>  <p>  Also in 2022, market soundings were completed for a suitable patient management systems across the community healthcare setting and a public spending code compliant business case will be developed to secure sanction for investment in this important area.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Maternal and Newborn Clinical Management System (MN-CMS), which generates electronic health records for newborn babies and their mothers, is now well established. It has now been implemented in CUH, University Hospital Kerry, The Rotunda Hospital and National Maternity Hospital, resulting in more than 40% of babies born in Ireland having an EHR created at birth. Approval has been provided for deployment to the Coombe Women&rsquo;s Hospital and the maternity hospital at University Hospital Limerick and these sites are scheduled to go live in 2022 and 2023. This will result in 70% of babies born in Ireland having electronic health records at birth. An approach to the wider deployment of EHRs at national, regional and local level will also be considered in the context of a refreshed eHealth Digital healthcare strategy, due later this year.<\/p>  <p>  The National Integrated Medical Imaging System (NIMIS) captures images digitally for all major modalities at all major acute healthcare settings, which facilitates sharing of these images regardless of where a patient if being treated.<\/p>  <p>  Combined with widespread adoption of practice management systems at GP surgeries and community pharmacy systems, where patient medical information is stored in digital format, and the national digital messaging systems 'Healthlink' for sharing of clinical information, Ireland is certainly in a better position that it was just a few years ago. Nonetheless, sustained investment and focus is required to get to where we need to be, whereby digital records become the norm across the Irish health system, and where systems can share the information more easily so that healthcare professionals can access and update the information they need for the patient they are treating, safely and securely. Based on experience from other countries that have more digitally mature health systems, we expect that will require an ongoing commitment in terms of funding and resources in the short, medium and long term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500088#WRHH05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff","counter":1898,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500088#WRHH05100"},{"type":"question","counter":1899,"qnumday":671,"qnumall":"[35413\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500088#WRHH05200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if there has been progress made on the pay increase due to kitchen staff working in the HSE given that many staff have been waiting several years for the pay increase.","asker":"1613","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1900,"content":"<p>Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the hard work carried out by hospital chefs in the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  As you may be aware, the current Public Service Agreement, Building Momentum, includes the process of Sectoral Bargaining, to address outstanding claims.

In April I requested that the HSE set out the short term, immediate actions to alleviate the current situation in EDs, and ensure the system is best positioned for next winter. I also requested the development of a longer-term programme for reform and improvement of unscheduled care, to ensure that EDs are in a position to cater for expected increases in demand driven by population growth and an aging population.<\/p><p>I met with senior officials from the HSE on a number of occasions, most recently on 23rd June, to discuss the immediate responses required to tackle the pressures currently being faced by all 29 Emergency Departments across the country. I wrote to the HSE on 27th June to request the HSE urgently commence the implementation of the short-term measures identified for each ED.<\/p><p>My Department and the HSE will continue to work together to develop a programme building on these measures with a suite of longer-term actions to deliver systemic change to how unscheduled care is delivered. The overarching aim of this programme is to transform unscheduled care delivery across the full patient flow continuum in a structured, systemised and governed manner which is measurable and sustainable. This programme will adopt a 3-year phased approach. <\/p><p>The programme will be developed according to the &lsquo;Five Fundamentals of Unscheduled Care&rsquo;, which were designed and developed as an integrated framework to support sustainable and scalable unscheduled care improvement in line with the Sl&aacute;intecare vision and goals. The Fundamentals were developed through an international review of published frameworks for improving unscheduled care performance. The five areas of focus are:<\/p><p>- Leadership, Culture and Governance<\/p><p>- Patient Flow at Pre-Admission<\/p><p>- Patient Flow at Post-Admission<\/p><p>- Integrated Community and Hospital Services<\/p><p>- Using Information to support sustainable Performance Improvement.<\/p><p>The patient will be at the centre of all initiatives. This framework follows a robust programmatic approach ensuring a standardised improvement approach is taken nationally while allowing for local bespoke improvement initiatives to be developed and locally owned. Enablers including data, reporting systems and project management will be provided in order to effect and sustain change. The approach is underpinned by the ethos &ndash; &lsquo;clinically led, excellently managed&rsquo;.<\/p><p>I will update the D&aacute;il further as this plan progresses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500091#WRLL01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2040,"qnumday":718,"qnumall":"[35611\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500091#WRLL01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of patients waiting more than 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours and more than 120 hours in an emergency department in 2021 and to the end of May 2022, in tabular form, broken down by month and by hospital and by patients under 65 years and over 65 years;

Following extensive engagement with healthcare unions on the matter, on 19th April\u00a0the HSE published eligibility guidelines and FAQs, as apply to the HSE and Section 38 agencies, which are available on its website:\u00a0www.hse.ie\/eng\/staff\/resources\/hr-circulars\/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html. Payment is currently receiving priority across all Hospital Groups and Community Services in the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE and the Department are currently examining progressing the rollout to the list of 6 non-HSE\/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision. It is hoped that information will be published shortly for those certain non-HSE\/S38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in:<\/p>  <p>  1. Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);<\/p>  <p>  2. Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;<\/p>  <p>  3. Agency roles working in the HSE;<\/p>  <p>  4. Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help \/ home care \/ home support) contracted to the HSE;<\/p>  <p>  5. Redeployed members of the Defence Forces to work in frontline Covid-19 exposed environments for the HSE;<\/p>  <p>  6. Paramedics employed by the Department of Local Government, Housing and Heritage.<\/p>  <p>  The Government\u00a0is mindful of other workers who played their own part during this difficult period in sustaining other services.

This has been enhanced by regular discussions with HIQA, HSE, Private Providers' representative groups and legal expertise assisting with legal text and interpretation of core issues, such as, capacity legislation, employment laws and health and safety issues.

The Programme for Government: Our Shared Future (2020) contained a commitment to examine extending the remit of PAS to residents of long-term residential care facilities. <\/p>  <p>  In February 2021, the original PAS contract was extended, and from June 2021 the service was offered to HSE-operated nursing homes and nursing homes operated under arrangement pursuant to Section 38. <\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year, the National Advocacy Service for People with Disabilities (NAS) was awarded the contract for the next iteration of PAS. This next iteration of the service, commencing from November 2022, will include expansion to private nursing homes. <\/p>  <p>  In advance of the next iteration of PAS, my Department is examining complaints processes across the nursing home sector including key data, information on best practice, the level of standardisation, and the views of key stakeholders including residents and families, with a view to determining the need to develop enablers such as policy, legislative and\/or guidance instruments. In parallel with this work, my Department is also examining whether any legislative amendments will be required to support the rollout of the advocacy service to private nursing homes.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500093#WRNN01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":2164,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500093#WRNN02000"},{"type":"question","counter":2165,"qnumday":760,"qnumall":"[35730\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500093#WRNN02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of children on scoliosis waiting lists, by list and location in January 2019, 2020, 2021 and to date in 2022, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2166,"content":"<p>Reducing waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures remains a commitment of this Government.

A Technical Guidance document has been developed and submitted to the EU Joint Action Steering Committee. A food industry EU-wide technical guidance is being prepared based on the WHO Nutrient Profiling Model, together with an outline on governance and monitoring. A document to encourage food companies and partner organisations to sign up to the Codes will be developed and a register of signatories will be maintained and published by the national monitoring bodies.<\/p>  <p>  A scientific evidence review on voluntary versus mandatory Codes is also being prepared.<\/p>  <p>  A workshop led by Ireland took place in May on Monitoring food advertising: Progress, experiences, challenges and solutions which included a review of global monitoring protocols.

This is having an impact on delivering routine, non-priority developmental screening assessments. This means that the service can no longer carry out Developmental Assessments for 3 month, 9-11months, 21-24 months and 46-48 months in vacant PHN caseloads.<\/p>  <p>  The Dublin West team have implemented a system which enables them to prioritise the screening services and address those needs while the staffing issue is being addressed. There are a number of reasons for the staff shortages:<\/p>  <p>  The Public Health Nursing Sponsorship Programme is currently the only route for recruitment into Public Health Nursing. The PHN Department supports the sponsorship of approx. 6- 8 standard PHNs annually however as per the National PHN Transfer Agreement (2015) PHNs who train apply for a transfer post their 18 months sponsorship. <\/p>  <p>  Since 2015 40 PHNs have transferred. Despite 3 recent cRGN recruitment campaigns the service has been unsuccessful in attracting candidates to the area. Staff retirement and staff moving to take up promotional opportunities have also reduced the number of PHNs in the area.<\/p>  <p>  From 2021 to 2022, 5 PHNs transferred and 5 PHNs commenced working as ADPHNs. This year the PHN Department has applied for standard PHNs and every effort is being made to recruit nurses.  There are 4 PHNs due to qualify in 2022 and these will be assigned to fill vacant PHN areas.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE have confirmed that they will continue to use transfer panels and recruit for Public Health Nurses across the area. The situation is expected to improve in coming months when student PHNs are allocated to the area.<\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2022, the Minister secured annual investment of &euro;195m to enable the continued delivery of the Enhanced Community Care Programme.   This investment is supporting a programmatic and integrated approach to the development of the primary and community care sector.

I am pleased that there has been an overall improvement in compliance in recent years, acknowledging that further improvement is needed.  Together with the Department of Health, I will continue to work closely with both the Commission and the HSE to improve mental health services.   <\/p>  <p>  The report raises a range of issues around the delivery of mental health services. With regards to the issues raised concerning variance in compliance between independent providers and the HSE, the HSE cannot comment on the performance of private organisations. However, there is a significant case mix difference between patients in Private and Public Approved Centres. Additionally, National Community Mental Health Operation office are working closely with CHO4 in relation to compliance issues, most of which are premises related.  CHO4 have a comprehensive capital plan to accelerate the development of new in-patient units, and the national office are working with them to secure funding in this respect.<\/p>  <p>  Importantly, HSE Mental Health Services are committed to the delivery of high quality and safe mental health services. Both the Government and the HSE value the regulation of our mental health services as it provides a framework in which to constantly review and improve our services, so they remain person-centred. The HSE have reviewed the recommendations within the report and are confident that various initiatives currently underway address many of the recommendations made.<\/p>  <p>  The Government and I are committed to improving the quality of mental health services. All aspects of mental health services are being improved and developed, through implementation of our national mental health policy, Sharing the Vision in the short to longer term. Sharing the Vision aims to enhance the provision of mental health services and supports across a broad continuum, from mental health promotion, prevention and early intervention to acute and specialist mental health service delivery, during the period 2020-2030.<\/p>  <p>  The need to build a more accountable and transparent health service is a focus of Sl&aacute;intecare and is also a key objective for Sharing the Vision. Sharing the Vision has a key focus on Accountability and Continuous Improvement as one of the policy&rsquo;s four core domains. This domain focuses on the organisational processes needed to implement and track delivery of the reforms proposed with an emphasis on innovation and continuous improvement. Key recommendations include developing a National Population Mental Health and Mental Health Services Research and Evaluation Strategy and the implementation of a national mental health information system. Additionally, the policy recommends that regular surveys of service users and family, carers and supporters be independently conducted to inform assessments of performance against PIs and target outcomes in Sharing the Vision, that mental health services ensure that the principles set out in the National Healthcare Charter, You and Your Health Service, are embedded in all service delivery and that training be provided for service users and staff on making and dealing with complaints.<\/p>  <p>For the complete list of recommendations to enhance accountability and continuous improvement through the policy implementation, I would direct you to the Sharing the Vision Policy document, and for details on the programme of implementation for the next three years, I would direct you to the Sharing the Vision Implementation Plan 2022 &ndash; 2024, which was published earlier this year.

There are approximately 8,000 known rare diseases; 80% of rare diseases are of genetic origin and are often chronic and life-threatening.  Up to 1 person in 12 in Ireland may have a rare disease at some stage in their life.  Approximately 300,000 persons in Ireland are living with a rare disease.   <\/p>  <p>  Many of the recommendations of the National Rare Disease Plan for Ireland (2014 &ndash; 2018) have already been implemented including the establishment of a National Rare Disease Office (NRDO) and HSE National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases which has now been  operationalised and incorporated into the NRDO which is the main contact point and driver for National HSE rare disease projects and initiatives.   <\/p>  <p>  The National Rare Disease Plan elaborates on Ireland&rsquo;s participation in European Reference Networks (ERN).  ERNs are virtual networks involving healthcare providers across Europe where the networking of knowledge and expertise through reference centres and teams of experts takes place.  These links are emphasized in the Plan to address the care of patients with rare diseases at both National and European levels.  Significant progress has been made with regard to participation in ERNs with Ireland&rsquo;s 15 applications for entry to ERNs recently being approved from 5 academic hospitals. Entry to these networks commenced on 1 January 2022 and represents a significant achievement for the Irish Health Service which will drive innovation, training and clinical research for highly specialised care. It is also a very positive development for individuals and families affected with rare diseases.   <\/p>  <p>  In order to ensure that the input and the voice of the patient is represented in the ongoing work in relation to Rare Diseases, in 2021 I met with the HSE, NRDO and the Rare Diseases Task force which comprises the main rare disease advocacy groups; Rare Disease Ireland (RDI), the Medical Research Charities Group (MRCP), and  the Irish Platform for Patient Organisations, Science and Industry (IPPPOSI). At this meeting priority areas for the future were discussed with a view to building further on the significant progress made to date in implementing the Rare Disease Plan. A number, of priority areas for the coming period were agreed including; patient awareness, European Reference Networks, research and registries, access to services, access to medicines, diagnosis, education, legislation and policy.   <\/p>  <p>  The fundamental challenge that applies to consideration of almost all new medicines in Ireland is their price and affordability in a budget-limited health service. The principal factors in determining the speed of reimbursement are therefore the price at which a manufacturer applies for the reimbursement of a product, the outcome of the HSE&rsquo;s rigorous assessment process as to its clinical and cost-effectiveness, and the availability of Exchequer funding.   <\/p>  <p>  This Government is committed to providing timely access to new and innovative medicines to all patients, including for the treatment of rare diseases, as quickly as possible. Budget 2021 allocated &euro;50 million for the reimbursement of new drugs. This enabled the HSE to approve fifty-two new medicines, nineteen of which were for the treatment of rare diseases. Budget 2022 allocated a further &euro;30 million for the reimbursement of new medicines and as of 26 May the HSE has approved thirty new drugs in 2022,including three for the treatment of rare diseases.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500096#WRQQ03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2364,"qnumday":827,"qnumall":"[36104\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500096#WRQQ03700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"to indicate the incidents of rare diseases reported\/diagnosed in this country in the past five years; the extent to which it has been found possible to offer appropriate medication within a short time; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2365,"content":"<p>As this question relates to service matters, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500096#WRQQ03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2367,"qnumday":828,"qnumall":"[36105\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500096#WRQQ04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the degree to which research continues into rare diseases in this country by means of the highest possible level of scientific research, reference to centres of excellence globally; the extent to which, in Ireland that it is possible for persons suffering from rare diseases to obtain early diagnoses and remuneration as appropriate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2368,"content":"<p>As this question relates to service matters, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500096#WRQQ04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products","counter":2369,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500096#WRQQ04200"},{"type":"question","counter":2370,"qnumday":829,"qnumall":"[36106\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500096#WRQQ04300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the degree to which access to various medicines remains equally available to those in this jurisdiction as compared with the rest of the Single Market in Europe and at a similar price; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2371,"content":"<p>My Department does not collate data on the availability of medicines in Ireland as compared with other European countries.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Oireachtas put in place a robust legal framework, in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, to give full statutory powers to the HSE to assess and make decisions on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines, taking account of a range of objective factors and expert opinion as appropriate.<\/p><p>HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (the NCPE).

There are approximately 8,000 known rare diseases; 80% of rare diseases are of genetic origin and are often chronic and life-threatening.  Up to 1 person in 12 in Ireland may have a rare disease at some stage in their life.  Approximately 300,000 persons in Ireland are living with a rare disease.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the recommendations of the National Rare Disease Plan for Ireland (2014 &ndash; 2018) have already been implemented including the establishment of a National Rare Disease Office (NRDO) and HSE National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases which has now been operationalised and incorporated into the NRDO which is the main contact point and driver for National HSE rare disease projects and initiatives.<\/p>  <p>  The National Rare Disease Plan elaborates on Ireland&rsquo;s participation in European Reference Networks (ERN).  ERNs are virtual networks involving healthcare providers across Europe where the networking of knowledge and expertise through reference centres and teams of experts takes place.

Women&rsquo;s health remains a key priority for the Government and the Department of Health continue to focus on prioritising the care needs of women affected by mesh related complications. <\/p>  <p>  Uro-Gynaecological (Transvaginal) mesh is used in the surgical treatment of Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI) and Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP) in women and such mesh devices have been widely used for this over the past two decades. However, in late 2017, in line with emerging international evidence, concerns were raised at national level regarding the frequency and severity of complications associated with the use of transvaginal mesh devices. The then Minister for Health requested the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) to prepare a report on the clinical and technical issues involved.<\/p>  <p>  In November 2018, the CMO&rsquo;s Report on The Use of Uro-Gynaecological Mesh in Surgical Procedures was published. The Report contains a number of recommendations regarding the safe and effective provision of mesh procedures in urogynaecology and an appropriate response to women who suffer complications as a result of undergoing such procedures. In July 2018, the CMO had asked the HSE to pause all mesh procedures where clinically safe to do so, pending confirmation of the implementation of specific recommendations in the CMO&rsquo;s Report. This pause remains in place.<\/p>  <p>  In April 2019 the HSE published a detailed Implementation Plan to progress the recommendations detailed in this report and the National Women and Infants Health Programme continue to lead on this work for the HSE. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the service provisions and supports in place to support women experiencing mesh related complications, multidisciplinary specialist services for women suffering from mesh complications are available via the HSE National Mesh Complications Service, based at Cork University Hospital (CUMH) and the National Maternity Hospital (NMH) Dublin. This service has been operational since 1st September 2021. There are designated HSE contact points and associated care pathways to ensure that service needs can be identified and provided for and all persons affected by mesh are strongly encouraged to access these services via their clinical consultant.<\/p>  <p>  Trans-labial and transvaginal education and training was carried out in November 2021 by a Consultant Uro-Gynaecologist from Croydon University Hospital in the UK, on site in CUMH. The Mesh Complications Service will have a lead Consultant for this service at the two centres (NMH and CUMH) to facilitate trans-labial scanning.   <\/p>  <p>  The HSE has advised the Department of Health of a Treatment Abroad Scheme protocol for mesh removal, for women with certain defined clinical complexities. This protocol aims to ensure timely access to care under the Treatment Abroad Scheme for this patient group where clinically appropriate.   <\/p>  <p>  A key priority is that all women affected by mesh are offered care. Consequently, women affected by mesh have been strongly encouraged to engage with the relevant HSE contact points and the associated care pathways, to ensure that their service needs can be identified and provided for. Information on this, and a list of contact points, are available on the HSE website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500096#WRQQ05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Healthcare Policy","counter":2380,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500096#WRQQ05300"},{"type":"question","counter":2381,"qnumday":833,"qnumall":"[36114\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500096#WRQQ05400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the degree to which cardiovascular research continues to be made available to the service providers with particular reference to ensuring that adequate provision in terms of financial and staffing supports are made available to those providing such services in the shortest possible time; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2382,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500096#WRQQ05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disease Management","counter":2383,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500096#WRQQ05600"},{"type":"question","counter":2384,"qnumday":834,"qnumall":"[36116\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500096#WRQQ05700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of patients throughout the country allegedly suffering from a rare disease but whose condition remains undiagnosed; if such patients are deemed to be suffering from a rare disease; if a sufficiently coordinated action plan will be put in place to meet their requirements in early date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2385,"content":"<p>As this question relates to service matters, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500096#WRQQ05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":2387,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500097#WRRR00200"},{"type":"question","counter":2388,"qnumday":835,"qnumall":"[36118\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500097#WRRR00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when children under five years will be offered the Covid-19 vaccine; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2389,"content":"<p>The immunisation programme in Ireland is based on the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC).

However, a more comprehensive analysis of the effects of the tax is needed, and the Department thus commenced an evaluation of the measure.<\/p>  <p>  The first step in this process was to look at existing examples that could inform the methodology to assess the impacts of the tax.  This literature review and data scoping exercise enabled the Department to make an assessment of the potential approaches to evaluate the impact of the tax and the timelines and resources required for the evaluation.  The Department has also developed links with researchers who are working on projects relevant to the evaluation topic, which has impacted upon the nature and timeline of the work.

From a policy and budgetary point of view the Deputy may also be interested to note the following progress in areas such as enhancing all aspects of our mental health services and supports remains a key priority for Government. There have been significant improvements in the delivery of our mental health services over the past number of years and the Government is committed to ensuring their continued development throughout this year and into the future. I have outlined in my below response some of the key achievements in mental health in recent years. <\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s clear commitment to enhancing mental health services, is shown by significant mental health funding increases in recent years. I am pleased to have secured an unprecedented level of funding, totalling, &euro;1.149 billion, for mental health in this year&rsquo;s budget. This Budget, which is the largest mental health budget in the history of the state, is supporting the continued implementation of new developments under our national mental health policy, Sharing the Vision, including out of hours supports, CAMHS services, crisis resolution team, the national clinical programmes, and specialist mental health services for older people.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2022 includes an additional &euro;47 million on 2021, comprising &euro;24 million for new developments, &euro;10 million for mental health initiatives in response to Covid and &euro;13 million for existing levels of service. An additional once off &euro;10 million was announced on Budget Day to further support the mental health sector.  <\/p>  <p>  Funding for a number of initiatives has been provided through the additional &euro;10 million An Taoiseach Covid Recovery fund. This includes &euro;2 million for continued enhancement of the HSE Digital Response programme and &euro;0.66 for a collaborative project with Jigsaw to build mental health literacy. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, through the additional once off &euro;10 million announced on Budget Day &euro;1m was provided for MyMind to continue to deliver free of charge counselling sessions, in over 15 languages, to clients impacted negatively by the COVID-19 pandemic. &euro;1m was also provided to Mental Health Ireland to manage a grant scheme on behalf of the Department, to manage a grants scheme for community and voluntary agencies promoting mental health and well-being.<\/p>  <p>  Funding allocated to mental health services in recent years has allowed for the continued investment in the mental health national clinical programmes and models of care, which has led to significant service improvements, including the full implementation of specialist perinatal mental health network provided for and the on-going expansion of specialist mental health teams for eating disorders, ADHD in adults, and dual diagnosis. <\/p>  <p>  Telehealth services are fully established including YourMentalHealth.ie; the information line 1800 111 888, the crisis textline, 50808, and NGO online supports. These include youth specific supports, such as those provided through Jigsaw, SpunOut, and Turn2Me. The majority of telehealth supports are available seven days per week, with some providing 24hour support. In addition, the HSE has partnered with SilverCloud, on a national roll out of digital cognitive behaviour therapy to address depression and anxiety and to make mental health support more widely available.<\/p>  <p>  Importantly, as budgets increase, we need to ensure that we have plans and strategies in place so that those resources are used effectively and efficiently to the benefit of people using our mental health services. All aspects of mental health services are being improved and developed, through Sharing the Vision in the short to longer term. Sharing the Vision aims to enhance the provision of mental health services and supports across a broad continuum, from mental health promotion, prevention, and early intervention to acute and specialist mental health service delivery, during the period 2020-2030. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of implementation and oversight, the National Implementation Monitoring Committee (NIMC) implementation and implementation monitoring structures are well established, enabling policy implementation and governance. The NIMC is made up of the NIMC Steering Committee, supported by a NIMC Reference Group to provide the service user and family member perspective. The establishment of the Reference Group in March 2022 is a key development as it is absolutely vital that people who use our services and their families are at the heart of the design, development and delivery of the systems we build to serve them. <\/p>  <p>  NIMC Specialist Groups, have been established in priority areas of development including Youth Mental Health Transitions, Acute Inpatient Bed Capacity, Women&rsquo;s Mental Health, Primary Care Mental Health Services and Digital Mental Health. <\/p>  <p>  Sharing the Vision Implementation Plan 2022 &ndash; 2024 was published on 23 March 2022.  The Plan sets out individual programme pathways of implementation for each of the 100 policy recommendations for the next three years. Additionally, official reporting has commenced with Status Implementation Reports and NIMC Analysis Documents published on a quarterly basis online. As of Q1 2022, 68 of the 100 recommendations are in implementation, with 51 marked on track.<\/p>  <p>  The implementation of Sharing the Vision will build on existing initiatives already underway, for example in the provision of digital mental health services, the continued phased development and rollout of our national clinical programmes, which are at the heart of service improvement, and the ongoing legislative reform through the review of the Mental Health Act. <\/p>  <p>  In mid-2021, the Government approved a General Scheme of a Bill to amend the Mental Health Act. This General Scheme took into account the 165 recommendations of the Expert Group Review of the Act, the observations of key stakeholders such as the Mental Health Commission and the HSE, the results of a 2021 public consultation wherein 100 submissions were received, changes in domestic legislation, most significantly the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, and Ireland&rsquo;s international commitments, including under the European Convention on Human Rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. <\/p>  <p>  A Mental Health Bill is now being prepared in line with the General Scheme. The Bill will significantly update existing mental health legislation through, inter alia, the introduction of a set of guiding principles for adults and children receiving inpatient treatment, a revised set of criteria for detention, an overhauled approach to consent to admission and treatment, aligning capacity in mental health legislation with the provisions of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, the introduction of a new, discrete Part on the care and treatment of children, and the introduction of additional safeguards for people receiving inpatient mental health treatment. The finalisation and introduction to the Oireachtas of a Mental Health Bill is a priority for the Government and it will be introduced as quickly as possible when drafting concludes, which is expected later this year.<\/p>  <p>  I was very pleased to announce, in November 2020, the extension of Connecting for Life, our national suicide reduction strategy, by four years to 2024. This followed a recommendation from the independent strategy review conducted in 2018. It reflects the many achievements to date and the hard work and dedication of multiple stakeholders. The National Office for Suicide Prevention responsible for the implementation of Connecting for Life and overseen by the Department has a &euro;13 million allocation. The extension and continued implementation of Connecting for Life demonstrates the government&rsquo;s commitment to addressing suicide and self-harm in our communities.<\/p>  <p>  Following the Programme for Government commitment, the interdepartmental High-Level Taskforce was established by Government last year to enhance links for those in contact with the criminal justice system accessing Mental Health, Addiction or Primary Care services. Significant progress has been made by the Taskforce, under the Chair of former Minister Kathleen Lynch, and a Final Report will be published shortly.<\/p>  <p>  As the question also concerns operational matters, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500098#WRSS04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Care Services","counter":2488,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500098#WRSS04300"},{"type":"question","counter":2489,"qnumday":871,"qnumall":"[36238\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500098#WRSS04400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will outline the main improvements in the provision of primary care services since 27 June 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1572","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2490,"content":"<p>The development of primary care services &ndash; alongside social and community care more broadly &ndash; is central to this Government's determination to deliver a high-quality, integrated and cost-effective health care system.<\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2022, the Minister secured annual investment of &euro;195m to enable the continued expansion of primary care services through the Enhanced Community Care (ECC) programme. This level of investment in primary care reform is unprecedented and is intended to address historical capacity deficits in the sector. It forms part of wider efforts to deliver on Sl&aacute;intecare and the promise of care being delivered in the right place at the right time and as close to home as possible.  The ECC programme includes a number of different elements that will bolster primary care services across the country.  Amongst other initiatives, the funding will allow for the rollout of 96 Community Healthcare Networks (CHNs) to be completed and enables the continued development of 30 Community Specialist Teams for Older Persons, and 30 Community Specialist Teams for the Management of Chronic Diseases.<\/p>  <p>  79 of the planned 96 CHNs are now in place.  It is expected that all 96 networks will be operational by the end of this year.19 Community Specialist Teams for Older Persons are now established, with 8 Specialist Teams for Chronic Disease Management already implemented.  Full nationwide coverage by the Community Intervention Teams has been achieved with 21 now operational across the country.<\/p>  <p>  The ECC programme represents a significant expansion in primary care capacity, and will see some 3,500 additional staff recruited overall, with a particular focus on nursing and health and social care professionals.  Some 2,000 staff have been recruited, and approximately 1500 staff will be onboarded by year end. <\/p>  <p>  We will also continue to develop new, state of the art Primary Care Centres (PCCs) to support the provision of the very highest standards of primary care.  There are now 152 PCCs open nationwide, and 19 more are scheduled to become operational over the course of 2022.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, several measures pertaining to General Practice will be implemented or expanded upon in 2022.  The Minister ensured that Budget 2022 provided for the provision of GP care without charges to all children aged 6 and 7.   This is the first stage of the phased expansion of GP care without charges to all children aged 12 years and under.  <\/p>  <p>  The Chronic Disease Management programme, which commenced in 2020 and was modified to facilitate remote reviews during the COVID-19 pandemic, is also being extended in 2022 to all adult GMS patients, while work is ongoing to explore the potential to further enhance the GP Access to Diagnostics programme introduced in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  These investments and reforms are a demonstration of the commitment to shift the model of healthcare towards a more comprehensive and accessible primary care service in order to deliver better care closer to people&rsquo;s home in communities across the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500098#WRSS04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services","counter":2491,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500098#WRSS04600"},{"type":"question","counter":2492,"qnumday":872,"qnumall":"[36239\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500098#WRSS04700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will outline the main improvements in the provision of health services for people with a disability since 27 June 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1572","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2493,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to a service issue, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500098#WRSS04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Care of the Elderly","counter":2494,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500098#WRSS04900"},{"type":"question","counter":2495,"qnumday":873,"qnumall":"[36240\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070500098#WRSS05000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will outline the main improvements in the provision of health services for older people since 27 June 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1572","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2496,"content":"<p>On Monday 20th June 2022, the HSE published its 2021 Annual Report and Annual Financial Statements.  The report and accounts, which is available on the HSE&rsquo;s website highlight the key health and social services, including older persons services provided by the HSE in 2021 out of a budget of &euro;21.643 billion, including funding to non-statutory agencies of &euro;5.691bn.  The 2022 HSE National Service Plan also available on HSE website sets out the type and volume of health and personal social services to be provided by the HSE this year.<\/p><p>The Programme for Government commits the government to &lsquo;Introduce a statutory scheme to support people to live in their own homes, which will provide equitable access to high-quality, regulated home care&rsquo;.  In Budget 2021, I secured additional funding of <b>&euro;150 million<\/b>for home support to progress the development of a reformed model of service delivery to underpin the statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-support services and to provide <b>5 million<\/b>additional hours of home support or more than 25% above the 2020 target.  The funding for these additional hours has been maintained for 2022.<\/p><p>On 27 April 2021, Government gave approval to the Minister for Health to draft a General Scheme and Heads of Bill to establish a licensing framework for home-support providers. The drafting of the Heads of a Bill is at an advanced stage and it is intended to bring this legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity. In tandem to this, draft regulations setting out the minimum requirements a home support provider must meet to obtain a licence are also at an advanced stage. A public consultation on these regulations is ongoing.<\/p><p>Testing of a reformed model of service delivery for home-support has commenced in four pilot sites. Last week, I announced the commencement of the recruitment of 128 Care Needs Facilitator posts to progress the national rollout of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs in the community. It is planned to have these posts in place by the end of Q3 2022. InterRAI standardised outputs will be used to determine prioritisation and levels of care required. A comprehensive and robust operational model for the roll-out of the interRAI has been developed which will facilitate effective, efficient, fair and transparent care needs assessment and planning and appropriate service delivery. A National Home Support Office is in the process of being established. Recruitment to posts to run this new office are at an advanced stage, and office buildings have been sourced.<\/p><p>I am very much aware of the strategic workforce challenges in the home support and nursing homes sector.  I have established a Cross-Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group to examine issues such as recruitment, retention, training, pay and conditions and the career development of front-line carers in home support and nursing homes into the future, so that solutions can be identified and implemented. Ensuring an adequate supply of appropriately skilled healthcare support assistants and healthcare assistants is a key objective of this initiative.  The Group which is currently engaging with key sectoral stakeholders is committed to providing me with a set of recommendations by September.<\/p><p>Day centres are fundamental to the health and well-being of our older population and play a key role in enabling older people to live independently in their own communities and the reopening of these centres are a priority for me. The re-opening of day care centres following their necessary closure in 2020 began in the second half of 2021 and continues into 2022. About 85% of Day Care Services for Older People are open and have resumed service and by the end of 2022 it is expected that 92% of Day Care Centres will have resumed the service.<\/p><p>In 2021 the HSE has commenced the implementation of the Enhanced Community Care programme which aims to deliver increased levels of healthcare with service delivery reoriented towards general practice, primary care, and community-based services. Work continues on the roll-out and establishment of community healthcare networks and community specialist teams for older people and for chronic disease management. The National Integrated Care Programme for Older Persons (ICPOP) forms part of the ECC Programme and seeks to ensure older people with complex care needs can access care quickly, at or near home, through care pathways specifically designed for older people and targeting Frailty, Falls, and Dementia.<\/p><p>The Integrated Care Programme for Older Persons (ICPOP) has worked with acute hospitals and their local community older person&rsquo;s services to develop end-to end care pathways for older people with complex care needs.<\/p><p>A total of 30 ICPOP Community Specialist Teams will be established across the country to deliver on the Sl&aacute;intecare principle of delivering care as close to people&rsquo;s home as appropriate. Each Community Specialist Team will service a population on average of 150,000 across an average of 3 CHNs. The teams will be co-located together in &lsquo;hubs&rsquo; located in or adjacent to Primary Care Centres, reflecting the shift in focus away from the acute hospital towards general practice, a primary care &amp;amp; community-based service model. As of May 2022, 19 of 30 Community Specialist Teams for Older Persons are now established. The full complement of 30 ICPOP teams will be established by Q3 2022<\/p><p>Throughout the pandemic, the overall national response to COVID-19 has had a specific and sustained focus on older persons, and in particular, those resident in nursing homes. This included the establishment of a structured nursing home support system, in line with National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) recommendations, to provide enhanced supports to public and private nursing homes. A comprehensive package of direct and indirect supports was established in early 2020 and many of these remain active across the country to support nursing homes on a proactive basis and to respond in the event of a COVID-19 outbreak.Furthermore, an independent COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel was established in May 2020 to examine the complex issues surrounding the management of COVID-19 in nursing homes. The Expert Panel recommendations have provided a guiding framework not only for the pandemic response in nursing homes over the last two years but also more broadly for a wide-ranging programme of improvement and reform for older persons&rsquo; care, in particular in residential care settings. Four Expert Panel Progress Reports have been published to date, the latest published on the 21st of June 2022. This progress report sets out the progress achieved across the 86 recommendations in the Nursing Homes Expert Panel&rsquo;s report and outlines the plans and structures in place to continue implementation along with details of next steps and timelines. It is available here - www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/c7f5b-covid-19-nursing-homes-expert-panel-report-implementation-oversight-team\/#progress-reports  <\/p><p>The Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Amendment) Act 2021 introduced further safeguards into the NHSS, also known as Fair Deal, to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses. It also introduced a change which extends the three-year cap on contributions to the sale of a personal residence, removing a disincentive against the sale of a property. My Department has also developed an amendment to reduce the rate of at which rental income is assessed under the NHSS, to remove a disincentive to the rental of vacant homes owned by residents in long-term care. This change will be enacted imminently and the legislation will be commenced once appropriate preparations have been made within the HSE to ensure it can be operated effectively and in a way that addresses concerns I have raised in relation to safeguarding, consent and capacity.<\/p><p>Furthermore, if residents wish to make their properties available to house refugees without charge, this will have no impact on their contributions to the scheme. It is also anticipated that the financial contribution for hosting of temporary protection beneficiaries will be exempt from means-testing under the NHSS, once the related legislation, which is currently with the Oireachtas, has been enacted.<\/p><p>My Department is at an advanced stage of developing a national policy on adult safeguarding specifically for the health and social care sector, the policy will cover all public, private, and voluntary settings including private nursing homes. The Department expects in the near future to announce details of a public consultation with the intention of submitting a costed policy to the Government for its approval around the end of 2022. Any required underpinning legislation will be prepared following Government approval of the new policy.<\/p><p>I have long been an advocate for the development of services for people with dementia and their families and this is representative in the focused investment in these supports and services in recent years.

In total, some 179 vessels availed of this scheme at a cost of &euro;10 million.<\/p>  <p>  I introduced this tie-up scheme again last month and it will operate until October or November this year.  To further assist the fishing fleet in these difficult times, I am allowing each vessel to receive aid for 2 months in 2022.  Already, some 67 vessels availed of the scheme for the month of June.  <\/p>  <p>  For the inshore fleet, a Brexit Inshore Fisheries Business Model Adjustment Scheme operated over January to March and was availed of by 754 inshore fishing vessel owners at a cost of &euro;2.5 million.  The scheme provided aid of &euro;2,700 to owners of vessels under 8 metres and &euro;4,000 to owners of vessels of 8 to 18 metres.  Each participant was provided with a suite of 4 training modules to assist them in adjusting their business to the post Brexit environment.  In addition, a Brexit Inshore Marketing Scheme is underway and is investing &euro;600,000 in 2022 in promoting stocks of interest to inshore fishers to support prices at the quayside.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, a &euro;45 million Brexit Processing Capital Support Scheme is open for applications at present, with the aim of supporting the seafood processing sector to engage in transformational change, mitigating the effects of Brexit, and assisting the sector to move further up the supply chain to produce higher value seafood products.  Grants of up to 50% for capital investment are available.  <\/p>  <p>  For coastal communities, a &euro;25 million Brexit Blue Economy Enterprise Development Scheme is open for applications and aims to counter the adverse economic and social consequences of Brexit on businesses operating in the blue economy in our coastal regions.

There are derogations to this access rule, including restrictions on access to Member States' coastal waters.   <\/p>  <p>  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, other than Northern Irish vessels under the Voisinage Agreement, no EU Member State or Third Country has access to our 0-6 nautical miles zone.  France, the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium have access for specific species in various areas of the 6-12 nautical mile zone along Ireland&rsquo;s West, East and South coasts.  Ireland does not have access to any other Member States&rsquo; 6-12 nautical mile zones.<\/p>  <p>  Last year, the European Commission published a proposal to rollover, for another ten years, the provisions relating to the restrictions on access to Member States' 6-12 nautical miles zones, as set out in the Common Fisheries Policy Basic Regulation (Regulation (EU) No. 1380\/2013). <\/p>  <p>  I had sought that this issue be dealt with in the context of the CFP Review.  The matter of access to waters for fishing fleets is a sensitive issue and cannot be looked at in isolation.  However, the Commission views this as a technical amendment.  This means that the proposal is moving ahead of the CFP review process. <\/p>  <p>  I had initially sought to extend Ireland&rsquo;s current exclusive 6 nautical mile zone out to 12 nautical miles and create a new restricted zone between 12nm and 20nm with access for fleets with traditional fishing activity in that zone.  Both of these changes were intended to provide a level playing field for Irish vessels and to enhance the sustainable exploitation of stocks within Ireland's 12 nautical mile zone.<\/p>  <p>  Having carefully considered the concerns of some Member States, and in the spirit of compromise, I removed the request for restricted access to the 12-20nm zone.  However, I continued to argue for an amendment to seek exclusive access to the 12 nautical miles zone around Ireland for our own fishing fleet.  I believe that there is a strong case to be made to increase the protections for Ireland&rsquo;s fishing fleets in these waters, particularly against the background of Brexit.   <\/p>  <p>  I have had ongoing engagement with Commissioner Sinkevicius on this issue.  I have also been engaging  with the French, Belgian, Dutch and German Fisheries Ministers.  In May, I met with the French Fisheries Minister to further discuss my proposal and Ireland's concerns.  France is the most impacted of the four Member States and France currently has the Council Presidency.  On the margins of the May Agriculture and Fisheries Council, I met with the Dutch and German Fisheries Ministers to discuss this matter further.<\/p>  <p>  I highlighted in particular the unacceptable impact of the TCA on our fisheries and the importance of a re-examination and full review of the CFP to ensure a fair,  balanced and equitable policy, and explained the strong case for my proposal in relation to our 12 miles zone.  <\/p>  <p>  Other Member States did not support Ireland's proposal and on 1st June a Council General Approach  on the rollover of the derogations was adopted with only Ireland opposed.<\/p>  <p>  However, Ireland was able to secure an amendment to the text which provides that both the duration and scope of this extension to the derogations may be revised in the framework of any review of the CFP.<\/p>  <p>  The draft Regulation is due to be discussed by the European Parliament's Fisheries Committee later this month.

The scheme is aimed at supporting industry led transformative capital investments that enable the sector to focus on 'creating more from less' in the wake of reduced supply of raw material and at moving enterprises in the sector further up the supply chain to produce higher value products and shift the industry to a focus on secondary processing and beyond to products targeting end-user markets.
