Project Ireland 2040 'Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018-2027' sets out the Government&rsquo;s objectives for capital investment in Ireland&rsquo;s culture, language and heritage. The plan includes a total of &euro;40 million over 10 years from 2018 to 2027 to secure existing investment in arts and culture infrastructure nationwide and ensure a regional balance.  A total of &euro;3.9m was spent on arts and culture infrastructure in 2018.  This level of investment will ensure the upkeep of regional infrastructure right across the country.<\/p>  <p>  The recent Arts and Culture Capital Scheme allocated &euro;10.2 million to 134 projects under three complementary grant streams for the refurbishment and enhancement of the existing arts and culture facilities throughout the country.  Over &euro;7.6m of this funding will be paid out over the coming years.  This is the most significant investment in cultural infrastructure in a decade with funding provided to arts centres, theatres, galleries and museums, artists&rsquo; studios and creative spaces. The list of these projects with the amounts of their allocations is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.<\/p>  <p>  This Scheme is making a huge difference to many individual organisations and we are seeing excellent outcomes and significant positive feedback. My Department is currently giving consideration to new round of grant funding for Arts and Cultural Capital to be announced later this year.<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, the Arts Council in conjunction with local government through the County and City Management Association commissioned an independent, strategic review of the network of venues and arts centres across the country. <\/p>  <p>  The review focusses on the infrastructure of professionally-managed arts buildings that are open to the public throughout the year, and will be used to help develop a coordinated, spatially-informed strategy to support and develop the built infrastructure for the arts.

These Creative Associates are a mixture of practising artists, arts practitioners and teachers with an understanding of creativity and its potential to transform the lives of children and young people.

Initiatives will be developed in collaboration with State partners, National Cultural Institutions, institutions of learning and other stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  - A Community Strand, which will involve a collaborative approach &ndash; similar to that adopted for the 1916 centenary commemorations &ndash; between the State, local authority network and community organisations, including in Northern Ireland where appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  - The Creative Imagination Strand, which will continue to encourage artistic and creative expression in remembrance of the significant historical events of the period from 1919 to 1923 and all of those who lost their lives. <\/p>  <p>  One of my key priorities over the coming months is to advance plans under each of the four strands and build collaborative relationships with key stakeholders, with a particular focus on local authority engagement.  In bringing forward plans to mark the significant historical events that took place between 1919 - 1923, my approach will continue to be informed and supported by the Expert Advisory Group on Centenary Commemorations and developed in consultation with the All-Party Consultation Group on Commemorations.  As matters stand, and in line with the advice of the Expert Advisory Group, there are no State-led commemorative events envisaged for the period to end-June 2020 (12 months time) under the Decade of Centenaries initiative.<\/p>  <p>  On 21 January the centenary of the convening of the First D&aacute;il was commemorated, with a diverse programme, including a ceremonial event, led by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  On 20th January, I represented the Government at a community-led commemoration to mark the centenary of the Soloheadbeg Ambush. I approved a grant allocation of &euro;10,000 to assist Tipperary County Council in supporting the local commemorative committee and wider community in developing their plans for this event, in recognition of the significance of the Soloheadbeg Ambush as the generally accepted first action in the Struggle for Independence.  <\/p>  <p>  I believe that local authorities have a significant role in encouraging appropriate and authentic citizen engagement, debate, and analysis, which is sensitive to the local context. My aim is to provide a supportive structure that ensures that the, often deeply personal, historical events are remembered at county and community level in a respectful, measured, and non-partisan manner<\/p>  <p>  Under the Community Strand of the commemorative programme for the coming period, I am encouraging a collaborative approach &ndash; similar to that adopted for the 1916 centenary commemorations &ndash; between the State, local authority network and community organisations.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I approved a funding allocation of &euro;10,000 for each local authority to support their commemorative programming in 2019.  In recognition of the very important role that local authorities have played to date, and will continue to have, my Department hosted a special Decade of Centenaries forum for the authorities on 13th March.  This event offered an important and timely opportunity to share their learnings to date with each other and also share their views on how they plan to navigate the period ahead.  Funding allocations for local authorities over the coming years will be considered as part of the annual estimates budgetary processes.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that local authorities have already given significant and thoughtful consideration as to how they will plan for commemorations at county and community level in 2019 and over the remainder of the Decade and the authorities have shared their plans for 2019 with my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061200070#WRB04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Arts and Culture Capital Scheme","counter":111,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061200070#WRB04700"},{"type":"question","counter":112,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[24334\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061200070#WRB04800","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the status of the engagement between her Department and Cork County Council regarding repairs to a theatre (details supplied) and the shortfall in funding for the project; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1284","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":113,"content":"<p>The recent Arts and Culture Capital Scheme 2016 - 2018 is focused on the refurbishment and enhancement of the existing stock of arts and culture facilities throughout the country.

Transitional justice is an integral part of the peace process and this marks an important achievement. <\/p>  <p>  However, significant challenges remain, including regarding the safety and reincorporation of former combatants, as well as the protection of human rights defenders, social leaders and activists. In our exchanges with the Colombian Government, Ireland raises regularly reports of violence, threats and intimidation against these groups.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The reincoporation of former combatants, and the ability of human rights defenders and social activistis to safely exercise their rights to freedom of expression and to peaceful assembly, are essential to the successful implementation of the peace accords and to the transition of Colombia to a peaceful, stable, post-conflict society. <\/p>  <p>  Our new Embassy in Bogot&aacute;, which opened earlier this year, regularly meets with all relevant stakeholders, including our multilateral and civil society partners, to discuss the implementation of the peace accords and the human rights situation in the country, and has met with a number of\u00a0former combatants, human rights defenders and social leaders. Having a permanent presence on the ground means we are better equipped to engage on these important issues.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has been, and continues to be, a longstanding and committed supporter of the peace process in Colombia. Ireland has provided over &euro;14 million in funding since 2007, mainly channelled through the United Nations, and Colombian and international NGOs focusing on the areas of human rights, conflict prevention, peacebuilding and supporting livelihoods for rural populations. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland was a founding member of the EU Trust Fund for Colombia and will contribute &euro;3 million over the five-year lifespan of the Fund. The Fund\u00a0finances projects targeted at the marginalised rural areas of Colombia which have been most affected by conflict, and works to support the reconciliation and social and economic reintegration of former combatants.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland also provides funding to the UN Multi-Partner Trust Fund for Colombia, which works to support stabilisation in areas affected by the conflict, towards reincorporation of former combatants, and to support victims and systems of transitional justice, including by working to strengthen the Special Jurisdiction for Peace. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As well as financial support, Ireland has also provided support in the form of lesson sharing based on our own experience of peacebuilding and reconciliation on the island of Ireland. My Department is very pleased to support former T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Eamon Gilmore, in his role as EU Special Envoy to the Colombian peace process, in sharing his experience and insights into the process. Most recently, this month my Department shared lessons from the Northern Ireland peace process with Colombia by engaging with the Government in a series of discussions around the implementation of the peace accords.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Not least among the lessons we have learnt in twenty years of implementation of the Good Friday Agreement is how long it takes to build peace and that it is not a linear process. We have seen how slow and painstaking the work is of building trust between communities and of enabling reconciliation and a culture of trust. <\/p>  <p>  I firmly believe that Colombia&rsquo;s peace accord provides the framework in which the endemic violence and impunity which has afflicted Colombian society for decades can successfully be addressed.

The discussions were informed by a Report, of March 2018 to the Houses of the Oireacthas in accordance with Section 11 of the Public  Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017. A copy of the report and relevant data can be accessed at: .<\/p><p>The Report shows that there has been strong recruitment since 2011 to the estimated 237 recruitment grades across the public service, with over 60,500 new entrants hired. This includes over 16,000 teachers, nearly 5,000 Special Needs Assistants and almost 10,000 nurses. <\/p><p>The report also quantified the cost of a two point adjustment as approximately &euro;200m and the potential benefit to the individual as &euro;3,301 on average. Full restoration in January 2020 would equate to an estimated &euro;200m cost in that year. An adjustment  of one increment in January 2020 and one increment in July 2020 would have the effect of spreading the cost over 2 years, due to carry over costs.  <\/p><p>Since the publication of the Report, my Department, in support of the discussions between the parties,  engaged in further work to assess and model the potential budgetary implications and impacts through phasing of the overall quantum.<\/p><p>Discussions on the issue with public service trade unions and representative associations, commenced in October 2017 and agreement was reached, in September 2018, between the parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement on a measure which provides a credible pathway to addressing the concerns of those recruited to our public service since 2011 in a balanced and sustainable way.  It provides a fair and affordable path to managing the cost associated with the issue.<\/p><p>The cost of this measure as agreed during the remaining term of the PSSA is &euro;75m (&euro;27m in 2019 and &euro;48m in 2020).  The full cost of the measure based on current data and public service numbers (2017) will cost &euro;190m out to 2025. It is estimated some 58% (35,750) of &lsquo;new entrants&rsquo; will benefit from this measure in year 1 rising to 78% (47,750) by year 2. Provision for the additional cost will be provided for in the upcoming budget 2019 and subsequent years.<\/p><p>In general, the agreement provides for two separate interventions which will take place at point 4 and point 8 of pay scales.

The Framework promotes student engagement in the teaching and learning process whereby students become engaged thinkers, active and discerning learners and where digital interactions are respectful and positive and conductive to wellbeing. \u00a0The DLF supports and complements the School Self Evaluation (SSE) process and will allow schools to evaluate their own progress and measure where they stand against benchmarks of effective and highly effective practices in the use of digital technologies in teaching and learning and leadership and management. <\/p><p>Prior to its national dissemination the Digital Learning Framework was trialled in a cross sectoral representation of 50 schools during the 2017\/2018 school year accompanied by an external evaluation conducted by the Education Research Institute (ERC). <\/p><p>The ERC Evaluation Report, available at , concluded that overall the DLF trial was a success.

However the effective use of digital technologies, as outlined in the Digital Learning Framework, will enhance teaching, learning and assessment practices in schools. The use of digital technologies, allows teacher to unlock and deepen learning across all areas including literacy, numeracy, languages, arts education and STEM. The Framework can be used as a planning tool by individual teachers, or groups of teachers to plan, and reflect on, their daily teaching and learning practices at all levels and across all areas of the curriculum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061200072#WRD04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Applications","counter":218,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061200072#WRD04100"},{"type":"question","counter":219,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[24407\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061200072#WRD04200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of an application for a new school building by a school (details supplied) in County Tipperary;

The GIS records the number of primary and post-primary schools within each planning area, the combined enrolments for all of the schools within each area, including total enrolment and enrolment in each class group, together with child benefit data for the 0-4 age group relevant to the area.<\/p>  <p>  The school planning areas are used in the demographic exercise as a basis for the assessment of areas of growth and to inform recommendations on the establishment of any new schools required in that school planning area.  There are no current plans to revise school planning areas.<\/p>  <p>  New schools established to meet demographic demand are required to prioritise enrolments from within the school planning area which the school was established to serve.  This does not preclude schools from enrolling pupils from outside of the designated school planning area, rather it reflects the need to accommodate in the first instance the demographic for which the school was established.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to enrolment generally, it is my Department's responsibility to ensure that schools can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in an area. Parents can choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted. In schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, it may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in their school of first choice.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, a Board of Management may find it necessary to prioritise enrolment of children from particular areas or particular age groups or on the basis of some other criterion. For example, some schools give priority to applicants who have attended a particular primary school (known as a feeder school).  The criteria to be applied by schools in such circumstances are a matter for the schools themselves. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, was signed into law by the President on the 18th July 2018.

In an effort to better understand the communications between all parties concerned, a senior official from the Department spoke to the Coroner on 7 June last.

The Coroner stated that the normal practice where someone is interested in the outcome of a coroner&rsquo;s consideration of whether an inquest will be held into the death of a person is necessary or when a person&rsquo;s remains are to be released for burial, is that a letter would be on file.  In this case a formal request in writing was not recorded on the file and therefore the Coroner arranged for the appropriate and dignified burial of the deceased, through the relevant State agencies, as is the standard practice where next of kin have not been identified, despite efforts to do so.<\/p>  <p>  While thankfully, the occurrences of deaths where the deceased remains unidentified, unclaimed or no next of kin is identified, are very rare, the Department will take appropriate action to ensure that formal requests are made in future so that friends and groups, who have expressed an interest, are properly informed through appropriate communications with the coronial service and by liaising with other agencies involved in this case.<\/p>  <p>   The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) supported the organisation of a memorial for the person concerned, which was held shortly after her passing and was attended by her friends, centre management and members of staff from RIA.

When combined with HSE activity, it is projected that the NTPF will be in a position to offer treatment to all clinically suitable patients waiting more than 6 months for one of these high-volume procedures.<\/p><p>A key element of the Plan is the stabilisation of the Outpatient Waiting List. Under the Plan the HSE, in line with the National Service Plan, will aim to deliver 3.3 million outpatient appointments, of which approximately 1 million will be first appointments. Under the plan the NTPF will use &euro;6 million to deliver 40,000 first Outpatient appointments.<\/p><p>The plan includes a target that the number of patients waiting for a first Outpatient appointment will fall from over 516,000 at the end of 2018 to under 509,000 by the end of 2019. This target takes into account the more than 800,000 new patients who will be added to the Outpatient waiting list in 2019; a figure that is based on trends for the previous two years. <\/p><p>While the meeting of short-term targets is always welcome, more can be achieved and, in this regard, the HSE, Department of Health and NTPF, under the Access Plan, will work together with the objective of developing medium-long term improvement initiatives for patient access to hospital procedures.

Last year saw considerable improvement in the number of patients waiting for procedures. As a result of increased activity and the ongoing collaboration between the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF), the number of patients waiting for an Inpatient or Day case procedure fell to 70,204 in December 2018, from a peak of 86,100 in July 2017. This represents a reduction of over 18% in the overall number of patients waiting for a procedure. The number of patients waiting more than 3 months fell by more than 17,700, or 31% in the same period from July 2017 to the end of December 2018.<\/p><p>The impact is particularly notable when one considers the improvements to the Waiting Lists for those particular specialties which were the focus of the Inpatient\/Daycase Action Plan in 2018. These include the numbers waiting over 3 months for a Cataract procedure which fell by 55% from July 2017 to the end of December 2018; the numbers waiting 3 months for a tonsillectomy fell by 65% in the same period; and angiograms fell by 50%.<\/p><p>Budget 2019 announced that the Government had further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the NTPF increasing from &euro;55 million in 2018 to &euro;75 million in 2019. The joint Department of Health, HSE, and NTPF Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published on 11th March. <\/p><p>Under the Plan the HSE, in line with the National Service Plan, will deliver 1.155 million elective inpatient and day case discharges at a value of &euro;1.4 billion in 2019. The Scheduled Care Access Plan includes:<\/p><p>- detailed plans from the NTPF to fund 25,000 IPDC treatments; 5,000 Gastro Intestinal Scopes and 40,000 first outpatient appointments.<\/p><p>- Projections by year end to reduce the overall number of patients on the Inpatient\/Day Case waiting list (excluding GI scopes) from just over 70,200 in Dec 2018 to under 60,000;<\/p><p>- Within this overall reduction the number of patients waiting longer than 3 months will reduce from 40,200 at the end of 2018 to 31,000;<\/p><p>- It is also projected that for ten identified high volume procedures, including tonsillectomies, all clinically suitable patients waiting more than 6 months will be offered treatment in 2019. These 10 procedures account for over a third of the active inpatient day case waiting list and represent 60% of NTPF planned activity in 2019.<\/p><p>A key element of the Scheduled Access Plan is the stabilisation of the Outpatient Waiting List. Under the Plan the HSE, in line with the National Service Plan, will aim to deliver 3.3 million outpatient appointments, of which approximately 1 million will be first appointments. <\/p><p>The plan also includes a target that the number of patients waiting for a first Outpatient appointment will fall from over 516,000 at the end of 2018 to under 509,000 by the end of 2019. This target takes into account the more than 800,000 new patients who will be added to the Outpatient waiting list in 2019; a figure that is based on trends for the previous two years. <\/p><p>While the meeting of short-term targets is always welcome, more can be achieved and, in this regard, the HSE, Department of Health and NTPF, under the Access Plan, will work together with the objective of developing medium-long term improvement initiatives for patient access to hospital procedures. This will include moving care to more appropriate settings and providing care at the lowest level of complexity such as providing ophthalmology in the community; maximising the use of Advanced Nurse Practitioner led clinics; and physiotherapists to manage orthopaedic clinics.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061200074#WRF04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":357,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061200074#WRF04600"},{"type":"question","counter":358,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[24375\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061200074#WRF04700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the details of the cost cutting plans by University Hospital Waterford to ensure the hospital comes in on budget; if this will involve curtailing theatre use at the hospital; the cost saving measures being introduced in respect of cleaning, recruitment and the use of agency staff; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1258","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":359,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to you directly as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061200074#WRF04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services Data","counter":360,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061200074#WRF04900"},{"type":"question","counter":361,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[24380\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061200074#WRF05000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of assaults recorded against psychiatric nurses to date in 2019, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":362,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061200074#WRF05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Respite Care Services Data","counter":363,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061200074#WRF05200"},{"type":"question","counter":364,"qnumday":160,"qnumall":"[24381\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061200074#WRF05300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of respite care sessions provided in 2018 compared to 2019, by CHO and LHO in tabular form.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":365,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

Approximately 112,000 consultations were provided by GPs, and 57,810 early repeat smear tests were provided between 01 May and 31 December &ndash; in other words, about half of the consultations resulted in a smear test.<\/p>  <p>  Laboratory turnaround times have increased since that time, as a consequence both of the out of cycle smears and the increased uptake generally. While a backlog of around 80,000 smears had built up, this has now begun to fall, and is reported by the HSE to be down to around 54,474 as of 9 June. The programme should typically have approximately 23,000 samples in process at any one time. The HSE reports that more than half of tests are being returned within 8 weeks. However, they can take as long as 30 weeks, and this remains a significant challenge. <\/p>  <p>  Since 1 May, Medlab Pathologies Ltd, which has the largest backlog, has ceased accepting new slides and is focused on clearing its backlog. Agreement has also been reached with Medlab to process tests based on a HPV initial testing model; i.e. HPV testing will be carried out on samples prior to cytology. The HSE advises that this approach was chosen as the most effective way to process all outstanding tests based on prioritising women most at risk. Additionally, CervicalCheck has agreed with laboratories to prioritise those slides which originate from women who attended colposcopy, as this cohort of women are considered to have the most serious need.<\/p>  <p>  However, the HSE has advised that the natural history of cervical cancer would indicate that the disease would normally develop over a period of 10 to 15 years. It has said that in this context, a delay in the return of cervical screening results, whilst undesirable, poses a very low risk to women.<\/p>  <p>  Following a global search for capacity, Quest Diagnostics was identified by the HSE as offering the necessary additional capacity to replace that previously provided by Medlab, given it has ceased to accept new slides. Agreement has now been reached and a contract has been signed for this additional capacity. This agreement comes after an extensive quality assurance review of existing and new capacity to ensure that it meets the requisite standards.  The HSE advises that Quest, working alongside the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital (CWIUH) provides the necessary capacity to allow the CervicalCheck programme continue until the introduction of HPV primary screening. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the specific data requested on waiting times and number of smear tests by laboratory, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061200075#WRG02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Care of the Elderly","counter":414,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061200075#WRG03000"},{"type":"question","counter":415,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[24428\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061200075#WRG03100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of Belmullet District Hospital; the number of beds due to be closed; the reason for same; his plans for the hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1336","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":416,"qnumday":184,"qnumall":"[24435\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061200075#WRG03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons awaiting home help hours in County Mayo; the length of time they have been on the waiting list; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1336","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":417,"qnumday":186,"qnumall":"[24445\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061200075#WRG03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the home help scheme; if it is being closed to new entrants; if so, the reason therefor; the support that will be put in place for persons and families in need of home care supports; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1336","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":418,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 178, 184 and 186 together.<\/p>  <p>  Homecare is an important support that enables older people to remain in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.

When combined with HSE activity, it is projected that the NTPF will be in a position to offer treatment to all clinically suitable patients waiting more than 6 months for one of these high-volume procedures.<\/p><p>The latest published National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) figures for the end of April show that the Saolta University Health Care Group IPDC waiting list has decreased by 17% (-3,271) when compared to the same period last year. 70% (11,464) of patients on the Saolta IPDC waiting list are waiting 9 months or less and 80% (13,049) are waiting 12 months or less.\u00a0 In terms of long waiters, the number of patients waiting over 12 months has decreased by 17% (-652) when compared to the same period last year.<\/p><p>The information requested by the deputy is outlined in the table. <\/p><p><b>Saolta Group IPDC Waiting Times<\/b><table><tr><th>Letterkenny University Hospital<\/th><th>879<\/th><th>475<\/th><th>229<\/th><th>105<\/th><th>46<\/th><th>24<\/th><th>40<\/th><th>21<\/th><th>1<\/th><th>----<\/th><th>1820<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Galway University Hospitals<\/td><td>2759<\/td><td>1770<\/td><td>1207<\/td><td>947<\/td><td>568<\/td><td>317<\/td><td>499<\/td><td>494<\/td><td>106<\/td><td>20<\/td><td>8687<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo University Hospital<\/td><td>1021<\/td><td>659<\/td><td>373<\/td><td>223<\/td><td>166<\/td><td>106<\/td><td>166<\/td><td>138<\/td><td>16<\/td><td><\/td><td>2868<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mayo University Hospital<\/td><td>648<\/td><td>447<\/td><td>322<\/td><td>253<\/td><td>188<\/td><td>120<\/td><td>94<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>4<\/td><td><\/td><td>2086<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Portiuncula University Hospital<\/td><td>143<\/td><td>44<\/td><td>38<\/td><td>33<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>276<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Roscommon University Hospital<\/td><td>198<\/td><td>163<\/td><td>89<\/td><td>24<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>18<\/td><td>25<\/td><td>19<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>550<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>5648<\/td><td>3558<\/td><td>2258<\/td><td>1585<\/td><td>998<\/td><td>587<\/td><td>824<\/td><td>682<\/td><td>127<\/td><td>20<\/td><td>16287<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061200075#WRG04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":434,"content":"<p>Question No. 184 answered with Question No. 178.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Home Services","counter":435,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061200075#WRG05100"},{"type":"question","counter":436,"qnumday":185,"qnumall":"[24440\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061200075#WRG05200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason a nursing home in Kilcoole, County Wicklow, is still empty almost a year after completion;

These include the 117% increase in investment over the last 4 budgets that has supported services to operate at optimal capacity and has provided additional capitation for early learning and care programmes, including a 7% rise in September 2018 in the ECCE capitation rate. Measures also include the introduction for the first time of an annual Programme Support Payment to recognise the administrative roles that services play; this totals &euro;21.4m in 2019. I have also continued to provide a higher rate of capitation payment for graduate-led pre-school rooms, to encourage the attraction and retention of Early Learning and Care graduates, and in 2017 I introduced a higher capitation payment for services that employ a qualified Inclusion Coordinator as part of the AIM programme. In addition, last year I introduced a pilot measure for funding services whose staff take part in continuing professional development, and I extended the pilot this year to include the new 'Aistear and Play' CPD programme implemented by Better Start. I hope to build on this pilot further over the years to come, following an evaluation.<\/p>  <p>  I have encouraged providers to use such additional funding to support, wherever possible, improved pay and conditions of the hard-working frontline staff that make such a lasting difference to children's lives.<\/p>  <p>  Within First 5, there is a commitment to develop a Workforce Development Plan which will ensure appropriate levels of ELC and SAC staff at all levels in the sector. The Workforce Development Plan, which will involve close collaboration between the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Education and Skills, will be developed in two stages. Stage 1 (for completion by Q2 of 2020) will involve preparation of a core report that sets out: a high-level vision for the ELC and SAC workforce for the period 2020-2028, and a pathway for achieving the commitments set out in First 5 in relation to development of the ELC and SAC workforce. Stage 2, which should be completed by Q2 of 2021, will involve completion of implementation plans by working groups to be specified in Stage 1.<\/p>  <p>  The most recent sector profile published by Pobal indicates that in mid-2018 the average hourly wage of staff working directly with children in the early years sector was &euro;12.17. The average wage increased by 24 cent or 2% on the previous year. Data from Pobal indicates that approx. 55% of staff\u00a0earned less than &euro;11.90 per hour in mid-2018.<\/p>  <p>  In general, staff in management and leadership roles earn the highest hourly wage with centre managers earning &euro;14.99 and deputy managers &euro;13.49 per hour. These are followed by room leaders (both ECCE and non-ECCE) at an average hourly wage of &euro;12.44. The average hourly rate for early years assistants (both ECCE and non-ECCE), who constitute 48% of all staff working directly with children, is &euro;11.20 per hour. Relief staff are paid the lowest hourly wage, at &euro;10.77.

The guidelines provide for planning permission for specific BTR developments to be sought from a planning authority. Where such a planning permission is sought the proposed development must also include the provision of dedicated amenities and facilities specifically for residents in\u00a0terms of communal recreational space, work spaces and cooking\/dining facilities as well as a range of other support services such as laundry facilities, concierge and management, or repair and maintenance.\u00a0 BTR projects are subject to Part V obligations and developers must engage with the planning authorities to mutually agree on the best way to discharge this obligation. <\/p>  <p>  Shared Accommodation projects are professionally managed rental accommodation arranged around individual rooms, rather than apartment units, within an overall development that includes access to shared or communal facilities and amenities dedicated for use by residents only. This distinct accommodation type can be compatible with the dynamics in the urban employment market &ndash; for example, their use by new employees arriving in urban areas and seeking short term accommodation during an establishment or local acclimatisation period that may be longer than a few weeks. Shared Accommodation may also be used innovatively to provide accommodation within protected structures in order to ensure their long term rehabilitation and to address sensitive architectural constraints of protected building. <\/p>  <p>  Due to the distinct nature and features of Shared Accommodation type development, it is only appropriate where responding to an identified urban housing need at particular locations. In this regard the obligation is on the proposer of a shared accommodation scheme to demonstrate to the planning authority that their proposal is based on accommodation need and to provide a satisfactory evidential base accordingly. <\/p>  <p>  Shared accommodation units are not normally\u00a0 subject to Part V requirements because such developments would not be suitable for social housing given that they are not provided as individual self-contained residential units.<\/p>  <p>  While I am satisfied that the Guidelines as issued are robust, given the relatively new nature of this form of accommodation, my\u00a0Department will monitor this emerging sector and may issue further additional technical updates to this document as appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061200078#WRK00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Loan Scheme","counter":604,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061200078#WRK00600"},{"type":"question","counter":605,"qnumday":245,"qnumall":"[24548\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061200078#WRK00700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the options available to a couple who apply for the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme in circumstances in which one of the married persons is employed and earning a wage and therefore eligible to apply and the other is self-employed since May 2017 with tax returns completed, but not certified for a period of two years; if they can be approved for the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme with particular reference to the fact that they can demonstrate that they have been paying a rent of over &euro;1,700 a month for a period of two and a half years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":606,"content":"<p>The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan was made available\u00a0from 1 February 2018.\u00a0 The loan enables credit worthy first time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties.

The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including relevant structures on the Record of Protected Structures.  Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.<\/p>  <p>  I also have a role, as Minister, as a prescribed body under the Planning and Development Regulations 2001-2015 whereby development proposals that may impact on our built heritage are referred by planning authorities to my Department so that recommendations can be made, as appropriate, to avoid or mitigate any such impacts.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has a number of measures at its disposal to facilitate the maintenance and restoration of historical or cultural sites.  As Minister, I am the owner or guardian under the National Monuments Acts 1930-2014 of approximately 1,000 national monuments located at approximately 750 sites and in such cases there is a statutory duty to maintain the national monument.  Such maintenance is undertaken by the Office of Public Works (OPW).  Local authorities are responsible under the National Monuments Acts for maintaining the national monuments of which they are owners or guardians. <\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service works in close collaboration with the OPW on survey, excavation and research work to optimise the protection, management, interpretation and presentation of national monuments in State care. <\/p>  <p>  The National Monuments Service of my Department provides archaeological advice to the OPW on a routine basis and also with regard to the OPW Flood Relief Scheme, to ensure the appropriate protection of archaeology in the context of flood relief. All works at or in the vicinity of a national monument &ndash; to include any works to mitigate water damage - are required to be notified to the Department, which ensures that appropriate controls are put in place for the protection of the site. <\/p>  <p>  Officials of my Department meet regularly with their OPW counterparts to devise and agree shared policy approaches to areas of mutual interest, to review operational priorities while also working closely together on a day-to-day basis in relation to individual projects.<\/p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the National Monuments Acts, my Department has established and maintains the Record of Monuments and Places, which affords legal protection to all recorded archaeological sites and monuments in the State.  Anyone proposing works to, at or in the vicinity of a monument that is included in the Record of Monument and Places must give the Department two months prior notice before works can start.<\/p>  <p>  My Department also provides financial support for the protection of heritage buildings and historic structures through the Built Heritage Investment Scheme (BHIS) and the Historic Structures Fund (HSF), both administered by local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  The Built Heritage Investment Scheme is a scheme for the repair and conservation of structures that are on the local authority Record of Protected Structures. It is designed to leverage private capital for investment in small scale conservation projects across the country and to support the employment of skilled conservation professionals.  The Historic Structures Fund 2019 is for conservation and enhancement to heritage structures and historic buildings, in both private and public ownership, for the benefit of communities and the public. <\/p>  <p>  On 28 March, I announced funding of &euro;4.3 million to 478 projects under these schemes, of which &euro;104,000 was awarded to projects in County Kildare. <\/p>  <p>  Receipt of applications for both the Built Heritage Investment Scheme and the Historic Structures Fund is now closed, however on-going queries can be addressed to all respective local authorities who implement both schemes.<\/p>  <p>  The National Inventory of Architectural Heritage is a state initiative to identify, record, and evaluate the post-1700 built heritage of Ireland, uniformly and consistently as an aid to its protection and conservation. The NIAH building surveys provide the basis for my recommendations, as Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, to the planning authorities for the inclusion of particular structures in their Record of Protected Structures. The published surveys are a source of information on the selected structures for relevant planning authorities.  They are also a research and educational resource.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061200078#WRK03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Archaeological Sites","counter":635,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061200078#WRK03700"},{"type":"question","counter":636,"qnumday":255,"qnumall":"[24552\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061200078#WRK03800","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"her plans for archaeological excavation of historical sites that have not been investigated to date with particular reference to encouragement of local interest in such projects from both a tourism and archaeological point of view; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":637,"content":"<p>My function as Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in relation to archaeological excavation is to regulate this activity through the licensing system\u00a0under section 26 of the National Monuments Act 1930, as amended.

Heritage Ireland 2030 will support local communities in caring for their heritage and will also\u00a0recognise the increasingly important role that local authorities play in protecting and managing heritage for the enjoyment and benefit of all. It will help ensure Ireland's heritage management structures meet modern requirements and comply with EU and international obligations. It will promote greater appreciation and understanding of the immense intrinsic value of Ireland's rich heritage including its natural and built heritage resources and highlight heritage as a valuable amenity for communities, farming, business and tourism.

Screen Ireland is the national development agency for Irish film making and the Irish film, television and animation industry.\u00a0 Its statutory remit is to assist and encourage the making of film in the State and the development of a film industry in Ireland.\u00a0 Screen Ireland supports writers, directors and production companies across these sectors by providing investment loans for the development, production and distribution of film, television and animation projects. It has a vision for a vibrant, creative and sustainable Irish film, television and animation industry, with diverse voices, talent and opportunities which speaks to and connects Irish film culture with audiences at home and abroad. <\/p>  <p>  Screen Ireland also works in conjunction with the enterprise agencies to support the development of the film sector to make a substantial contribution to inward investment. It promotes Ireland as a location for international production by providing advice and support for international companies seeking to locate production activity to Ireland, organising inward and outward trade missions on an annual basis and working in partnership with EU counterparts on co-productions.<\/p>  <p>  Government policy also supports the sector through Section 481 tax relief, international film co-production treaties, an annual international programme of Irish film festivals, and through engaging high-profile talent to project a positive image of Ireland and reflect Ireland as a creative place.<\/p>  <p>  In April 2018, I joined with the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, in launching my Department&rsquo;s capital investment plan: 'Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018 &ndash; 2027&rsquo;. This plan incorporated an amount of &euro;200m to be invested in media production and the audiovisual industry over the next 10 years and represented a first step in the Government&rsquo;s ambitions to enable Ireland to become a global hub for the production of film, TV drama and animation. The investment will be delivered through Screen Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The Audiovisual Action Plan under Pillar 4 of the Creative Ireland programme is designed to deliver on ambitions to make Ireland a leader in the audiovisual sector. It is underpinned by the Olsberg SPI with Nordicity Report which has set recommendations that will assist in attracting greater inward investment.\u00a0 A number of important recommendations that will have benefits in terms of attracting international productions have already been delivered upon, including the announcement in the budget speech in October last that the Section 481 tax relief for the film industry would be extended beyond its 2020 deadline to 2024; the additional funding I secured for Screen Ireland in Budget 2019; and the signing of the revised European Convention on Cinematographic Co-Production in May 2019 following the efforts of my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061200078#WRK05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"}]
