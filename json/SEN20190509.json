It was pointed out in the course of that debate that the assumption that somebody had applied in the past and had been recommended would not of itself justify the provision unless that person still wanted to be appointed to the position for which he or she had previously applied, and for which he or she had been previously recommended.  In light of that discussion we have tendered a new section, section 49, to the Bill.  The new section reads: &quot;Where the Commission has in the previous three years recommended the appointment of any person to any type of judicial office, that person shall for the purposes of this Act also be deemed to be recommended to any judicial office of the same type except when the person has notified the Commission or the secretary to the Government that he or she no longer wishes to be considered for appointment to such an office.&quot;  In my view this is a perfectly reasonable thing.  The provision would hugely enhance the proper operation of this legislation were it, by any mischance, to be enacted.  I say this because if somebody has been shortlisted in the previous three years and has been recommended to the Government for appointment to a particular position there should be no question whatsoever of their being publicly deemed to be a non-recommended person if the Government receives a different shortlist that does not contain his or her name within a short period of time of three years.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Let us consider the case of, for example, a High Court judge who is successful in applying to the commission and is included on the shortlist of three that went to the Government.  In the meantime, one of the other people on that shortlist might be appointed and this would mean that there would be two people who would not be appointed and who would be disappointed as a result.  It seems strange that where another position arose within six months or a year, the Government could not say that the commission had recommended those two individuals for appointment to fill a similar vacancy and that, while it was disposed to appoint another candidate, they were not merely also-rans but were suitable for the job.  It is also strange that those two individuals should somehow disappear off the list from which the Government would be expected to make its selection.<\/p><p>The arguments against such a provision are completely empty and specious.  What harm could this amendment do?  It could not create a situation whereby someone who was willing to be appointed would be given the position in unfortunate circumstances.  This raises another question: is someone in that position, for example, a judge of the High Court, expected to continually reapply?  Are people to be interviewed in respect of each appointment?  Are they to be asked different questions?  Are they to be asked if there is anything since they last applied for recommendation to the Government which should case the commission to take a negative view of his or her application?  Is something of that nature envisaged?  I am worried about the consequences if the commission is putting up a shortlist which is influenced by considerations such as gender.  If the Government decides to appoint a female judge, will the next list also be the subject of gender influence such that the two males who were disappointed candidates on the previous occasion might be-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019050900002#D00300","speaker":"1403","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557405000,"counter":37,"content":"<p>The new requirement for a quorum is that six Members, as opposed to 12, need to be present.

There is no valid reason that somebody who was recommended in the short period prior to a similar vacancy arising could not be deemed to be suitable for appointment.  Earlier, I was giving the example where there might be a shortlist consisting of one female and two males, where the Government appoints the female to fill a vacancy and where, in a short period, the commission is obliged to consider candidates for another vacancy of the same type.  In that case, because of its mandate to try to seek gender balance, the commission might nominate two females and one male.  One male might just be dropped from the list as a result of the commission attempting to achieve gender balance, he might just fall off the shelf, as it were, and not be further recommended.  That seems contrary to the spirit of the legislation, which is that if, within a reasonably short period such as three years - which the Minister agreed is reasonable- a person is deemed suitable, why should the Government not decide, in circumstances where the previous decision between the two candidates was quite narrow and one is now gone, that it might remedy matters by appointing the person to whom, after the successful candidate, it was most favourably disposed on the previous occasion?  From that perspective, I can see no harm arising from this amendment and I invite the Minister to point out any such harm if he can identify it.  Given that we have altered matters to allow persons who are no longer interested to indicate this to the Government, and effectively put themselves out of the reach of the section, no harm can come from accepting the amendment but a good deal of practical benefit can certainly be derived from doing so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019050900002#E01000","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1557405000,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I hope the Minister will look favourably on this amendment.

The problem with section 49, as it has come to us, is that if it is left in its present state, it will state:<\/p><blockquote>Within 30 days after the end of each year, the Minister shall cause to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas a statement of appointments to judicial office made by the President during the previous year (not being appointments made before the commencement of this section) and that statement shall include&mdash;(a) the name of each appointee and the judicial office to which he or she was appointed,<br \/><br \/>(b) particulars of the education, professional qualifications and experience of each appointee, and<br \/><br \/>(c) if it be the case in relation to a particular appointee, a statement that the appointee's name was&mdash;<blockquote>(i) recommended by the Commission to the Minister in accordance with the provisions of this Act, or<br \/><br \/>(ii) recommended to the Government under <i>section 44<\/i>.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote> <p>I will not repeat what I had to say earlier about section 44.  However, if this is to be the law, that the Minister is to lay a report before the Houses of the Oireachtas every year stating who he has appointed to various positions, giving details of their suitability and the like, it raises the question as to why the Minister is being asked to do this.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->If each House of the Oireachtas is not entitled to consider the report that has been put before it and is not entitled to debate it in some shape or form then the purpose of the report seems to me to be entirely non-existent.  If, on the other hand, it is anticipated that, I do not know, the justice committee of each or both Houses or the entire Chamber in each or both Houses should be free to debate the report of the Minister under this section, then that raises the very significant issue of what purpose such a debate could actually have.  Are people to say, &quot;Why did you appoint so and so as I do not think much of her or his [to keep Senator Norris happy] educational qualifications?&quot;  Is this information just simply to be put out there and never commented on?  Is it to be put out there so that the media can comment on same or is it to be the subject of debate and consideration by the Houses of the Oireachtas?  For the life of me I cannot see any useful purpose in having such a report or debate.  It would tend to embarrass and politicise the Judiciary.  It would tend to, if there were negative criticism of the actual appointment made, undermine public confidence in the appointments which were made.  I do not see how it could advance anything in particular except, perhaps, some people might make the point that there were not sufficient members of each or either gender appointed, or people from a diverse background.  All of that can be gauged by looking at <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il<\/i>.  There is no need for a report of this kind.  I do not know whether I am right or wrong and perhaps the Minister will inform me because I have not had the opportunity this afternoon to go back over the D&aacute;il record in terms of this legislation.  Is this an original part of the legislation or something that was brought in when Committee Stage was considered by the Select Committee on Justice and Equality or when Report Stage was considered in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann?  I do not see why section 49 should be part of the Bill.  It is for that reason that I think the amendment put forward by us stating, &quot;The Government shall not be obliged to publish the names of persons who have not been appointed to judicial office&quot;, should be substituted for section 49.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019050900002#F03700","speaker":"1403","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557405000,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I seek guidance from the Chair, which can come from Senator McDowell via the Chair if he likes.

It serves no useful purpose and that is why I am opposed to it.  The reason the amendment we are discussing has been proposed is in order that the legislation will stipulate that &quot;The Government shall not be obliged to publish the names of persons who have not been appointed to judicial office following their recommendation by the Commission.  In other words, it will in no way be obliged to publish the names of unsuccessful candidates.  The amendment also states, &quot;Nothing in this section shall prevent the Commission from informing persons who have applied to it to be recommended for appointment to judicial office whether such persons have been recommended by the Commission to the Government for such appointment.&quot;  The proposed new section 49(1) is intended to be inserted in substitution for the entirety of the existing section 49 and not merely the final two subsections, which, as Senator Norris stated, are clearly obnoxious and could only result in grave unhappiness and issues relating to the separation of powers.<\/p><p>I have made the following point in newspaper articles but I will make it again for the record of the House.  It is the Government alone that takes responsibility for appointments to the superior courts.  It is the Government's decision alone to recommend to the President that a particular person should be appointed.  It is a decision which it has to make by reference to criteria which are perfectly sound such as whether, for example, someone is a notorious conservative or notoriously radical liberal.  These are issues the Government is entitled to take into account.  As I read it, however, the criteria which will be set out in the remainder of the legislation will never make reference to matters such as the outlook of the person in question, his or her history in deciding cases or any articles he or she may have written as a lawyer or as a person involved in public affairs.  Those are the kinds of issues the Government could and should take into account, particularly if they are relevant to an appointment, but they are also the issues that the commission is not entitled to take into account as far as I can see.  A point made to me by an individual I met related to one of the so-called pillars of this legislation, namely, that appointments should be made on merit.  There are two qualifications on gender balance and representation of society as a whole.  Merit is not a term of art or science.  If one is to say someone is to be appointed on merit, is a conservative more meritorious than a liberal?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019050900002#H00300","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1557405000,"counter":115,"content":"<p>Surely not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019050900002#H00400","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1557405000,"counter":116,"content":"<p>Perhaps he or she is.

It might decide that Mr. Justice Michael McDowell was a very heavy sentencer in the criminal courts and that it was a good thing to have him in the Court of Appeal to bring a bit of rigour to sentencing law.  It might think the exact opposite and that someone much more lenient was needed as the prisons were silting up with people being sent there to no good.  It is a decision for the Government.<\/p> <p>What I find difficult to understand is what the word \"merit\" means in the context of the legislation and how it is suggested the commission will decide between conservatives and liberals, lenient sentencers or hard ones, generous people with damages and people who take a strong view on the powers of the police, one way or the other.  These are the kinds of issues the Government must always consider and it is wrong to ask it to consider a shortlist compiled by a group which is prohibited from taking those issues into account.  I emphasise that point.  If the purpose of the legislation is to confront the Government with a shortlist in circumstances in which it will be embarrassing to go outside of it, we are left with a situation in which the people making the recommendations and compiling the shortlists are addressing issues and adjudicating on inclusion or non-inclusion by reference to criteria which the Government does not take into account.  It appears that all of these provisions are props to that process of embarrassing the Government were it to appoint someone who had not been recommended.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In those circumstances, I really do believe that the amendment I am proposing should be made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019050900002#H01100","speaker":"1403","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557405000,"counter":124,"content":"<p>I will make a couple of comments.

I do not believe they were appointed to make law at all.  They make law <i>faute de mieux<\/i>.

I absolutely accept that judges, particularly of the superior courts, make law particularly by providing precedent and so on but that is in the absence of the kind of action that the public want and require.

The criteria for appointing somebody are manyfold.  Governments have in the past, to my certain knowledge, been confronted by people who are clever, hard-working and well steeped in the law and by people who are less clever, less hard-working and less learned in the law and yet the first person who has all these attributes might appear to be somebody whose judgment the Government did not have confidence in.  It might not appear in a paper interview, or a suitability interview before the judicial appointments commission, or whatever, but it might well be that a rather dull and unambitious High Court judge is far preferable to the whizz-kid young barrister who seems to know everything and has a degree from Oxford or Cambridge, a master's degree and a diploma and is earning a fortune in the Law Library or whatever.  It might well be the case that the plodding judge is the kind of person in whom the Government would have more confidence.  That is the point I am making.<\/p> <p>Going back to what Senator Norris was saying about the judges making law, the Constitution is the Constitution.  It means, at first instance, what a High Court judge, subject to the right of appeal, says it means.  Even the fundamental law of this State is interpreted in a particular way.  When I say \"making the law\", it is not legislating in the form of enacting legislation, I agree with Senator Norris.  The separation of powers and the Constitution say that the sole function of making laws for the State is vested in the Oireachtas.  I have no problem with that but, in the end, the administration of justice involves a radical power of interpretation of the Constitution, common law and statute law to consider, for instance, if somebody falls and breaks a leg, is that worth &euro;30,000 or &euro;80,000?  Is the person who was responsible for it liable to pay &euro;80,000 rather than &euro;30,000?

That applies not simply in Ireland but across the common law world.  The power of the common law Judiciary is to interpret the law subject only to the right of the appellate courts to put them wrong, or for the Legislature to legislate where it is competent to do so, or for the people to amend the Constitution to reverse a particular outcome of a particular case.  The people did that, for instance, in the X case on the right to travel.  The people said that, when they voted for the eighth amendment to the Constitution, they had no intention of people being subject to travel injunctions.  We effectively reversed the finding by the Supreme Court of what the eighth amendment meant by saying it did not mean that anymore.<\/p><p>That is why I say the Judiciary has a function in law making - not in the sense of legislating but in the sense of interpreting the law and Constitution.  I will add, by way of a footnote to that, that every judge of the High Court, sitting alone, has the power to invalidate an Act of Parliament, an Act of the Executive or the acts of a lower court by reference to the Constitution.  That power is not present in many states in the world.  It is peculiar to the common law where there is a written constitution.  That goes to the point as to why we are asking people who have that power to prove their suitability to be of an appellate court by subjecting them to an interview, selection or short-listing process since they have that power already and since, as I pointed out here and in a recent newspaper article, they are entitled, if invited by the President of the Court of Appeal or the Chief Justice, to sit as a member of that court <i>pro tem<\/i>already.  Why they have to submit themselves to an assessment as to their suitability to a group of outsiders, the majority of whom are being selected on the basis that they are not legally experienced persons, I cannot understand at all.<\/p><p>To return to the point that we are dealing with here, I really believe it is important that under no circumstances can the Government be obliged to identify people who have been unsuccessful applicants.  That has to be stated as part of the law and that is the first leg of this amendment.  I do not see a prohibition of that kind anywhere in the legislation unless it is by inference that the Government, by convention, should not reveal that kind of information.

I say this in all modesty, but it just shows that the word \"merit\" is capable of being subject to quite a number of fluid interpretations, including those motivated by jealousy and spite.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019050900002#K00300","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1557405000,"counter":143,"content":"<p>Does the Minister wish to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019050900002#K00400","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1557405000,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I merely wish to bring Senators back to the amendment-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019050900002#K00500","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1557405000,"counter":145,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 96b.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019050900002#K00600","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1557405000,"counter":146,"content":"<p>-----if it is in order for me to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019050900002#K00700","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1557405000,"counter":147,"content":"<p>It is totally in order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019050900002#K00800","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1557405000,"counter":148,"content":"<p>Before I do, I offer clarification.  I was asked a direct question by Senator McDowell about the construct of the section 49 that now appears before us in the form of subsections (1), (2) and (3).  In the Bill as presented at the outset section 49 comprised what is now subsection (1).  Subsections (2) and (3) were inserted following a lengthy debate by the Select Committee on Justice and Equality, to which we will refer.  I acknowledge amendments in the names of the Senators that are broadly or very similar to mine.  I welcome the support of Senators in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019050900002#K00900","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1557405000,"counter":149,"content":"<p>They are identical.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019050900002#K01000","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1557405000,"counter":150,"content":"<p>It is my intention to propose, with the support of Senators, the deletion of subsections (2) and (3) from section 49.  I heard Senator McDowell go further and say that, irrespective of that proposal, he intended to oppose section 49 because he did not see merit in it.  He does not have any regard for the laying before the Houses of the Oireachtas what will be no more than a statement of information.  The provision of information for Members of the Oireachtas is important.  It represents an important channel of communication by the Executive with the Legislature.  What the Legislature does with it is entirely a matter for the committee or a plenary session of this or the Lower House.  We are in an era of information and the provision of information is important.  That is why it is not my intention to remove, in its entirety, section 49.  There is good reason to leave subsection (1) in the amended section 49 to which we will I hope agree at some stage.<\/p><p>Senator McDowell states my approach is unnecessary because he is in the Law Library and familiar with the candidates for high office.  That may well be the case, but there are many elected Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and, I dare say, Seanad &Eacute;ireann who might not be as familiar with the candidates or the process as the Senator and his colleagues.  That is why the provision of the information is important.  I refer to what is really no more than basic information, a short report on the implementation of an Act of the Oireachtas.  Far from it being unusual, it is becoming more commonplace and  I support it.  The measure is no more than an additional element of accountability on the part of the Government in the matter of its relationship with the Legislature.  I refer to the fact that there may well be an interpretation by some that there is duplication in the publication in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il<\/i>and the formal laying before the Houses of the Oireachtas of a brief report.  I do not agree.  I see a reason for the measure in question, given the nature of the debates that might take place as a result of the laying before the Houses of the brief report.  That will be a matter for the Houses, but Senator McDowell is right to point out that such a debate will obviously be subject to restrictions insofar as the role, duty and obligation of the Government in the appointment are concerned.  Also to be borne in mind is the concept of Cabinet confidentiality.  Should the justice committee or the Seanad decide to call in the Minister for Justice and Equality to deal with certain aspects of the report, it would be the time and place to consider the nature of such a debate and whether it might take place.  I am not minded to remove section 49 in its entirety, having regard to the basic information that will be contained therein.<\/p><p>As regards the amendment, we have already accepted amendment No. 87b which inserts a new section 42 into the Bill.  We described it at the time as the provision of information for applicants.  I accepted that amendment in February on the basis that, in the event that there was an unforeseen difficulty, we could revisit it.  Paragraph (a) of the new section obliges the commission to inform each applicant in respect of the office in question whether he or she was among the persons represented by the commission in the form of a recommendation to the Government.  I recognise a potential overlap, not a direct one, with the proposed new subsection (2) in amendment No. 96b.  It might even be a clash because the proposed subsection states the commission will not be prevented from informing applicants whether they have been recommended to the Government, but amendment No. 87b requires the commission to inform the applicants whether they were recommended.  I do not want to see a potential difficulty that might be the subject of misinterpretation that might give rise to uncertainty.<\/p><p>As regards the proposed section 49(1) in amendment No. 96b, I support the principle.  I would like to see how we can protect it in addressing the matter.  I will consider it, but I am not minded to remove section 49(1) for the reasons stated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019050900002#K01100","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1557405000,"counter":151,"content":"<p>As the Minister pointed out, we are only considering the amendment at this stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019050900002#K01200","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1557405000,"counter":152,"content":"<p>How stands the amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019050900002#K01300","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1557405000,"counter":153,"content":"<p>That is the point.
