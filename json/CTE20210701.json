I welcome everybody to the meeting.  Due to the situation with Covid-19, only the clerk, support staff and I are in the committee room.  Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that, in order to participate in public meetings, members must be present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit, either Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin.  I ask members to confirm their location before contributing to ensure that we are adhering to that constitutional requirement.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness and is attending remotely.<\/p> <p>  Today, we will engage with officials from the Higher Education Authority, HEA, to examine its 2019 financial statements.  The HEA has been advised that the committee has an interest in the following matters: the recurring deficit in third level institutions; the impact of funding cuts; occasional and hourly staff in third level institutions; how funding is used to support scaling up and spin-out companies; private company funding of third level institutions and training; ring-fenced funding for Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology's Mayo campus; and the HEA's role in the University of Limerick's purchase of the former Dunnes Stores site.<\/p> <p>  We are joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by the following representatives from the HEA: Dr. Alan Wall, chief executive officer, Ms Orla Nugent, deputy chief executive officer and head of system funding, capital funding and system governance, Ms Pearl Cunningham, head of finance, and Ms Orla Christle, senior manager with responsibility for system governance.  We are also joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by Mr. William Beausang, assistant secretary general of the tertiary division of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  When we begin to engage, I ask members and witnesses to mute their devices when not contributing so that we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind all in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.<\/p> <p>  Before we start, I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses regarding references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, today&rsquo;s witnesses are giving their evidence remotely, from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts, and as such may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Such witnesses have already been advised that they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 218, that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.<\/p><p>Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p> To assist the broadcasting and debates services, I ask that members direct their questions to a specific witness.  If the question is not directed to a specific witness, I ask the witness responding to state his or her name when first contributing.  I call Mr. McCarthy to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021070100002#A00400","speaker":"1491","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625128200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>The Higher Education Authority, HEA, is the statutory planning and development body for higher education and research in Ireland, and the primary State funding source for Irish universities, institutes of technology, ITs, and other higher education institutions.  The HEA&rsquo;s income in 2019 was &euro;1.4 billion, with more than 80% coming from Vote 26, education and skills.  A further 13% came from the national training fund.  Following the establishment of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the bulk of the HEA&rsquo;s funding from 2020 onwards will come from the Vote for that Department.  The payment of recurrent and capital grants, totalling &euro;1.39 billion, to higher education institutions represented almost all of the HEA&rsquo;s expenditure in 2019.<\/p> <p>  The HEA&rsquo;s operating costs in 2019 amounted to &euro;11.8 million.  I issued a clear audit opinion on the 2019 financial statements.  Members may wish to note that I certified the authority's 2020 financial statements earlier this week.  These will be presented to the Oireachtas in due course.  My audit opinion on the 2020 financial statements was also unqualified.  <\/p> <p>  Most of the HEA&rsquo;s expenditure involves grant funding to higher education institutions, which I audit.  As the HEA has oversight responsibility for the sector generally, this presents an opportunity for us to provide feedback on sectoral problems or on patterns identified during audits.  This is done mainly through regular meetings, usually held quarterly, between staff of my office and HEA officials.  This approach has proven useful in resolving common concerns, advancing accounting and governance issues, and exchanging information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021070100002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1625128200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I call Dr. Wall to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021070100002#B00300","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625128200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>My colleagues and myself are pleased to assist the committee in its consideration of matters which are of specific interest to it, as indicated in its letter of 4 June.  I will provide some general comments on the HEA's role of supporting the Minister in the achievement of national policy priorities and ensuring effective accountability and oversight of governance in HEA-funded higher education institutions, HEIs.<\/p> <p>  The past year has been a difficult one for students and staff, and the HEA has worked closely with all parties in the higher education sector to help overcome the challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.  Throughout, a quality student experience has remained the core consideration and I look forward to a more holistic higher education experience for students in the coming academic year.  Recent years have been a period of significant and ongoing reform of the higher education landscape.  We now have a sector that is moving towards a smaller number of institutions but with greater opportunity for development and innovation, and which will continue to play a central role in Ireland&rsquo;s social and economic development.<\/p> <p>  The HEA is accountable to the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science for the achievement of national outcomes for the higher education sector.  These national outcomes are supported by the authority through its policy advisory role and through the allocation of targeted funding supporting national policy priorities for skills.  The authority also has responsibility for the effective accountability and oversight of governance in HEA-funded higher education institutions and it takes this responsibility very seriously.  The remit of the authority is under review with the development of the new higher education Bill 2021, which is due to go through the Houses of the Oireachtas later this year.  The new Act is expected to give the HEA appropriate regulatory legislative powers.  The original HEA Act is 50 years old and while it has done the nation some service, it is no longer fit for purpose.  The new legislation will provide greater clarity in respect of the extent and operation of the HEA&rsquo;s responsibilities, including those of the institutions and the Minister.  Pending the enactment of the new legislation, the HEA continues to evolve the governance mechanisms for the sector.<\/p> <p>  Building on existing governance frameworks for higher education, since 2021, the HEA has required each institution to sign an oversight agreement confirming that it is conducting its activities in line with statutory requirements and the requirements of code of governance for State bodies, as reflected in the relevant sectoral code.  This agreement specifies that the chief officer of an institution is required to keep the HEA informed, on a timely basis, of any governance issues, concerns or major risks that may arise for the institution.  If an institution does not comply with these requirements, it must provide an explanation to the HEA and set out the actions agreed by the governing body to achieve compliance and an agreed timeline.  The auhtority also requires an annual governance statement and statement of internal control from each institution.  The annual governance statement needs to include confirmation of compliance by each HEI with a comprehensive list of governance requirements.  Non-compliance in any matter must be identified in the statement.  The template is signed by the chair of the governing body and the president of the institute.  Set-piece meetings, such as budget meetings and strategic dialogue meetings, also allow for any material issues relating to governance or financing to be declared to us.  In exercising its oversight role, the HEA seeks to be respectful of institutional autonomy within an accountability framework.  The role of the authority is distinct from the responsibilities of the governing authority of each institution and from the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the HEA&rsquo;s financial statements for 2019.  I am pleased to note that these were signed by the Comptroller and Auditor General in June 2020 with no issues arising.  Regarding recurring deficits in third level institutions, the HEA monitors the financial position of all higher education institutions continually.  Over the past year, the Covid-19 pandemic has heightened the financial challenges facing higher education institutions and in May 2020, the authority prepared a report on the implications of Covid-19 for the sector.  Following engagement with the Department, a Covid-19 related support package of &euro;130 million was agreed to for the sector with an additional &euro;52 million in student supports, which were disbursed by the HEA.  Three institutions have been operating with accumulated deficits and I refer members to our briefing paper for further information on this.  While progress has been made in reducing these deficits, it will be some years before they are fully eliminated.  The HEA continues to engage with the institutions that are in deficit to ensure they are financially sustainable and return to a position of growth.<\/p> <p>  On the impact of funding cuts, a 2018 spending review by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform noted that funding for higher education decreased by approximately 20% between 2008 to 2014, while, from 2015 to 2018, there was an increase of 9%.  In parallel to this, student numbers increased by approximately 30% from 2008.  Recent initiatives to increase funding to the sector and meet the challenges of increased demographics are set out in detail in our briefing paper and include human capital initiative investment, increased investment in apprenticeships and Springboard+, a transformational fund for technological universities, Project Ireland 2040 funding, Covid-19 funding, and funding to support additional CAO places.  The general impact of previous funding reductions continues to present challenges in areas such as increased student-staff ratio, a lag in investment in capital infrastructure and limited industrial relations tools to address inescapable pay costs.  The HEA contribution to the annual Estimates process identified areas where additional funding is required for 2022.  Work has also been advanced by the Department on an independent economic review on the future funding options for the tertiary education sector.<\/p> <p>  In reference to occasional and hourly staff, the HEA appreciates the concerns of the committee relating to casualisation of work, precarious employment, employment rights and job security of occasional staff in the higher education sector.  Employment contracts are the responsibility for HEIs as employers, while sectoral industrial relations are under the remit of the Department.  The HEA notes the intention of the committee to write to the Minister to highlight concerns.  In response to queries from the committee, the HEA liaised with the HEIs and provided data on the use of occasional hourly-paid staff.  We have also raised these matters with the HEI representative bodies, the Irish Universities Association and Technological Higher Education Association, with the aim of providing further and better information to the committee before the end of 2021.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation is responsible for national intellectual property, IP, policy and the funding to support the scaling up and spin-out of companies in higher education institutions.  Through the annual governance statement, each institution is asked by the HEA to confirm it has an IP policy that reflects the requirements of national IP policy.  This requirement for HEIs has evolved from two reviews of intellectual property policies by Knowledge Transfer Ireland and the HEA.  With regard to private company funding of third level training, the HEA has written to all HEIs seeking confirmation that governance requirements are being met in their associations with regard to third parties and receipts of non-exchequer funding specifically as these relate to climate change concerns.  We will revert to the committee on its queries in this regard.<\/p> <p>  In 2017, ring-fenced funding of &euro;750,000 was committed to the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, campus for five years to support the implementation of a plan that had been recommended by the working group.  A review of progress of the implementation of the plan has been completed by Mazars on behalf of the HEA.  The final report has been provided by the HEA to the Department with the recommendation that consideration should be given to specific policy and funding arrangements for remote campuses such as GMIT, Mayo.  A copy of the report and the HEA&rsquo;s letter to the Department has been provided for the information of the committee.<\/p><p> While significant challenges remain with the evolving higher education landscape and the clarity the new legislation will bring, I believe we are at a point of opportunity for significant reform and modernisation.  I am happy to answer any questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021070100002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Alan Wall","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625128200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Thank you, Dr. Wall, for your opening statement.<\/p> <p>  Some more apologies have come in.

In particular, I wish to pay attention to University of Limerick, UL, and the Dunnes Stores site.  We had representatives from the university before the committee recently.  Professor Mey accepted that how this was handled was not best practice.  There was no written valuation.  The site was valued two years prior to purchase at &euro;3 million but there was an &euro;8 million purchase tag.  There was non-compliance in terms of the procurement of the consultant.  What information did the HEA have?  Three options were given in the first instance but the Dunnes Stores site was not one of those.  Approval was sought from the authority.

What funding did it approve?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021070100002#C00300","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625128200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>In the context of the competition that was being run for capital expenditure we noted that a change of site was being made as part of the application.

It can undertake purchases and does not require oversight or any permission from the HEA to buy land.  In the past ten years there have been dozens of land purchases by universities.  We have not had sight of them and we do not generally have sight of them.<\/p> <p>  What happened here is that in the context of the competition we got a letter, which said that the board of governors had signed off on the purchase, that it was a good deal and that they thought it was a good deal.  That was in the letter we had in that context.<\/p> <p>  We also had the annual governance statement from 2018 to 2019, which we require everyone to sign.  In the statement we had a place where any financial risks or new financial information could be disclosed.  The &euro;8 million was disclosed there by the UL.

There were a number of suggestions from the TUSEI consortium and the Department facilitated engagement.  Members of the consortium suggested a number of people who they believed could assist them in driving forward the project, which, as many Deputies will know, has been very challenged over a long period of time.<\/p> <p>  Briefly, on the particular capacity and capability that Mr. Boland brought to the role, he played a similar role in relation to the Munster Technological University, MTU, another project that encountered quite significant challenges in being delivered.  Obviously, I am happy to answer further questions, but we should not lose sight of the strategic importance of achieving delivery of the technological universities and the transformation in the higher education landscape that is involved in that.  At previous meetings of this committee, questions legitimately were asked about the length of time it was taking to see the technological universities be designated and come into existence.

One trusts but one verifies.  I will tease out a couple of these issues.  I know we do not have much time but I ask the Deputy to bear with me.  In my 20 months here, we have been involved in tightening up the governance arrangements as much as possible without legislation.  The oversight agreement is much more specific about what bodies sign off on when they get money from us.  The annual governance statements are much more specific and we require sign-off on very specific issues.  As the Deputy will be aware, the issues she has raised, such as the issues of spin-out companies and intellectual property, have all been subject to rolling reviews and changes have been made that have affected the annual governance statements.  However, there can be frustration because, even if one sees red flags such as the Chair has mentioned, our capacity to act is very limited.  We have seen this in respect of other investigations we were required to carry out and which we could not.  I do not know enough yet because I have to ask direct questions but I am not happy.  The Deputy is right about the sector.  We need to move towards legislation so that we can be less toothless.  \"Toothless\" is not an unfair term to use.  The committee will have heard the frustration of other CEOs before me with regard to what we do not have capacity to do.  We are in very close dialogue with our parent Department about our own resources.  Our internal systems are not great for gathering information.  There are things for us to learn from this.  We need to watch that.  I do not want to take up the Deputy's time but, overall, we are not happy.  We want to see improvement.

As we came to 2018 and 2019, despite significant funding having been allocated to support that objective and to build capacity in the institutions, we were encountering very serious difficulties in delivering on that objective or vision.  Technological University Dublin, TU Dublin, had been established by the amalgamation of three institutions from the beginning of 2019 and a single person chaired the governing body of each institute.  It was our assessment that leadership could be provided by one individual representing the role of the institution to be rather than, as would be the case in other circumstances, existing presidents, who have to be conscious of the interests of their own institutions.  When the Munster technological university consortium ran into difficulties in getting its application over the line, we recommended that it find an individual to discharge the type of role played by the chairs of the governing bodies of the three institutions that were ultimately established as TU Dublin.  Independently of the Department, the two institutions, Cork Institute of Technology and the Institute of Technology, Tralee, appointed Tom Boland to that role.  He worked with the institutions, their staff and student representatives to secure the successful designation of Munster Technological University.  When we turned our attentions to the long-standing issues with the technological university for the south east, we made the same suggestion to the two presidents, who provided us with a list of individuals they believed could fulfil that role.<\/p><p>In order to support the process, we met with three people and for various reasons, none of those individuals wished to take up the role.  The two institutes then identified Mr. Tom Boland, given his experience and performance in the Munster Technological University, as an appropriate person to discharge that executive leadership role in TUSEI.  To be fair, he is only just one person working with the institutions, their staff, the project team and a large number of working groups to successfully secure the submission of an application for the establishing of a technological university, which I understand will be assessed by the international panel from the beginning of July.  I hope we are on a time path to the establishment of a really important strategic objective in the south east, a technological university that we hope can be transformative in terms of regional development needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021070100002#L02900","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Beausang","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625128200,"counter":331,"content":"<p>On the timeframe, essentially there was a process being undertaken by the Department and that process did not resolve the issue or identify a successful applicant so another applicant was chosen without a process by the institutions.

I was surprised by the figure.  We are not dealing with a fast-foot outlet or temporary stalls for Christmas.  We are dealing with third level institutions.  If the HEA is going to be given more powers, that is one area that it might get into.  It is something that surprises a lot of people, including students.  Over the years, I have spoken to many people in universities who are employed in jobs that operate on an if-and-when-we-need-you basis.  They do not have any great contracts or security.  The hours are very <i>ad hoc<\/i>.  They may have limited hours of nine or 11 hours a week.  They are expected to be available if-and-when needed.We have seen the levels of pay enjoyed by senior staff, in relation to University of Limerick, for example, where several people were on over &euro;180,000.  These are lecturers and highly qualified people and it is an area that we have to deal with.  Dr. Wall may say there are issues around funding for the sector.  They have been touched on here today and we understand that but we have to try to make this more secure and more regular for people with more regular hours.  In the county I am from, County Laois, there are people who work in third level institutions.  I was surprised at the hours available to them, the level of pay and the <i>ad hoc <\/i>nature of the pay.  There did not seem to be any set pay for the hours they work.  I was very surprised that people who are highly qualified, having spent years studying in university and who have high academic achievements, end up employed on a very casual basis.  There are people working in fast-food outlets who have better terms and conditions.  It is an area to which the HEA and the Department need to pay attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021070100002#N01500","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625128200,"counter":361,"content":"<p>It is important, to respond to comments of the Chair and Deputy Catherine Murphy, that we get to the bottom of what the employment landscape looks like.
