I also would like to acknowledge the office of the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, which made contact with my own office this morning about this Commencement matter.  I tabled this Commencement matter to ask the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to make a statement on how the public spending code ensures that taxpayers get greater value for money from publicly funded projects.  It is a real issue to make sure that we get bang for our buck when it comes to publicly-funded projects.  These are very significant funds that the State is pumping into Government agencies.  We need to make sure that Government agencies deliver on the ability to have these major projects delivered.  We have huge sums of money given, in particular, to local authorities.  How the public spending code deals with local authorities is a real issue of concern for many people.<\/p> <p>I raise this issue on the back of a huge issue we have in my own part of the world where our only public pool, which is in Dunmanway, received &euro;5.5 million four years ago.  It has been running at half capacity ever since.  To give an example, other public pools in the county will be open up to 60 or 70 hours every week.  We have 25 hours every week in Dunmanway.  This is a state-of-the-art complex that has a 25 m pool, a jacuzzi and a gym, all funded by the State coffers, and yet it is still running at half capacity.  It runs five days a week, from 11 a.m. until 5 p.m., and not on Sundays.  This is our money being spent on a public project and the public is not getting value for money.  <\/p> <p>We have swimming clubs that have not had lessons in two years.  We have a huge issue in my part of the world.  The Minister of State has visited west Cork and knows it is an area where we have access to water all the way along.  For parents to not have access to swimming lessons for over two years is an absolute disgrace.<\/p> <p>I am trying to work out where national government fits in.  Where does the public spending code fit in to make sure that we get value for money when we give money to local authorities?  The local authorities seem to be running around on this issue and have not done anything in the past four years regarding making sure the services that are required in the community are delivered.  <\/p> <p>We have often seen the call that we need more money for infrastructure and we need to have these projects delivered on.  We have the money, we have had the infrastructure built and now we do not have access to it.  That is a significant bugbear for so many people.  Unless we have due accountability for the moneys that we give to local authorities, we will continue to have this mess.  It is a significant issue.  <\/p> <p>Can the Minister of State elaborate on where the buck stops?  Who controls it?  Where is the auditor regarding making sure that the investment the State makes on behalf of the Irish people into these publicly-funded projects means they are actually open to the public?  That is the crux of the matter.  Many Deputies and Senators in west Cork have been going around in circles, trying to get this pool opened.  We now need to make sure there is accountability regarding the money spent.  Where is the line of command and who can give us that accountability?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012500002#B00400","speaker":"1666"},{"type":"speech","time":1643121000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Lombard for raising this Commencement matter.  I am delighted to hear that the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, has made contact with him.  I will read the script provided in response to the matter raised.<\/p> <p>Delivering greater value for money in the expenditure of public funds is a key element of all public investment policy.  Efficient public capital investment means quality investment decisions supported by robust evidence and analysis to maximise outcome for limited public resources.  The management and delivery of investment projects and public services within allocation is a key responsibility of every Department and Minister.  It is important to note that this is not a static space and public bodies are continually working to improve processes and frameworks to ensure value for money.<\/p> <p>The public spending code is the tool used by Government to evaluate the consequences of the capital investment decisions it makes.  The code was updated in December 2019 following an extensive consultation process involving engagement with over 150 public officials and a review of international best practice.  The update code also incorporated lessons learned in Ireland on a wide range of projects such as those outlined in the PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC, review of the national children's hospital, which recommended the following: the rules that govern public sector spending should be strengthened; the standards to which business cases are presented should be more clearly defined; and a central assurance and challenge function should provide a consistent challenge to and review of major projects throughout their lifecycle, which I think is the issue the Senator brings to the fore today.  <\/p> <p>As well as implementing these recommendations, the updated guidance better aligns with the realities of the project delivery, with a particular focus on improved appraisal, cost estimation and management.  The public spending code is grounded in the principle of proportionality.  The resources and time to be spent on project preparation must be commensurate with the nature, cost and complexity of the investment.  All the evidence shows that the greatest impact on improving project outcome comes from the careful project preparation.  The more work that is done on the earlier stages leads to more considered decisions on projects.  At the same time, there is a need to balance project preparation with the imperative of delivering critical infrastructure.  Accordingly, the update to the code streamlines the process for smaller projects.  This can speed up project delivery.  In addition, the code specifically refers to sectors such as housing and urban regeneration, whereby policy interventions can be appraised on a programme-wide basis without the need to assess every project on scheme individually.  <\/p> <p>The update of the code in 2019 highlighted the need for more structured scrutiny on major public investment projects, particularly in the areas of planned delivery, costings and risk.  This is to ensure that the Government is making decisions with a full picture of the proposal, its costs, risks and benefits.  The majority of public investment projects are delivered on budget and on time.  There is a high level of professionalism across the various sectors.  However, we have also recognised the higher risk profile of larger projects and introduced a new procedure for projects with an estimated cost of over &euro;100 million in order to improve project outturns, avoid cost overruns and reduce the risk of delay in delivery. <\/p> <p>The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has put in place an external assurance process to provide independent project scrutiny at key decision stages.  This will involve independent expert review of two key points in the project lifecycle under the public spending code - approval in principle and prior to tender - focusing on issues such as cost, risk and ability to deliver.  This process will improve value for money and support funding Departments and Government with expert insight relating to project risks, delivery feasibility and robustness of costings, governance and procurement.  <\/p> <p>To support the external assurance process a new major project advisory group has been established to further strengthen project management.  As a prerequisite to seeking Government approval for projects at the relevant decision gates, project proposals and external reviews will be scrutinised by the advisory group in advance of the decision to proceed.  The new arrangements bring Ireland into line with leading international best practice and meet a recommendation of the IMF's public investment management assessment of Ireland.  It should be noted that timelines associated with public spending code compliance are a fraction of the times required for compliance with a range of statutory requirements.<\/p> <p>I am not sure if that response has answered the Senator's question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012500002#C00100","speaker":"1484"},{"type":"speech","time":1643121000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the response.

The update of the code in 2019 was done in the context of many lessons learned here in Ireland, including the national children's hospital and also international guidance through a review of the investment framework by the International Monetary Fund.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform continues to work with colleagues from other Departments and agencies to refine the requirements of the overall public spending codes to produce sectoral guidance that is more applicable in specific areas.

I have always said this Government will be very much judged on its track record and delivery in health and housing.  I think we all know that.<\/p> <p>I will focus on one simple measure concerning health.  It is in response to an email every Deputy, Senator and Minister received from the Neurological Alliance of Ireland, NAI, campaign for 100 extra nurses in neurology.  Patients are waiting too long for diagnosis and treatment and I think the Minister of State and I, and everyone, agrees on that.  As an example, consider St. Vincent's University Hospital, which is one of the bigger focuses and the key aspect of this campaign, albeit a national campaign.  Based on the catchment area of St. Vincent's, national and international guidelines recommend there should be 22 neurology nurse specialists there but there are only four.  Patients deserve better.  I believe that and the Minister of State does too.<\/p> <p>Investing in more neurology nurses is a cost-efficient way of improving efficiencies and outpatient clinics, reducing waiting times and ensuring patients have access to specialist supports they need to manage their conditions.  Patients with access to neurology nurses have reported improved psychological well-being, improved sense of involvement in their care and in their pathways for care, and the preparation for the tests and the investigations that are especially necessary for this specific area of medicine.  More neurology nurses will also ensure patients get quicker access to outpatient appointments, thereby reducing waiting lists, and based on their deteriorating condition.  I support the NAI's campaign for 100 extra nurses specialising in this area, including 17 extra nurses for St. Vincent's.  I ask the Minster of State to do the same.<\/p> <p>There was a chart published of nursing numbers per hospital which makes for very interesting reading.  I will read it into the record.  The recommended number of nurses for Beaumont Hospital is 15 whereas it currently has ten.   The recommended number of nurses for Cork University Hospital is 20 whereas it currently has four.  The recommended number of nurses for the Mater Hospital is 14 whereas it currently has six.  The recommended number of nurses for Sligo University Hospital is seven whereas it currently has three.  The recommended number of nurses for St. James's Hospital is 14 whereas it currently has only four.  The recommended number of nurses for St. Vincent's Hospital is 22 whereas it currently has only four.  The recommended number of nurses for Tallaght Hospital is 20 whereas it currently has only 15.<\/p> <p>University Hospital Galway will be of particular interest to the Minister of State.  The recommended number of nurses there is 13 but only four are in place.  The recommended number of nurses for the University Hospital Limerick is 11 whereas it currently has three.  University Hospital Waterford is really disappointing.  The recommended number of nurses is six and there are none in place.

I am taking it on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly.  The script I will read was prepared by his Department.  I also take the opportunity to acknowledge the work and the role played by neurological nurse specialists.  They play an important role in triaging, assessing, and providing ongoing support to neurological patients.  This in turn builds capacity within neurological services and allows for more timely access to efficient, equitable and quality care.<\/p> <p>I am advised that the HSE's national clinical programme for neurology, NCPN, in conjunction with the Neurological Alliance of Ireland, NAI, completed an all-Ireland survey of neurological services in 2020.  This survey confirmed that all neurological centres have access to a designated clinical nurse specialist or advanced nurse practitioner, recognising the value that skilled and highly trained nursing staff add to neurological services.  The HSE has advised that plans will be developed to incrementally increase the overall numbers of nurse specialists.<\/p> <p>The NCPN continues to engage regularly with patient organisations and the NAI to establish ways to promote neurology nurse specialists.  It is focusing its current work streams and initiatives around nurse-led clinics, nurse-liaison services and outreach programs.  Examples of this include the headache programme and the epilepsy outreach programme, both of which are funded under the Sl&aacute;intecare innovation fund.  These programmes reconfigure the management of these conditions, enabling clinical nurse specialists and advanced nurse practitioners to lead and co-ordinate the care of these conditions in the community.  This reduces reliance on consultant neurologists and tertiary services, which, in turn, reduces waiting lists and allows more timely access to services and improves the overall quality of care.<\/p> <p>The HSE has advised that the neurology department in St. Vincent's University Hospital provides regional services in all aspects of general neurology including migraine and epilepsy services in addition to tertiary services for people with multiple sclerosis, cognitive disorders, dystonia and movement disorders and Parkinson's disease.  The neurology Department offers an inpatient, outpatient and consultation service.<\/p> <p>The HSE has further advised that there are currently ten specialist nursing positions in neurology in St. Vincent's, of which nine are in post.  It is hoped that the post of advanced nurse practitioner in multiple sclerosis will be filled very soon.  The Government, along with the Department of Health, is fully committed to improving patient services and having patient-centred care in St Vincent's and across the country.  That commitment is, I strongly suggest, reflected in the unprecedented level of funding that is being targeted right across the health service in recent budgets and again in budget 2022.  Since the end of 2019 the health sector has grown by a total of 12,506 whole-time equivalents, WTEs.  The largest area of growth has been in nursing and midwifery, with an additional 3,372 WTE posts.<\/p> <p>I am assured that the HSE remains committed to the progressive development of neurology services and, specifically, to improving this service for patients of St. Vincent's University Hospital and the surrounding areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012500002#E00200","speaker":"1484"},{"type":"speech","time":1643121000,"counter":20,"content":"<p>With all due respect, I fully appreciate that the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is taking the matter for the Minister for Health.

Their availability mean that more people need to be trained.   To all the volunteers who have given up their time to become first responders I pay tribute.  They are a credit to themselves, their families and their communities for their responsibility to and solidarity with their communities.  I was particularly impressed by an initiative undertaken in the Buncrana Garda district recently where the National Ambulance Service provided cardiac first response training to members of that Garda district.  All of the members took it up.  As a result the National Ambulance Service installed a defibrillator in every single Garda vehicle, including a motorcycle, in that district.  It is an initiative that I would like to see rolled out throughout the country.  It makes perfect sense that those who are first tasked as emergency responders, that is, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who respond in emergency situations would have the equipment in their vehicles to be able to assist those in a cardiac arrest situation but also that they would have had adequate training to be able to use that device.  It is a simple situation that could be life or death.  Members of the Garda are on the ground 24-7 and in fairness to them, they respond as quickly as they possibly can.  It is an excellent initiative that I would like to see rolled out.  I believe that training in basic first aid and cardiac first response is something that should be universal and that we should begin it in schools.  I introduced a Bill in the last Seanad on first aid and mental health first aid in order that individuals could be trained from the get-go and we would not have to do it retrospectively.  <\/p> <p>I not only commend members of the Garda in the Buncrana district but also the National Ambulance Service personnel in Donegal for taking this initiative.

This strategy was developed by an interdisciplinary steering group, which had the aim of increasing the number of people who survive an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Ireland, using national and international experience to address all the elements in the chain of survival.  The HSE has since established an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest strategy implementation group to progress this work.  The group is led by the National Ambulance Service and actions are being progressed by partner organisations, including Dublin Fire Brigade, the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council, the Irish Heart Foundation, and as the Senator noted, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  At present, the National Ambulance Service has a list of locations for more than 2,000 AEDs on its national computer-aided dispatch system which it can use to advise emergency callers, although this is in its infancy.<\/p> <p>The most important thing the Senator raised is that, following the pandemic, not everyone within the voluntary organisations has returned to the role of being a first responder.  Therefore, the National Ambulance Service has been looking at other ways of equipping people to become first responders because time is critical in these situations.  We have seen that in Donegal and in what the Senator said with regard to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There is a strategy and a very clear plan to roll it out but it is important that we roll it out at pace.  That is for the simple reason that there is a deficit in the number of community first responders at this moment in time.  It is important that, where we know there is a deficit, the National Ambulance Service works with the local fire brigade or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to train and equip them, so there are no gaps left in any communities across the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012500002#G00200","speaker":"1484"},{"type":"speech","time":1643121000,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive response on behalf of the Minister for Health.

We have great community volunteers who volunteer in cardiac arrest situations with defibrillators but for one reason or another the logistics of getting them out to a remote location might prove difficult.  The Garda is on the scene 24-7 in an emergency situation and it makes perfect sense for every Garda vehicle to be equipped with a defibrillator or an AED and that every single member of the Garda would be trained to use it.

In particular, the National Ambulance Service, via the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest strategy, continues to advance development of a national AED register, which will enable the service's national emergency operations centre to locate all publicly accessible defibrillators when it receives a 999 or 112 call.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Anne Rabbitte:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2436\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2436&amp;amp;pid=AnneRabbitte&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is a significant source of mortality and morbidity, with a wide variation in its reported incidence and outcomes globally.

I will share time with Senator Carrigy.<\/p> <p>There is much concern and anxiety among parents and leaving certificate students, especially given the number of absences due to Covid-19 infection or close-contact status.  It has been a big issue over recent months, particularly because of the Omicron variant, for both teachers and students alike.  Meetings were held last week, on 20 January, with the advisory group on planning for State examinations for leaving certificate 2022 and further bilateral meetings with stakeholder groups are being held into this week.  It is now 25 January, and clear guidance is required for parents, students and teaching staff.  When will there be a decision on leaving certificate 2022?<\/p> <p>An increase of more than fivefold in CAO maximum point scores has been reported over recent years and there is significant pressure on college places.  There is a disparity between standard exams and accredited grades and this is putting courses out of reach for students as points increase.  A lottery system faces students.  What supports are in place for this year&rsquo;s cohort of students, who more than most have been impacted since March 2020 when they were in their junior certificate year?  They may not yet have completed any State exams.<\/p> <p>Students and parent advisory groups have reached out regarding this stress and anxiety.  The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science has brought forward changes to the CAO form, which now includes both further and higher education options and apprenticeship places, increasing young people&rsquo;s options to reach their career of choice.  There are also a further 6,000 places, intended to reduce pressure on the points system over the next two years.  What are we going to do this year?  We are reaching capacity in higher education.<\/p> <p>Leaving certificate reform is well overdue and we need it now.  When will the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA&rsquo;s, final advisory report on senior cycle reform be published?  Continuous assessment options apply only to 60% of subject choices but they should apply to all of them.  Like my party colleague Senator Carrigy, I have received reports that the National Parents Council, which is represented on the advisory group for post-primary, does not represent all parents.  He will develop this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012500002#H00400","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speech","time":1643121000,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I concur with the comments made by Senator Dolan relating to the leaving certificate.  As she said, the advisory group met recently to discuss proposals.  One group that is represented on the advisory group is the National Parents Council Post Primary, which comprises the Catholic Secondary Schools Parent Associations, CSSPA, representing 342 schools, or 40% of the total; the Education and Training Board Schools National Parents Association, representing 271 schools; the National Association of Compass, which represents 22 schools that promote Protestant or minority religions; and the Parents Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools, which represents 91 schools.<\/p> <p>The NPC does not represent all the smaller organisations within it, which means not all parents in all schools are represented.  This issue has been raised with me in my home county of Longford by representatives and parents, who have stated they are not getting the opportunity to feed in their views to the discussions that are taking place.  We need an organisation that represents all parents' views, and the people who are members of that organisation need to be parents themselves in order that they can understand the issues that exist for youngsters on the ground.<\/p> <p>In a letter issued roughly 12 months ago, the executive of the CSSPA expressed a lack of confidence in the leadership of the National Parents Council.

This has been done in consultation with the advisory group on planning for the State examinations and with public health.<\/p> <p>Both the National Parents Council post-primary and primary are represented on the advisory group, and I will come back to the point that both Senators have made in terms of that aspect.  Other members of the group include representatives of students, teachers and school leaders, and representatives of the State Examinations Commission, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, higher education and the Department.<\/p> <p>The Department is aware that the leaving certificate experience for the class of 2022 has been disruptive.  The State Examinations Commission, working with the Department, has sought through a range of measures to take account of the disruption to learning experienced by these students.  These measures include the following: adjustments to the assessment arrangements for the 2022 State examinations that were announced in August 2021.  These adjustments were designed to take account both of the disruption to learning experienced by students in the early part of 2021, as well as providing for some possible further disruption in 2021-2022; revised arrangements for leaving certificate oral language examinations, and the performance tests in leaving certificate music.  These examinations will take place outside of school time over the first week of the school Easter holidays, and will minimise disruption to teaching and learning; and pushing out of the timeframe for certain assessment elements of the leaving certificate applied examinations.  Schools were also reminded of the flexibility available regarding the dates for the completion and authentication of leaving certificate course work.<\/p> <p>The Minister also announced that an alternative set of leaving certificate examinations will be run in 2022 and shortly after the conclusion of the main set of examinations.  This will be for students who are unable to sit the main set of examinations for various reasons, including Covid-19 illness, bereavement or serious illness.<\/p> <p>The Department has also made available guidance materials to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils or students in a Covid-19 context.  This includes information on well-being supports for leaving certificate students.  It includes a series of supports on managing well-being, coping with uncertainty and managing stress and anxiety, developed by the National Educational Psychological Service in the Department.<\/p> <p>The Department continues to engage with all partners in education on all matters relating to leaving certificate 2022 examinations.  The advisory group on State examinations, as both Senators know and stated, met on Thursday last, 20 January.  A number of updates were received from group members, including reports of results from surveys of their members that were conducted by some bodies.  The issue of grade inflation was also raised.  The meeting was positive and collaborative with all parties committed to continued engagement in the short period ahead in order to provide clarity in relation to State examinations 2022.  It was agreed that the members of the group would reflect on the contributions made at the meeting, and that engagement would continue between the Minister and the stakeholders on a bilateral basis.   The bilateral engagement has been continuing since late last week and over the weekend.  It is planned that a further meeting of the advisory group will be held in the coming days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012500002#J00200","speaker":"1493"},{"type":"speech","time":1643121000,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

I have been asked that every day in recent weeks but it will be an early decision.

I know plenty of people who abandoned their plans for dry January over the weekend, after the difficulties that we have had.  We have spoken often in this House about hospitality, tourism, the arts, live events and the entertainment sector.  It is important that we give our support to them.  I ask that we consider replacing the Government advertising campaign, which tells us that restrictions have been lifted, with encouragement to people who are in a position to do so to go out and support their local bars and restaurants and to buy tickets to the theatre or a gig, stating that it is their patriotic duty to do so.<\/p> <p>We need to recognise the sacrifices that young people have made, which we have talked about in this House.

We have to be conscious, within our education system, that a certain number of young people have been left behind over the last two years.  We have to put supports in place to make sure that this does not become a long-term issue.  We raised this with the Minister, Deputy Foley, last week.<\/p> <p>I have a question about the online safety and media regulation Bill.  It will soon come before the House.  The Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media recommended, and the Minister accepted, the establishment of an online safety commissioner.

To be honest, in many ways it is being set up with the possibility that the system will fail.  The language used includes that the panel is to \"consider the scope of such a scheme, taking into account the nature and volume of online content and the overall purpose of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill.\"  While we accept that a threshold must be established, I am concerned that the joint committee was not consulted about the terms of reference for this expert group.

Some &euro;289 million is being spent on walking and cycling across the country.  Tipperary was successful and secured &euro;6.6 million, which is very welcome.  However, as I stated last week, it is extremely frustrating for us to be told before Christmas that the N24 road project from Cahir to Waterford was being shelved because of a lack of funding.  The Department of Transport has lots of money.  All we were asking for was &euro;1.5 million to continue the design phase of a strategic route between Limerick and Waterford.  I ask the Minister to reflect on that decision, reverse it and continue the investment in the design stage of the N24.  It is a key project which needs to be supported.  It is all well and good to give &euro;170 million to the greater Dublin area.  We are asking for only &euro;1.5 million to continue a road project which is hugely important.<\/p> <p>At the weekend, I went to apply for a passport for my two-year-old son's first passport.  I visited a pharmacy to get his photograph taken.  There was a queue in the pharmacy of people getting pictures, predominantly for young children.  I then went to the Garda station with my wife to sign a consent as a guardian.  The garda said the station had been inundated with people looking for passports.  I then went to the post office where I had the exact same conversation.  There is huge excitement with the country reopening.  Part of that excitement is people looking forward to the opportunity to travel in the summer.  In the next number of weeks, public representatives will be inundated with questions about passports.  If we thought it was bad a couple of months ago, the queries will skyrocket in the coming months.  In 2020, 450,000 passports were issued.  In 2019, which is probably the best barometer, 900,000 passports were issued.  It is expected that between 1.3 million and 1.7 million passports will be delivered this year.  The majority of those are processed in January and February each year but that will increase this year on the back of the announcement last week and Government advertising on applying for passports.<\/p> <p>I welcome that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, is increasing Passport Office staff by 300, from 600 to 900.  That is a 50% increase in staff but we have a threefold or fourfold increase in passports.  I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come to the House to talk about passports as a priority this year in supporting sectors such as aviation as well as travel agencies which have had a difficult two years.  I also ask that the appointment of the additional 300 staff in the Passport Office happen immediately.  We should look at introducing a seven-day rather than five-day roster system in the Passport Office.  This needs to be treated as an emergency in the coming months to ensure that everyone who wants a passport can get one in time in order that we can support the aviation industry and travel agencies and get back to normality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012500002#O00200","speaker":"1629"},{"type":"speech","time":1643121000,"counter":46,"content":"<p>That may be a topic for a Commencement matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012500002#O00300","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1643121000,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that No. 96, motion 3, be taken before No. <i>a<\/i>1.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Sharon Keogan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> I am pleased we are moving forward with the reopening in recognition of the reality of the state of play with regard to Covid and I look forward to the full relaxing of restrictions as soon as possible.  As much as we can enjoy ourselves now, we must not forget what still needs to be done, both in moving forward and in assessing what is now in our past.  A full inquiry into the effectiveness, the necessity and the scope of each Government restriction put in place to combat Covid must be carried out and begun no later than this year.<\/p><p>The Covid certificate, which has been discontinued for domestic use, leaves behind it a massive haul of personal data.  The public needs to be told exactly what data is being held by the Government and how it is going to be held, processed or deleted in the near future.  The same request must be made at the EU level.  On the retirement of the certificate as a prerequisite for international travel, what will happen to the data in Brussels?  We need certainty on this.  I ask the Leader to ask the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, to come to the House to make a statement on the matter.<\/p><p>Not all to do with the pandemic response was an imposition.  The move towards outdoor dining last summer brought with it great developments to the atmosphere in our towns and villages.  As we come out of the winter months, I would like to see the regulations allowing restaurants and bars to continue to operate these outdoor spaces extended indefinitely.  Many owners put a lot of money into these spaces, as did the Government, in order for them to be able to trade in accordance with the Government restrictions.  The least we can do is allow these spaces to continue to exist into the summer and beyond.  Perhaps we could ask the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, to update us on the extension of this provision.<\/p><p>In the same vein of helping hospitality, I am sure no one in this Chamber has been a stranger to passport requests over the past two years.  Much of this arose from the closure of the Passport Office for a time over the course of the pandemic.  I do not think that should have happened, given the essential nature of the service, but it did, and we are still working through the fallout.<\/p><p>I was contacted by a number of individuals who have been in the hospitality industry for years.  They told me hoteliers are tearing out their hair over the delays in processing visas for skilled industry workers, particularly chefs.  Backlogs have been experienced since last June regarding visa decisions for young chefs from outside the EU.  It is causing real difficulty in the industry, an industry we should be doing all we can to help.<\/p><p>I ask the Leader to check with the Ministers to see what can be done in regard to these issues and perhaps ask each of them to come before the House to make a statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012500002#O00400","speaker":"1664","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643121000,"counter":49,"content":"<p>There is much optimism around at the moment.

We are all very aware of it but, understandably, we wonder what we can do about it.  One thing I am asking everyone to do this year is to talk about and think about trees.<\/p> <p>Trees matter.  When it comes to climate, they sequester and store carbon and, apart from providing us with beautiful surroundings and amenities, in the right place they also provide a whole range of biodiversity, water and ecological benefits.

Our forestry programme is the means through which we do this and a new one is due to come into place this time next year.  Before it does, I want to make sure people get the opportunity to engage with all of the issues, become informed about trees and forestry and then give their opinion.  The decisions we make this year will shape our woodlands and forests for generations to come.  We have a much lower level of forestry cover than almost every other country in Europe and our level of native woodland is particularly low.  How do we up it?  How do we decide what is planted where and by whom?  That is why we need to talk about trees.<\/p> <p>We started already with a behaviour and attitudes poll before Christmas.  Its findings were encouraging in that it found that we, as a nation, value trees, we love to walk in woodlands and we want and like our mix of both conifers and broadleaves.  I can certainly identify with that, living so close to the wonderful woodlands of Emo Court and Charleville Castle.  However, the poll also showed that we have not really noticed much talk about trees in the media and we are much less aware than I would like of the benefits of timber for construction, something that cannot be ignored.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Pippa Hackett:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=0000\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=0000&amp;amp;pid=PippaHackett&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is why we need that conversation about trees, which continues this evening when I will engage with the group from An For&oacute;ige, a representation of the young people who will be most impacted by the decisions we make this year.

It has been a real deficit for us all.  I have missed bringing people into this House to engage with me in my role in the Seanad and hosting important and worthwhile campaign and lobby groups in the audiovisual room to give them an opportunity to engage with all Members of the Oireachtas.

We must learn the lessons of a lack of investment in healthcare provision and infrastructure across the State and redouble our efforts in this institution to address those deficiencies.<\/p> <p>I also wish to discuss organ donation and the human tissue Bill, which the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, indicated at the end of last year would be a priority for him early this year.  While it would do a lot of things, one of its core components would be to create a soft \"opt-out\" option for organ donation.  Similar legislation is going through the assembly in the North.  Given that organ donation operates on an all-Ireland basis in terms of the list through which people can hopefully obtain an organ, it is important that we harmonise that legislation and approach.  In calling for that legislation to be brought forward under Government time, I respectfully ask people, because it is a personal issue, to consider becoming an organ donor if they are not already one and indicate to, and have a conversation with, their loved ones and those closest to them about their desires in this regard as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p>This does not happen very often but I fully agree with Senator Ahearn about the issue of passports, an issue I have raised consistently.

It has also been pointed out that these drills will take place in an area with a lot of sub-sea infrastructure running along the southern coast and connecting Europe to North America, beneath the nexus of many of the Internet cables which connect these two continents.  If there was to be any damage, accidental or otherwise, to these cables, it would cripple the economies of NATO countries and our economy.<\/p><p>Fishermen in Cork have expressed grave concerns at the environmental damage that would be caused to biodiversity and marine life in the area and have indicated their plans to peacefully protest against these drills.  The chief executive officer of the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation, Mr. Patrick Murphy, has said there is currently 500 million tonnes of blue whiting in the area.  Whatever munitions Russia plans on testing there, it will have a detrimental impact on the environment.  Many of the warheads will likely contain depleted uranium.  Any submarines involved will be using sonar, which can be devastating to larger marine life, particularly whales.  We have a responsibility to protect the environment and larger marine life such as dolphins and whales.  Seismic activity can have an impact for years.  There is one example of a change in the migratory pattern of tuna, which is yet another example of human activity having a long-term impact on nature.   War ships engaging in war games off our coast can and will have a devastating impact on the environment and marine life and has the potential to have a devastating and detrimental impact on our economic industry if things go wrong.<\/p><p>It is important we in the Upper House have an opportunity to ask the Minister for Defence what is being done.

It inflicts trauma and stress on students without any real preparation for life after second level education.  We should be rewarding children&rsquo;s learning abilities and not just their memories.<\/p> <p>In 2016, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child recommended that Ireland should reform the leaving certificate as it inflicts mental distress on young people.  It is now 2022 and we have made no effort to change the system.  The best interests of children should be the main priority.  Young people are the main stakeholders.<\/p> <p>Delayed reform means that more than 800,000 students will have gone through the leaving certificate system, some of whom will have fallen through the gaps, most likely not have progressed to third level education and will have experienced poverty, unemployment and homelessness due to a stressful, unequal system.  I propose school-based assessments similar to the ones introduced by the Department of Education during the pandemic until the total leaving certificate system is reformed, as expected by 2030.  <\/p> <p>I have received many emails from students throughout the country stating that they want calculated grades this year.

A great many issues have been with us for years like the need to extend footpaths, walkways and cycleways, to take away dangerous bends and so forth.  For the first time, we have seen a Government providing money to sort out such problems.  I was in contact with a number of local authority members yesterday evening and I must say that the announcement got a great welcome.  Of course, the fact that it is a roll-over fund is very important.  The situation where local authorities are forced to spend money coming up to the end of the year or else send it back will not apply.  This is a roll-over fund which is really important for some projects.<\/p> <p>We also had school announcements from the Government recently.  Six schools in my own county of Roscommon and the Galway part of the Galway-Roscommon constituency received very good news under the summer works scheme.  On the subject of education, I have spoken to the Minister for Education about giving some sort of break to leaving certificate students this year and of course, the Minister of State at the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Niall Collins, was in the House earlier to respond to the Commencement matter raised by Senators Dolan and Carrigy.

There is a shortage of eight or nine in the hospital.

I have heard various debates and interviews over the course of the day on the issue and am aware of the concerns of both employees and employers.  Issues like health and safety, access to broadband and related matters that are a concern for both employers and employees can be addressed by the Connected Hubs initiative launched by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys.

We now have four SAR bases in the country that are guaranteed by the Government.  That is welcome and I thank all the Members of this House and the Lower House who got behind that campaign to ensure that we kept four helicopters.  I have asked on a number of occasions for the business case for this to be released.  This is part of the reason we asked for the debate in this House.  The Air Corps was assessed as providing one base in the country.  In order to provide that base, it was expected to have three helicopters rather than five for four bases, to be available 100% of the time rather than 95% of the time and to fund spare parts at a premium of 60% above that which would be charged to a commercial supplier.  I can see no reason why the Irish Air Corps would not provide the fixed-wing element, but it looks like we are going to have a fixed-wing element provided from the UK.  That aircraft will be flying across Ireland with sophisticated surveillance technology on board.  None of this makes sense.  In agreeing to have four helicopters for SAR or four helicopter bases, we have altered the business case that was put together to form the pre-qualification questionnaire in the first place.  In addition, they added on the fire-fighting equipment after the business case was put together.  Everything about this is shambolic.  It seems to be a case of making it up as we go along.  It is vitally important that the business case is published and that we have an open debate in this House.  It is not the Minister or any politician that is making these decisions.

We talk a good deal about wanting to equal things out, equal things up and have women earn the same money and be treated as equals.  We are the ones creating the barriers for children at a very early age.  When we send boys and girls to segregated schools, we tell them they are different.  We do not do this in cr&egrave;ches and we do it to increasingly less in primary schools and new schools that are being built.  We need to look at our secondary schools.

There is more research now emerging where employers are not as in love with remote working as they have been over the past two years, whereas employees are still as in love with remote working.  We have to help them through that transition.  We do it through skills, by training them, by talking in this Chamber about remote-first, remote only and best practice hybrid companies.  We can do it through talking about companies such as HubSpot, Flipdish, GitLab, Dropbox and Shopify, which are not normally part of the employers that we talk about, as well as the Grow Remote alliance of top CEOs who are committed to leading the transition.  We need to implement their learnings.<\/p><p>Employers need to provide credible and demonstrable reasons they would refuse remote working.  Nobody wants a box-ticking exercise that enables them to refuse requests without an effective challenge and consideration.  Many employers have already shown much goodwill.

There are thousands of people no longer getting into their cars at 7 a.m. to travel to the office for 9 a.m., while others who live in particular locations and do not have access to good public transport are no longer stressed about having to get up early in order to get somewhere in order to access public transport.<\/p><p>We need to have a proper debate.

From an environmental point of view, to have this so-called testing of arms happening off our coast makes no sense.  It is within our economic zone.<\/p> <p>In my part of the world, fishing is a really important to the economy.  Fishermen work exceptionally hard.  That the biodiversity and fishing stocks could be disrupted, if not destroyed, by these exercises is unbelievable.  We need to have a real debate in the Seanad on this issue.  We should ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, to come to the House to update Senators on his views on this matter and on what he proposes to do to stop these exercises.  The proposal from the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation that fishing boats go out there is very dangerous.  I would be deeply concerned for my fishing community that they could become embroiled in an international incident off the south-west coast of Cork.  We need to make sure that these waters are safe.  To permit such exercises at this stage is beyond belief.  Our neutrality has been a really important part of our history.  To have these so-called exercises happening makes no sense.

The schools we want and the communities we want are facilitated by these great workers.  They deserve to be recognised as a profession in themselves.  It is sad to think we have nearly 18,000 people who do not have a proper contract and who wonder every year if they are going to have employment in the following year.  That has its own knock-on effects, such as on getting a loan or a mortgage and all those things you have in normal life.  It is predominantly women who work in this role, as all Members know.  That is another example of how gendered roles in our countries have been neglected, seen as a part-time gig or just a bit of pocket money for a woman.  That is not correct; this is a profession.

That stress is now compounded by what the leaving certificate class of 2022 has gone through with the additional stresses Covid has brought along.  I have received many telephone calls from students and parents in recent weeks who are calling for finality and for a decision to be made sooner rather than later on this issue.  For anyone to suggest this leaving certificate class should be treated differently to those of the preceding two years is grossly unfair.  This year's class have been impacted as much as the classes of 2021 and 2020.  I compliment the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, and all the stakeholders including parents, students and the Department on the work they have done in the last number of years to come up with a model whereby predicted grades were able to satisfy the vast majority.  It is impossible to satisfy everyone with these things.  I appreciate this is difficult and talks are ongoing on this issue.  I ask that a final push be made on behalf of the students of the leaving certificate class of 2022 so they too can get a fair crack of the whip, so to speak, and that some form of predicted grades could be adopted to facilitate them.

That is important particularly for the habitats of cetaceans, given that in the past, links have been drawn between naval and military exercises and the mass stranding of whales and dolphins.  Ireland, as a neutral country, has always been strong on international law being the way in which we engage constructively.  This environmental law is an appropriate instrument through which we can engage, and we can then partner with appropriate civilian or scientific partners.

I made a request last week to the Minister for Transport to appear before the House for a debate on the plans.  To be optimistic about it, perhaps the backloading of the money from that Minister's Department is a reason for the absence of the roads from the list that was published before Christmas.

I say this advisedly so as not to get myself or anybody else into trouble.  It arises in the House almost every other week, and it is surprising nobody else is talking about the same issues in their local hospitals to the same extent as the three Senators.  If it is not arising in Beaumont Hospital, the Mater hospital, Letterkenny University Hospital or wherever, there is a reason for that, although we do not know what that reason is.  As Senators Gavan and Conway said, there have been announcements of spending commitments at the hospital in recent years.  It is not that the State is not putting the money there but that it seems to be just gobbled up, and as soon as new beds are provided, they seem to be gobbled up too and the problem seems to return.  Not only do I concur that a debate is needed but we need a wider examination of the exact problems.

For far too long in this country and somewhere after the 1980s, and maybe when the Celtic tiger came in the 1990s, we all got a little above ourselves thinking that we all had to be brain surgeons or stockbrokers.  The traditional professions that had been the backstop of hardworking, decent people in this country were suddenly uncool and yet we find ourselves at the moment with not enough bricklayers, carpenters, electricians and mechanics because they all left or did not train.  So it is certainly welcome that young people are looking at those professions again.<\/p><p>I saw an article the other day on how people pick their careers and research shows that people with a higher intelligence quotient, IQ,  are usually employed by people with not as high an IQ.  Moreover, we have far more entrepreneurs in the sectors that have been mentioned concerning apprenticeships than we have in any other part of Irish society.  It is welcome that we have got back to our roots and basics.<\/p><p>Senator Dolan spoke about the welcome announcement by the Minister for Transport yesterday on active travel.  Sometimes when these announcements are made, people say that we always talk about greenways or cycling but the bread and butter of yesterday's announcement is to fix the pathways in housing estates that are 20 and 30 years old, which are uneven because of trees growing.  It is the real, normal bread and butter stuff that county councillors work on day in, and day out, and lots of us here were county councillors.  It is not just about the wonderful advantages that we are going to have from a tourism perspective or even the exercise and health perspectives because of the greenways, walkways and blueways but is also just about the normal common or garden problems that we have in all of our villages and that are going to be solved by this money, which is great.<\/p><p>I wish to say to Senator Joe O'Reilly that I was struck by Fr. Murphy last week because of the hurt and the pain that young Eden's passing caused him.  He really did reach out and not just to the family and the wider community.  I refer to how touched Fr. Murphy was interacting with that young man and the devastation caused by the passing of Eden's life.  The Senator is right, and Senator Keogan has mentioned it here before, that people are very quick to stand up and give out about religious staff and sometimes that is deserved but not always, and certainly not everybody.  It is very few and seldom that we see people laud the work that they do in communities.  I know for sure from my own parish, and the priests who were in our parishes but who have gone to different parishes, and Senator Keogan will probably know who I am talking about, they are wonderful men who support communities and they certainly do not get the praise they deserve.  I thank Senator Joe O'Reilly for bringing up this matter.<\/p><p>Senator Carrigy talked about the warmer homes scheme and the fact that we need to examine measures to speed them up.  I will write a little note to the Minister this afternoon to ask him to come back to us with the plans for the short and medium term.  I take on board the use of language that he raised here this morning.  The language that we use is very important but it is something that has become accepted now but it should not be and should be challenged.  I thank the Senator for bringing the issue up this morning.<\/p><p>Senator Gallagher and others talked about the leaving certificate today.  I nearly feel sick listening to myself talk about it but that is probably because I have a young man at home who is studying and he will not let me forget about it.  My son constantly quotes to me what Deputy Barry says every single day because he is so impressed by him.<\/p><p>It is wonderful that 17 and 18-year-olds in the last couple of weeks have become politically attuned to what it is that we do because they are interested in the decisions that we are going to make, as they have a direct impact on them.  We read, periodically, how political parties are going to engage young people.  When one talks about what is important to them then they get engaged and that has really been shown in the last couple of weeks.  What is crucial this week is that we show that we have listened to young people and have heard what they have had to say.  I hope that the Minister and, indeed, the steering group really do understand the effects that stress due to Covid has had on them in the last number of years.  While we all welcome the fact that today we are going back to whatever the new normal is, their normal has not been anywhere near normal for the past 24 months and we need to take that into account.  <\/p><p>Senator McGreehan sought a debate on the future of SNAs.  At the moment the unions have a campaign on respect for SNAs.  We have spoken about this issue here before and it is something in which we should engage.  The 18,000 people who look after the care needs of children in school, and do it so well, should be applauded and supported, so I would agree with that.<\/p><p>Senators Lombard and Hoey spoke about the Russian interactions and intentions over the next couple of weeks.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, is obviously far more diplomatic than I would be when he described these things as unwelcome and unwarranted.  I think that there is something incredibly sinister and menacing about the actions.  We all know that this is far more than training with live missiles off the coast of a neutral country that does not have the monitoring capabilities.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Whether it is from a sonar perspective, as Senator Higgins has spoken about, from an ecological perspective or to pick up the tab for the damage it will potentially do, we all know something sinister is going on.  It is far from innocuous training that was going on.  I will leave it the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and his far better diplomatic skills to deal with it and to ensure we have the support of the European Union.  To that end, this morning I asked for a debate, because it is timely, and I have no doubt that they will not pull out between now and next week.  As soon as I have a date for that I will organise it in the schedule for next week.<\/p><p>Senator Horkan asked for a debate on remote working.  There will be one because the heads of the Bill that were passed by Cabinet this morning will go to the committee for pre-legislative scrutiny but it is probably important that we have a debate here to highlight all the good measures we have seen over the last two years and to weed out some of the harsh practices employers sometimes use.  We should make sure we see them coming before they sneak up.  I will organise that in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>Senator Currie has been speaking about remote working for years, long before it became cool during Covid.  It has accelerated people&rsquo;s acceptance of it and their appreciation of the fact that the two hours most people spend commuting every day do not need to be so spent.  The appreciation of being able to spend more time with our families is lovely.  One thing that was nice about the last two years was that participation in the workforce by women, or returnees as we call them, has increased by 3%.  That is massive and it is to be welcomed and worked upon.<\/p><p>Senator Fitzpatrick talked about O'Devaney Gardens and the welcome news that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage got the go-ahead from Cabinet this morning to proceed with those 1,000 plus homes that are so badly needed in that area.<\/p><p>I am sorry to say this to Senator Craughwell and I hope he understands but I cannot accept his amendment to the Order of Business only because I cannot get anybody today.  In the time since he raised the issue &ndash; and Senator Keogan first proposed it - I have secured a debate for next Wednesday on the search and rescue tender.  I have also instructed that without having the business case in our hands before the debate then the debate is fruitless.  To that end, I have also extended the time for the navigation Bill in order to get the Minister here for the afternoon.  I ask the Senator to accept that I will have that debate next Wednesday but not without the business case, which has been altered on the basis of the announcement that was made for the Cabinet this morning.  We all need to see it and I am surprised that the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications has not received it yet, given that it had requested it.  I hope that suffices and that we will have the debate next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012500002#AA00300","speaker":"1653","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643121000,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I thank the Leader.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012500002#CC00200","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speech","time":1643121000,"counter":92,"content":"<p>The Senator is dead right.  If nothing else he has the passion to keep bringing something he cares about to this House and to everybody&rsquo;s attention every week.  I have no doubt, whether he is right or wrong, that his bona fides will be appreciated by the end of this.<\/p> <p>Senator Seery Kearney talked about the massive increases in remote working hubs she will see in Dublin 8, which is welcome.  Again that forms part of the requirement for a debate on remote working.  Senator Murphy talked about the active travel money announcements yesterday.  He also talked about the paths and dangerous bends on our roads.  These are the bread and butter issues that we know mean so much to the people in our communities so I thank him for bringing that up.<\/p> <p>I was not here last week to welcome Senator Flynn back and I know she is not in the Chamber at the moment but like Senator Murphy I would like to welcome her back.  She is a massive addition to this Chamber.  We have probably been talking about leaving certificate reform since I did my leaving certificate and that is not today or yesterday.  It was appropriate and it stuck in my mind when she said the end of our school days should be about rewarding learning abilities and not just rewarding people who have good memories.  Unfortunately that is the way our leaving certificate model is established.<\/p> <p>The CAO points and the fact that there are only ten places for 25 people even though we need 30 nurses are bizarre and bonkers.  The last couple of years have forced our teachers' unions and the entire school community to do something they would have never done in a million years if we did not have to and if we did not have Covid.  It is a difficult task and I do not envy the Minister for Education because it is a difficult job.  Where there are people and negotiations there is always difficulty but we have shown that we can do it and that we can do it fairly.  There is grade inflation and that is the downside to it but we must increase the number of places we have on offer.  We acknowledge that if we had 1,000 new nurses tomorrow the HSE would be able to employ them and yet we only train 400 or 500 every year.  It makes no sense.  Let us find the places because we need the resources of the young men and women who want to be in those professions.  I welcome Senator Flynn back and thank her for her contribution.<\/p> <p>Senator Hoey talked about the Russians and I will organise a debate on that issue.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile spoke about welcoming D&aacute;il tours back, whether it is active age groups, school tours or Tidy Towns organisations.  It really will be lovely to see this place buzzing again the way it used to be over the last four years.  As the Senator said, a number of people who have been elected to both the D&aacute;il and Seanad in the last couple of years have never experienced this place when it is at full tilt so it will be really welcome.<\/p><p>Senator Keogan asked about bringing the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, into the House to make a statement about Covid certificates.  She is absolutely right.  I will contact his office this afternoon to try to arrange a date and come back to the Senator.  She is right, however.  Some of the things that have happened in the last number of years such as outdoor dining would never have been accepted in the psyche of Irish people.  We have always been these cold creatures who would sit outside and freeze.  The reality has been entirely different.  People have genuinely enjoyed the pedestrianisation and friendly family atmosphere that became evident in their towns and villages, and long may it last.  Whatever extensions to legislation or by-laws that need to be done should be done.  I will certainly bring it up with the Minister of State.<\/p><p>The Minister of State, Senator Hackett, talked about green shoots and her plans and ambitions for tree planting in this country which, again, is very welcome.  When somebody is talking about something they love, the passion just exudes from them and comes naturally, which is great.<\/p><p>Senator Ahearn spoke about passports with equal passion.  Again, we talk about the bread and butter issues that people bring to us.  It was an unprecedented disaster last year and given what we know about the pent-up backlog, I am not even sure that 300 staff will be enough.  It is welcome but as the Senator said, we absolutely need to see them now.  We need to see them immediately.  We need to see accelerated processes because the priority passports are no longer priorities.  People who apply online get them within two or three days while the priorities are waiting weeks.  As Members will know, a person cannot do his or her first application online when it comes to new children, plenty of whom have not been outside of the country in the last few years.  I will certainly bring the request for statements to the Minister as a priority.<\/p><p>Senator Malcolm Byrne opened today by encouraging those people who can afford to do so to go out and look after the people who have been absolutely crippled for the last couple of years, whether it is going to Copper Face Jacks, a local burger joint or even just out for a pint - a real pint of Guinness as opposed to a home-made one.  It is something we should all do to genuinely enjoy the company and sociability we have missed so much for the last 24 months.  There is an awful lot to be catching up on.  On a more serious note, the Senator talked about the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill and the need for the Minister to come back with reassurances that he and his committee colleagues made.  I will certainly send that note to the Minister today and hopefully be able to come back to the Senator as soon as I can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012500002#CC00300","speaker":"1653","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643121000,"counter":94,"content":"<p>Is the Leader inviting us all to Coppers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012500002#DD00200","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1643121000,"counter":95,"content":"<p>It was just Senator Byrne.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012500002#DD00300","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speech","time":1643121000,"counter":96,"content":"<p>That is a matter for the Leader.
