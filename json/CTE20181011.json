We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Seamus McCarthy, as a permanent witness to the committee and he is joined by Peter Kinsley, deputy director of audit.<\/p> <p>  Are the minutes of the meetings on 27 September and 4 October agreed?  Agreed.  <\/p> <p>  A couple of matters arise from the minutes which I want to move through quickly.  Some are of particular interest to our work.  In the minutes of the meeting of 27 September we referred to item of correspondence No. 1585 from the Minister for Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, regarding the Tax Appeals Commission which is doing an independent review of staffing requirements and it was agreed that the Department keep the committee updated on the review.  I do not think we have yet got a copy of the review.  The Minister announced on budget day that it was published.  It should be here by now and we want that urgently because the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is coming in next week.  <\/p> <p>  At that meeting we dealt with correspondence from Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills regarding the contribution of the religious congregations to the cost incurred by the State for residential institutional child abuse and he gave us an appendix in that letter, which we received on 23 July, about several properties and transactions that were to be completed by the end of quarter 3, 2018, which was the end of September.  We expect to see the outcome of that by next Thursday and to see whether that the promise made in July has been fulfilled.  We want that for next week because it should be completed.  It is a question of sending us that summary.  <\/p> <p>  In respect of correspondence No. 1507 from Mr. Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the general indemnity scheme that arose when we were talking about local authorities, he will be here next week to discuss the Office of Public Works, OPW.  We want that report before he comes in.  Nobody has any work to do on it.  I do not know how long the report has been sitting there.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101100002#B00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539244800,"counter":7,"content":"<p>It is also the insurer of the Education and Training Boards, ETBs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101100002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1539244800,"counter":8,"content":"<p>We did say in the minutes that we would include the national broadband plan and the information and communications technology, ICT, programme for the Department in our work programme for that meeting.  We want answers to every single item of correspondence we have sent to the Secretary General of the Department in recent months before he appears here next week.  Maybe we have got all the replies but I would like that doublechecked.<\/p> <p>  The next item arising out of the minutes of the last meeting, on 4 October, is that we noted all the financial statements over the course of the summer.  We noted with regard to No. 412, that the accounts of the Dublin Greyhound and Sports Association Limited were certified in June 2018 and were received in August 2018.  It received a clear audit opinion and the Comptroller and Auditor General noted on the documents given to us last week that the committee ceased trading in February 2017 and the agreement was reached for the sale of the premises, Harold's Cross Stadium, for &euro;23 million, which is sufficient to allow the company discharge its residential liability.  I think that is a fair assessment of how the price was arrived at.<\/p> <p>  Arising from the minutes we want a detailed report from the Department of Education and Skills on how it felt it was appropriate to spend &euro;23 million of the schools land acquisition budget to bail out the Irish Greyhound Board, IGB.  It would have been far more transparent if the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine had wanted to bail out the IGB and clear its debts to put in a supplementary Estimate and do it that way.  That might have been in breach of state aid rules but maybe it said if it put a value on the asset and got another Department to buy the asset for &euro;23 million perhaps that would not breach state aid rules.  I do not know if that was a factor.  Bord na gCon was in here some time ago a day or two after this sale was announced but there was a lack of candour.  It did not tell us that it had two in-house valuations discussed by its own board of &euro;6 million and &euro;12 million.  That was not made known to the committee. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101100002#B00400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1539244800,"counter":9,"content":"<p>It was the methodology-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101100002#B00500","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speech","time":1539244800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I am coming to that.

The Valuation Office is a State body and all State assets are a matter of concern to it, including the assets of Bord na gCon and the Department of Education and Skills.  It was not working for the Department, it was working for the State.  Whether that asset transferred for &euro;2 million, &euro;22 million or &euro;42 million is a matter of indifference to the Valuation Office because the land was staying in State ownership, either with the Greyhound Board or the Department of Education and Skills.  Its setting of a price is not the issue.  The issue is why the Department agreed to proceed with the payment of &euro;23 million.  It is very coincidental.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General remarked it was sufficient to allow the company, Dublin Greyhound Sports Association Limited discharge its residential liability.<\/p> <p>  I am suggesting that next Thursday, when the Department of Education and Skills is here with the Higher Education Authority, HEA, we must allocate a separate portion of the meeting, maybe before we bring in the HEA, whether it is 30 minutes or an hour, to discuss this payment out of its budget, if members are agreeable.  It is fishy to say the least that the Department of Education and Skills came up with &euro;23 million to solve the greyhound board's problem.

Under circular 11\/15 Bord na gCon as the seller, being a State body, was obliged to go to the Valuation Office.  It went to Savills, a private valuation company instead.  It never went to the Valuation Office.  My first question is why did it breach that circular.  The purchaser, the Department of Education and Skills, then had the valuation done on a property which it did not own and is counter to the circular because it is the State body selling that goes to the Valuation Office.  We now know the difference between the two prices which amounts to &euro;11 million.  We need to find out why the IGB did not go to the Valuation Office as it should have done and what prompted the Department of Education and Skills to go to the Valuation Office.  Surely it is aware of this circular too.  Would it not have found out that the IGB should have gone to it and if the IGB did not go to it and was aware of it did it not ask why?<\/p><p>Did the Department of Education and Skills not ask why it rather than the IGB was going to the Valuation Office, as per the protocol and the circular?  A reason would have been needed for the Department to be informed that it had to take an action, that being, to get the valuations done.  This brings me to the need to determine who knew what in the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Education and Skills.  There is no way that the latter could have gone to the Valuation Office, given that it would have been aware of the circular stating that the IGB should go to the Valuation Office.  Who told it?  How was the Department aware that it should go in breach of the circular?  Were there discussions between the two Departments and between Bord na gCon, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Education and Skills?  We need to find out all of that.  Ultimately, we need to find out why the Department of Education and Skills accepted the requirement to pay this amount of money, which I understand was &euro;23 million of a total budget for land purchases of &euro;28 million, or more than three quarters of its money for the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101100002#B00900","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539244800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>A number of members have indicated.

We all have constituencies, and I have several schools on my books for which I am trying to get sites acquired.  The Department has come back with reams of stuff to the effect that this or that site is not value for money, but those amounts pale into insignificance compared with Harold's Cross.

The overall question related to whether a bailout had been given by a Department to an organisation audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, namely, Bord na gCon, which is accountable to us, and whether the sale of the property was effectively that bailout.

For example, if I owe &euro;5,000 to Bank of Ireland and I have a &euro;5,000 overdraft in Permanent TSB, I pay the cheque off that.  When that is paid off, then I start paying off the Permanent TSB one and the money keeps going around in circles.  If this was a bailout for Bord na gCon, it should be called that.  Do not treat the people like fools and claim that this was worth &euro;23 million.  Pages 48 to 56 of the transcript of the meeting of 18 May 2017 contains the exchange on the valuation.  Bord na gCon stated that it had received a valuation from Savills.  Whether it was a red book valuation or one that was invoiced out at &euro;10,000 plus VAT, companies like Savills are not going to risk their reputations over a Mickey Mouse fee, which is what that amount would be to it, by valuing it at &euro;12 million and not referring to it as a formal valuation.  A valuation is a valuation.  It might not have been accompanied by the 50 pages and background material that accompany a full valuation, but neither was it a verbal or informal valuation of &euro;12 million that then became &euro;23 million.  In fact, it would not even become &euro;12.1 million.<\/p> <p>  This is a disgrace.  This is Departments clearing up the sloppiness of organisations' debts.  Arguably, Dublin City Council is implicated.  It voted down a rezoning for the private sector.  I am not saying that was right or wrong, but everyone was at the party.<\/p> <p>  My next point probably feeds into some of the matters that we will discuss with the OPW, but no one is paying the price.  Consider how this was structured.  If it was a State bailout of Bord na gCon, that is fine.  Was the Minister involved, did he know and did the Government sanction it?  If so, fair enough.  Alternatively, was this creative accounting by officials on the premise that a school was needed in that area - of course it is - and here was the money to pay for it?  A figure of &euro;23 million?  Forget it.  I valued it.  I do not have the experience of Savills, but zoned as it was, I think it amounted to &euro;750,000 per acre.  If it had the appropriate institutional zoning, that could have increased to &euro;1.5 million in cost to the Department of Education and Skills.  The Savills valuation was slightly higher than that at &euro;12 million.  I said at our previous meeting that, once Bord na gCon was prepared to supply it to us, we would see that the Savills valuation would be substantially less than &euro;23 million.  Although the witnesses told us that it was sensitive information because the deal had not yet been closed, I asked them to provide it to us for our examination.

The &euro;12 million valuation we hear about is now only &euro;12 million if it was for housing.  In fact, it was a lower valuation if it was for something else.  I think I recall &euro;6 million being talked about, so it is actually multiples of what the valuation was when one considers that if it had been a site for a school, the amount of the valuation would have been an issue.  What is really getting to be more than infuriating is that the word \"candour\" has been used in here and commercial sensitivity almost inhibits the candour we require of public bodies to hold them to account.  They can come in here and validly say a matter is commercially sensitive and that they cannot tell us whether there is a valuation, and then it can end up in the newspaper.  The whole issue of commercial sensitivity is therefore something we must find some way of defining or find a way through when we are trying to deal with an issue such as this.  It feels to me like they bought something in Limerick, they ran into trouble, they were not getting the numbers in Limerick, they had to sell one of the assets, the asset that would get them out of trouble was Harold's Cross, but Harold's Cross would not get them out of trouble unless it was of a particular value, and it was not of that particular value if the valuation that appeared in the newspaper at the weekend was the true valuation.

It strikes me now that maybe they were not, given the information we have, which to me is serious.  What was fishy, to use the Chairman's word, at the time was that the valuation, or what was actually paid, almost hit the bulls eye in terms of the debts that were owed.  That is what jumped out of the pages - why does the valuation pretty much come in at the amount in legacy debts the organisation had?  It seems that our concerns and what was pretty obvious to many of us at the time have now come to pass.  A separate session is therefore needed, to be fair, to get to the bottom of this.

There are issues surrounding CervicalCheck and how the audit was carried out.  That plays into what Dr. Scally said yesterday to the effect that, because the audit process had concentrated only on women who had cancer, it was not really a proper audit.  It was never recorded in the risk register.  There are issues at Mount Carmel with the private operator which is managing it.  It was meant to be managed on a temporary basis, but it will now be long-term.  The company is owned by Mr. Denis O'Brien, something which will raise concerns for some as he seems to have his finger in lots of pies.

We will also hold over No. 1561.  There is nothing new in any of it.  However, No. 1609 is new.  It is correspondence, dated 2 October 2018, received from Mr. Derek Finnegan of the parliamentary affairs division of the Department of Health on a capacity review, providing information requested by the committee on the health service capacity review, including details of the audit of empty beds in public hospitals.  We will note and publish the correspondence, to which we will come back.<\/p><p> No. 1614 is from Mr. Nick Reddy, private secretary to the Taoiseach, in response to our inquiry regarding data protection issues and commissions of investigation.  This seems to be a copy; we dealt with the matter previously.  The letter states that changing the terms of reference of a commission of investigation would not change the general law which applies to commissions of investigation and data protection.  In other words, the Taoiseach was saying that they have powers of the High Court when carrying out their investigations.  In the context of data protection, therefore, they can make their own orders regardless.  We will publish that.<\/p><p> The next item is correspondence held over from the last meeting.  There is correspondence from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General, Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  We have noted it before and we hold it over.<\/p><p> No. 1572 is related to the previous item.  We have noted it and held it over.<\/p><p> Nos. 1605 and 1616 relate to the remediation of a landfill site in County Wicklow.  We will note and hold that over.  At our meeting on 27 September, we agreed to send the response from the Department to the correspondent and last week we noted that the secretariat had done this.  The individual has since responded to say that he believes the issues will be ventilated and resolved in due course.  We note this correspondence.<\/p><p> Nos. 1611 and 1612, dated 4 October 2018, are from an individual regarding human resources, HR, practices in the HSE.  We sent the individual a response received from the HSE which confirmed that all divisions of the organisation and the section 38 agencies were notified of the provisions of the agreement and of the necessity of advising those who had been unsuccessful in their applications for regularisation or who had otherwise not received any outcome to their applications.  This further correspondence requests that committee make inquiries with the HSE regarding evidence that it circulated the circular to the relevant staff.  I propose to forward the item to the HSE - in redacted form, if necessary - for a response to the questions raised.  This is an ongoing issue.  The HSE claims that it informed everybody about this matter regarding one of the pay agreements.  People could apply for regularisation.  Members of staff are saying that they never received notice and, as a result, we want the HSE to prove its statement that people were notified.  If there was a breakdown in communication from the top level to the people on the ground, we need to know where it happened.<\/p><p> No. 1613 is correspondence, dated 29 September 2018, from an individual questioning the Department of Defence's spending on ships at a time when, according to the correspondent, wages and allowances are driving personnel out of the Naval Service.  Essentially, this correspondence states that we have eight naval ships but only enough staff for seven.  The Naval Service is bringing a ninth ship into service.  There might only be sufficient staff for six by the time that vessel comes into service.  While this is a staffing issue, it is also a financial issue because what is the point in having nine vessels if we do not have the people to man them?  We are writing to the Secretary General of the Department of Defence for a detailed response.<\/p><p> No. 1615 is from a co-ordinator in Chartered Accountants Voluntary Advice.  We dealt with this at a previous meeting.  The secretariat has already sent the transcript to the correspondent and communicated the decision of the committee which was that we considered the matter closed at our previous meeting.  I think the correspondence essentially crossed in the post; that is all.<\/p><p> No. 1617 dated 5 October 2018 is from the whistleblowers who corresponded with the committee regarding issues at the University of Limerick.  We had said that we would meet them and they are inquiring about where that stands.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report on handling of remuneration for certain senior staff in the University of Limerick and the Institute of Technology Sligo is related to this and is with the Minister.  We expect to receive it shortly.  I propose that we arrange a meeting following that to engage with the two whistleblowers mentioned.  We will inform them accordingly.  I ask the secretariat to set up the meeting with those people and to come back to us with a time for it.<\/p><p> No. 1623 is correspondence from Deputy David Cullinane providing radio clips relating to Waterford Institute of Technology and the McLoone report.

We are now in October of the following year and there is still no report.<\/p> <p>  The concerns I raised at our previous meeting were not necessarily directed at Waterford Institute of Technology, they were directed at the HEA and whether it had dotted the i's and crossed the t's with the terms of reference and, perhaps, overreached in the context of the scope of the report.  Anything we put on the record is a matter of fact.  We know, as a matter of fact, that strong legal letters were issued by a number of individuals, as is their right.  They felt that the draft report might have been unfair to them.  That is how it appears and that is what Dr. Love told us previously.<\/p> <p>  Obviously the HEA needs to protect itself.  I have no difficulty with that.  People are entitled to due process.  If people have concerns, they have a right to take legal action and that is what is happening.  At no point did anyone ever undermine their right to do that.  However, what the Accounting Officer and the president of the institute said is that I was trying to deconstruct 20 years' hard work by the institute, that I was being negative, that I was trying to do down Waterford and that my motivations were not to protect the staff at the institute.  He suggested that there was an ulterior motive.  I am dealing with facts.  I have not responded publicly because he talked about due process.  This is due process.  The Committee of Public Accounts has a job to do.  I will respond at the Committee of Public Accounts, which is part of the due process to which he refers.<\/p> <p>  We received a letter from the Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, which represents the staff.  Members of staff obviously approached the union and stated that, having come forward and been part of a process where the HEA was conducting a review, they are concerned that there is nothing at the end of it and that they feel isolated.  That is their concern; it is not an invention of mine or an invention of any other member of the Committee of Public Accounts, it is real.<\/p> <p>  There a number of different issues arising.  There is an attempt by the Accounting Officer - he used the words himself - that I should stop asking questions.  I resent being told by an Accounting Officer that I should stop asking questions.  Even by saying that, it makes it very difficult for me to raise these issues again.  I will raise them in any event because I will not be deterred.  We need to get information from the HEA as to whether the report will ever be published.  Does it need to go back to the drawing board?  Where is it?  What is its status?  It is reasonable that we get responses to those questions.  It is very disingenuous and almost unprecedented for an Accounting Officer to attack, in my view, a member of the Committee of Public Accounts on his local radio station in that way and to suggest that I have an ulterior motive.  I do not have to defend myself; I think my record speaks for itself.  I represent the city and county of Waterford.  I will always do that to the best of my ability.  I have no ulterior motive other than to protect and defend staff who work at the institute and who have raised concerns separate from those articulated in the TUI report.  I have received separate emails from individuals who go further and say they are concerned that they came forward.  I have not put any of that into the public domain.<\/p> <p>  I seek the Chair's protection in the first instance.  Accounting Officers - especially this Accounting Officer - should understand there would be no HEA review if it were not for the Committee of Public Accounts.  That is due process.  There would not have been any examination of this if the Committee of Public Accounts had not examined it.  That is due process.  It is perfectly reasonable for me or anybody else to ask questions about the status of a report that should have been published in September 2017.  We can all be vulnerable.  It happened to Deputy Kelly in the past, although that was political.  It is a horse of a different colour when an Accounting Officer says, \"I want to take on Cullinane and look forward to taking him on at the Committee of Public Accounts.\"  That is a bit much; it is overstepping the mark.  I am uncomfortable with his choice of language and with the way in which he has chosen to respond to issues.<\/p><p> I will make a final point.  Given that he was the vice president of research and development who oversaw the process that is being examined, to then attack me in this way is highly problematic and unusual.  I am very concerned about it and have put my concerns on record.  I will continue to ask questions without fear or favour.  Whether issues impact locally, regionally or nationally, we are here to do a job and I will do my job.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101100002#F00800","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539244800,"counter":136,"content":"<p>A couple of other people have indicated.

It does have implications for us and needs to be responded to.  This is an Accounting Officer.  This is somebody who has a responsibility to come and be held to account by the Committee of Public Accounts.  He said there has been a breach in due process, called into question the motivations behind the questions being asked, and claimed that false information was being put into the public record which, in view, is not the case.<\/p> <p>  In general overall terms, in my view, and the words were used that the Deputy, which is me, - he did not refer to me by my first name or call me a Deputy but I will leave that aside - should stop asking questions and stop doing what he is doing.

My understanding is that he sought to redraft some elements of it.  The report, as with all of these reports, goes out into the institute.  Obviously people then have an opportunity to respond, which they did.  They then got a number of legal letters, which were with the legal unit of the HEA.  Dr. Love hoped that he would be able to resolve all of that and then produce a draft report very quickly.  Unfortunately, six months have elapsed and we are nowhere closer to having the report. <\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General is preparing a separate report, which is only one element.  It is one company.  We will have that report, which will give us an opportunity to invite the Accounting Officer to return here.

We have covered what is to be dealt with at the meeting on 25 October.<\/p><p>On 1 November we have scheduled a meeting with Revenue to discuss a couple of interesting chapters in the report, as well as its annual report.  I am asking for a letter to be sent to the Department of Finance and Revenue seeking an explanation for the extra &euro;700 million in tax that arrived from the multinational corporation sector.  I have no problem with the money arriving and will explain why we need the note.  We have been told that this money came to be paid because of changes in accounting rules.  My view is that these changes in accounting rules were well known a year or two out.  They did not happen during the course of the year.  Regardless of whether the moneys relate to the accounts for the last accounting year, or even this accounting year, the rules were well known and established.  When the Department was drawing up its estimates of corporation tax receipts for this year, it must have known that the rules had changed.  It did not happen this year.  It was well known at least a year ago and possibly two.  I want to know about the work done by Revenue and the Department in the knowledge that the accounting rules were going to change in a way that would affect corporation tax receipts.  This has been known for quite some time.  What work was done by Revenue and the Department to estimate how much in additional taxation the rule changes would bring in?  Is it possible that there could have been a loss of corporation tax, depending on how it worked?  I do not believe the Department did not know this was in the offing.  I do not accept it.  If I were to accept that it did not know about the rule changes, I would be saying it was utterly incompetent.  We want to receive information notes from Revenue and the Department breaking down the details of this matter.  They can work together to clear the relevant memos.  If we were to ask just one of them to clear up this matter, it would tell us that the other one had the answers and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  We are asking the question.  We need to know these things.  It was probably well known at the time of last year's estimates that there was a possibility that much more would be taken in.  Perhaps it was decided to hold it in reserve.  We need to be a little more transparent and accurate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101100002#K01900","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1539244800,"counter":276,"content":"<p>Is it possible that other rule changes might lead to more windfalls?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101100002#K02000","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1539244800,"counter":277,"content":"<p>That is a good follow-through question.  We should ask whether other changes in accounting rules might affect corporation tax receipts positively or negatively.  It is good for Ireland that the changes have had a positive effect, but the opposite could also have been the case.  We will ask whether there are other potential changes.  We will also ask what Revenue and the Department of Finance are doing to estimate the impact of the changes on receipts.  A few years ago, we used to have big debates here about the inadequacy of the estimates of receipts of taxation prepared by Revenue and the Department.  I know that, depending on the economic cycle, it can be difficult to make such estimates, but Revenue and the Department should have known about this one.  We will have representatives from the Revenue Commissioners before us on 1 November.<\/p> <p>  The following week - on 8 November - we will consider matters related to cervical cancer and thalidomide litigation.  We will examine how the State Claims Agency is handling all of these cases.  The thalidomide issue is long-standing.<\/p> <p>  On 15 November we will ask the Department of Health about the hepatitis C fund, which has cost &euro;1.5 billion to date.  We really need to know what lessons have been learned.  If lessons had been learned in dealing with the hepatitis C issue, we would not be heading into what we are heading into in dealing with the cervical cancer issue, potentially at major cost to the Exchequer.

It lasted approximately three and a half hours.  We had a detailed discussion on information coming out on this area and we should be concerned about it.  It is important to have the correct lines of demarcation between the committees in order that we do not fall into issues in the way we did in the past.  If there is a clear demarcation line, this committee will be responsible for looking at the contracts, the tendering process and the money spent on those matters.  I ask the clerk to the committee to liaise with the clerk to the health committee.  After I asked questions yesterday, Dr. Scally revealed that he had received no documents for the tendering process.  He has found that the HSE shredded them as soon as the time limits were up, which is the only example of efficiency on the part of the HSE that he has found.  Now the HSE has to go to the laboratories to obtain copies of its own tender documents.  The second extraordinary thing is that, even now, Dr. Scally cannot guarantee that the HSE has provided him with every version of every contract with every laboratory.  The third extraordinary thing is that Dr. Scally does not know whether there were other examples of laboratory work being outsourced in the past ten years.  He does not know where it begins and ends but thinks he has some of it.  However, he cannot guarantee that there were no more examples.  The demarcation line that applies to this committee relates to our responsibility to examine the spending of taxpayers' money.  It is important for this committee to liaise with the health committee to hone in on these areas in advance of our meeting on 8 November.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101100002#K02400","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1539244800,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I totally agree.

The 2017 appropriation account for Vote 13 - Office of Public Works records gross expenditure of just over &euro;394 million.  Appropriations-in-aid were almost &euro;34 million, resulting in net voted expenditure of just over &euro;360 million.  The surplus for surrender at the year-end was &euro;4.6 million.  The appropriation account is presented under two programme headings: flood risk management, on which a total of &euro;75 million was spent, and estate portfolio management, in respect of which the total expenditure was &euro;319 million.  The graphic that is shown on screen outlines the main areas of expenditure in 2017.<\/p> <p>  In addition to activities funded by the Vote, the OPW acts on an agency basis in the property management area, mainly managing capital works projects on behalf of other Departments and agencies and leasing accommodation for small State agencies.  The associated expenditure is reflected in the accounts of the client Departments and agencies.  Total expenditure handled by the OPW on an agency basis amounted to &euro;84 million in 2017.<\/p> <p>  I issued a clear audit opinion in regard to the appropriation account but drew attention to procurement in 2017 to the value of &euro;812,000 that was not compliant with public procurement rules.  This is disclosed by the Accounting Officer in the statement on internal financial control.<\/p> <p>  The OPW signed a new, 25 year lease in May 2017 in respect of large office premises at Miesian Plaza in Baggot Street, mainly to accommodate the Department of Health and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Even though lease payments were incurred from December 2016, the premises remained unoccupied until May 2018.  Chapter 6 of my report examines the issues that gave rise to the delay in occupying the premises and a number of other matters related to the lease.<\/p> <p>  The Miesian Plaza lease represents a very significant commitment of public funds, with annual rent starting at &euro;10 million and subject to five-year rent reviews in line with inflation over the 25 year period of the lease.  The examination found little evidence of the key elements of a standard business case that should support the commitment of that level of public funds.  In particular, there was little evidence of detailed evaluation of other options, no economic appraisal was carried out and the full costs and risks associated with the project were not documented and considered in advance.<\/p> <p>  In March 2016, the OPW board approved the lease on the basis of the terms negotiated by consultants on its behalf.  At that stage, it was envisaged that, allowing for a fit-out period of eight to ten months, the premises would be ready for occupancy in the first quarter of 2017.  As it turned out, the first occupancy was achieved only in May 2018 and full occupancy was achieved only in July 2018.  We estimated that the delays that occurred from March 2017 resulted in ineffective expenditure on unoccupied premises of around &euro;11 million.<\/p> <p>  There was extensive engagement between the OPW and the two main client Departments in seeking to achieve timely occupancy of the leased premises.  The main issues that gave rise to delay were finalisation of the number of staff to be accommodated and agreement on the layout of the accommodation and on shared facilities.  Currently, Miesian Plaza does not have capacity to accommodate all of the staff of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the expected future staffing needs of both Departments.  Currently, the OPW targets a space allocation of 12 sq. m per person.  In Miesian Plaza the space allocation achieved is 15.3 sq. m per person, about 27% more than the target level.  The report recommends that the OPW review its approach to agreeing accommodation needs with Departments and that it should establish standards for space allocation and fit-out that take account of the business needs of different categories of occupant.<\/p><p>The examination also identified an issue with the area of the premises to which the agreed rental rate was applied.  There are different standards for measuring property which result in different reported areas for a building.  The rental rate agreed for Miesian Plaza was based on what is known as the net internal area.  From 2016, a new international property measurement standard was introduced and measurement of Miesian Plaza on this basis resulted in a larger reported area.  The rental rate agreed should have been adjusted <i>pro rata<\/i>to reflect the change in the basis of measurement.  However, this did not happen and the signed lease applied the rate per square metre negotiated on the basis of the net internal area to the larger area, as measured by the new standard.  We estimated that this error resulted in annual rent that was &euro;344,000 higher than what was negotiated.  After taking account of inflation, the projected additional cost to the Exchequer is of the order of &euro;10 million over the 25-year term of the lease.  At the time of finalisation of the report, the Office of Public Works stated that it had engaged with the landlord with a view to rectifying the matter.<br\/><br\/>The examination team reviewed a sample of 20 other live OPW leases with various start dates, and identified one other possible excess payment case in that sample.  This involves a 20-year lease entered into in 2006 where confusion about measurement appears to have resulted in an excess annual payment of some &euro;141,000.  I understand the OPW is examining that case. <br\/><br\/>I thank the Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101100002#M00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539244800,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Buckley to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101100002#N00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539244800,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for introducing my colleagues.

Temporarily at least, we have taken a step backwards but not in the whole organisation.<br\/><br\/>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to present to the Committee of Public Accounts the expenditure and works of the Office of Public Works across its different areas of activity.  The OPW is the lead body responsible for flood risk management and the stewardship of the nation&rsquo;s national monuments and historic properties.  Through these activities, the OPW interacts with and supports communities and local authorities in every county in Ireland. <br\/><br\/>The third primary area of OPW activity is the management of the State&rsquo;s modern property estate, including accommodation for Government staff and numerous specialist facilities such as Garda stations, courthouses, laboratories, data centres and customs infrastructure, which has become topical again now in the context of Brexit.  I provided an information briefing on Garda accommodation in advance of this meeting.  Later in this statement, I will address the matters raised in Chapter 6 of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report titled, Lease of Offices at Miesian Plaza.<br\/><br\/>The OPW is responsible for a range of other important functions, including the State art collection, the day-to-day running of &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in and organising State visits and events.  Recent examples of events include the May referendum, the visit of Pope Francis in August and the upcoming inauguration of the President.<br\/><br\/>As Members are aware, flooding is a natural phenomenon which can cause widespread damage and have a devastating effect on communities, property and infrastructure.  We have to think only of the poor people in Spain who suffered a disaster of flash flooding in the past couple of days when ten people lost their lives.  This risk is likely to increase in the future due to rising sea levels and other potential effects of climate change.  The Government has recognised these risks and committed &euro;1 billion of capital investment to flood risk management over the next decade.<br\/><br\/>The OPW has responsibility for leading and co-ordinating the implementation of the national flood risk policy, which involves the development of a planned programme of works.  In 2017, the OPW completed the largest study of flood risk ever undertaken in the history of the State, the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme.  The CFRAM programme involved analysis of flood risk across 300 designated communities, including 90 coastal areas and the production of 29 flood risk management plans with a prioritisation of those measures that can manage the assessed flood risk nationwide.  It includes building our capability to protect 95% of properties assessed to be at risk through 118 new flood relief schemes in addition to the 75 schemes that are complete or under way.<br\/><br\/>This capital programme was launched on the 3 May 2018 and we are now moving into the detailed development and implementation of these measures with the local authorities.  During 2017, the OPW carried out capital works at a cost of more than &euro;45 million, including the completion of major projects at Bray and Foynes; the substantial progression of construction on schemes at Bandon, Skibbereen, the River Dodder, Claregalway and Dunkellin River; the provision of more than &euro;2 million to local authorities to carry out minor flood works; the commencement of new schemes in Athlone and Templemore; and the progression of design work on a large number of other major schemes to be implemented in the coming years.  In addition, the OPW maintains all arterial drainage schemes completed by it under the Arterial Drainage Act 1945.  This investment involves providing ongoing protection to 263,000 ha of agricultural land through the annual maintenance programme for 11,500 km of river channel, including 800 km of embankments.<br\/><br\/>My office manages a range of other measures to tackle flood risk, including the OPW minor flood mitigation and coastal protection scheme in partnership with local authorities.  A total of 500 projects have been completed under this scheme protecting 6,500 properties, two thirds of which are outside the CFRAM study areas.<br\/><br\/>The OPW continues to support and co-ordinate sectoral led work on non-structural solutions to help protect and-or mitigate flood risk.  Key to these solutions is the development by Met &Eacute;ireann, in conjunction with the OPW, of a national flood forecasting service.  Also, a new website, <i>www.floodinfo.ie<\/i>, has been developed by the OPW.  This is an important resource in supporting emergency response planning by local authorities and empowering people and communities to plan and respond to their flood risk. <br\/><br\/>As caretakers of the built heritage estate, the OPW is responsible for the management, conservation, maintenance and presentation of some 780 national monuments and 70 OPW managed heritage sites.  Responsibilities include the day-to-day management and presentation of 30 major historical properties, gardens, parks and arboreta.<br\/><br\/>The OPW has consistently been of the opinion that the importance of the State&rsquo;s national heritage cannot be overestimated, either in a cultural or economic sense.  This is especially true in the context of rural regeneration and is borne out by the increase, year on year, of the number of visitors to these sites.  The OPW enjoyed a very successful 2017 with a record total of 7.9 million visitors to OPW managed heritage sites.  The leading visitor sites continue to do remarkably well, including Dublin Castle, Kilmainham Gaol, the Rock of Cashel and the Phoenix Park, the largest city park in Europe and an enormous green resource for the people of Dublin. <br\/><br\/>In addition, a strategic partnership with the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and F&aacute;ilte Ireland has enabled the OPW to develop and enhance tourism investment possibilities within the cultural and heritage estate.  The broad focus of this programme is to enhance the visitor experience at sites managed by the OPW, with particular reference to less visited sites so that a greater volume of increased footfall on a wider base can be sustained.  This will ensure that we continue to increase tourism numbers and the generation of Exchequer revenue.<br\/><br\/>Efficient and modern accommodation is a key requirement for the successful delivery of many Government priorities.  Estate management by the OPW is an all encompassing discipline of strategically aligning the use of State and leased property with Government priorities while ensuring value for money through the optimal use of resources.  Estate management includes the acquisition and disposal of properties and leases, essential property maintenance, necessary development and retrofits and the provision of storage and mechanical and engineering works to more than 70 different client Departments and public bodies.  In order to facilitate the management of that portfolio the OPW is developing a much needed estate management system which will shortly go live in the office.<\/p><p>The system will provide centralised information to staff, which will allow for effective and efficient estate management planning in the commercial environment within which the office operates.<\/p><p> On climate change, members will be aware that the recent Citizens' Assembly recommended that the State take a leadership role in addressing this risk through mitigation measures, including retrofitting and renewables generation on public buildings.  The OPW portfolio consists of more than 2,500 properties and the total investment was &euro;319 million in 2017, which included the fit-out of several properties, including Miesian Plaza.<\/p><p> I will now turn to the Comptroller and Auditor General's chapter on the lease of offices at Miesian Plaza.  The lease was part of the OPW accommodation strategy to move staff from Hawkins House, a large, end-of-life building, to a fourth generation energy-efficient building that could support almost 1,000 staff.  Miesian Plaza, at approximately 15,000 sq. m, is the largest lease acquisition that the OPW has secured in recent years and has 936 workstations.  The imperative of acquiring a new headquarters for the Department of Health arose from the deteriorating condition of Hawkins House which was constructed in the early 1960s.  In addition, the lease on a property on Mespil Road which accommodated the Department of Children and Youth Affairs was due to expire and could no longer cater for the expanding requirements of that Department.<\/p><p> Following a review of the available properties in what was an exceptionally tight market, Miesian Plaza on Baggot Street was identified as the most suitable option for the Departments of Health and Children and Youth Affairs and certain units of the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.  Central to its acceptance as a potential location was its proximity to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The OPW retained an independent professional negotiation team to determine if a satisfactory commercial arrangement could be concluded.  Following several months of engagement with the landlord, the negotiation team secured a 25-year lease at approximately 15% below the prevailing market rent.  With the addition of five-year rent reviews linked only to the consumer price index, the deal effectively insulates the State against any significant or erratic market fluctuations in the medium term.  In the context of the rising Dublin property market, which is related to Brexit, the OPW considers this index linking to be of significant benefit.<\/p><p> The large-scale permanent relocation of any group of staff is a challenging task.  This was particularly complex in the Miesian Plaza project because of the physical and cultural challenges of moving almost 1,000 staff spread across four major Departments.  It is a common misunderstanding that the identification of a building and securing of lease terms are effectively the end of the process and that people just move in.  In fact, it is only at this stage that the fit-out process which transforms the building from a grey shell to a habitable modern office and takes up to ten months can commence.  These issues were particularly intense in the Miesian Plaza project in light of the ground-breaking steps being taken relating to open plan work spaces and a dramatic reduction in the use of cellular offices.  The project very quickly moved from one involving mere bricks and mortar to one encompassing human relationships and business process reform.  In the OPW&rsquo;s experience, it is quite common that staff and business considerations trump those relating to the physical building in terms of complexity and the time needed to complete the project.<\/p><p> Reflecting on the project, I suspect that some aspects, including the change management process, were underestimated by all involved, including the OPW.  The protracted discussions designed to ensure buy-in and to bring everybody along on a difficult journey undoubtedly caused delays.  The cost of the delay is very much regretted by the OPW and, I am sure, all those associated with the project.<\/p><p> It is rare for major projects to progress without some problems.  The Miesian Plaza project experienced problems, including the aforementioned programme overrun and an issue relating to the application of a new measurement standard.  Although those issues serve to lessen the very significant value negotiated, the demonstrable benefits of the overall deal and ground-breaking business transformation outcomes significantly outweigh all other considerations.  The building secured by the OPW will serve as a flagship for the State&rsquo;s property portfolio for the next 25 years while accommodating some of the most important Departments in a leadership in energy and environmental design, LEED, platinum-rated office accommodation.<\/p><p> I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff for their assistance and courtesy during the audit.  I have no doubt that the committee and Chairman will have questions on the matters I have raised.

The second issue is also related to the Office of Public Works.  The Committee of Public Accounts issued its periodic report on 23 January 2018 and one of the issues it dealt with was the reopening Garda stations.  One of the recommendations of our report was that the cost implications of the review to reopen Garda stations should be considered in the context of the 2018 Estimates.  This need not be written down.  The report was published by the Committee of Public Account.  We recently received a response to our recommendation from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 18 July 2018.  We sent a letter to his Department in January 2018 asking that the costs of reopening Stepaside Garda station and some other Garda stations be considered in the context of the 2018 Estimates, bearing in mind that the decision was made in June 2017.  We reported on that in January 2018.<\/p><p>Mr. Watt's reply states:<\/p><blockquote>The Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform is informed by the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that this recommendation is accepted in principle.  The 2018 estimate provision for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is long since complete. However, over recent months, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of Public Works have been working to quantify the final projected costs to reopen all six stations.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na indicates that the estimated costings produced will be reviewed and discussed with the sanctioning authorities, the Departments of Justice and Equality and Public Expenditure and Reform, once concluded.<\/blockquote><p>As Chairman of the Committee on Public Accounts, I find it totally unsatisfactory that the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform took seven months to reply to our recommendation.  We wrote to Mr. Watt early in the year to give him plenty of advance notice for this matter to be raised in the Estimates in 2018.  He wrote to us in July saying he was sorry but the Estimates were over.  The matter should have been encompassed in the 2018 Estimate, as recommended by this committee.  Mr. Watt states that while he agrees in principle with our recommendation, it is too late.  That is an unsatisfactory response and delay and we want to ensure there is accountability.  Given that it may not have happened in 2018, I will put a question on it to Mr. Buckley now because this follows directly from the report we published.  If we are to do our business, we need to follow through on our recommendations.  Mr. Buckley says in his briefing note today that in February 2018 he received the final brief in respect of Stepaside.  He said the OPW has to issue a notice to quit in respect of Stepaside, that it considered a modular solution and is now renovating the existing building, which it hopes to have completed by the end of June 2019.  I have seen the Estimates announced by the Minister on budget day.  What figure for the reopening of Stepaside Garda station is provided in the Estimates for 2019, given that none was provided in the 2018 Estimate? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101100002#P04900","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539244800,"counter":409,"content":"<p>The cost of reopening Stepaside and the other six Garda stations would be provided through the Department of Justice and Equality under the Garda Vote.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101100002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Buckley"},{"type":"speech","time":1539244800,"counter":410,"content":"<p>To clarify, the public will be confused and Mr. Buckley will have to bear with me as I try to help the public.

If we were to take, for example, a one-year, rent-free period, it would mean the rent for the other 24 years would be correspondingly higher.  In terms of the rent reviews based on the CPI, each time the index would be applied to a higher figure.  We have done some internal calculations that show the State would have lost between &euro;5 million and &euro;6 million had we had a one-year, rent-free period on this lease.  Our normal practice is to try to negotiate a rent-free period to allow for the fit-out and everything else, but in this case because of the CPI linkage, the circumstances surrounding the deal and the negotiation, what was beneficial for both parties and what was the best deal that could be obtained, we obtained a deal for roughly 15% below market rent.

The fit-out of a building this complex takes in the region of ten months.

When we get it, it is a shell or core and it is basic.  It is the same as anything else.  There was a delay &ndash; I am not saying there was no delay &ndash; but we must put a perspective on this.  We needed approval to start the contractor on the fit-out in January 2017 as soon as we had possession.  We were not able to give the go-ahead to the developer until July 2017 because we did not have sufficient agreement between the OPW and the client Departments.  That is a six-month delay.

The answer to what Mr. Buckley has said is \"No\".<\/p> <p>  That is my frustration with this situation and with so many other public bodies that come before the committee having squandered public money.  The attitude is that they will hunker down, maybe say \"Sorry\" and get a rap on the knuckles .  Then they are out the door until next year and life goes on.  It goes on for the OPW but it does not go on as normal for thousands of our citizens because of OPW's actions.  We do not talk about this enough.  More specifically, as the Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out, there was a lack of action and failure to act.  I have a hostel in my home town of Navan, close to the OPW headquarters in Trim, that has vacant sites.  I am repeatedly told there is no money to provide that.  I can tell Mr. Buckley that &euro;11 million would do a good deal for that.  I have a Garda chief superintendent who is looking for a divisional headquarters in Meath but there is no progress on that or even a straight answer from the OPW in respect of the site acquisition for that.  The impact of the people in the OPW flittering away &euro;11 million has consequences for whether money being available for services that the public desperately need.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Buckley has come before the committee and his statement referred to how there was a difficult journey to bring everyone along and how it undoubtedly caused delays.  It was a difficult journey.  Mr. Buckley should note they were not carrying their crosses to Golgotha; they were going from Hawkins House to Baggot Street.  The fact is that rows were documented in the report about open-plan space, who would have an office or whether the water cooler would go in a given corner.  That resulted in &euro;11 million of ineffective expenditure.  It is a complete and utter scandal.  The attempt to say before the committee that it was a good deal is inexcusable.<\/p> <p>  Since there is ineffective expenditure on a grand scale at this level, the culture seeps down throughout the organisation.  We have seen it with other bodies here and it has happened here as well.  I will ask Mr. Buckley one more time about this deal.

I do not accept that it is anything to do with the distance between the two buildings.  It has a great deal to do with the nature of the buildings.

The interaction revolved around the points mentioned.  They were the critical building differences which would result in business process differences.  In fairness to the Departments involved, they accepted early on that, in the nature of the building move, it would not be possible or correct to provide cellular offices for the same number of people or anything like it, as was the case in Hawkins House.  The Departments agreed with the OPW that it was a big change and step forward for the public sector in general that a particular grade, the assistant principal officer grade, would be housed in open plan office space in Miesian Plaza.  It was the first time it had been done on a large scale in the Civil Service or the public sector.  It was at a time when we were recovering from a recession, dealing with a clawback under the Haddington Road agreement, while the Department of Health was dealing with issue after issue in managing the health service.  We took on those issues, but it was difficult and took much negotiation during the year.  I saw some difficult periods when people were trying to do their best in the public interest in representing different bodies.  It was not just about staffing issues.  It was also about management being sure its system could be run.  We could not risk jeopardising the work of the Department of Health in the move.  If it could not function properly for even one month, can one think of the devastation it would have caused?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101100002#V00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Buckley"},{"type":"speech","time":1539244800,"counter":614,"content":"<p>I want to get into those issues.  There were many issues at the time.  People were losing their jobs and whether they were in a cellular or open plan office was not their concern.  I acknowledge that in December 2016 Mr. Buckley initiated meetings to resolve the ongoing issues.<\/p> <p>  Chapter 6.41 of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General states the &ldquo;OPW has a directive power in relation to civil service office accommodation [but] it did not exercise that power in this case&rdquo;.  That is an important point that I would like Mr. Buckley to consider.  The Comptroller and Auditor General stated the OPW did not exercise that power because it felt &ldquo;far more effective when engaging with client Departments in relation to office relocations&rdquo; and &ldquo;that directive powers are useful in certain situations but are a &lsquo;blunt instrument&rsquo; and ... would not have dealt with the complete culture change associated with a move from &lsquo;cellular&rsquo; to open plan layouts&rdquo;.  In his opening statement Mr. Buckley stated: &ldquo;In the OPW&rsquo;s experience, it is quite common that staff ... considerations trump those relating to the physical building itself&rdquo;.  What stage does it have to reach for the protection of the take from the public purse to trump the feelings of the people discommoded by having to look at someone across a desk, rather than being in an office?  That goes to the heart of what Mr. Buckley said in his statement and the fact that he had powers at his discretion to bypass all of this nonsense of whether guys&rsquo; feelings were out of check because they were moving from a cellular to an open plan office.  Modern companies do this all of the time.  It is extremely frustrating to think the public service cannot adapt in the same fashion and that the net result was a loss of &euro;11 million.  No private company would even countenance such a scenario.  A private company would tell its employees that they would not have a job the following morning if they did not get over their feelings.

I have made several moves and they are planned several years ahead.  The technology and processes have to be put in place.  I am not saying staff are not important, but they  are part of it.  A body like a Department is nothing else but the staff in it.  They are the people who are writing the policies.  However, the business process has to work.  Some are paper-based but will be IT-based.  Teamwork, collegiality, the use of meeting rooms and the way we interact with visitors are different in a different environment.  It takes a little time.  There was engagement over two years, but it could only become intense once we had clear visibility of the type of building into which we were moving.

I am looking at the spending review from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is a very good overview.  I am not too sure about the conclusions.  I wish I was here looking at the OPW in respect of the very important work it carries out.  It looks after over 2,000 buildings and flood prevention and relief, which are extremely important.  I am going home tonight to a city threatened by a storm and possible flooding.  I really wish we were doing that.  I have always had the greatest respect for the OPW on the ground.  It is an extremely important Department so I really regret that we are now mired in this.  It is really putting forward the wrong view of the OPW whose role is essential in any functioning democracy.  It is responsible for 2,000 buildings.  I wish we were here looking at what the OPW feels or how it is implementing Government policy in respect of the colossal spend on rents - &euro;96 million per year.  I do not mean to be disrespectful in any way but the OPW should have as an addendum \"the Office of Public Rents\" because we are now in the market and are actively colluding with high rents in a market.  These are just my general comments.<\/p> <p>  I return to the specifics and I hope I have a chance this afternoon to return to the many aspects I would like to address such as flood risk.  In respect of the report, we are here today because the Comptroller and Auditor General produced this full document.  Unfortunately, the OPW's handling of the Miesian Plaza affair gets an entire chapter, which is very unusual.  I have read the chapter and the comments on it.  I have read everything at this point.  One could have a sense of being overwhelmed.  I will deal first with the problem relating to the extra &euro;300,000 per year as a result of miscalculations.  It reminds me of when NAMA came before us and the debate was pushed into what was the appropriate percentage to use, which is not really relevant.  What has happened here is that there was a negotiated rent based on certain measurements - net internal space or something like that - and an agreement was reached.  The OPW then had to use other measurements that were introduced in January 2016 that should have resulted in the rent being recalibrated.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101100002#W00500","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539244800,"counter":625,"content":"<p>The same rent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101100002#W00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Buckley"},{"type":"speech","time":1539244800,"counter":626,"content":"<p>No, recalibrated in terms of the new measurements.

This is black and white.

As Mr. Buckley will be aware, Mr. Morgan wrote to us.<\/p> <p>  In March 2014, we had the submission by Mr. Morgan and a colleague in relation to the accountability board in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  On 19 June 2014, the OPW Chairman had a meeting with Mr. Morgan on the matter of the submission to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and five high-value cases were provided.  In March 2015, the OPW surveyors made a submission that was distributed to the Committee of Public Accounts.  On 25 May 2015, the Comptroller and Auditor General requested a response from the OPW to the Committee of Public Accounts inquiry.  In July 2015, the OPW requested the surveyors who wrote this to directly investigate the previously identified five sample cases with a particular emphasis on certain areas.  On 1 December, the OPW surveyors provided a detailed report on the same five cases for the OPW and that was brought forward.<\/p> <p>  The following is what I want to find out.  In December last, these two individuals provided a detailed report on five cases of concern that they had been asked to investigate by the OPW and I want to know what has happened since.  This report, of 1 December 2017, a copy of which I have to hand, is an extremely comprehensive report on five expenditure concerns.  I refer to numerous occasions, I have the letters, on which Mr. Morgan wrote.  On 8 March, he wrote to the Chairman asking where this was at.  On 12 March, the Chairman's private secretary wrote back acknowledging the letter, and on 30 April, wrote back stating it was being looked at.  On 8 May, Mr. Morgan wrote again to Mr. Buckley asking where this was at.  On 7 June, he wrote again, stating he was concerned about the lack of information coming back.  On 14 June, the OPW director of corporate services wrote back to Mr. Morgan stating basically there had been changes etc.  I have read the letter, which does not really say much.  On 2 July 2018, Mr. Morgan wrote to Mr. Buckley, as Chairman, again outlining his concerns and wondering why they had not been addressed, and stating he was willing to come in and speak.  On 4 July, that was acknowledged.  Then, on 2 August, Mr. Morgan wrote again, basically offering to assist and stating that the replies to date have been anodyne in nature and non-specific in their content.  On 9 August, this was acknowledged and then, on 26 August, Mr. Morgan wrote again to the director of corporate services.  There is the chronology, which I have read into the record, more or less.<\/p> <p>  I want to know, since 1 December 2017, after this report was published to OPW by two individuals one of whom has written to this committee, what Mr. Buckley has done about it.  It has been the guts of a year.  There are serious concerns raised in this report.  To some of the members here on the committee, the letter that was written by Mr. Alan Morgan is one of the most extraordinary letters we have ever received.  I want to know what Mr. Buckley has done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101100002#Y01300","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539244800,"counter":750,"content":"<p>The dialogue with Mr. Morgan has been in train for a number of years.

At that stage, they were thoroughly investigated by the OPW, by my predecessor, Ms Clare McGrath.  It was very thoroughly done.  A good action, I think, was to involve the person, two members of staff, actually, at the time in the process.  They are very experienced valuers.  These are senior people.  These are people who we would really respect and whose views we would take very seriously.  I, personally, certainly would be concerned at the issues raised and want them addressed, and that was done in-depth during 2014-2015.  Various conversations took place.

I bet I will be proven right in saying that we will be discussing the issues in this report - I am not prejudicing anything that will happen - in a future report from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It would probably have been done this time around except that the issue of the new home for the HSE took up so much time and space.

Just so I am clear, and the Chairman or the Comptroller and Auditor General might be able to clarify this, the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report deals with the Miesian Plaza and the failures in process that his office identified.  That is fair enough and we will deal with them.  The correspondence we have now got, which is PAC correspondence from a Mr. John Dowds and Mr. Alan Morgan, is from 2014, and there was a separate report at some point in 2017 that we will get.  Certainly, the 2014 letter talks about multiple property transactions and then potential issues such as mistaken, superficial judgments by the surveyor, hidden but legitimate considerations, ignorance of the market by the negotiating body or person, poor negotiating skills, compromised negotiating positions and corrupt actions.  We should say there is no evidence whatsoever of any corruption but that is what was said.

There is, therefore, a choice: do you go farther out of the city and have rafts of officials in taxis and particularly on overtime, constantly coming to and out of the D&aacute;il, or do you take a prudent decision and decide that it is more sensible that they be closer to the D&aacute;il with maybe someone else who is not in the D&aacute;il as often being slightly further out?

I do not know too much about it but I have discussed it with a few people and read an article about it in <i>The Times <\/i>, Ireland Edition on 4 October.  The OPW worked on this and can explain what is involved.  Essentially, it is a new planetarium and science centre for children with plans for more than 200 exhibits at the back of Earlsfort Terrace, close to Iveagh Gardens.  There are planning issues involving trees, tennis courts and so on and the application has gone to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.

The OPW has supported it in kind by providing architectural designs for the building.  The history of this dates from the beginning of the century.  A project was developed back in 2003 for Heuston Gate.  The OPW had a huge development planned there and it proved possible, at the behest of the then Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern, and T&aacute;naiste, Ms Mary Harney, to include this science centre.  It is a very worthy project, which links into our STEM education promotion and so on.  The idea was that it would not cost the State any money and the building could be provided as part of the total development.  So far, so good but unfortunately, when the recession hit, like so many Celtic tiger projects, the museum got blown out the window and could not go ahead.  At that time, the OPW had umpteen projects in the heritage and cultural areas that had to paused or stopped.  All of the different promoters went back to the drawing board, reassembled their teams, rebuilt their business case as well as the public and political support to go ahead with the project.  For reasons best explained by themselves, the promoters of the national children's science centre chose a different route and pursued a legal angle in that they determined that they had a binding legal commitment from the State, through the OPW, and that seemed to be the case.  The OPW then had to enter into a follow-on agreement in 2013 to provide a premises.  We did that very carefully and located a premises in Earlsfort Terrace so that at least the building would be on a very important historical property owned, long term, by the State.  There is a commitment to provide that building free of charge to the promoters of the centre.

Much time was spent following up on the matter.  It was mentioned earlier that the committee was heavily criticised for examining matters such as speeding fines but we knew the job we were doing and we were right to do it.  Mr. McCabe was right to do what he did.  Mr. Justice Charleton gave him a glowing report in saying he always put the interests of the State above all other issues, including his loyalty to his day job.  He put the State first and came out with some good praise.  We acknowledge the fact that the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General helped to get the matter to the Charleton tribunal.  I know examination of the issues is not yet complete but it is important to note the findings.  At our next meeting we will meet representatives of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the morning before meeting representatives of the Department of Education and Skills and the Higher Education Authority in the afternoon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101100002#VV06100","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1539244800,"counter":1650,"content":"<p>The witnesses withdrew.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1539244800,"counter":1651,"content":"<p>The committee adjourned at 4.41 p.m. until 9 a.m. on Thursday, 18 October 2018.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
