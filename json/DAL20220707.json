We all know that we need to dramatically increase the supply of all types of housing and accommodation.  This obviously has a direct impact on students.  This is why, when the Government launched the Housing for All policy, which is led by my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, we set out a series of actions that will be delivered to address the housing crisis.  This plan is backed by the largest housing budget in the history of our State to transform our housing system, with funding exceeding &euro;20 billion.<\/p>  <p>  Since I became Minister, I and my Department officials have been engaged intensively with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and his Department, the wider higher education sector and stakeholders on student accommodation issues in the context of overall housing policy.  In a welcome development, my engagement with the sector has indicated that hundreds of additional bed spaces are to be made available by institutions for the start of the forthcoming academic year.  We believe this figure to be in the region of 600.  In addition, the major development of 674 extra bed spaces, which is under way at the National University of Ireland, NUI, Galway, is expected to be delivered later in the academic year.  Therefore, while fully accepting the challenges that exist, and of which there is no doubt, we will be starting this college year with more college and student accommodation than we did last year, and with the additional 674 beds coming on board from NUI Galway later in the academic year.<\/p>  <p>  We must do much more than that, however, and the Deputy&rsquo;s question gets to the heart of the matter.  Looking to the medium-term and on the basis of the most recent data available to my Department, more than 40 separate, purpose-built student accommodation projects have been granted planning permission.  Between them, they are capable of delivering approximately 10,500 bed spaces.  Three of these projects relate to plans by HEIs.  These are: University College Dublin, UCD, which has planning permission for 1,254 bed spaces; Dublin City University, DCU, which has planning permission for 1,234 bed spaces; and Maynooth University, which has planning permission for 117 bed spaces.  What we must do now, though, and I have discussed this issue with the Deputy previously, is to ensure that a model is in place that enables those developments that are ongoing to progress.  I will have a chance to come back in again with another contribution shortly, but I will be updating the Cabinet committee on housing next week regarding this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700003#A00500","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1657180800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>As the Minister outlined, many universities have student accommodation projects at various stages of planning and development.  Many of these are shovel-ready.  In my engagement with the universities and colleges, I have found that they are unable to progress these projects due to the relationship between project cost and what that means in respect of the rent that the colleges must charge students.  In order to access loans, colleges must charge enough rent to repay those funds in a set timeframe.  This means that as the construction costs for these projects go up, so do the amounts that colleges have to charge in rent.  I have no doubt but that the Minister is fully aware of that point.  Projects are being shelved because colleges are, rightly, unwilling to advance those that will deliver accommodation at rent levels that are far too expensive for the majority of students.  I am concerned that accommodation relating to those projects that have progressed will involve the payment of very high rents.  We already have student accommodation in public universities that can cost up to &euro;1,300 per month, which is scandalous considering the current economic climate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700003#A00600","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speech","time":1657180800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>There are a couple of elements to this issue.  There is what can be done right now, immediately, for September.  The factual answer to that is that hundreds more college and student accommodation beds will be open this September compared with last September.  Another 674 bed spaces are coming on board through NUI Galway as well later in the college year.  We must also be conscious of the rent-a-room scheme that is available.  Last year, there was a bit of a perfect storm, if I may use that phrase, and understandably so with the prevalence of Covid-19 being so high.  Many people who might previously have been happy to rent a room to a student, or anybody else, understandably did not want to take other people into their homes.  There is obviously a situation where it is possible to rent out a room in one&rsquo;s home and to earn an income of up to &euro;14,000 tax-free.  Several of the universities and colleges are working to promote that scheme in their localities.  Technological University, TU, Dublin has actually created a register for people to express an interest in renting rooms.  What we need to do, and what I am determined to do, is to come up with a model that unblocks the market failure in respect of larger-scale projects.  That will require a public subvention, but in return for that subvention it will also be necessary to have an agreement and an understanding regarding an affordable rent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700003#A00700","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1657180800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Absolutely, that aspect has emerged in the conversations I have had with the representatives of the colleges and universities well.  There will have to be conditions in respect of the affordability of accommodation.  That can be done.  Affordable accommodation is the biggest barrier to entering third level education today, and this is especially true for students from rural areas.  A report undertaken by researchers at NUI Galway found that the average cost for the cheapest room in Irish university accommodation is considerably higher than in Britain and Europe or even up the road in Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast or Ulster University.  The Government estimated in its 2017 student accommodation strategy that for every four students housed in student accommodation or digs would free up an additional housing unit in the private sector.  Investment in student accommodation is vital for fair access to education, but it also has the potential to take the pressure off the private market.  As the Minister said, we therefore need to be building accommodation of all kinds.  I take from what the Minister has said that he is going to commit to capital funding for the colleges and universities to enable them to provide student accommodation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700003#A00800","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speech","time":1657180800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I could come in here and bamboozle us with figures, but I do think that would be terribly useful.  Under the official student accommodation strategy, we are, from what I can see, either on or ahead of target.  Approximately 25,770 bed spaces were either completed, under construction or had planning permission granted at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021.  That kind of misses the point though, which is that we need a new model.  I agree with the Deputy that we need a model that does ease concerns with affordability.  We also need a model that is concerned with college-owned accommodation.  We cannot be fully reliant on the private market in this area.  I genuinely believe that.  I want to see a model developed that has a required public subvention element to it.  In return for that subvention, however, I want assurances in respect of the timescales for delivery and affordable rents.  I cannot announce that model today.  I am engaging with Government colleagues on this issue and I am due to update the Cabinet committee on housing shortly on this matter.<\/p>  <p>  A final point I wish to make on this issue that I think will be useful, particularly since the Deputy is from the regions, is that we now have clarity regarding the borrowing framework for the TUs.  There is much potential in that sector and I have made that clear to those universities.  I will be writing to them all this week to make that clear to them.

For example, more than 43,600 students have already been approved, through the student grant scheme, for the college year starting in September 2022.<\/p>  <p>  We also saw an important body of work done that was commissioned by the Department.  The review of the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, student grant scheme gave rise to a number of recommendations on issues including the rates of grant, income thresholds, eligibility criteria and postgraduate support.  It is my intention to progress measures to reduce the cost of education for families and students through improvements to the student grant scheme.  I am pleased to say that we have started that work.  We made the first changes to SUSI undergraduate grant rates and eligibility thresholds in a decade, as well as changes to the non-adjacency rules to benefit students who are commuting.  Another change we have introduced means students can now earn up to &euro;6,552 during non-term time in 2022, without being concerned that it will affect their eligibility for a grant.<\/p>  <p>  On 4 May, I launched the Funding the Future framework, which sets out how we intend to reduce cost as a barrier to education in the context of budgets.

The figure has increased from &euro;4,500 to &euro;6,552.  That is absolutely a positive change, but it seems that it will come into effect only next year.  Families think, \"Great - this will really help me\", and then they find they have to wait a year.  I ask the Minister to think of a case in which a student has taken on more work this summer to cope with the cost of living.  He or she wants to apply based on 2022 income because there has been a change of circumstances in the household.  Such students, however, will be penalised for working more this year, the year during which they are absolutely struggling to get by.  This form will do exactly what it was intended not to do.

In fairness, and as the Deputy will know, applicants are assessed on last year's income, so the measure is very much a benefit for this summer.  Students applying to SUSI for September will be assessed on what they earned in summer 2021.  What we tried to do this year was ensure that a student working in a bar, a hotel, a shop or a restaurant would be able to earn a little more than &euro;2,000 more this year.  Applicants are not assessed on that income until the following year, however, so it is absolutely a measure for this summer.  Applicants are always analysed based on their income going back 12 months.  I do not think that making the change Deputy Conway-Walsh suggests would have helped students because they are being assessed this year on what they earned last summer.  I am telling them they can go ahead, work hard and earn more money.  Work should always pay, and we will not penalise them when they then reapply to SUSI next year.  That is how the system is working.

I know there was a lot of worry and concern among new students of graduate entry medicine when a bank made a decision to withdraw a loan product that had been used by many students of such courses.  For the record of the House and for the Deputy's information, I have corresponded with Bank of Ireland on this.  The bank made it clear to me that while it was making a commercial decision to withdraw the product, people could continue to apply for the product until 31 July of this year.  I say that just by the by, but it is perhaps important information for people who will start such courses in September.  There is no immediate cliff edge.<\/p>  <p>  The broader point the Deputy makes very much concerns me.  As a former Minister for Health, I am of the view that diversity in the medical profession is a good thing and that people coming to medicine from a whole variety of backgrounds can only be a good thing.  We need to look at graduate entry medicine in a different way from how we might look at some other programmes.  At the moment, as the Deputy will know, doing graduate entry medicine is marked as doing another level 8 degree, so the reason students do not qualify for the same level of supports or for SUSI is that it is seen as doing another degree at the same level.  I am not sure that is quite fair because there could be very significant benefit to the health service and to our population from someone doing a science, occupational therapy or physiotherapy degree and then deciding they wish to become a doctor and having an additional level of qualification, so yes, I am up for looking at that.<\/p>  <p>  How do I intend to look at it?  I intend to do a couple of things.  First, this came up in the context of the SUSI student grant scheme.  At present, the scheme does not encompass graduate entry medicine.  I have to be honest with the House: there are legislative, policy and funding issues that relate to this.  The student grant review raised the policy question as to whether there should be flexibility for graduate programmes in areas of critical skills shortages, including medicine.  One avenue I am looking at is SUSI and whether we could then make that available.  I am also considering another range of policy and funding tools to try to increase the supply of domestic medicine graduates.  The Deputy will know that we have announced 60 more undergraduate places for September.  In that context, I will engage with the Department of Health on whether there is a policy rationale to do more to support graduate entry medicine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700005#C00900","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182000,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.

There is a great deal of speculation - obviously, he cannot make any commitments this morning - on maybe reducing it by &euro;250 per student on budget day, which I would certainly welcome.

The two most direct ways in which we can assist is the Deputy's second suggestion regarding the level of subvention through the free fees initiative that the State provides.  Deputy Berry has not suggested this, but sometimes it is suggested that the State does not provide any funding in this regard.  That is not the case.  The case, as the Deputy rightly said, is that we do provide some subvention.  Could we provide more?  That is definitely one policy option.<\/p>  <p>  The second option is trying to provide access to SUSI, which would be a more targeted intervention, in assessing a graduate entry medicine student in the same way any student is assessed.  If such students were eligible, they would be able to avail of significant financial support and maybe a reduction in fees not available to them at the moment.  They are the two most direct ways.<\/p>  <p>  I will tell the Deputy something else I am considering doing.  I have yet to finalise this or to bring it to the Government, but we run a number of bursaries through our national access plan.  Currently, those bursaries are only for undergraduate programmes.  I am very seriously considering extending them to graduate entry medicine, recognising the need for diversity in the profession and including people from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds in graduate entry medicine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700005#C01100","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182000,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I agree that a similar type of bursary scheme would make an excellent contribution.

People will probably be watching these proceedings with interest, so I will share with the Deputy and the House the following.<\/p> <p>When I corresponded with Bank of Ireland on this, it responded to say:<\/p><blockquote>\tWe carefully considered the future of the GEM loan product and we ultimately decided that it should be discontinued for a number of reasons.

We have been trying to do everything we can possibly do in order to try to reduce waiting times and increase the number of professional places.<\/p>  <p>  A key focus of Funding the Future, our funding plan for higher education, is to ensure that we have an appropriate pipeline of suitably qualified individuals to enable the provision of essential public services in areas such as health and social services, as referred to by the Deputy.  This priority is now being advanced by my Department in conjunction with HEIs.  It is very important to say that these institutions are autonomous in the context of academic affairs, including the design and structure of the programmes they offer.  I wish to reassure the House that, quite rightly, I do not decide academic programmes, their structure or design.  This is a very important safeguard of quality, which the Deputy will appreciate.  The programmes put in place and delivered by HEIs must also conform to regulatory standards required for professional accreditation.  For example, CORU, the  multi-profession health regulator, was one of the regulatory bodies and the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland is another, to ensure that their programmes meet relevant standards.  Clinical placements are arranged by individual institutions, the HSE and other healthcare providers.<\/p>  <p>  What I can and am doing, to assure the Deputy, is to try to work with other Departments to identify the skills needs.  To give one example, we started this with medicine this year where we sat down with the Department of Health.  We asked it how many doctors it needs to train.  They have given us a number, we will be publishing it very shortly, it will be a multi-annual figure, and we have announced 60 more places from September in medicine.  We announced about three extra last year, to give the Deputy an idea of the scale of this increase.<\/p>  <p>  I now want to do the same exercise with the Minister of State with responsibility for disability, and with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth on speech and language and occupational therapy professionals.  I would love to stand say that I can slash a year off the course, but I cannot.

We have tried to target them in areas where there is a critical skills need, particularly a public service skills need.

The single biggest increase ever, and certainly in a very long time, is that there are more therapy places, though not as many as I would like.<\/p>  <p>  The next thing is to definitely do this workforce planning exercise in order that when we increase the size of higher education overall next year, we will look to target the areas where there are skills needs.

If one looks at speech and language therapy, which is a very important discipline and profession; there is also a role of speech and language therapy assistant, for which we can provide through further education and training.  The more we can expand the system in general for some children and for some adults, the better.  Speech and language therapy assistants be able to play a very helpful role in that regard.

On the higher education side, I am pleased to say that the target set in the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-2019 in the context of increasing participation in higher education for people with disabilities was not only met but was exceeded.  Specific targets to increase participation in higher education by students with a physical or sensory disability were also met.  In fact, they actually revised the targets and increased the level of ambition.  I also want to be honest because I sometimes think that when targets are met, I am little bit suspicious because they can sometimes be set too low.

We were not measuring, for example, participation of students with intellectual disabilities.  The plan was silent in respect of autism.  These are two areas we have moved on in the past couple of weeks together as the Deputy will know and we have announced a new funding stream.  In the first instance, &euro;3 million has been allocated to all the colleges to develop universal designs and initiatives that support autistic students.  This could be sensory rooms, wayfinding apps or new ways of teaching.<\/p>  <p>  In the second and very exciting initiative, which will kick-off in 12 months' time, we have now had a call-out to all of the universities to ask them to design and come up with programmes for people with intellectual disabilities.

We have no empirical evidence in this regard in Ireland.  Higher education educators going into prisons can see this.  We can very quickly see when an individual struggles with dyscalculia or dyslexia.  It is wrong.  There are certain interventions that a teacher is skilled to make but there is no diagnostic capacity.  There is no capacity to wrap this up or quantify what it is and how to properly deal with it.  It would be great if the Minister's Department could do this.  It is not in the realm of justice.  I would say it is in the realm of further and higher education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700007#E00300","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1657183200,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I want to raise several issues.

Rather than having separate funds if we could provide access to SUSI it would be very good.  With regard to the student assistance fund, will the Minister see whether it can be made available earlier this year?  What many students and families say is that they need the money in September.  Waiting until October, November and December can often restrict the choices of students and put them into hardship.

It is not unusual for a student with a disability to be told or advised to do a four-year degree because they are well able for it but that it might work better for them it to do it over five or six years.  We have asked Professor Tom Collins, one of the co-chairs of our new funding implementation group, to do specific work on part-time education, what it is and how we define it.

The Department wants to hear a little bit more from the Deputy on this.  I will read what I have and we might engage a bit more on it.  The fund for students with disabilities provides funding to higher and further education institutions for the delivery of services and supports for students with disabilities.  We know this.  The fund is intended to assist in offering supports and services to eligible students with disabilities so that they can participate on an equal basis.  This funding can be used to provide support and accommodation in a range of broad categories, including non-medical helpers, personal assistants and notetakers.<\/p>  <p>   The disability support services in higher education institutions complete a needs assessment in respect of each student.  On completion of the needs assessment, disability support staff in the institution determine the nature and level of supports, such as a non-medical assistant or a personal assistant, required by students.  They can draw down from the fund for students with disabilities to provide these supports.  In further education, need assessments determine the supports and accommodations requested for students and the individual education and training board or further education college is responsible for decisions on the most appropriate support to provide to the student.<\/p>  <p>  I checked this out when I saw the question.  We are not aware of the issue mentioned by the Deputy.  I am sure she has more information.  Perhaps it has been raised by a particular institution with her.   If she is happy to share information with me now or afterwards in more detail we will certainly examine the matter.  I want to be very clear that the entire policy rationale of the funding is that it is on a needs-based approach.  The ultimate answer to the Deputy's question is that it should not have a rigid application whereby it must be this or that.  It is about a needs-based assessment for each student and the institution then draws down from the fund.  I am not aware of any such rigidity and if the Deputy has come across it I would be very happy to work with her on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700007#E01200","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1657183200,"counter":78,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

This is something that should be considered with regard to disabled people and people who suffer from chronic pain.  It is something that has been raised with me.  The person in this case is being allocated a personal assistant but when it comes to toileting he requires two people.  This seems to be where the problem arises.  Apparently the college has been told it is not allowed to allocate a second person.  This is the information that is coming from him.  I can seek further information or I can ask whether I can pass on his details to the Minister to look at the matter.  It is coming to the stage where he is asking whether he will take up the course.

I will ask my officials listening in to the debate to expect to hear from the Deputy on the matter.  My very clear understanding in checking this out is that the higher or further education institutions determine the level of support provided, but they do not do it in a vacuum.  They do it based on the needs assessment.  If there is a needs assessment for any student which states that there is a particular requirement, the relevant institution should be in a position to draw down from the fund to provide the support required.  I am not blaming the college or the education and training board, ETB, in question.  If there is an anomaly, we need to look at it.  I am not familiar with the case.  The Deputy is not being critical of anybody and I am not either.  If there is an issue here, we should look at it.  The fundamental principle is that the needs assessment sets out the student's requirements.  The higher education institution outlines how it will meet the needs of the student and it then requests funding from the fund for students with disabilities.  That is the process.

Sometimes the contracts concluded between colleges or further education institutions, the provider of the PA service, and perhaps the insurance company, stipulate that the students are precluded from leaving campus during contracted hours.  That is quite restrictive.  For example, if a student wants to go for a coffee with friends, they are told that they cannot leave campus during contracted hours.  I have heard that from the head of an institution, who highlighted the issue to me.  Perhaps that is something the Minister can look at.  I am also aware that the HSE has very strict rules around PA hours for non-academic PAs.  I know that the issue is not entirely within the Minister's remit.  The non-academic PA hours are linked to the relevant student's home county, when students often study outside their own home county.  It is another issue that affects disabled students.  For disabled students to be able to attend college, they need to have their PA for both non-academic and academic purposes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700008#F00300","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1657183800,"counter":82,"content":"<p>The Deputy's question has been most useful in providing valuable insight through the information she has picked up.

I think it is sometimes hard to decouple the issues that students face in relation to accommodation from the boarder housing issues.  That is why I have referenced Housing for All.  The plan is backed by the largest housing budget in the history of the State.  There is a &euro;20 billion budget behind it.  I have been engaging extensively with my Department on the issue, with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and his Department, as well as with the wider higher education sector, student representative groups and other stakeholders.  In recent weeks I chaired a meeting of all higher education institutions and the Union of Students of Ireland, USI, to further pursue the issue.  I have corresponded with all chairs and presidents of the new technological universities at least twice this year regarding the current issues with accommodation and how we can try to resolve them.<\/p>  <p>  As I said to Deputy Conway-Walsh earlier, we are approaching the new academic year with two different realities.  First, we are approaching the year with around 600 additional student accommodation beds.  Second, I hope we are approaching the year in which we can begin to get the rent-a-room scheme back up and running, which fell off a cliff during the height of the Covid pandemic.  They are the two most immediate avenues that we can pursue.  In addition to the 600 beds I mentioned earlier, another 674 beds are due to become available during the academic year in NUI Galway.  The bigger project that I am genuinely working intensively on is to try to put a new model in place to deliver student accommodation.  I am saying openly and bluntly that I think it will require public and State subvention to bridge what seems to be the market failure challenge that universities and colleges are experiencing at the moment.  There will have to be an affordability conversation in return for any subvention made by the State.  However, there are many planning permissions in the pipeline for college-owned student accommodation that could be built if we can unleash the new model.

To be honest, the Government should intervene immediately to ensure that students and their families are not being screwed with that level of rent.  It is not that I am a fan of HAP but, as I said, a temporary stop-gap must be introduced.  People should not be paying that level of rent.  I would be in favour of nationalising all the privately- and investor-built student accommodation.  The developers are getting tax breaks and they are charging &euro;1,000 a month in rent, which most students cannot afford.

The first is that we need to take a flexible local approach.  We have said several times that we want to hear from any higher education institution in any part of the country that has a local solution.  If there is something that can be done on campus or near campus, or if the institution has a building that can be converted into student accommodation, we want to hear about it, and we will provide assistance in making that happen.  There is an example of this approach being taken in Limerick, the constituency of the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, where the technological university there worked with the local authority to deliver a local solution.  The second action we need to take, which I have discussed with students, is to get the rent-a-room scheme up and running again.  If people have a spare room, they can earn up to &euro;14,000 tax-free while renting out a room.  That is a scheme that has traditionally worked well.  I accept that USI wants assurances around the protection for students in what it refers to as digs.  That is a valid issue.  The third element is the borrowing framework.  We have provided legal clarity that the new technological universities, which were previously institutes of technology, of which there is one in the Deputy's constituency, can borrow to build for the first time.  The fourth is the new model that I am working on, which I believe will require an intervention from the State to unleash the potential to build many thousands of on-campus college-owned student accommodation units.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700008#F01000","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1657183800,"counter":89,"content":"<p>The problem is that rather than the Government making a decision that we have to have the necessary student accommodation to avoid a student accommodation crisis and to make it affordable, the onus is being put on the colleges to provide it.

I made a general suggestion to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, but he did not take it up.   The Seamark Building, a multistorey building located opposite the Merrion Gates, has been sitting empty for ten years.  I suggest that the Government buys the building and refurbishes it for student accommodation.  Nothing the Minister said really suggests to me that we are not going to face major problems again this year.

As he will be aware, apprenticeship is a demand-driven, employer-led system that aims to develop the skills of an apprentice in order to meet the needs of industry and the labour market.  In light of that employer-led model of apprenticeship, the level of apprenticeship opportunities and associated advertising for those roles in any particular sector are obviously based on the current demand that exists in that sector for apprentices.  A key deliverable under the Action Plan for Apprenticeship, 2021 to 2025 is to increase this demand by addressing barriers to employer participation.  In this context, I introduced an annual grant for employers who employ apprenticeships in one of the post-2016 apprenticeships and thereby extending financial support to all apprentice employers for the first time.<\/p><p>SOLAS has advised my Department that there are 66 open jobs currently advertised on the Generation Apprenticeship website.  Nearly 1,000 jobs have been advertised since its launch in October 2020.  A total of 2,881 employers have been set up on the apprenticeship jobs portal to date.  There is a national campaign underway via the Generation Apprenticeship campaign to drive awareness of apprenticeship opportunities across a broad audience of stakeholders.  I am pleased to say traffic on <i>apprenticeship.ie<\/i>has increased very significantly as a result of the changes we made to the CAO website.  There have been over 30,000 click-throughs from the CAO website, which means more than 30,000 people went to the CAO site and then went directly to the apprenticeship website.  Both campaigns promote a number of key initiatives under the Generation Apprenticeship banner.  They are targeting the employer audience regarding the gender bursary and employer grant, as well as targeting students, parents and guidance counsellors regarding opportunities in apprenticeship.<\/p><p>Long story short, the Deputy is right.  I am looking at how we can link some supports we provide to the public advertising of apprenticeships.  There needs to be equity with people's ability to access information on this.  We are also working very hard on public sector apprenticeships and we have a target of 750 public sector apprenticeships by 2025.  That will increase the opportunity the Deputy refers to about the availability of apprenticeships in local areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700009#G01000","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1657184400,"counter":102,"content":"<p>When we have an all-time shortage of staff, to hear just 66 apprenticeship posts are being advertised on <i>apprenticeship.ie<\/i>is bizarre.

All of them have representatives of significant weight.  Why are those bodies not being leaned upon to recognise that the learn-as-you-earn model offers a way to attract young people into these sectors with huge growth opportunities?  Huge work has been done and I fully acknowledge that but we need to get these partners going beyond approving apprenticeships to offering a pool of opportunities.  It is not the same going to the site if there are only 66 posts.  There are something like 30,000 places on the CAO site.

Now we as a State are providing financial incentives to all apprentice employers in the country, it is not unreasonable that in return we ask for things in terms of how these are advertised.  That is a route I intend to pursue.  However, I would not like, and I know the Deputy would not either, for a small number of advertisements on a website to suggest a lack of progress because we obviously saw the highest number of new apprentices ever registered last year, namely, 8,607.  We had set a target of getting to 10,000 by 2025 and I am quite encouraged we are going to beat that target and get there earlier.  We now have 65 apprenticeship programmes with 16 more being developed.  We have a new national apprenticeship office being established with the TUs rolling out access to apprenticeship programmes and we have the changes to the CAO.

The public sector needs to step up here.  To be really clear, it has not done so.  A public sector that employs around 300,000 taking on around 200 apprentices per year is offensive.  It is offensive to me, offensive to the Government and offensive to mums and dads right across this country.  Every local authority, Government Department and State agency should be doing it.  What we are doing at the moment is we have a global figure of 750.  We want 750 apprentices every year across the public sector by 2025.  We are in the mapping exercise of that right now of going out to the local authority, asking where its skills needs are, where can it take on apprentices and how many.  It is my intention to return to the Government in the autumn and map out how we get from here with in and around 200 per year to 750 per year.  The local authorities will have a major part to play in that and yes, absolutely, that will be a big moment with a central depository, if you like, of public sector apprenticeships available to all our citizens.

Bystander training can be a crucial intervention to help educate people about sexual and domestic violence prevention.  This type of training programme can highlight the danger of normalising abusive behaviour.  It cultivates an understanding of people's capacity to intervene and it can provide learners with a safe environment to better understand appropriate social interactions.  It also helps to identify unacceptable behaviour, ensuring an understanding of the importance and meaning of consent but also, more broadly, personal assertiveness and social responsibility.<\/p>  <p>  University College Cork, UCC, launched its online bystander intervention in January 2019 and I commend and thank Professor Louise Crowley in the UCC school of law for her leadership on this initiative.  The UCC programme seeks to educate and empower students to support the development of a visible institutional culture which stands against unacceptable behaviour and abuse.  It also seeks to foster a culture of positivity and support.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2019, the Higher Education Authority awarded &euro;350,000 in performance funding in recognition of the impact of the programme.  The Higher Education Authority's centre of excellence for equality, diversity and inclusion has since been working with the UCC bystander programme to facilitate, as the Deputy suggested, the national roll-out of this programme.  National reporting on the framework for consent in November of last year showed that a majority of our higher education institutions have now engaged with the UCC bystander programme and are either offering or intending to offer the training.  There has been good progress in that regard, I am pleased to say.  The Higher Education Authority has this year allocated &euro;20,000 to support the roll-out of a pilot of the online version of the UCC bystander programme in all higher education institutions.  It can be accessed immediately once invitations are issued by UCC to participating staff and students.<\/p>  <p>  In another very welcome development, the bystander programme has now advised that it is responding to growing interest from second level schools.  This is important because third level can be too late and it would be better if some of this happened in second level, if not earlier.  The bystander programme has now developed a pilot intervention training programme at second level.  That has initially been rolled out in seven schools and training has been provided to 140 teachers.  It is now being rolled out in 45 schools and I thank Professor Crowley for that.<\/p>  <p>  We intend to roll out the programme nationally.  We are nearly there, quite frankly.  Almost all our higher education institutions are now saying they are on board and schools are also getting in on the act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700010#H00400","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1657185000,"counter":111,"content":"<p>That is very welcome.

We asked how each of the presidents would adopt a zero-tolerance approach and what they would do to tackle sexual harassment.  I was not asking them to hide beyond national frameworks, important as national frameworks are.  I wanted each of the presidents to reflect on how the national framework could be applied to their institutions.

A good example of workforce planning is the work that the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and I did this year in relation to medicine places.  We sat down as two Departments with the HSE, others and the deans of medical schools and identified the need.  We now have seen a very large increase.  We want to replicate that process across health, social care and education.  I have written to all Cabinet colleagues on this.

They have qualifications in educational psychology, but they teach maths, English and Irish all day long.  They never get into realm of screening and diagnostics.  I acknowledge there will be a top-up required in order to do that.  One cannot just become clinical the minute one graduates from college and diagnosis children.  However, surely, that in-house capacity needs to be looked at, rather than referring the children off onto a NEPS list, where they might not get an appointment for 18 months.

It makes no sense for someone with an educational psychology qualification to be filling out a referral form for somebody to NEPS, which will not see them for a year or two.  That is absolutely illogical.  There needs to be a new pay grade in teaching and a new incremental point in order that somebody exiting the college system with this qualification is actually put to practice.

Accommodation in an integration and reception centre will be own-door for families and own-room for single people with specific supports for people with identified vulnerabilities.

Once the four-month programme is complete, if the applicant has not received a positive first-instance decision on his or her application or is undergoing an appeal process, he or she will transition from an integration and reception centre to accommodation in the community.  A local authority allocation has been developed to determine the relative proportion of international protection applicants to be accommodated in each local authority area under the new model.

I am encouraged that providers have shown such willingness to work in partnership with the State toward the shared goal of delivering affordable early learning and childcare for families.

However, I am doing all in my power to address the issue of pay.  In particular, I began a process in December 2020 to examine the possibility of regulating pay and conditions and the suitability of a joint labour committee for the sector.  This process culminated in the establishment of a joint labour committee for early years services, which began meeting in December last year.  The outcomes of the committee's work will be supported by the new core funding stream I announced in budget 2022, which will provide an additional &euro;73 million of funding in 2022 and is equivalent to more than &euro;221 million in a full year.<\/p>  <p>  Core funding is expected, among other objectives, to support employment regulation orders that may arise from the joint labour committee to improve workforce recruitment and retention through improvements in pay.  Core funding will require providers to commit not to increase fees from the September 2021 rates.  This will ensure that parents feel the full affordability benefits of the NCS.  This is particularly important because, from September 2022, universal NCS subsidies will extend to children up to the age of 15.<\/p>  <p>  A transition fund is available to providers from May until August, ahead of the introduction of core funding.  This fund invests in services, subject to providers' agreement not to increase parents' fees from September 2021 levels.

The primary objective of the transition fund is to ensure that the fees charged to parents do not increase.  Participation in the transition fund is optional, but I am glad to see that 96% of providers have signed up to it.  In Dublin, 991 providers are now participating and providing 43,541 places for children.  The transition fund remains open for new entrants to sign up to for the remaining months of its operation.

This will give parents greater certainty about what they will be charged and prevent increases in NCS subsidies from being absorbed by fee increases.  The NCS is supporting thousands of families to offset the childcare costs.

Nothing highlights the challenges faced by households more than the outrageous cost of childcare.  It is the equivalent to, or sometimes more than, a second mortgage or a month's rent for many people.  In Dublin childcare fees come in at more than &euro;1,200 per month per child according to a recent Newstalk survey.  Statewide they are more than &euro;800 per month on average.<\/p>  <p>  Many parents, especially women, are forced out of the workforce as they struggle to afford to go back to work due to these crippling costs, if they are lucky enough in the first place to be able to secure a place for their child.  It is a scandalous situation and one that needs to be rectified.  The reality is that parents cannot wait any longer for actions to reduce childcare fees.  Later today, Sinn F&eacute;in will publish its policy proposals to set out how we can cut childcare fees so they are affordable for the many families who are being fleeced at present.  This can be done by providing significant additional funding to the sector in exchange for the providers cutting fees by two thirds.  This is in the gift of the Government.<\/p>  <p>  If the Minister listened to \"Morning Ireland\" this morning or yesterday he would have heard the struggles of parents, staff and providers.  They are at their wits' end.  Parents cannot afford the fees they are being asked to pay.  Highly-skilled staff are struggling financially to remain in jobs they love.  Services are equally under enormous financial pressure to remain viable.  The system is broken.<\/p>  <p>  Our proposals would cut fees for parents and ensure that providers received crucial funding to invest in their services.  They would also ensure fairer pay for a highly-educated workforce.  A total of &euro;270 million is the additional public investment required.  It would be the best money spent in any budget.  It would be an important investment in our children's future.  It would be a major step in helping families hit by the cost-of-living crisis.  It needs to be done.  It must be done.  Families simply cannot keep waiting for the Government to take this crisis seriously.  It is time to cut childcare fees by two thirds.  Does the Minister agree with me that this year's budget is the opportune time to slash childcare fees to ensure families get a much-needed break from these ludicrous costs?  Will he commit to the ambition that we have spelled out and want to achieve and that Sinn F&eacute;in would deliver, which is cutting fees by two thirds?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700021#T00100","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1657191600,"counter":261,"content":"<p>This year's budget and last year's budget were designed together.  Anyone listening to \"Morning Ireland\" this morning would have heard the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, set out that there are real challenges but there are ways we can fix it.  There are three challenges.  The first is the economic sustainability of the providers.  This is why last year's budget was important.  In it the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, secured &euro;221 million for providers on the understanding that there would not be an increase in fees, as provided from this September, with the transition fund in the meantime.<\/p>  <p>  The second key issue is low pay for workers in the sector.  There is a real issue that we do not value enough the caring work in our State.  As part of addressing this, the Labour Court has published the first draft employment regulation orders for early years educators and providers of school-aged childcare.  I understand the joint labour committee for early years services will meet shortly, with a view to agreeing proposals for one or more employment regulation orders, EROs, to set minimum rates of pay for different roles in the sector.<\/p>  <p>  The third aspect is the high cost for parents and the Deputy is correct.  This is where this year's budget connects to the previous budget.  By providing in the budget this September improvements to the national childcare scheme subsidies to parents, they will not be gobbled up by the providers who have already got the fund and agreed they will not be able to increase fees.  This is strategic thinking fixing a real problem and causing a huge improvement for households that are in real difficulty because of high inflation, caused mainly by international factors.  We are delivering it in government two years in, in the same way we are delivering in a range of ways.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome it if Sinn F&eacute;in is coming out today with similar proposals to support childcare.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, has been at it for the past year and a half, planning strategically and making sure the public money invested is spent well and goes to the parents and, more than anything else, goes to care for our children.  We have to look at other areas.  We have to look at children raised by parents in the home to make sure they are not disadvantaged with whatever we do in the budget.  We must look at ways we leave the choice with parents who are best placed to decide the right way to go.  There has been a transformative change in the past two years under the leadership of the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, towards recognising that we need to pay people properly in the sector and that the operators were not in a viable economic model and needed support.  The &euro;221 million was not insignificant.<\/p>  <p>  The third leg of this multi-annual approach, so that it works effectively, is increasing the subsidy to all parents this year as a way of reducing the cost of living.  I am glad if Sinn F&eacute;in is looking at something similar or is similarly interested.  We are delivering it and doing it in government.  We will do so this September and did so last October.  We will continue to review it through the Labour Court through improving the pay of workers.  This is all real change.  There will be a real benefit to parents throughout the country.  I commend the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, on what he is doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700021#T00200","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1657191600,"counter":262,"content":"<p>We have been trying to get Governments to slash childcare fees for years.

This is what the Government is delivering.  It is not delivering the cuts we need to see.  I will put it very clearly.  Sinn F&eacute;in has a very clear policy on this.  We can cut childcare costs by two thirds for families.  The Minister spoke about delivering no increases in September.  We need to see substantial reductions.  We need ambition.  Families know.  This is why they are spilling onto the airwaves on \"Morning Ireland\" or on local radio stations.  They are being fleeced by the cost of childcare.  It is the highest in Europe.

Yesterday's Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, report has confirmed yet again the scale of failure over successive years to ensure that people have adequate homes and the right to a home.  Since this Government assumed office, rents have increased by 15%, house prices have risen by 22% and homelessness has increased by 19%.  There are outrageous numbers of individuals and families on the homeless list.  There are over 3,000 children, 1,366 families and over 5,000 single people on the list.  There is an unacceptable level of homelessness and poverty in Ireland, a relatively wealthy country in the EU, in 2022.  The ESRI has confirmed to us that an impending crisis for older people renting is also facing us.  Renters can barely cover the cost of rent, let alone save up to buy a home or save up for retirement.  While the Government's current strategy is predicated on an assumption that rental is short-term and that people will somehow morph into homeowners by the time they retire, we know that can no longer be assumed.  We know that failures to deliver on housing and housing supply now means that many people will be renting into older age and will be continuing to pay unaffordable rents.  Indeed, in my own constituency and that of the Minister, Dublin Bay South, there is a much higher level of households in the private rental sector than in other constituencies across the country.  It is a particular issue there, with over 40% of households in the Dublin Bay South constituency renting.  I am receiving, as I am sure the Minister is, more and more communications from older people who can no longer afford their rents, who are facing eviction, or who simply cannot find a place, let alone an affordable place to rent.<\/p>  <p>  We have called for a radical shift in housing policy, for budget 2023 to deliver a drastic ramping-up of the building of social, affordable and cost-rental homes.  We, and my colleague, Senator Moynihan, our housing spokesperson, have called for the Government to bring vacant homes back into use with a vacant property tax.  Such a tax rate must also be accompanied by resources and proper enforcement measures.  We need to see an increase in the percentage of Part V units for social and affordable housing.  We have consistently called for a three-year rent freeze in order to see a reduction in evictions.  That must be introduced.  Targeted supports must also be provided for communities particularly at risk of homelessness.  There must be an end to speculation and land hoarding.  We need to see a referendum on the right to housing, something we have called for consistently.  I ask the Minister to push, at Government level, to ensure that there is a radical shift in housing policy towards seeing a home as a right and towards delivering on a policy of reducing and eliminating homelessness in Ireland.  Will the Minister push for that in budget 2023?  It is an urgent issue for many households and families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700022#U00500","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1657192200,"counter":276,"content":"<p>It is true.  The Government has a range of work to do, but the three key objectives central to Government are addressing the housing crisis, reforming healthcare and advancing the opportunity we will get from taking climate change from going to the max in what we need to do.  In housing, there is not just the Housing for All strategy, which I believe engages on and commits to many of the measures that the Deputy has just mentioned.  There is also the national development plan.  The clear commitment among every Government Department is that housing comes first, it gets the largest allocation and it is the critical area in which we have to spend up to &euro;4 billion a year.  The Deputy mentioned a referendum on the right to housing and various other measures.  I think this week the Housing Commission initiated its public consultation on how such a referendum might be framed.  As a country, we have learned that referendums require us to think about the question that is being asked and the wording of it.  The Deputy called for the introduction of a vacant property tax.  Yesterday, the Minister of Finance committed to introduce such a tax, as well as a zoned land tax for land that is not being used.  That has been committed to.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage will be discussing the shared equity scheme today, perhaps even as we speak.  It is one of a series of measures that we need to introduce in the area of affordable housing.  I agree with the Deputy that cost-rental housing is central and key to delivering affordable housing.  The Housing for All plan commits to the provision of 18,000 cost-rental homes, and to go further if we can.  We will work with the Land Development Agency, LDA, on the matter.  I agree that the situation can be frustrating.  A lot of the time we would like to see things done faster.  Many of the developments for which planning applications have been approved are not being built.  In Dublin city, for example, the real question is where the housing is being built.  A lot of the housing is being built in the peripheral counties around Dublin.  Not enough housing is going into Cork city, Limerick city, Galway city, Waterford city and Dublin city.  Houses need to go back into the city centres.  We have to think where we are building houses, as well as how many.  On the plan to move towards delivering 33,000 houses per annum, which we must do, the latest analysis presented to me shows that this year we will be on target.  It is expected that 25,000 houses will be completed this year.  It is never going to be enough, but we are on track to deliver what we committed to do.  I do not disagree with the points the Deputy raised.  I think the real job is ensuring that we accelerate the programme now.  I do not believe there is a huge difference in the policies.  It is about delivering them.  The Minister for Finance announced measures yesterday and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage is announcing measures today.  I could list a number of other occasions where the Government is acting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700022#U00600","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1657192200,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I agree with the Minister.  It is about delivery.  In fact, in this case it is about the lack of delivery.  What I am hearing from renters or those aspiring to own a home but cannot do so, and indeed from people who are seeking to build homes to deliver on housing, is that there is a lack of delivery and urgency in delivery by Government.  Certainly, very welcome measures have been announced by Government.  However, what is so frustrating for people is that we have not seen the impact of those measures.  There has been no outcome in terms of the supply of homes available to people who need them now.  Each number on the homeless list represents a person who is looking for a home, but who cannot currently be housed and has not yet felt the impact of housing policies that have been announced.  We have not seen the urgency and delivery of policies.  We, in Labour, have sought to put forward constructive measures, such as our renters' rights Bill and Senator Moynihan's idea of a rent-to-buy scheme to convert rent paid in a property over three years into a deposit for a property for individuals.  The measures we have proposed are constructive.  We brought forward a homeless families Bill to prevent the risk of child poverty and child homelessness.  We need to see more concerted action.

It feeds into absolutely everything.  It is true to say that the issue is EU-wide and that the war in Ukraine has contributed to the problem, but we have our own fiscal tools that we can deploy here to bring inflation under control.  The truth is that every country is dealing with the war.  However, not every country is like Ireland.  We are unique, we are an island and we have almost full employment.  Yet, we have not taken one measure to deal with costs.  The economist, David McWilliams, has said that we need extraordinary measures in extraordinary times, and we must control the controllables.  He said we need to take away the excise on fuel and reduce inflation accordingly.<\/p> <p>The Government has instead added tax by increasing the carbon tax, but I do not care what the tax is called.  It can be called the carbon tax, the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, levy or excise.  It is tax.  Remove it.  The tax is causing cost-push inflation and we are getting into a spiral of demand-pull inflation.  The Minister is not solving the problem.  The proposal to reduce inflation through this measure is a realistic one.  Fuel is the lowest common denominator of any economy and even more so in Ireland as we are an island dependent on transport of every kind.  We import most of our energy, so we are totally exposed here, yet the Minister has done nothing except add to the cost of living by adding carbon.<\/p> <p> The reality is this probably suits the Green Party.  Its policy is driving demand destruction because people will have no choice but to stop using fuel and energy, or reduce usage to bare minimums.  In response, the Minister will say he is saving the planet.  He will say it is a just transition.  What is just about people freezing in their homes?  What is just about being pushed into abject poverty?  What is just about not being able to go to work because it no longer makes financial sense to work, while the price of everything in the supermarket goes up?  The Government could, if it wanted to, cut excise on the fuel but it will not.  It is gouging the people by increasing taxes instead.  Is it the case this so-called just transition we speak of has driven people into penury in rural Ireland?  Whatever chance we had of a just transition without a war, we certainly have no chance now.  To continue with this high-tax regime when we are, as an economy, extremely reliant on fuel and the transport of goods means this policy will contribute in a negligible way to the world targets on carbon emission reductions while we see our squeezed middle opt for unemployment benefits rather than work.  In particular, if the proposal kited this week is anything to go by, the squeezed middle in rural Ireland, where there are no transport alternatives, would absolutely be financial better off to have joined the social welfare queue.

There is none.  There is no use in telling the carer who might cover as much as 30 km to 40 km on their day visiting those who are at home and incapacitated and most in need of support.  That carer is now giving up work.  The question is why we are not doing something to prevent this.<\/p>  <p>  I am sorry but the Minister is completely offside when he says we cannot control our own excise duties.  I have listened in relation to VAT and I accept the EU may have governance over our VAT regime but it does not have it over our excise duties, carbon tax or NORA levy.  All of these the Government could remove but has not.  We have people who are drawing social welfare because they do not feel the need to go hungry or freeze in their homes.

Ireland will not be included.  We get a derogation because we have already gone in that direction.

Yesterday evening, as the Minister is probably aware given he is the Minister over it, the EU diktat voted that gas and nuclear are basically going to be classed as green resources, which I do not have a problem with.  The Minister is probably also aware of some of things going on in Europe such as in the Netherlands.  The Minister is proposing to bring in climate targets on the agricultural sector whereas the Netherlands Government is actually closing down farms.  Funnily enough, our own national media do not seem to be interested in it.  They would rather show something in Australia or somewhere else than show farmers being kicked around the place.<\/p> <p> The Minister is probably aware, particularly if he has been talking to fuel merchants, that coal is becoming scarce.  There are only a couple of places from which we are importing coal.  It is getting scarce and has more than doubled in price.  Fuel merchants to whom I have talked estimate that a 40 kg bag of coal will cost &euro;50 or more this winter.  The Minister referred earlier to the price of oil coming down.  He should consider why that happened.  The American dollar has become strong and the euro has collapsed.  That is why.  The price of oil has come down by damn all in recent days.  It was at $120 per barrel.  In euros, a barrel of oil is now probably &euro;105, &euro;106 or &euro;108.  The reality is that it costs &euro;1.60 per litre.  A litre of white diesel costs &euro;2.20.  The Minister spoke about Europe and said the Government cannot do this, that or the other.  Europe exports food.  Is there an agenda in Europe to reduce food output in order that it will not be exported and the figures relating to the green agenda will stack up?  Is Europe going to starve people in other parts of the world?<\/p> <p> There is an application for a licence on the Minister's desk at the moment from a company in Mayo.  There appears to be a large resource of gas there that would help this country.  I understand the Department is sitting on that application.  What is the Minister going to do to ensure that we have energy security?  Whether we like it or not, we will need gas into the future.<\/p> <p> The Minister is aware of the pressures - they were outlined earlier - that ordinary people face.  The Minister mentioned that the fuel allowance has been increased and I admit that.  However, the new poor are in middle Ireland.

The regulations will not affect the householder.  They do not consider producers or someone who might be cutting a bog and so on.  They focus on the retail side.  They relate to smoky coal, wet wood and turf at the retail and sales levels.  That was agreed in the consultation last September.<\/p>  <p>  It is true that the world has changed since last September as a result of the war.  It is true that the price of coal has increased because much of the coal on the market was Russian coal and the supply chain has been affected in that regard.  Oil and gas have also been significantly affected.  The key answer in this insecure time, for Europe and Ireland, is the European Green Deal.  This was set out by the Commission in advance of the war, but it all the more urgent and requires to be committed to now.  Europe imports so much of its energy, food and feedstock for its animal production system that it makes for an insecure world for us.  We must start to become much more efficient and much more reliant on our own resources.  We must create wealth out of the alternative renewable efficient economy, which is growing.  That is where the jobs are and where the investment will be.  That is where our country has a real advantage.  Our population is relatively small for the size of the island.  Our wind resources are beyond compare.  Everyone can see this coming but we can now convert that wind to hydrogen gas, which provides real security.  Rather than going out into the Atlantic Ocean at &euro;100 million a pop and trying to drill on a 50\/1 outsider bet, which is our record when we have gone out to explore in an attempt to find sources of fuel, we have the odds-on knowledge that the offshore wind is there.  We can tap into that and convert it.<\/p>  <p>  The green transition is central to the European strategy and the Government's strategy.  It belongs to all three parties.  It is smart, clever and obvious to use our natural resources in this difficult time.  That is the best way to protect our people.  I do not always agree with the finer details of what the European institutions decide.  I did not agree with the Parliament's vote on taxonomy yesterday because I disagree with describing gas or nuclear energy as green in any way.  However, that is not going to distract us from what we need to do, which is to tap into the resources we have in abundance and to use them with real skill, which we have in respect of balancing variable renewable supply and demand management to heat our homes, move our transport system and power our industry.

I listened carefully to, and read, the Minister's speech and that is what motivated me to speak and say on the record that I have the most serious concerns, once again, about the way legislation is going through the D&aacute;il.  I have concerns for the staff, without identifying any staff, with regard to the pressure they are under to produce Bills and amendments in the manner they are being asked to do it.  I have serious concerns about our ability as Deputies to scrutinise legislation.<\/p><p>When I looked at this Bill I was a little relieved by what I was told by the Minister and the Bill Digest of the Oireachtas Library and Research Service.  Again, I suspect the Oireachtas Library and Research Service is under the most serious pressure and I do not think it is in a position to give us comprehensive digests in respect of legislation.  I say this reluctantly because I have found the Bill Digest to be my greatest source of information and education since I was elected to the House, but it is under extraordinary pressure.  When I was told it is a technical Bill, I thought that was okay and that I could rely on the Minister and on the Bill Digest.  We are told by the Bill Digest that the Bill is very technical and its primary purpose is to amend Part XA of the Planning and Development Act 2000, which deals with substitute consent.  The existing system is a two-part system where one goes <i>ex parte<\/i>and the public have no say, and then come back to the second part.  However, the <i>ex parte<\/i>stage, significantly, is where exceptional circumstances are laid out.  At the second stage, where the public have a right to take part, they are not entitled to comment on exceptional circumstances.  I welcome that it is now being streamlined and I welcome that change.<\/p><p>It follows a Supreme Court judgment that put the whole thing in perspective.  The Supreme Court found that the use of the substitute consent procedure needed to comply with EU law, in particular, the environmental impact assessment, EIA.  It held:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWhen the Court of Justice refers to retrospective regularisation as having to remain the exception, [In other words, we should only regularise planning permissions retrospectively on an exceptional basis and, significantly, the public had no say in the definition of what was exceptional circumstances] its justification is that otherwise developers may be incentivised to ignore or disregard the requirements of a prior consent EIA: in other words, national measures cannot act as an inducement to avoid EIA compliance.  Therefore, such regularisation must remain the exception, rather than the rule.  Consequently, the relevant provisions of domestic law cannot permit, allow or facilitate a situation whereby the obtaining of, as in this jurisdiction, a retention permission becomes in any way standard, typical or routine. <\/blockquote>  <p>The Supreme Court placed a huge emphasis on the exceptionality test.  Another issue decided by the Supreme Court was whether the public should have the right to know.  The public were excluded.  The Supreme Court held: &quot;The evident intention of that part of the Act is to the effect that the leave stage is intended to be carried out without a general right of public input.&quot;  It went on to point out that the EU requires that the public are enabled to make submissions at the first stage and therefore the Supreme Court found that the Irish legislation was inconsistent with the EIA directive.<\/p><p>I will go into that because it is always important to give a little background or perspective to what is before Deputies.  Once again, we are introducing emergency legislation following a Supreme Court case.  As I said, I welcome the changes.  What concerns me, however, is the Minister's speech.<\/p> <p>There are six pages in it.  What concerns me is not the Bill as such, even though I have concerns about the manner in which it is being pushed through, but what the Minister proposes to do when we come to the amendments.  On the proposed Committee Stage amendments to the Bill, he stated in the House yesterday:<\/p><blockquote>\tI ... wish to inform the House of my intention to introduce Government amendments as the Bill makes its way through the legislative process on Committee Stage. ... [which] amendments relate not only to planning legislation, but to other [pieces of] legislation ... [under] ... the remit of my Department. <\/blockquote> <p>The Bills Office is under extraordinary pressure, but Deputies will not be able to deal with this.  If the Government proceeds with these amendments, we will come back with a whole new Bill.  I would like the Minister of State to deal with this for me.  We have what is described as a technical Bill to comply with our obligations under the Supreme Court judgment becoming an entirely different Bill, where proposed amendments are not before us and we have one week left to deal with it.<br\/><br\/>I will look at the amendments the Government is proposing.  They are amendments relating to short-term letting, ministerial directions regarding statutory plans and related provisions, flexibility in planning applications, which is a very complex and very significant area we need to look at, the judicial review process, the Valuation Act - I imagine those amendments will be somewhat technical - and the Maritime Area Planning Act.  I have concerns about all those amendments but what jumps off the page are the amendments relating to the judicial review process, the maritime Act, which we only passed recently and are now going to amend, and the flexibility in planning applications.<br\/><br\/>I will run out of time in a few minutes.  I took this time to register my concerns.  I wish I was going through the Bill in detail to say what was good and what was worrying about it.  I can only do so on a sketchy basis.  I am doing that because, when we discussed the maritime Act, we were lambasted by the Taoiseach.  That was extremely important legislation we needed to discuss.  He said he was fed up and tired - I am paraphrasing - because important and strategic projects were being inhibited by opposition.  Those were his words, more or less, and that mantra continues.  It continues in respect of judicial reviews.  I am calling it a mantra and a myth.  Yes, of course, we need to resource the courts and the judges.  We need to look at that, but not with the accompanying propaganda and spin that states projects are being stopped because of public participation.<br\/><br\/>Over and over again the superior courts in this country have stated there is a trinity in the planning laws, namely, the developer, the local authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la, and members of the public, without whom we cannot have a functioning planning system.  In my experience, since I was elected in 1999, every single hurdle has been put in the way of people participating in the planning process.  They are called objectors and they are demonised.  I call them active citizens who are sufficiently concerned to make their concerns known.  At every stage of the process, whatever the planning application is, it is extremely difficult for them.  Indeed, we brought in a restrictive system, where if people did not make an application at the city or county council level, they could not do so with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  We then brought in a fee.  We have this constant myth, repeated by a number of Deputies in the House, that we have to stop the various organisations on the ground that are holding up planning permissions.  We completely forget about the history of planning in this country and the Mahon tribunal, which found systemic corruption at every level of the organisations involved in planning, not to mention the very vivid pictures of money passing hands.  Here we are, and we will come back next week with a brand new Bill that we will not call a Bill.  We continue to misuse language.<br\/><br\/>When I spoke on the maritime Act, and the Taoiseach was very critical, many Deputies highlighted that only 2.13% of Ireland's maritime area is protected.  The programme for Government commits to reaching 10% as soon as practicable and 30% by 2030.  We fell short of that.  We are now being told that, by way of amendment, we will have a situation where a developer or company that does not have planning permission can occupy a certain part of the sea conditional on planning permission.  What is happening all the time, little by little, is an encroachment on public participation and in opening up the seas for development.  We have learned nothing from Covid or from climate change.  The maritime area is one of our greatest assets.  The area it covers is seven times that of our land mass.  This belongs to all of us.  It should be part of the solution in a new sustainable world.<br\/><br\/>I object to the amendments being brought in the manner they are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700029#EE00300","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657196700,"counter":377,"content":"<p>Like my colleague, Deputy Connolly, I will put on record my concerns about how this Bill is being brought forward in the rushed way it is, and how it is changing completely between now and Committee Stage next week.  This is a real problem.  It does not lead to proper democratic oversight of how the Bill progresses.  It is symptomatic of how this Government treats the end of term that is now coming up.  There will be 19 Bills before the House by the end of this term in July, while from January to July we probably dealt with approximately 12.  Some of the provisions in this Bill, which are being rushed through next week because they are absolutely necessary, have been flagged since before last summer.  It is not that these have suddenly been foisted on the Government and it has to deal with them; these have been sitting around.  The Department has been sitting around on these provisions waiting for the summer recess so it can get them in the Bill and get them rushed through without any scrutiny.  That is the reality of the situation.  These provisions have been sitting around since last summer so why could they not have been dealt with before now, if that is the case?  That really is a problem and it is worrying.<\/p>  <p>  It can be seen, when looking at every year for the past five or six years since I have been elected, and probably in the years before that as well, that in July there is a mad rush to put Bills through.  We get this process every summer in the run-up to the recess.  The same thing happens in the run-up to Christmas, when a raft of Bills come through.  Why is that?  It is because there will be no democratic scrutiny and that is what the Government wants.  We then get the Taoiseach coming to the House lecturing us about how there should be democratic scrutiny and so on, and that this is a legislative body and we should deal with legislation rather than motions and all that kind of thing.  The reason we deal with motions is the Government has no legislation to put forward.  That is why motions are on the agenda.  The Government would not allow motions on the agenda if there was legislation to deal with.  This scam that is played on the people by the Government every year is wrong.  It has been highlighted very particularly by this Bill today.  That is a problem.<\/p>  <p>  There are some useful things in this Bill that are to be welcomed, but there are also many things that are very concerning.  It is also interesting that it shows how the Government views and looks at the Supreme Court and how that court does its business.  As Deputy Connolly said, if a planning application was properly constituted and properly submitted to a council, it would not get a hearing in the Supreme Court.  The reason the Supreme Court allows planning applications to be heard is there are problems with them that have to be dealt with.  We would not have this so-called judicial process and so on if there was not a problem with legislation.  That is very important.  This Department states that this legislation is correct and defers to the Court of Justice of the European Union.  We then saw yesterday that the Department of Justice stated the Court of Justice of the European Union is completely wrong and should not be doing things.  The contrast between both Departments and what they look at is interesting.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the streamlining of the substitute consent process for quarries in this Bill.  That is very important.  County Donegal is probably unique in the country in that there are many approved quarries there and many that are just quarrying building stone.  The process has been tortuous for them.  There was an attempt to rectify it a number of years ago but that led to major problems for very small operators who are quarrying very small amounts of craft building stone.  They are being treated the exact same as very large operators of very commercial premises.  That is wrong.<\/p> <p>I welcome the fact that this sub-consent streamlining process is in there.  I think that will make a difference.  It is something positive that comes out of this legislation.  We look at the planning process and the flexibility that is within the system.  Some of these issues are very technical and it is important that they are considered prior to Committee Stage.<\/p> <p> The exclusion of the public from various stages is nonsensical and completely wrong.  The Minister will create more judicial processes by doing that.  I always wonder what is so badly wrong with the planning process that we have to exclude the public until a very late stage so that we pull the wool over their eyes for as long as possible and not let them know what is happening regarding a proposed plan.  That does not serve anybody.  The Minister is actually doing a disservice to the people he wants to help.  He is doing developers a disservice by putting this process on them.  If they went out and talked to people in advance of an application, I believe it would do a lot more to streamline the process and make it work for everybody.  That way, we would not have as many applications ending up before the courts.<\/p> <p> While there are some welcome aspects to the legislation, there is an awful lot that is very worrying.  These measures might be good if they were sorted out but the problem is that we will not have the time to deal with them and see whether they are or not.  This might be horrific for the Government, but perhaps the Opposition could amend the Bill in such a way that it would make it better and make it work, but the Government would never accept that.<\/p> <p> The process that we are going through here is wrong.  It is wrong for this Department and for every Department.  What is happening is that we are rushing legislation through in the jaws of summer and that is ultimately the real problem with this entire process.  I wanted to put my thoughts on the record in regard to the Bill.  I will deal with amendments at a later stage.  This process could have been done an awful lot better.  There was time to put amendments forward.  The Government says there is not very much time for legislative debate and that it has to put all the legislation in together to get it through.  If that is the case, there is something wrong with the process.  There is enough time from January through to July to get legislation addressed because very little legislation is dealt with in this House in that period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700030#FF00200","speaker":"1547","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657197300,"counter":379,"content":"<p>The Minister will probably get a great deal of agreement across the House that this process is very rushed.  It is lastminute.com.  We are dealing with planning.  I think we could all accept that we started from a point of having very poor planning regulation in this State.  We all know what the impact has been on regular people in that regard.  Much of that has been in the public domain for many years.  Reference has already been made to some of the tribunals.<\/p>  <p>  We also heard from some of the major stakeholders such as Transport Infrastructure Ireland, National Broadband Ireland and many others, which point out the flaws in our planning process.  That is the reason the Attorney General's review is ongoing.  I believe there are stakeholders' meetings happening in terms of reviewing.  I am very interested in how that process is working.  I would like to think there is some sort of overlap with the process with which the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, is engaged.<\/p>  <p>  Like many others, I have serious qualms about the substitute-consent process becoming a single-tier operation, as opposed to being a two-stage operation.  There is room within the two stages for a greater amount of public consultation and involvement.  I agree with the point many previous speakers have made to the effect that an awful lot of our planning difficulties and problems across the board are due to the fact that the pre-planning or consultation piece has not been done as well as it could have been.  We have all seen where good planning has been put into action.  We have seen where it has been done well by organisations in terms of wind farms, roads or whatever else and where there has been consultation with people who have been involved from a very early stage.  Sometimes, problems have been caught early and they have been addressed.  We have also seen where it has been done badly and where people's backs have rightly been got up in a community and then we sometimes end up with a situation where there are no winners.  We must ensure that whatever changes we are going to make that public involvement and consultation are put at the top of the agenda.<\/p>  <p>  A number of amendments will come forward relating to judicial reviews and a range of subjects that I do not have time to talk about at this stage.  We do not like how this process is being conducted and we believe that there are serious qualms in regard to this planning legislation.  The fact is that we do need to review the system and to improve it.

The Bill's purpose is essentially to streamline the substitute-consent procedure in the planning system.  Streamlining of the substitute-consent regime is required to increase the efficiency and utility of the process in order to safeguard confidence in the Irish planning system by eliminating a surplus step in the substitute-consent process.  It will also ensure that the system is fully in compliance with EU environmental requirements and recent court judgments.  In this context, it is proposed to provide for a single-stage application process under the remit of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which would replace the current two-stage process.<\/p>  <p>  It is also proposed to amend section 37L of the planning Act, which currently allows simultaneous applications to be made for certain quarry developments for both future development and substitute consent to An Bord Plean&aacute;la at the same time, so that simultaneous applications will be open to all types of development.<\/p>  <p>  Amendments are also proposed to section 34(12) of the Act which will require planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la to screen an application for retention permission for EIA and AA, and refuse to consider applications for retention of unauthorised development where either EIA or AA are screened in.<\/p>  <p>  While we are considering this legislation, it is appropriate to mention the current situation at An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Recent revelations have resulted in a loss of public confidence in the organisation.  I know the Minister has ordered an inquiry, which is currently under way.  Of course we await its publication, but it is clear the issue of public confidence in the board must be addressed.  It is critical that the public and stakeholders can have confidence and faith in our planning system.  Ireland's international reputation is at stake.  I look forward to measures being taken quickly to restore confidence when the inquiry concludes.  As regards, this largely technical Bill, I thank the Minister and his officials for introducing the legislation.  I hope it will streamline the process and deliver a more efficient planning system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700031#GG00300","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speech","time":1657197300,"counter":381,"content":"<p>This is a very technical Bill that deals with a process called substitute consent.  In Kildare, we have seen substitute consent relating to unauthorised developments such as quarries that have breached the water table and ended up as lakes.  These lakes can be an unintended swimming destination in rural Ireland.  They have many dangers including cold shock.  There have been a number of deaths in south Kildare over the years and I appeal to young people in particular to stay away from these quarry lakes.<\/p>  <p>  Substitute consent seeks to regularise planning permission retrospectively where an environmental impact assessment or appropriate assessment is required.  The most prominent and controversial case of substitute consent was an ESB wind farm in Derrybrien, County Galway.  A landslide during excavation work for the wind farm caused extensive environmental damage, resulting in the European Commission taking Ireland to court in 2008.  It ordered a retrospective environmental impact assessment, but this was not carried out.  In November 2019, Ireland was fined &euro;5 million by the European Court of Justice for the State's failure to carry out an environmental impact assessment at the site.<\/p> <p>Since then, a further &euro;15,000 a day has been added to that fine by the court, meaning the Irish taxpayer is currently facing a &euro;17 million penalty.<\/p> <p> The Bill makes some changes to the existing substitute consent process as the previous legislation on this was rushed and needs further amendment.  We have seen successive housing policy initiatives making a mess of the housing and planning situation and doing more harm than good.  We saw this with the strategic housing development legislation, which was slated by most councillors, including those who are members of the parties in government.  I question the need for this Bill.  There are existing mechanisms for substitute consent in exceptional circumstances.  The Bill gives the power of initiation to developers and makes it easier for them to access the process of seeking substitute consent.  This is another example of the Government looking after its developer friends, while substitute consent will no longer be available to local authorities to initiate.  If someone who has been breaking planning laws wants to apply to build a new development, that should be done through the mainstream planning process.  Access to a fast-tracked process for new developments should not be slipped in with the substitute consent process.  We must not reward bad behaviour in planning.<\/p> <p> We need wider consultation on this Bill.  The Government is ramming legislation through with little thought for the consequences.  We need a review clause to ensure the best interests of the public and the State are being pursued.  Further consultation with councillors is a must if we are to leave them with any semblance of having the power to represent their constituents.  We need to listen to them.  They have been elected to represent the people and their powers have been diluted far too much by the Government and its predecessor.  It is time to respect local democracy and show we place a value on it by investing in local authorities in order that decisions can be taken as closely as possible to the people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700031#GG00400","speaker":"1588","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657197900,"counter":383,"content":"<p>I will not speak to the Bill as I prefer to take this opportunity to flag several issues in regard to planning generally.  The Minister has intimated there are further amendments to come, which will give us a chance to revisit the provisions.<\/p>  <p>  There is an obvious need for affordable housing, whether by way of private sector delivery or State-supported schemes.  With the cost trajectory and affordability index rising all the while, State spending is more and more required to supplement runaway costs.  Does the Minister have any plans whatsoever to look at the tax take on new housing in the State in terms of VAT, stamp duty and development fees?  The latest figure I saw showed it is somewhere close to 40% on a new house build.  One of the main blocks that is occurring in the construction process at this time, particularly for housing development, arises from the role of what are, in essence, two State quangos, namely, Irish Water and the ESB.  I have spoken to a number of developers who pointed to those bodies as creating significant problems when it comes to getting schemes finished and certificates issued and being able to pass properties on to the end user.  I ask the Minister to look at that.<\/p>  <p>  Why will the Planning Regulator, having given a series of recommendations to deliver high-density housing in both urban and rural settings, not make himself available to local authority members to discuss their drawing up of development plans?  The regulations were given but we do not really know whether they have a statutory footing or are just recommendations.  It surely is incumbent on the regulator to make himself available to local authority members to ensure they are fully guided on what he is trying to deliver and what is required in terms of sustainable strategic planning at local authority level.<\/p>  <p>  The judicial review process, which has been referenced by other speakers, is farcical.  Many of the reviews relate to strategic housing developments.  Out of 34 judicial processes taken to date, the Government has lost 30, conceded one and three have not yet been heard.  There is a plethora of cases coming behind the ones that are already in train.  The legal cost to the State in respect of judicial reviews is horrendous, yet the Department continues to fight these cases, even though, based on the present trajectory, it has an almost 100% chance of failing.  How much longer will the Minister continue to put that cost onto the State when the judicial reviews are showing significant problems with the planning process?<\/p>  <p>  The quango that is Irish Water is almost dysfunctional in its failure to integrate with new planning schemes.  In Waterford, it has asked developers for &euro;30,000 per house for a connection to wastewater and &euro;5,000 for a connection to water.  I am sure the Minister of State is aware that the south-east region is probably the most disadvantaged in the country at this stage.  Where are buyers supposed to find &euro;35,000 just to connect to water?  The ESB is the other State quango that is throttling investment development and adding significant costs to the building of private and public houses.  The delays in connections and in the issuing of certificates are imposing increased costs on many developers in terms of accessing tranche funding before they can pass properties over to the buyer.  I ask the Minister and the Department to start looking at this in a serious way.<\/p>  <p>  We have a crippling lack of rental accommodation across the country, which is increasing the risk of homelessness for many people.  The Government must prioritise the delivery of cost rental housing and not just in large cities.  It needs to be done in rural areas also.  Likewise, affordable purchase schemes must be made available in coastal towns, including Dunmore East and Tramore in my area, where property prices are being driven way beyond the means of young people to get on the property ladder.  This is not acceptable and it is eradicating community into the future.<\/p>  <p>  I see no clear strategy to expedite the renovation of vacant housing.  We in the Regional Group brought a motion to the House setting out an interim accommodation measure in this regard.  In Waterford, the local authority has been very successful in rolling out a repair and lease programme that offers property owners the opportunity to access build finance, with the authority then renting the renovated property for a period of 20 years or so.  I understand Waterford accounted for nearly 55% of the total houses delivered under this scheme in the past year.  Why is it not being delivered in our large urban centres, where it could add significantly to the capacity of housing stock?<\/p>  <p>  Public sector procurement contracts need to be looked at and modified.  The fixed-costs model with a 180-day price guarantee is no longer suitable to the dynamic market trends.  That is why tenders are coming back unanswered.  What is the Government doing?  It is putting those tenders back to the market again as if something has radically changed, when, in fact, the same restrictions apply.  This is A, B, C stuff.  Why can something not be done about it?<\/p>  <p>  The amount of oversight, regulation and bureaucracy involved in delivering public sector contract builds is retarding output and driving up finished-cost prices.  Even for development on public lands, the time taken to expedite the build and receive settlement payment is too long and the price is too costly.  In my area, I have seen private sector housing delivered in half the time public sector builds take.  Hard-pressed taxpayers and the State are paying for these delays.  Ultimately, it is falling back on the Exchequer to support cost prices by way of first-time incentives and so on.<\/p>  <p>  Several parties in this House are talking about a constitutional change to give a right to housing.  If such a proposal is brought forward, it will be meaningless without the ability of the State to deliver it.  The Government continues to adopt the position of a detached onlooker to the issues around costs, many of which it is driving, and appears to have no appetite to remodel the system.  That is a significant flaw in Government policy.  The recent report outlining the significant fall in house ownership among 25- to 35-year-olds is a significant clarion call for our future economy and the welfare of those who are welded to rental opportunity only.  This is the most productive demographic sector and it now faces significant disadvantage arising from the rampant cost escalation in the general construction sector and the failure of the State to regulate that cost base in any significant way or remove some of the burdens that are being placed on hard-pressed families.  We should be trying to ameliorate those pressures as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, we will get another chance to consider the Bill that is before us today.  I have far more pressing concerns in terms of the development of policy around housing and planning.  I have outlined areas in which the Government could, if it wished, take significant actions to help people trying to get onto the property ladder, including those who are welded into rental accommodation and will be for the rest of their lives.  They could have an opportunity to buy a house if the Minister would give serious consideration to those issues.  I wait to see what actions he will take.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700032#HH00200","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speech","time":1657197900,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.<\/p> <p>I want to concentrate on planning first and what is really happening in that area.  Taking County Galway, we have just passed the county development plan.  It has been operating for two weeks.  We are being told now, and it is being put out there in the newspapers, that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, will be producing a review of rural housing and the strategy for planning and development in that regard.  This creates uncertainty.  Coming up to the passing of our county development plan in Galway, the submission of applications for rural housing was undertaken in a frenzy because people were fearful that something would happen in the context of that plan.  Now, another rush of applications is going to come because people are afraid of what the Minister will bring in to restrict people building houses in rural areas.<\/p> <p> At the same time, we have many growth centres in County Galway, such as Craughwell, Corofin, Abbeyknockmoy, Ardrahan, Laban and others.  It should be possible for houses to be built in towns and villages, but we cannot do that because we do not have any wastewater treatment plants.  When I say wastewater treatment plants, I mean publicly-owned wastewater treatment plants.  In effect, what is happening is that Galway County Council&rsquo;s planning department and An Bord Plean&aacute;la are refusing to allow development in any of these towns and villages if a municipal wastewater treatment plant is not available.  They call it \"premature development\".  At the same time, we do not want people to live in the countryside.  We are trying to push them into the towns and villages, where they will have services.  Equally, people are being pushed into the cities and away from their families.  Therefore, we must look at this issue in respect of how we are providing housing and ensuring that people can live, work and raise their families in their own parishes.  It is important that we go back to the grassroots on this issue.<\/p> <p> Similarly, with zoning, policy decisions that have been made and that are being implemented by the planning regulator are forcing high densities and restricting the amount of land that can be zoned for development.  This is creating scarce supply.  Additionally, regarding the zoning that is being designated, the land concerned may not be available because the owners may not be able to sell it, perhaps due to the legal title not being right.  All these things are done on a desktop, however, so we end up with lands that are zoned as R1 in our towns, cities and counties, but which cannot be built on.  Therefore, we are creating an increase in the value of zoned land that is available and, in turn, increasing the price of our houses.<\/p> <p> I had an interesting conversation last week with a mother whose daughter is building a house and who must get a water connection from Irish Water.  This shows how bad the situation is.  The water connection must come from the mains, which is 250 m from the road.  Irish Water has estimated a cost of &euro;300 per linear metre, which would add up to a total of &euro;75,000 to get a water supply to the house.  We have gone way beyond any kind of real common-sense approach to building houses if that person must pay &euro;75,000 for a water supply, and all because Irish Water has set a national rate for laying pipes and will not allow anyone else to lay pipes along public roads.  So be it.  In the commercial world, however, that piping could probably be laid for about &euro;5,000 and I would even argue that that might be a bit too dear.  We must be realistic here and ask who is paying for what and who is conning whom.<\/p> <p> Turning to this Bill, the substitute consent process was flawed when it was initiated.  I have seen cases where An Bord Plean&aacute;la awarded decisions on substitute consent that stipulated that a development or project was fine up to the date of the said decision, but that it was necessary to go back in again and seek planning permission for future works.  Effectively, that closed quarries badly needed for infrastructure.  I know of a case involving one quarry that has been in the courts.  Every time the quarry makes a move to do something to regularise its position, judicial reviews are brought to the courts.  At this stage, that quarry's planning application is not in Heaven or in Purgatory but down in Hell, because neither the county council nor An Bord Plean&aacute;la have any legal mechanisms by which they will accept an application for future planning concerning this development.  At the same time, several years ago this same quarry was deemed qualified to supply stone to Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, for a major project being undertaken in Galway.<\/p> <p> Therefore, something is completely amiss here.  There is a mystery as to who is putting in all these objections, who is taking all these judicial reviews and who is going to the courts at such a cost.  The Minister and the Government need to examine what is going on in the quarry industry now.  If they do not, then we will be closing quarries by stealth and we will end up with few suppliers.  There may then be a cartel-type operation.  Therefore, I strongly urge the Government to have a look at this issue, because I am not comfortable with what I see going on in respect of the objections going in.  There are serial objections and there is no fear that money will not be found to do what the objectors are doing.  I would like to see transparency regarding where the money is coming from to put in these objections.<\/p> <p> A case in point, and it is mentioned in the briefing notes, is Derrybrien.  From day one, that was a sordid mess.  It continues to be a mess because we have now lost the capacity to generate green energy.  We are going to decommission the 45 wind turbines up there.  They are a valuable asset in Galway now and they are going to be decommissioned, which means they will have to be taken down and taken out of there.  That is going to create a risk of further landslides and mudslides.  We have gone from bad to worse to crazy in what we are doing now.  I would like to see legislation enacted to allow the ESB to try to regularise what has been done at Derrybrien and to keep that project live so we can benefit from it.  We have paid enough fines on that development and now we have to take the equipment down.  It just seems to be completely off-the-wall stuff and our hands are tied because of things we cannot do because of legal matters.  I challenge that perspective.  It is not the legal matters that are the problem, but the policies we have put in place.  The legislation we put in place was not good enough and the transposition of EU law into this country has also been flawed.  There is much to be answered for in the area of planning and this kind of crazy stuff has got to stop.<\/p> <p> We will have an opportunity to discuss this Bill next week.  There are many technicalities in this legislation and many issues that we will have to tease out.  I am glad that in the meeting of the Business Committee today the Government acceded to there being an extra hour to debate this Bill and accompanying amendments.  Planning has become a burdensome process for our public works.  If building to provide hospital beds, a flood relief scheme, a road, a railway or whatever is to be undertaken now, in the normal set of circumstances, the processes we have put in place for ourselves to try to be perfect people in how we do things mean there is now a seven-to-eight-year timeframe from the inception of a project to the date we will be able to go to tender.  The Government has announced that it is going to build an accident and emergency hospital department in Galway.  The project has been announced, but we must wait eight years before we will see a building contractor on site.  Equally, we have to tell people who have been flooded out several times that it will be seven or eight years before we will have a plan in place to allow us to deal with the problem.  There is something wrong.  Housing is an emergency right now, so we need to be able to do things in an emergency to ensure we can build houses immediately.<\/p> <p> I believe the construction industry can build the houses we need.  We will have to innovate and change some of the techniques by which we undertake building, but I believe that if the projects get to the contractors, then they will build them.  The big stumbling block now, however, is trying to get through these processes.  Another bugbear of mine is this issue around the public spending code, PSC.  It is another one of these things that was used when we had no money as a reason to delay projects.  It should not now be used as an excuse to stop or to delay us building houses, the necessary infrastructure for our health services and works to relieve flooding around the country.  Nobody is talking about flooding now because nowhere is flooding.<\/p> <p>I can guarantee that when the next flood comes, the people who were flooded five years ago will wonder what happened in the meantime.  Someone will say that consultants and hydrologists were brought in to do feasibility reports and whatever else, and that planning permission and appropriate assessments are needed.  They will look at the amount of money spent on all of that, yet we have achieved nothing.  It is important that there is a common-sense approach to planning.<\/p> <p> The Government must take the planning and procurement processes by the scruff of the neck in order to ensure that certain facets of our development can be done on an emergency basis and that, first, housing and, second, health infrastructure - be it hospitals, community nursing homes or whatever - are built.  Nobody will thank us in five or six years' time if we get all the paperwork right but have nothing done.  The biggest tragedy in housing is that we are not able to move from this great, big inertia that we have put in front of us in terms of getting things done.  We have to do it and be brave.  We have to do it for a short term in order to get things going again.  It is very important that we do it for the people who are hard hit as a result of everything that is going on.  If we do not show some initiative, bravery and forward thinking, we will be talking about this in ten years' time and have nothing done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700032#HH00300","speaker":"1482","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657199100,"counter":387,"content":"<p>The updated list indicates that Deputy Matthews is the next speaker, but it is between the Deputies to decide.

I somewhat agree with my colleague across the House, Deputy Canney, when he said that planning has gone from bad to worse to crazy.  While I agree with him, it is probably for different reasons because we look at planning differently, but his points were well made.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister referred to several new amendments in respect of planning and other legislation relating to his Department.  I am worried that we are rushing through legislation without the necessary scrutiny.  The Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill is very important legislation that covers a very complex area and such scrutiny is essential.  The Minister mentioned his intention to introduce a substantial number of amendments that will amend the Maritime Area Planning Act that was passed at the end of last year.  We still do not know what these amendments are.  Introducing entirely new amendments to legislation at the last minute is neither wise nor prudent.<\/p>  <p>  The Maritime Area Planning Act went through legislative scrutiny and it would be unwise to now make changes to the planning legislation without any scrutiny.  We have seen, again and again, the unintended consequences of changes to planning legislation, which is the basis of my concern.  Any changes will introduce uncertainty between the relationship of the new provisions and existing provisions of Irish planning law, as well as the European Union legal obligations, to which Irish planning law gives effect.  All of this is within the context of our international law obligations under the Aarhus Convention.  On the face of it, I do not see any unavoidable conflict between these new proposed provisions and the rights of public participation, access to justice, and access to information as protected under the Aarhus Convention.  However, I am concerned about the unintended consequences.  I ask the Minister to go on the record and formally confirm that this is his understanding and to commit to the D&aacute;il that the State, in responding to any litigation under these provisions, will do so consistent with such interpretation of these provisions.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the national planning framework, which is one of the major macro-effects of the Planning and Development Act.  The planning framework was introduced in 2018.  The idea behind it was that we would build up regional cities at a faster rate than the capital.  We need to build homes as fast as we can but we also need to build them in the right places.  The spirit of the national planning framework was that the regional cities would grow at twice the rate of the capital over the next 20 years.  We are told that this is about balanced regional development, but colleagues will agree that we have paid lip service to balanced regional development in this House over many decades.  The national planning framework is not doing what it set out to do.  Looking at it in real numbers, even though the target population growth of the regional cities is 60% versus Dublin's 30% in the next 20 years, because the regional cities are coming from such a low population base, it is not as impressive as it sounds.  We will be well into the next century before we see a convergence of those trends and actually achieve the balance that we say we are trying to achieve.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the problem with the national planning framework, there is strong evidence that suggests the framework is not doing what it intends to do and that it is not the straitjacket on planning and developing that it was supposed to be.  It increasingly looks like it is not even a useful guide.  We are seeing most development and population growth taking place in the counties of the greater Dublin area.  The gap between the capital and regions is widening and the all-roads-lead-to-Dublin approach, which has been the unwritten policy of the State for the past 60 years, seems to be the outcome if not the stated approach today.  We have to make a concerted effort to change this for undeniable economic and social reasons, as well as for environmental reasons.  It is not good for the capital to be burdened with such growth when it does not have the infrastructure to cope and when providing that infrastructure in the capital is difficult, slow and costly.  A better approach for Dublin and Ireland would be to genuinely target significant growth in the regional cities that have latent underutilised infrastructure and development land.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Minister confirm that there will be a review of the national planning framework in 2024?  That review, if it happens, should embrace the original spirit of the national planning framework and do away with the predict-and-provide approach and move to a plan-and-provide approach, as is the norm in other jurisdictions.  In my city of Limerick and in the mid-west region in general, we have grid, water and rail infrastructure as well as development land.  Limerick could grow at a very fast rate if the State decides that it is the right thing to do, which I firmly believe it is.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to raise a concern about An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  As a State agency, it is unusual in the way it was set up in the context of governance.  It does not have the required operational independence.  Unlike other State agencies, the board, which is appointed by the Minister, is involved in decision-making.  It simply does not have operational independence.  This is an issue that needs to be examined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700034#KK00400","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1657199100,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this highly technical Bill about the process of substitute consent.  It also addresses some issues and gaps caused by the rushing of earlier legislation.  In addressing some of the detail, changing substitute consent from a two-stage process to a single-stage process is problematic given how critical scrutiny and accountability is to the planning process.  Public participation is vital.  The public should not be excluded from a planning process that affects it.  Far from removing public participation, the Bill should seek ways to strengthen it, which we are obliged to do under the Aarhus Convention.  Early public participation would also prevent delays down the road.<\/p> <p> That is not our only concern.  The fact that the fast-tracking provision in the Bill applies to substitute consent applications pending with an Bord Plean&aacute;la is equally problematic.  In addition to those difficulties, there is the further matter that substitute consent is meant to be granted only in exceptional circumstances.  Fine, one might think, except that the definition of exceptional circumstances is very broad, far too vague and just not satisfactory.  We believe that where substitute consent is refused, An Bord Plean&aacute;la should be required to set out clearly what remediation actions are taken in respect of the site of the unauthorised development.<\/p> <p> Similarly, we are extremely concerned at the apparent intention to introduce on Committee Stage significant amendments relating to a range of planning issues and to the matters of judicial reviews and short-term letting without there being adequate time to consider those issues or to open them up to the necessary scrutiny.  Judicial review is an important recourse open to the public, not least - in fact, most importantly - on planning matters with a climate, environment and biodiversity impact and on matters of the public good over private profit or private interest now and into the future.  That is especially important as we grapple with the rapidly unfolding impacts of climate change and seek to meet our emissions targets.<\/p> <p> As for the matter of short-term lets, public scrutiny must be facilitated.  This sector is wreaking havoc on the housing market and, through that, on our people's lives.  Far too many people in north Kildare are spending their children's childhoods waiting and waiting on housing lists while the market, political parties and political ideology in thrall to the sector prioritise short-term tourism needs over longer term living needs.  Homeless families live in hotels while tourists live in Airbnb homes.  It shows that our priorities are all wrong.  We need to bring more light onto the planning process and a lot less heat into the market.  We would be a lot better off.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700034#KK00500","speaker":"1585","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657199700,"counter":392,"content":"<p>This is a very technical Bill.  In my view, it needs a lot more time for discussion.  I said in the D&aacute;il last week that we need more time for Bills rather than rushing them through the D&aacute;il.  However, it looks like the way this Government works at present is to talk little, to push through everything and to give very little opportunity to people in the Opposition to scrutinise these Bills in the way they should be scrutinised.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of issues with the Bill.  Many Deputies have raised issues with planning.  I certainly have many concerns about planning in my constituency, Cork South-West.  Deputy Leddin said that Limerick must grow.  He is well entitled to say that because he represents Limerick.  I appreciate and respect that, but west Cork should grow too.  With every plan and county development plan, the councils have done everything in their power to make sure it does not grow and, if it is to grow, that it is to grow only in a bigger town.  Rural communities and areas need the life built back into their areas too.  A lot of one-off planning permissions, which have to be deemed as being extremely safe, once they are carried out in a proper fashion, are being discouraged in every way.  Many young people have had their lives ruined because they have been forced away from their own bits of land and their own home areas and are being rammed into towns or villages that sometimes do not have the resources or the facilities their old rural communities had.  In a large number of cases they may have had broadband and many more services in the areas they left and may not have them in the places to which they moved.  There is no point in saying they have better sewerage systems because I know a lot of towns in west Cork that are pouring raw sewage into the tide, including in the parish I live in, Goleen.  It is sad we find ourselves in the situation we are in, where we have a Green Party in government and that is the case.  There is no progress whatsoever on that issue in my area, and there are more similar areas.  I could name them.  I commend the movement in Castletownshend.  We had discussions there last week because this is hugely important.<\/p>  <p>  Then I looked at the county development plan, however, and saw that quite a lot of areas that were zoned had become unzoned for some reason or another.  Who came up with that miraculous plan behind the scenes to zone an area maybe five or ten years ago and then to pull the plug?  People had plans in that area to build their community.  Those plans are gone to the wall now, and it is very unfair.  That needs to be explained.<\/p>  <p>  The planning process is extremely difficult to navigate.  Young families try to get off the ground, get up and get going in their lives.  The first thing they want to do is meet the planner.  Now that is not allowed either.  Since Covid the planners have gone into hiding and there are only online meetings, which is terribly unfair on young people who want face-to-face meetings and want to work out what is suitable and where and to get a feeling as to whether they are going in the right direction, instead of spending a lot of money - and a lot of money is being spent.  I know of one planning permission in my area - obviously, I cannot name the person - in respect of which the amount of work to get it across the line was shocking.  I do not know how many thousands it cost the family and the young man trying to get on in life.  There was this report for this and worms and snails, and I do not know what other reports in the name of God they had to draw up before he got planning.  Halfway through the family said to me, \"To hell with it, we are packing it up.\"  I urged them to keep at it.  They thought it was a terrible exercise.  The same people who devise it are very careful about the environment and whatever else.  There are so many rules and regulations attached to planning now that it is making things extremely difficult.<\/p>  <p>  There is also reference in the Bill to quarries and to the changes in that regard.  I was talking to Deputies Danny Healy-Rae and Mattie McGrath about this yesterday evening.  We are very worried about these changes.  Obviously, there have to be rules and regulations in respect of quarries, but if these changes come into effect, the small quarry owner, if he has a slight infringement, could be closed down very quickly.  That will suit the large quarry owners who have a monopoly in the market already.  If the Government starts closing the small quarry operators around Ireland, in rural areas in particular, the large quarry operator will price projects and deliveries out of all means.  It will break the local authority and break the ordinary couple on the street in the countryside who are trying to build their house and trying to pay for material.  They will not be able to pay for material because the large quarry operator will already have a monopoly in the market.  My worry is that this is a nice way to shut off the small quarry operators who have been great to local people, supplying goods at a fairly reasonable price and keeping these large operators on their toes.  I would like the Minister of State to clarify that for us later.  I would also like him to clarify that the latter is not what is intended and that if there is regulation - and there needs to be regulation - and if there is an infringement, at least the person gets a slap on the wrist and is told to put it right.  Okay, if after a second time they are not willing to do that, then the Government should move in.  However, if the Government is willing to shut down the smaller operators who are struggling as it is because of fuel costs, energy costs and everything else, the Government is only really putting them out of business.<\/p>  <p>  Many Deputies have spoken about the Irish Water connections.  It is astonishing to hear the prices some people - people, again, trying to get on and to get going in their lives - are being charged for a basic water collection.  Many people tell me they can run the pipe up themselves and can do everything else.  All they need is for Irish Water to do the final connection.  That is not allowed, of course, because somebody wants to take a nice tap of money out of it before finishing up.  That is an area that has to be looked into seriously because people cannot keep being penalised day by day and night by night.  We have to ask the questions of Irish Water and the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications.<\/p>  <p>  Why did I read a recent report to the effect that areas such as Clonakilty, Skibbereen, Bantry, Durrus, Goleen and Crookhaven are running out of water?  Imagine Clonakilty running out of water.  Development is no longer allowed there.  The people of Clonakilty want development in their area, as they deserve, because there are opportunities there.  The areas I have mentioned have had no works done to their reservoirs.  It looks like it could be a dry summer but not ragingly dry.  I know that the Minister of State or some other Minister will get up in a minute and say it is all to do with the environment.  For God's sake, that has been going on for the past 40 or 50 years.  The Government should stop that old nonsense talk.  The reality of the day is that if there is a dry summer in some of these areas, there will be no works.  There have been no works on some of the sewerage systems in Goleen and places like that - and it is not just Goleen.  They ran out of water in Coppeen, which is near Ballineen, two weeks ago for 24 hours.  What is wrong?  Why is the Government not investing in areas in west Cork?  Is it keeping all the money for the capital?  Is that where the money is going?  Will this Bill tackle those issues?  That needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>These people could be without water within hours which would be a scandal.  I am very concerned about the people in Skibbereen, Bantry, Durrus, Goleen and Crookhaven if that is to happen for the summer months.  <\/p> <p> I have spoken about areas such as Ballinspittle also.  It has significant issues with sewage.  The town is very close to Cork city and could increase in population.  It would be a super boost to that area of Ballinadee and Kilbrittain.  This work needs to be carried out.  It seems like a great deal of money has been spent but it has not been spent in the constituency that I represent. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700035#LL00200","speaker":"1461","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657200300,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I am happy to speak on this Bill, although I am very perplexed about the manner in which it has arrived in the Chamber which is as a result of a Supreme Court judgment.  Why has this happened at half past the eleventh hour of the D&aacute;il term?  What is of more concern is the question of where the planning and environment Ministers are? I have no issue with the Minister of State present with whom I have worked for a year.  Perhaps the brief of the Minister of State covers this but I believed his was an education brief.  These Ministers could do with an education on how to treat this House.  We are elected to pass and to consider legislation and to put forward amendments, and the Minister said he intends to table Government amendments to this Bill next week.  Where is the time to discuss those amendments, because we do not know what they will be?  The debate today could be void and empty because Government amendments are going to be brought forward.  I have never seen the beat of it and I am nearly 15 years or more here.  It is shocking.<\/p>  <p>  This legislation is being rushed and 19 pieces of legislation have come before the House in the past number of weeks.  We had 12 such pieces of legislation in the year before that.  This is a pattern that has crept in.  The Ceann Comhairle is here.  We divided these up this morning at the Business Committee meeting but it is not right, if you ask me.  This would appear to be a carefully laid out plan because none of the backbenchers is coming in.  I appreciate Deputy Leddin is present but no backbencher from Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael or the Green Party was present when legislation was being dealt with this week.  It is as if as they said let it off and let the Opposition huff and puff and bring the house down but we will pass this legislation in any event.  Being an Independent Group, we could not watch it.  There was a list of speakers, but they were not turning up to speak because they do not have time.<\/p>  <p>  There are very significant issues in planning.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle has left the Chamber, which I appreciate.  She raised issues on which I differ fundamentally around the area of An Taisce.  An Taisce has done great work in the schools with the green schools flags and on many other issues, including on the environment.  I resent, and I have raised it on this floor, the way it treated an industry in south Kilkenny, in respect of which, thankfully, a sod was turned last week after several court challenges.  I have no problem with people taking court challenges but the Taoiseach said to me one day that we have to limit the number of judicial reviews taken, which we must do.  An Taisce had no issue with the plant, the emissions, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, licence or anything else but had an issue with the cowherd.  How weird is that?  The building itself is a pristine cheesemaking plant where there is a ready market for its products with Dutch investors and we almost lost it.  <\/p>  <p>  Meanwhile, we were ferrying last summer and this summer milk from the south Kilkenny, all of Tipperary - my area - and other counties up to the Strathroy Dairy because we could not cope with the processing.<\/p>  <p>  What about the CO2 levels there and the emissions from the trucks?  How narrow-minded and perverse are the members of An Taisce?  Deputy Collins, myself and my colleagues met with its members and we got nothing but disdain from them.  We were to have a follow-up meeting with them but we never did.  They need to be reined in as do all of these NGOs.<\/p>  <p>  In reply to a parliamentary question put recently by Deputy Nolan, it was stated that there are 36,000 NGOs costing &euro;5.5 billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money annually.  What would that not do for back to school costs or to lessen the cost of living crisis if half or nine tenths of that were applied to it?  These bodies have mushroomed all over the place and are effectively dictating policy to the Government.  This Government and previous Governments have given them too much of a hearing.  The plant I mentioned almost disappeared because of people who have good jobs, who are retired with big pensions, who have public jobs and who live in nice places where they themselves were granted planning.  They do not want anybody else to have planning permission.  This is a case of the fox minding the henhouse.  These people were granted planning in lucrative areas, such as in Ballina in my county and other lovely areas, but they object to anybody else being granted such permissions.  It is a shocking situation.<\/p>  <p>  We did not meet the president of An Taisce, Fr. McDonagh.  We would have loved to have done so but we met his colleagues.  We might as well have been talking to Petticoat Loose and the Legend of Bay Lough, which is down in south Tipperary also.  Like other people here, I am shocked to think of the amendments because we do not know what the Government will bring in next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700036#MM00200","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1657200300,"counter":395,"content":"<p>I will be telling the Deputy about all of these when I reply to the debate.

I know the Government Deputies are hiding from them, but they will find you with the peann luaidhe istigh sa bhosca ball&oacute;ide.  They will find you and you will be fairly low down the list when they start using that pencil if you treat the people like this, and you will know what to expect.<\/p>  <p>  We are treating the House very badly.  I am not blaming the Minister of State present but I am blaming the Government as a whole.  It is one piece of legislation after another with the guillotine.  We had 45 minutes for a very important legislation last night.  The Opposition wants to be helpful and to pass legislation, such as in the area of special needs schools, and so forth, but this is just stretching it beyond what is acceptable, and it is just incredible that the Government can do so.<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of the quarries, some quarries can do what they like, such as the big conglomerates, which I will not mention, but everybody knows who we are talking about.  I was an admirer of Se&aacute;n Quinn for decades because he brought competition to the market with ready mix cement.  When I used to travel from Omagh and Monaghan on a Monday morning, an-luath ar fad, I would meet a couple of hundred green trucks moving around and it was a breath of fresh air.  What happened was a pity - if he got greedy or whatever - but he brought that badly needed competition.  Most of the small ready mix owners in my county were wiped out by big conglomerates.  Are we going to do the same with the small quarry owners?  If there are blatant infringements, yes.  They have to operate within the law.  If we bring the heavy hand of the law down on top of them, the big conglomerates can wheel out best barristers and can hold the process up for a long time.  This is not only happening in Ireland but is a pattern internationally.  I have great concern for the jobs and for the self-employed quarry owners who have built up a business over the years and may have ten, 20 or up to 50 employees, with the cost of electricity to run the crushing plants, the cost of fuel and of everything else.  If they go we will have no competition, then what will happen?  We will be in real trouble.<\/p>  <p>  Someone asked why we need the Office of the Planning Regulator because, in respect of the county development plans - our one in Tipperary is going to be finalised on Monday after two and a half years - the power that the county councils had in the making of the plan, through debate and discussion, is being overruled by this new office.  Why do we now need to create these great and powerful positions to take away the power from the democratically elected people on the councils?  It was the one power or function they had with which they dealt fairly and reasonably in most cases.  Shenanigans obviously went on in the past.  They were and had to be rooted out but now it has gone to one man who can do what he likes and does not have to answer to anyone.  Yes, he looked to meet me several times and with several members of my group but we did not meet him.  We have people now in big comfortable chairs, in nice plush offices with a brass plaque on the wall and they wield the power and have the ear of Government.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, I will not stray into discussing it, a Cheann Comhairle, because there is an investigation going on at the moment and there could possibly be legal challenges, or whatever, but it is not functioning.  A simple decision is required in New Inn in County Tipperary which is very important to people living there.  There is a phone mast right on top of a house and people in the local area are objecting, and rightly so, because there are plenty of other options.  It is right beside a listed building and three or four other listed buildings, including a reilig or an old graveyard, are in the curtilage of this mast.<\/p>  <p>   An Bord Plean&aacute;la has postponed the decision deadline three times and although the application is still in the system, it has given no deadline as to when it may make a decision.  It was a month, then it was put off for a further month or two, and a further number of months, and now it is vague and there is no decision date on the application.  That is happening with many projects.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la is not fit for purpose.<\/p>  <p>There is too much political influence, as Deputy Leddin alluded to.  It is not transparent.  We will see this when all the dirty linen is washed.  If the clothes were hanging out on the line on a good summer's day like today they would be fairly well stained.  They would need the washing machine and Daz or whatever is used now.  They have gone away from Daz.  I am not saying that I am a bad homemaker and I do not do some washing but I am not up to speed with the capsules that go into the washing machine.  It used to be Surf and Daz when I was a duine &oacute;g.  The Ceann Comhairle will also remember them.  We have a lot of clearing up to do.<\/p> <p> The Bill is not fit for purpose.  It is emergency legislation long after the Supreme Court made its judgment.  Why the rush with not enough time?  I will sit and wait to see some idea of the Government amendments.  Imagine we have not yet had sight of them.  There will be a briefing on Monday and next week the Bill is scheduled to go to and from the Seanad to be passed.  I have never seen the likes of it.  How will we have time to table amendments, study the Bill, study the briefing we will get on Monday and have the resources for amendments?  Anyway they will be ruled out of order, and if they are not ruled out of order the guillotine will be coming down on us like a big sharp tool to cut off all debates.<\/p> <p> We need a re-examination.  We have gone backwards with regard to debating legislation and the Opposition having an input.  We have regressed during my time in the D&aacute;il.  Then we get lectures from the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach that we are bringing in reports and Private Members' motions.  It is our duty.  The Government was not acting.  Now all of the actors have come together.  It is like the opera house.  We have opened again and we have 19 pieces of legislation that we are trying to get through in a mad panic.  Rushed legislation is bad legislation.  Justice delayed is justice denied.  We are not dealing with the real issues or the elephant in the room.  People must have a right to object but frivolous objections from NGOs that are well-paid with taxpayers' money and are objecting to taxpayers trying to put a roof over their heads are bonkers.  It is not fair on Se&aacute;n Citizen and Mary Citizen.  It is not what Cathal Brugha and others fought for in the War of Independence.  The Ceann Comhairle mentioned him this morning and I want to be associated with his remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700036#MM00600","speaker":"1612","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657200900,"counter":400,"content":"<p>Is Deputy Matthews a baritone or a tenor?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700037#NN00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1657200900,"counter":401,"content":"<p>I am a tenor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700037#NN00300","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1657200900,"counter":402,"content":"<p>Fiddle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700037#NN00400","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1657200900,"counter":403,"content":"<p>I hope the Minister will get a chance to correct some of the statements made during the previous contribution.

I listened to what he said.  It is entertaining a lot of the time but it is factually incorrect.  I reiterate my support for An Taisce and the fine work it does throughout the country.  Much of the environmental protection we have in the country comes from EU directives.  I do not think we would have introduced it ourselves.  We should acknowledge the contribution of Europe.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with some of the previous contributors that planning is complex.  When we introduce changes to the planning system they can impact further down the road in a way we may not be aware of.  This is why we should take considerable time when we seek to change aspects of the planning system.  Much of the planning system is very good.  The Act has been amended many times since it was introduced in 2000.  It is difficult legislation to follow.  I welcome the Attorney General's project to review the planning system and put some shape and form back on it so it does what it is meant to do, which is to provide for proper planning and sustainable development in the common good.  We need to put these three principles back at the core of planning despite some Deputies who might think that because planning does not suit them it is wrong.<\/p>  <p>  I will speak about the Bill before us.  We had pre-legislative scrutiny on this in September 2021.  At the time we were notified this was urgent legislation and we should expedite it.  We did so and we produced a report in November 2021, conscious of the urgency because of the judgment in the Ballysax and McQuaid cases.  It is disappointing to see the legislation not come before the House until one week before we finished.  I am concerned about it.  We have organised a briefing for members of the Oireachtas joint committee on Monday at 11.30 a.m. and I thank the officials and the Minister for assisting us with it.  All members are invited to attend and if they contact the committee we can issue the link.  I welcome anybody to attend.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill seeks to regularise developments that should have required an environmental impact assessment at the time.  There is nothing in EU law that precludes this.  It does allow it.  It is a positive move and will put us right with Europe.  I have several concerns and I look forward to getting better detail and discussing them on Committee Stage.  The substitute consent process is being streamlined to bring it from two stages to one stage.  I now understand why one of the stages is surplus as public consultation on the exceptional circumstances has been brought into both stages.  A two-stage process provides time for members of the public who may have an interest to be alerted to the fact a substitute consent process is happening or that somebody is seeking a substitute consent process.  We will now have a single stage and I am concerned members of the public will not have much time to react to it.<\/p>  <p>  I note the comments made by the Minister yesterday that he will extend the period from five to eight weeks.  It needs to be longer than this.  Normally the substitute consent process goes through the leave stage and then the substantive stage.  There will be a longer period of time for this.  I am open to correction on this.  It is important that we allow every opportunity for public consultation in the planning system.  Generally, the more people, the more stakeholder engagement, the more notification and the more information is available, the better the outcome.  Everybody may not be satisfied with the outcome but at least they will have had an opportunity to participate and make their opinions known.  We are used to hearing the word \"objection\".  There is no such thing as an objection in planning.  It is an objection that could be negative, positive, seeking a change in conditions or seeking conditions to be attached.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to detail the planning process in lay language for ordinary understanding.  Planning in is very complex.  I have experience of it but I do not think any of us in here has huge expertise in it.  It is difficult to make decisions on it.  There is the whole area of exceptional circumstances.  I would like the Minister to put into plain lay language the list of these.  There is a provision that somebody could reasonably demonstrate they did not know they needed planning permission.  It is hard to buy because everybody knows and everybody is aware of the planning system.  People would know if they were in an area where a development would need an environmental impact assessment or if they were extending a development that might be unauthorised.  They would be aware of it.  It is a very weak exceptional circumstance.<\/p>  <p>  Having a few minutes to discuss five or six significant areas of amendment the Minister has introduced is ironic.  We have only a week to deal with this and I have only a few minutes to deal with six points.  With regard to section 31 directives, we have a planning issue in local authorities whereby we have councillors who make decisions against the advice of senior planners, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the National Transport Authority, the Department, An Taisce and many experienced professional planners.  Councillors go ahead and make a decision anyway not because it is in the interests of planning but because they have the numbers to make those decisions.  This decision is then kicked up the line to the planning regulator, who must then notify the Minister who must issue a directive.  My concern is that there are small matters that do not comply with core strategies, national guidelines or regional planning guidelines and the Minister may not seek to issue a directive on the cumulative impact of all of these measures.  They have a cumulative impact.  When councillors make decisions, proposals or objectives they need to apply a strong rationale and logic that they can stand over.  They need to be accountable for going against professional experience and recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  I want to mention short-term lettings.  In somewhere like County Clare rent pressure zones do not exist but there is tremendous pressure for rental units.  My colleague, Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey, constantly raises this with me with regard to the pressures in seeking residential rental units in Clare.  We need to extend rent pressure zones throughout the country because the pressure exists throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  The design envelope is a sensible approach to take, especially when we are dealing with highly-technical developments such as wind turbines.  In two or three years they could be larger or smaller.  The technology could have improved.  The size of the wind farm may get bigger but the number of turbines may be smaller.<\/p> <p>It is sensible to have that.  I do have concerns that this seems to be extended to all aspects.  We are told that for maximum flexibility it is intended that the amendment would apply to the main land-based applications under the Planning and Development Act.  Is the design envelope not being applied to all planning and development?  It is a pity that we do not have more time.  I can take it up with the Minister on Committee Stage. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700037#NN00700","speaker":"1626","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657201500,"counter":407,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I agree with some of the points Deputy Matthews made in relation to An Taisce.  The organisation has played a really important role in protecting Irish culture and heritage.  It has held people to account who need to held to account.  The organisation has done the State a good service.  I wish to acknowledge that.  Planning and development is an important issue in every community right across the country.  The recent controversy in relation to An Bord Plean&aacute;la has been a huge blow to the confidence of the communities that I represent.  It has undermined the belief and sense that there is any integrity around An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  That feeling has been badly damaged.  I am not sure if people are aware of the anger that exists among the public following events surrounding An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The allegations around Mr. Paul Hyde have done serious damage to the integrity of the entire planning process, and not just An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The anger has also spilled out towards Dublin City Council and other local authorities right across the country, even though there is no evidence of any link there.  People will always talk, but in my experience as a member of Dublin City Council the planners that I worked with were nothing but professional and showed great integrity.   We agreed and disagreed on different elements of planning applications and developments, but the reality is that the they always showed complete professionalism.  I am aware that the Minister has sanctioned an inquiry into the deputy chairman of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The online publication The Ditch has highlighted the rot that has set into An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  We are lucky to have such strong investigative journalism in the country.  In 2016, a review into An Bord Plean&aacute;la was carried out.  Little has come out of the recommendations of that review.  Mr. Remy Farrell, SC, has been tasked with investigating the deputy chairman.  It is essential that the Minister publishes the findings of the investigation as a matter of urgency.  The fact that the deadline for the publication of Mr. Farrell's report has been extended by a few weeks is worrying in and of itself.  The report is not due to be published until the end of this month.  Of course, that means that the D&aacute;il will be in recess when it is published.  We need to know, and be confident, that all of the allegations that have been made against members of An Bord Plean&aacute;la will be investigated.

It will be held at a meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Some of the Minister of State's colleagues are less than forthcoming with giving people time, if they are not members of committees, notwithstanding Standing Orders.  I must say that Deputy Matthews is not among them.  I appreciate the fact that he does give people time.  If the Government is going to change the law, there is a way to do it, which is to bring legislation through the Houses so that everybody can debate everything fully in plenary, before going to Committee Stage, and coming back to the Houses for Report and Final Stages before the legislation is passed.  Invariably, legislation is passed because, as Deputy Matthews discussed in an entirely different context, it is all about having the numbers.  If the numbers are there, legislation can be bulldozed through, whether it is good, bad or indifferent.  It is a case of territorial pissing sometimes, the idea being that we will do what we want to do because we have the numbers to do it, and screw everyone else.  That is a little bit of what this Government does on occasion with legislation.  I am not saying that the Minister of State agrees with it.  I am certainly not saying that Deputy Leddin agrees with it.  However, there is a tendency to do that sometimes, and to ram legislation through at the end of term.  This is one example of that.  Why are we debating this legislation now, at the very end of term, when pre-legislative scrutiny was completed, as Deputy Matthews pointed out, months ago?  We have had months of sitting around and discussing statements instead of debating legislation, praising our wonderful Government for this, that and the other and for what it is doing, or criticising our Government because it is an abomination and the worst Government ever.  Either way, it is pretty short-lived stuff.  I cannot even remember what it is about.  The Minister of State cannot remember either.

This Bill could have been debated on Second Stage a lot sooner.  Pre-legislative scrutiny was completed.  I do not know this for a fact, but I presume that a committee had to change its schedule at short notice to get pre-legislative scrutiny done so that it could be discussed.

If I had a problem with the legislation, I would contribute to the debate.  I do not vote on stuff that I have not read, if I can help it.  I certainly do not purport to vote on matters if I am not here to vote or anything like that.  I do not want to go down that road.  I want to strike that from the record.  I withdraw that comment.  It is important that we have proper legislative scrutiny.  Pre-legislative scrutiny having been carried out months ago, there is no reason being given by the Government as to why this legislation could not have been debated before now.  Instead, we are now being told that we are not actually debating the legislation that is before us, which I have managed to look at and do not have a problem with.  I had not intended to contribute to the debate.  We are now being told that a load of amendments are going to be brought on Committee Stage, and they are going to be rammed through.  A guillotine procedure might even be used so that we will not get to discuss them.  That happens.  If the Minister of State does not believe that it happens, then he was not here last night.  At a conservative estimate, &euro;2.4 billion of taxpayers' money will be spent on the pyrite scheme, but everybody believes it will be a lot more.  It is fundamentally undemocratic.  There is a lot of celebration of Irish independence, the fact that the D&aacute;il is the only body that can make laws for Ireland and that we can elect our own people to the D&aacute;il, and rightly so.  Yet, here we are legislating by decree, almost.<\/p> <p>If the Government wants to legislate by decree then it should do so and bring in regulations but if it wants to actually legislate, it is important we can discuss and tease out fully the content of that legislation.<\/p> <p> I greatly welcome the comments in that regard by my colleague from the mid-west, Deputy Leddin, that we need time to discuss legislation and that there is plenty of time available to us generally to discuss legislation, though we might use it for other things.  Regardless of where all these statements come from - and I am not going to labour this point any more - there is this tendency to bulldoze legislation through at the end.  It has been commented on by another component of the Oireachtas, namely, the President, that it is troublesome.  We should also bear in mind this legislation arises out of a Supreme Court judgment and seeks to address an anomaly in the law, but the response to it then is to ram legislation through without considering it fully and to add amendments to it that cannot be considered, at least on Second Stage, because we do not know what they are.  We are, therefore, going to bring in legislation to deal with an anomaly in the law by ramming legislation through and possibly, at least, creating more anomalies in that law in that regard.  Legislation may not be the most interesting or glamorous part of a Deputy's life but it is what we are elected to do and we should be allowed to do it.  A Government should not, like a power-drunk county council, abuse numbers to just ram stuff through.<\/p> <p> I accept there is occasionally a need for emergency legislation that must be rushed through overnight.  The legislation dissolving the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, is one example.  If that had not been brought in by the next morning it would have had considerable financial repercussions for the State but this is not legislation like that.  It simply is not, and most of the legislation that is being rammed through is not like that.  It shows a disregard for democracy.  That is an easy statement to make, one the Opposition makes regularly but one you rarely hear Government Deputies making, though when I was one I made it with regard to legislation that was guillotined.  I should say I was not a Government Deputy but rather I was a Government-supporting Deputy.  You are either a member of Government or you are not.  Hearing these concerns from some on the Government benches is very welcome.  I hope the Government will listen, if not to the Opposition making these points then to its own backbenchers making them.<\/p> <p> I reiterate I do not have a problem with what is in this legislation but it is what is proposed to be put in at short notice that concerns me and the corrosive effect that has on democracy if that is how it is done.  That sets a precedent not just for this D&aacute;il but future D&aacute;ileanna and future Governments.  Members of the Government will not have a majority forever and they will probably be complaining about legislation being rammed through once they lose this majority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700038#OO01500","speaker":"1518","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657202100,"counter":422,"content":"<p>I thank all those who engaged in the debate on this Bill and for the facilitating of today's debate and for the further work that is going to go into this legislation, including Committee Stage amendments and trying to get the Bill through the Houses before the summer recess.<\/p><p>As the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, mentioned in his opening speech, the chief purpose of the Bill is to amend the substitute consent process, which concerns retrospective environmental impact assessments  or appropriate assessments in exceptional circumstances, by removing the superfluous initial leave to apply stage.  This initial stage did not involve public participation.  Related provisions clarifying EIA and AA screening processes for planning authorities are also included.<\/p><p>Just to say, the delay in producing the legislation was unavoidable due to the complexities of the Bill as published in terms of the drafting from the Attorney General's office and notwithstanding the fact pre-legislative scrutiny had taken place a long number of months ago.<\/p><p>The Bill also provides that an existing provision that is presently solely available to certain quarry projects alone, to allow a simultaneous application for future development at the same time as a substitute consent application, is expanded to include all development types.  This is to encourage remediation of existing unauthorised developments.  Any perceived benefits to a section 37L future-facing application of being able to apply directly to the board, instead of having to separately apply to the relevant planning authority first, will be significantly outweighed by the inherent vulnerabilities and significant potential financial exposure if the related substitute consent application is refused.  In such cases the relevant planning authority will be statutorily obliged to initiate enforcement proceedings against the unauthorised development seeking remediation of the site.  Furthermore, the future-facing planning application on the same or adjoining site may also be refused as a result if, for example, it relies on any elements of the refused substitute consent proposal.  In other words, the legislative proposal to allow parallel substitute consent and planning applications does not on balance provide an advantage to developers, noting the significant constraints and vulnerabilities for any developer attached to progressing a substitute consent proposal relating to unauthorised development, as well as noting the clear benefits to the public in allowing a parallel and holistic assessment of two related proposals on the same or adjoining sites to take place at the same time by the same assessment authority.<\/p><p>In the context of the wider planning system, substitute consent applications make for a very small, statistically insignificant percentage of the overall number of planning applications.  However, this does not recognise the important role played by substitute consent in bringing certain unauthorised developments back into the planning process where they can be subjected to appropriate environmental oversight and regulation.<\/p><p>The Bill also serves as a vehicle to introduce a number of important legislative amendments that fall under the remit of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I will detail them now.<\/p><p>The first Government amendment to be introduced on Committee Stage relates to short-term letting provisions in the Planning Act.  The Government recognises the issue of the significant number of properties withdrawn from the long-term rental market in recent years that have instead been diverted for use as short-term lettings and the associated negative impact this has had on the supply and availability of private residential rental accommodation with associated knock-on implications for rental prices.  Further amendments will be brought forward to address the issue.  Supplementary to these new legislative provisions, the Minister proposes to issue new guidelines to planning authorities updating the criteria to be taken into account in determining applications for change of use planning permission in respect of short-term let properties in rent pressure zones, RPZs, having regard to the extraordinary pressures for properties currently prevailing in the private rental market.<\/p><p>The second set of Government amendments to be introduced on Committee Stage relates to ministerial directions on statutory plans as provided for in the Planning and Development Act.  Since the April 2019 commencement and operation of the Office of the Planning Regulator on foot of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018, a number of technical matters have come to light regarding the legislative procedures of section 31 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 including, but not limited to, sections 31AM and 31AN on development plans and variations, sections 31AO and 31AP on local area plans and the interrelationship of such.  Minor and technical amendments are required to address cross-referencing, standardised wording, notifications and consistency in procedure for both the draft direction stage and the final direction stage.  The technical and procedural amendments introduced by this Bill will provide clarity and consistency of language and procedure for all stakeholders including local authorities and the wider public.<\/p><p>The third set of Government amendments to be introduced relates to flexibility in planning applications in the Planning Act.  These amendments address the decision of Mr. Justice Humphreys in the case of Peter Sweetman <i>v<\/i>. An Bord Plean&aacute;la, Ireland and the Attorney General and Bord na M&oacute;na Powergen regarding the design envelope approach for the submission of certain planning applications which require a degree of flexibility at planning application stage as the final details of the development may be unconfirmed at that stage.<\/p> <p>The High Court judgment disapplies all such flexibilities and replaces them with a very limited range of flexibilities, which is insufficient for the operation of a modern and effective planning system.  <\/p> <p> The amendments contained in this Bill introduce a pre-application procedure for planning applications seeking a level of flexibility with regard to the details of the proposed development to be submitted as part of the application and are intended to legislate for an approach which facilitates flexibility while providing sufficient clarity to allow planning authorities to consider what level of information is appropriate on a case-by-case basis, while also providing appropriate safeguards for environmental assessment.  While it is intended that the amendments will be of assistance to renewable energy applications in particular, the amendments are drafted to apply to all planning applications generally.  Any request for flexibility must be considered by the planning authority or the board and an opinion will only be issued where the planning authority or the board considers, given the specific circumstances of the planning application, that it is appropriate for the application to be made on a flexible basis.<\/p> <p> The next set of Government amendments to be introduced on Committee Stage relate to the judicial review proceedings in the Planning and Development Act.  New amendments will require the court to consider whether there is an adequate appeal or other available administrative remedy and if so, it should not grant leave.  This is not as absolute as the amendment that was originally proposed but it is compliant with EU law and creates a presumption, which the court is required to implement, that issues arising from determinations of planning authorities ought to be appealed to the board unless there are special circumstances.  In effect, an appeal rather than a judicial review challenge should be the default position in the first instance.<\/p> <p> There are two further amendments which will assist in reducing unnecessary judicial reviews and help to achieve Government policy in this regard.  The first will confer on the board and planning authorities the power to make an amended decision where there is a challenge.  If the challenge demonstrates that the board has made an error which nullifies its decision, the board will be able to have the matter remitted to it to make a new decision and it will not be necessary for the court to make an order invalidating the decision prior to the board doing this.  That will enable the board and planning authorities to correct any errors on the face of the record that would otherwise lead to the quashing of the decision.<\/p> <p> The final amendment introduced is designed to assist developers in obtaining remittal and address the judicial reluctance which has manifested itself recently to remit matters to planning authorities following a successful judicial review challenge.  At present, some judges refer matters back to the planning authorities to make a new decision while other judges are reluctant to do so.  To address this, it is proposed to provide for an effective presumption that the matter can be remitted to the board at the commencement of the legal proceedings in order that the errors can be corrected quickly, thereby avoiding associated delays with such proceedings.<\/p> <p> The fifth set of Government amendments to be introduced on Committee Stage relates to amendments to the Valuation Acts.  The purpose of these amendments is to enable the Commissioner of Valuation to defer the roll-out of the national revaluation programme.  In February 2022, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage agreed with the Commissioner of Valuation that the commissioner will further defer the revaluation of rateable properties.  It had been agreed to delay the dates for the revaluation of the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown rating authority on two previous occasions of foot of the impacts of Covid-19.  This amendment gives effect to the most recent review of the commissioner and agreement to the further postponement of the revaluation programme. <\/p> <p> The sixth set of Government amendments to be introduced on Committee Stage relates to technical amendments to the Marine Area Planning Act 2021.  The proposed amendments, which are technical in nature, have been recommended and drafted by the Office of the Attorney General.  Section 56 is amended by this Bill to allow for the appointment of a chief executive officer designate by the Minister ahead of the establishment of the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority.  Other amendments provided for are technical in nature and to support the establishment of the new marine planning system.<\/p> <p> In concluding the introduction of this Bill to the House, I thank Members for their contributions and confirm that the Minister will engage further on Committee and Final Stages next week.  I also point out, as has been mentioned, that the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Department officials will host a briefing next Monday morning for committee members and any other Member of the Oireachtas who wishes to partake.  We look forward to a positive engagement.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700039#PP00200","speaker":"1493","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657202700,"counter":424,"content":"<p>Question put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1657202700,"counter":425,"content":"<p>Insofar as a vote has been called, it is deferred until immediately before the Committee Stage of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700040#QQ00400","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Payment of Wages (Amendment) (Tips and Gratuities) Bill 2022 [Seanad]: Second Stage","time":1657202700,"counter":426,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700040#QQ00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1657202700,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I move: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to introduce the Payment of Wages (Amendment) (Tips and Gratuities) Bill 2022 to the House.  The Bill enjoys significant cross-party support.  I acknowledge the contribution of Senators, whose thoughtful contributions have helped us refine and improve the Bill.  I also acknowledge my colleague, the current Leader of the Seanad and former Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Senator Regina Doherty, who initiated this legislation.  I also acknowledge Sinn F&eacute;in and Labour Party Oireachtas Members who produced Private Members' legislation on this matter.  I further acknowledge the trade union movement, including Unite and SIPTU.<\/p>  <p>  Until now, there has been no legislation which requires employers to pass on tips and gratuities received from customers to their employees.  Tips and gratuities are a common feature in the hospitality sector and in some personal services.  The vast majority of employers treat their staff fairly, and I acknowledge that.  Unfortunately, there is evidence that some employers use tips as part of overall business income or use them to make up employees' contractual wages.  That is not right.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill makes some legislative changes to ensure there is fairness and transparency in the distribution of tips and gratuities in the sectors where these are common.  The Government's position is that overly burdensome regulation in this space is not necessary but that certain objectives must be achieved through appropriate regulation.  <\/p>  <p>  I want the hospitality and service sectors to be seen as a valued and sustainable career choice.  This Bill will bring clarity and transparency to how tips are treated and will bring benefits to large numbers of often low-paid workers and migrant workers in these sectors.  Tips can form a significant percentage of a worker's take-home pay.  This Bill will ensure that tips are distributed to the people who have earned them.  Making sure of this is all the more vital given the cost-of-living crisis emerging as a result of the series of external shocks brought about by the monetary policy of world central banks, Covid and, most recently, the Russian invasion of Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill passed through Second Stage in the Seanad in February.  Following that debate, we refined elements of the policy relating to the treatment of mandatory service charges.  The Bill before the D&aacute;il today has been amended to respond to some of the issues raised by Senators.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill has three objectives.  First, it will prohibit employers from using tips and gratuities to make up contractual rates of pay.  This ensures that tips and gratuities will be additional to a worker's contractual earnings.  Second, employers will be legally obliged to distribute tips and gratuities paid in electronic form, such as by debit or credit card, to their workers.  This is all the more important when fewer people are using or carrying cash.  People often now leave tips in electronic form.  The Bill requires that these tips and gratuities should be distributed in a fair and transparent manner.  If there is a dispute, the Workplace Relations Commission can adjudicate on whether the approach taken by an employer is fair and transparent.  Where money is not handled by the employer at all, such as is the case with regard to cash tips or some of the new applications people can use to leave a tip, this Bill will not interfere with arrangements that employees have made privately with one another.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill will also require businesses to display clearly their policy on how tips, gratuities and mandatory charges are distributed.<\/p> <p>This transparency is to the benefit of employees and customers.  It will not prevent business owners from imposing other surcharges, for example, for group bookings, where often they have to hire additional staff at a premium.  However, it will be clear that it cannot be described as a service charge unless it is treated as though it were a tip or gratuity. <\/p> <p> Following amendments in the Seanad, employers will also be prohibited from describing mandatory charges as &ldquo;service charges&rdquo; unless they are treated in the same way as tips or gratuities, as I said earlier.  This will provide clarity for customers on how certain charges are used.  It is also important to stress that this does not interfere with the right of a business to impose mandatory charges on customers for additional services.  However, if the charge is called a \"service charge\" or something similar, then the employer must pass it on to employees as though it were a tip or gratuity.<\/p> <p> We have taken this approach to eliminate uncertainty for customers and staff as to what the purpose of service charges is.  This is preferred over an outright ban on services charges in hospitality or other defined sectors.  Banning mandatory charges outright could have adverse or unanticipated consequences for employees, employers and consumers.<\/p> <p> A most important objective of the Bill is to provide a legal entitlement for workers to receive tips and gratuities paid in electronic form.  These tips and gratuities should be paid out to workers in a fair and transparent manner.  To ensure this, the employer will be required to provide a statement to workers showing the total amount of electronic tips obtained in a period and the portion paid to the individual employee for that period.  <\/p> <p> Employers will also be required to include in detail how cash tips are dealt with in their tips and gratuities policy.  There will be no other regulation of cash tips because the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, advises that it would not be workable.  Cash tips are not accountable and may not be under the control of the employer.  This means there is no clear evidential trail if there is a complaint.<\/p> <p> In contrast, payment of tips and gratuities by electronic means is under the control of the employer and they can control how these tips and gratuities are distributed.  The pandemic saw a large-scale movement away from cash, much of which has been sustained as we move to a more normal way of life.  Payment of tips by electronic means is becoming the predominant way of tipping staff.  The electronic record generated by this payment method will facilitate investigations by the WRC in the event of a complaint.<\/p> <p> On redress, a WRC adjudication officer may take into account certain factors when determining whether tips were distributed fairly.  These factors include the seniority or experience of the employee, the value of sales generated by the employee and the number of hours worked.<\/p> <p> There will be no interference with schemes where tips are managed by employees themselves, for example, under a tronc system.  These will continue to operate as they currently do.  There will also be no change in the tax treatment of tips and gratuities.<\/p> <p> The Bill provides for a review clause under the Act, which will be reviewed after one year in operation, when employers, employees and customers all have experience of how the legislation has worked in practice.  Further changes and modifications to policy can be considered in light of that understanding.<\/p> <p> There may be a minor cost to employers in complying with the new regime this Bill introduces.  This includes having to prominently display a statutory notice of the employer's tips and gratuities and mandatory charges policy.  However, information and guidance will be provided by my Department and the WRC to assist employers to develop their own policy and to help them identify the types of information and procedures that should be outlined and displayed in their policy.  There will, of course, be engagement with the representatives of these sectors before final sign-off.<\/p> <p> Most establishments already treat their employees fairly with regard to tips.  For these businesses, the Bill will have little impact.  They will simply have to display their policy clearly.  However, other businesses will have to review how they operate and how they treat their employees.  Their employees can have recourse to the WRC if they have a complaint.<\/p> <p> For customers, the requirement for establishments to clearly show how tips are distributed and to whom they go will ensure transparency.  It will provide reassurance that tips and gratuities left for staff will be distributed as the customer intended.  This goes for whether you pay by cash or card.  The requirement that the employer must provide a statement to employees showing the amount of electronic tips obtained in a period and the proportion paid to the individual employee for that particular period will ensure transparency for employees.<\/p> <p> The Bill will further improve the rights and entitlements of workers.  It builds on a set of legal rights that the Government is introducing to protect workers.  These include the new annual public holiday, the Sick Leave Bill, which is currently making its way through the Houses, the transparent and predictable working conditions directive, the right to request remote working, the right to request flexible working, the living wage and, indeed, the move towards a national pension scheme, or auto enrolment, so that all workers have an occupational pension to top up their State pension.  I firmly believe that these improvements to workers' rights are essential to recruit and retain the staff that we need to drive our enterprise economy forward.  I also believe they are essential in our efforts to build a more just society.<\/p> <p> In conclusion, the Bill will improve the rights and entitlements of workers, largely in the hospitality industry where pay rates are often low, and it will provide welcome transparency and reassurance for customers.  I commend the Bill to this House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700040#QQ00600","speaker":"1474","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657203300,"counter":429,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this important Bill.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports this Bill.  That will not surprise anyone.  Nevertheless, there are a small number of areas where we would like to see this Bill strengthened and I will reference them in my contribution, given that only 45 minutes have been scheduled for Committee and Remaining Stages next week.  It is frustrating for me, as a legislator, as I have a number of amendments tabled that I think will help to strengthen the Bill.  Many of them will not be reached because of the short time that has been allocated for the Remaining Stages.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill arose out of the bravery and hard work of workers and trade unions, and in particular, the One Galway movement, my own former trade union, SIPTU, Mandate and Unite.  All of these campaigned tirelessly on this issue over many years.  In particular, I want to give special thanks to the hard work and bravery of Julia Marciniak, who now with Unite.  She put her head right above the parapet and took on an unscrupulous employer for robbing tips from workers.  She drove this issue home and put herself out there.  In the industry she was working in, that is not an easy thing to do.  I want to acknowledge that the T&aacute;naiste met Ms Marciniak on a number of occasions and it is clear from this that he listened to her.  It is fair that we commend her on her work on this and on her input into this very important legislation.  She dragged a light and shone it purposefully on this whole industry.  I also wish to mention that this Bill being on our agenda is due in no small part to the work of Sinn F&eacute;in's Senator Gavan.<\/p>  <p>  In 2017, Sinn F&eacute;in presented a Bill on this issue alongside the trade union movement.  That Bill subsequently passed all stages in the Seanad, despite opposition from the T&aacute;naiste's own party, but more importantly, it kicked off a national conversation about tips and the importance of legislating for the protection of employee tips.  Thankfully, Fine Gael's position changed.  I commend the T&aacute;naiste on bringing forward this Bill, engaging with the trade union movement on it and strengthening it in the Seanad to the benefit of workers.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill does several important things.  It places tips, gratuities and service charges outside of the scope of a person&rsquo;s contractual wages, ensuring that tips cannot be used to top up a worker&rsquo;s wage but rather, that they are in addition to a worker&rsquo;s wages.  Following pressure from Unite, SIPTU, Sinn F&eacute;in and others, the Government amended the Bill in the Seanad to have service charges treated the same as tips and gratuities.  Prior to this change, service charges imposed by an employer could have been used to pay a worker&rsquo;s wages or, indeed, just be kept by that employer.  This was a significant win that will definitely benefit workers.  I was delighted to see that this aspect was strengthened.  I know this was done because there is an understanding of the importance of service charges to workers in the hospitality sector.  As I said before, the T&aacute;naiste engaged with the trade unions on this aspect of the Bill and in fairness, the changes that were brought forward will make a real and meaningful difference.<\/p>  <p>  However, I have no doubt that, like me, the T&aacute;naiste is concerned with public social media posts from the Restaurants Association of Ireland that state it intends to figure out a way around this part of the Bill that has been strengthened.  Not long after the amendments were passed in the Seanad giving workers a right to a share of the service charges, the aforementioned association and some of its members posted comments saying that it is their \"understanding that businesses are still permitted to apply a group booking charge as part of the new legislation\".  Essentially, what this looks like is that some businesses might intend to change the name of the charge from a \"service charge\" to a \"group booking charge\" to use this as a mechanism to circumvent this legislation.  To be honest, I was not necessarily surprised when I saw this, but the immediate efforts of the sector to look straight away for ways to circumvent this new law tells us all we need to know.<\/p> <p>What is more, it does a disservice to us as legislators, and to the T&aacute;naiste as a Minister who is trying to create a fair law in respect of workers' rights in the context of tips, gratuities and service charges.  Sinn F&eacute;in hopes the T&aacute;naiste will bring forward amendments to ensure the legislation cannot be circumvented.  We will work with him to do that.<\/p> <p> We welcome the obligation on employers to display prominently to customers their policy on the distribution of cash and electronic tips.  Additional provisions could be included, however, to make sure that every customer knows well what is the policy.  It could be added to menus, posted in bathrooms or communicated in another way to customers.  It is important that customers know where  their tip, gratuity or service charge will go.  There should be engagement with F&aacute;ilte Ireland with regard to ensuring that people travelling here know about this law.  If I tip in a restaurant when I am abroad, I want to know that it goes directly to the intended person.  I would find it reassuring, as would most people, to have that information front and centre.  There may be a role for F&aacute;ilte Ireland in promoting and publicising that.  It is also saying that this is a decent place and that if a customer leaves a tip, the worker gets that tip.  That makes one's food taste better.  I am not sure whether that is true, but it might work as part of a marketing campaign.  Maybe the T&aacute;naiste will take it on board.<\/p> <p> Furthermore, there is a clear obligation on employers to distribute all electronic tips.  Crucially, workers have a right to redress at the WRC, where issues arising in respect of tips, gratuities and service charges can be considered.  However, there is no right to redress in respect of cash tips.  That can be amended on Committee and Report Stages.  I understand the Department believes it would be difficult for the WRC to adjudicate on that issue but, as a person who has experience in this area, I know that every case at the WRC is difficult and can be challenging to adjudicate on.  That is not a reason not to do or consider this, however, and see if a mechanism can be found to address it.  If the WRC is supported and resourced properly, it can have success with regard to cash tips.  Let us not forget what we are discussing here.  We are talking about the stealing of money.  We have not done away with theft as a charge if a person robs money from someone else in the street, so we should not allow a worker's money to be robbed by an employer.<\/p> <p> I commend the work of Dr. Deirdre Curran and Unite the Union on the treatment of workers in the hospitality sector.  They have done a significant amount of research and studies into this sector and their work should be acknowledged.  In considering hospitality industry, it is valuable to hear from people who are engaged with workers on the ground and tell us what is really happening.  In 2016, Sinn F&eacute;in carried out research on the treatment of tips for workers in the hospitality sector.  That research indicated that one in three workers were not getting their tips.  The research by Dr. Curran suggested that figure was one in four, while more recent research undertaken by Unite suggests the figure may be closer to 50%.  It may be the case that half of workers who are tipped by a customer are having their tips robbed from them.  This is why the Bill is so important.  It is also why Sinn F&eacute;in wants to see penalties for contravening sections of the Bill increased to a class A fine of &euro;5,000 from a class C fine of &euro;2,500.<\/p> <p> Contravention of sections of the Bill equates to employers, in effect, stealing from their workers.  We have seen such instances uncovered time and again through WRC investigations.  It is often labelled in the media as the recovery of unpaid wages, which is one way to spin it.  It is not how I would describe it.  This is money that has been stolen.  In the past decade alone, &euro;18 million in wages has been returned to workers following WRC investigations.  The withholding of wages is particularly rampant in sectors where women and migrant workers make up a large or significant part of the workforce, such as the food and drink industry, the hospitality sector and retail.  These are the same sectors where one would expect tips, gratuity and service charges to be left by customers for workers.  It is clear, therefore, that we need strong protections and a strong and well resourced WRC.  Sinn F&eacute;in would like to see a rapid increase in the power of the WRC, including increases in staffing and funding, so that it can investigate workplaces and ensure that workers' rights are being respected and upheld.  It is no surprise that the more funding the WRC gets, the more breaches of employment law it uncovers.<\/p> <p> My final point is in the broader context of the industry.  It follows on from the excellent contribution of my colleague, Senator Gavan, in the Seanad last week.  In 2008, the joint labour committee system for the hospitality sector was struck down by employers.  That was a significant blow to workers in the industry because the system did not just establish tiered rates of pay such that one could look forward to a career and career progression in the industry, it also dealt with issues such as paid breaks, overtime rates, Sunday premiums, holiday entitlements and sick leave.  These were laws that protected low-paid labour.  Many of them predated the foundation of the State.  It was a significant blow to have those laws struck down by the High Court.  The joint labour committee legislation was reintroduced in 2012 but for ten years now, employer groups in the hospitality sector have refused to engage with that process.<\/p> <p> Despite the level of State support rightly given to the sector during the pandemic, they still refuse to engage in the joint labour committee process.  The Government gave a range of supports to keep the hospitality sector going throughout the pandemic.  I am not suggesting that this is somehow a transaction or that workers' rights can be bought from employers - they cannot because, as I always say, the price eventually gets too high.  One has to consider the supports that were rightly given to the sector, however.  Sinn F&eacute;in supported those measures and worked with the Government to ensure that the legislation got through quickly.  The sector, however, does not participate in the joint labour committee process.  We need to consider that.  Indeed, it is fair to say that many of the recruitment and staffing issues the sector faces - we know of these issues because they are well amplified in the media - could be resolved by adhering to the joint labour committee process and ensuring workers have a career path, structure, paid breaks and all those things that need to be codified, have to be enforced and are part of that joint labour committee structure.  These points are important in the context of ensuring people can make a decent living in the sector.  Some 43% of low-paid workers work in hospitality, retail and wholesale.  We need to ensure a better future for them so that people can look forward to a career in those sectors.  That will not come about unless there is proper negotiation and engagement.  That can happen as part of the joint labour committee structure.<\/p> <p> I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I look forward to working with the T&aacute;naiste on Committee and Remaining Stages of the Bill next week.<\/p> <p> In the few minutes I have remaining, I wish to bring to the attention of the T&aacute;naiste an issue that is coming to the fore within the hospitality sector, namely, the harassment of workers.  The T&aacute;naiste knows the sector and has engaged with some workers' representatives.  He knows that those in the sector are, for the most part, low-paid workers.  Many of them are migrants and many are women.  They are vulnerable workers.  The levels of harassment need to be examined.  There is enough anecdotal evidence - the T&aacute;naiste may be aware of it - to suggest there is a serious problem, as there often is where there is a massive power imbalance between the people at the top and those on the shop floor.  The levels of harassment, including sexual harassment, within the sector deserve to be examined.  I raise this issue because I unexpectedly have some time left in my slot.  It is my intention to pursue the issue because it is a serious one.  I very much look forward to working with the T&aacute;naiste and the Department to ensure that we can stamp out harassment within the sector.  What is happening is not on.  This is a vulnerable group of workers.  We are here discussing additional protections that are needed because they are a vulnerable group of workers.  They are not just vulnerable in the context of tips theft or wages being robbed, they are also vulnerable in a host of other ways.  We need to examine that.<\/p> <p> I urge any person working in the hospitality sector who is not a member of a trade union to join a trade union.  We know that collective action and people power work.  We know that one's union is one's voice at work.  It is a strong voice for the worker in his or her workplace.  Any worker in the sector who is not yet a member of a trade union should find out where his or her union is, join it and get active in it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700041#RR00200","speaker":"1467","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657203900,"counter":431,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  Like many others, I spent several years working in the hospitality sector.  I understand how poorly paid are those working in the sector, how challenging a job it is and how important tips are to staff right across the hospitality sector.  My party and I support the Bill.  It is important.  There has been a long campaign on this matter.  It is great to see it advancing through the various Stages.<\/p>  <p>  I commend the constant effort of hospitality staff.<\/p> <p>From personal experience, I know that when you work in the hospitality sector, you are drained at the end of each day.  It is extremely tiring work.  The last thing you want to do is get involved in a campaign.  The fact that they are committed and working to make changes is a credit to them.  It is also a credit to the trade union movement, which has been extremely active during this campaign.  As Deputy O'Reilly said, the One Galway movement has also led the way.  SIPTU, Mandate and Unite the Union have all campaigned tirelessly on this issue for many years.  My colleague, Senator Gavan, has been a constant voice in support of workers in the hospitality sector for a long time.  He highlighted the issue of tips being withheld by employers.  In 2017 he introduced the National Minimum Wage (Protection of Employee Tips) Bill 2017.  Unfortunately, that was blocked by the previous Fine Gael-led Government, which made it the subject of a money message.<\/p> <p> A high number of workers in the hospitality sector frequently see their hard-earned tips being withheld by employers.  We have seen from research that one in three workers do not receive the tips that they earn.  The change in stance by Fine Gael is very welcome.  I commend the T&aacute;naiste, whose engagement in the process relating to this issue has been very important in resolving and ensuring that the Bill was brought forward.  It is important to acknowledge his contribution.  Amid the cost-of-living crisis whereby so many low- and middle- income workers are struggling from week to week, it is hard to see their tips being withheld and gratuities taken from them by employers.  As Deputy O'Reilly said, people want to see staff getting the tips they leave for them.  They pay the staff who have been serving them during the night and delivering excellent service, and they want the tips they leave to go to those staff.<\/p> <p> Ireland has one of the highest rates of low pay in the developed world, with 20% of our workers in low-paid jobs and 50% of women currently earning &euro;20,000 a year or less.  A high proportion of those employed in the hospitality sector are low-income workers, and their tips and gratuities can make or break their week.  The withholding of tips and wages is especially rampant in the food and drink and hospitality sector in which large numbers of women and migrant workers are employed.  In the context of these sectors, you would expect tips, gratuities and service charges left by customers for workers to end up in workers' pockets.  Little do the majority of tipping customers realise the extent of the practice of withholding of tips, gratuities and service charges by employers.  Employers pocketing tips and gratuities meant for workers must be treated as what it is, namely, an unfair practice.  In many ways, it is about power.  It is the power of employers to impose whatever measures they want on staff.  It is up to the State and the Government to ensure that this legislation is delivered.<\/p> <p> We need the penalty for wages withheld by employers to be increased to a class A fine of &euro;5,000 and not the proposed class C fine of &euro;2,500.  Over the past ten years, almost &euro;18 million in withheld wages has been returned to workers after investigation by the WRC.  While legislation to protect employees&rsquo; tips will have a profound impact on workers in the hospitality sector, we must also acknowledge that workers should not be dependent on tips in order to live.  Workers need to be paid a living wage.  Relying on tips to survive is the result of what has happened in the context of a sector in which low pay, precarious employment and poor working conditions have been normalised.  We need to see the hospitality sector engage with trade unions and work to re-establish the joint labour committee.<\/p> <p> Many of the recruitment and staffing issues the hospitality sector faces could be resolved by an effective joint labour committee.  Without a system involving tiered rates of pay, overtime rates, Sunday premiums, holiday entitlements and sick pay, the sector will continue to face many of the same issues it faces at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700042#SS00200","speaker":"1555","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657204500,"counter":433,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill, which the Labour Party will be supporting.  I thank the T&aacute;naiste for his work in respect of it.  As has been said, people often take trade unionism for granted or do not understand the nature of it and what it achieves.  People's interaction with trade unionism, if they familiar with it, often involves their seeing images of picket lines, protests or placards.  However, what trade unionism does all the time is work to improve the conditions of workers.  It works with the Government, Departments and individual Ministers, it gets legislation over the line and it improves the lot of the workforce.  That is why unions are so important.  As has been said, that is why people need to be members of unions.  It is not always about disputes, although disputes will happen in any walk of life.  It is about spotting a problem, seeing a resolution, working with fair-minded people in government who are willing to work with trade unions in getting something over the line.  In fairness to the T&aacute;naiste, he has worked in a fair-minded way on this issue and has brought forward this legislation.  That is to his credit.<\/p>  <p>  It is slightly depressing that legislation such as this is deemed necessary.  You would have thought that if an industry dealt with its workers fairly, a tip allocated to a worker would remain in that worker&rsquo;s possession.  Unfortunately, however, we cannot have that level of trust with certain industries.  That is why we need legislation in this regard.  We have to reflect on the hospitality industry in Ireland.  It is important that we restate this.  The level of vulnerability of workers in this industry and the level of low pay, as has been outlined, are quite stark.  Some 23% of Irish workers are on low pay by OECD standards.  We have the third-highest proportion of low-paid workers in the OECD.  That is something which shames us.  A very high proportion of those workers are in the hospitality sector.  They are disproportionately migrants and women.<\/p>  <p>  It is not just the cost-of-living crisis that should make us reflect on how difficult it is to be in low-paid employment.  That is a constant struggle.  Also there are vulnerabilities around the security of that employment, and, certainly, the number of the workers in question who are unionised can be lower than in other sectors.  That is the very reason why legislation such as that before us is necessary.<\/p>  <p>  The Labour Party congratulates the One Galway movement, the One Cork movement and Senator Gavan who brought forward legislation on this matter in the Seanad.<\/p>  <p>  The hospitality industry always seems to be at the forefront of advocating for lower wages, for the breaking of sectoral pay agreements, for the disbandment of joint labour committees or whatever.  The industry appears to be resistant to change and is unmoved by the reality of the workers who keep their businesses afloat being paid so poorly and being so poorly treated.  The industry is held together by low-paid workers and by those who are particularly vulnerable.<\/p>  <p>  While we absolutely welcome the Bill, we need to have a wider discussion about stronger collective bargaining rights for workers.  We need to have a scenario where not just that the workers have the right to join unions but where there is a requirement on employers to engage with those unions.  It is no accident that the weakness of collective bargaining legislation in Ireland is a direct correlation to the numbers of people who are on low pay.  If you are a member of a union and if you work in a unionised profession, the productivity and pay relating to that profession are better and everybody is enhanced by being involved in the relevant industry.<\/p> <p>However, when one has an industry which seems to be built on profit-making from the hard labour, insecurity and low pay of vulnerable sections of society working in that industry, then that has to be challenged.<\/p> <p> The Labour Party, and our spokesperson, Senator Marie Sherlock, welcome this legislation.  It reflects well on the Government.  It reflects well on the Department in which the Minister of State, Deputy English, works.  We look forward to the next Stages of the Bill next week.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State will accept that we make this argument on this side of the House regularly.  We have a problem with low pay in Ireland.  We are a low-pay economy.  We stand out as a matter of shame in Europe on the rates of low pay.  It affects women disproportionately.  It affects migrants disproportionately.  It, obviously, has a knock-on effect in terms of accommodation and other levels of insecurity in life, such as mental health stresses.  It is particularly profound in the hospitality industry.  The industry has a great capacity to go on the airwaves and talk about poverty and how difficult it is.  Many of the concerns are valid but if we were to challenge them properly, the rates of pay in the industry are partly the reason it cannot attract and keep staff.  When it comes down to it, it will have to wise up and not stand over - we cannot stand over as a legislative body - the practises within that industry anymore.<\/p> <p> While we appreciate this Bill, this has to be one small brick in the wall of defence that the worker needs to have in advocating for himself or herself.  We need to have a unionised workforce in the hospitality industry.  Legislation from these Houses needs to protect that workforce so that it has proper engagement with employment, its payments can be enhanced and protected over a period of time, and security within that work can be enhanced and protected over a period of time, and that within their union, people have a department that will consistently work with them to improve their lot.

It is difficult to think that anybody will get up and speak against it in the sense that what we are dealing with, as Deputy O'Reilly put well, is a situation whereby employers are robbing the wages of workers.  That is abhorrent to most, if not all, right-thinking people.  It is absolutely necessary that we have legislation that protects and ensures that does not happen.<\/p>  <p>  I will add my voice, as many others have, to the Trojan work that has been done by many people who have worked in this industry, and particularly to the unions, the ONE Galway movement, SIPTU, Unite and Mandate, and the work of my colleague, Senator Gavan, in ensuring that this was put top of the agenda and that we are in this position.<\/p>  <p>  Many have spoken already about the fact that we are coming to the end of the D&aacute;il session, we are dealing with a great deal of legislation and there is not necessarily the time we would like to deal with the amendments.  It is fair to say there may be a number of gaps in this legislation and we need to ensure that those gaps are plugged because this is about protecting workers.  We are talking about workers who are absolutely necessary to the economy.  If we are talking about hospitality and the absolute importance of it to tourism and other sectors, we all will be aware of the difficulties being talked about within the industry in not being able to fill particular positions but a priority would be ensuring that the rights that workers have within this sector are guaranteed.  We all will be aware of the difficulty and the lack of engagement by employers in relation to the joint labour committee, JLC, framework.  We need to see that all those pieces are put together and that people have their rights in relation to overtime, paid breaks and all those other pieces that we all take as an absolute requirement.<\/p>  <p>  We welcome the fact the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, will be able to deal with disputes in relation to breaches of this legislation.  People should share electronic payments and we need to ensure we do this for cash payments because there is still a considerable number of people who would use cash to pay tips.<\/p>  <p>  We welcome the fact that policies will have to be displayed and people will know, but we need to ensure that is absolutely enshrined.

Probably, the only surprising aspect is that workers require this kind of protection.  Most people would have assumed that when a tip is given, the tip goes to the worker.<\/p>  <p>  One in five workers in the State is classed as low paid, that is, approximately 370,000 people.  Ireland's rate of low pay is significantly above the EU average, ranking 8th out of 27.  Among other high income countries in the EU, we have the second highest rate of low pay.  This is not a new problem.  For the past 20 years, the rate of low pay has remained consistently at approximately 20%.  This is a major structural issue which affects every aspect of our society.  Low pay has negative physical and mental health impacts on the health of workers.  It absolutely undermines their quality of life.  The economy suffers from the lack of purchasing power of low-paid workers.  Public finances and, therefore, public services are weakened by the low levels of revenue taken in by way of taxation.<\/p>  <p>  Low pay is feeding into homelessness and inadequate housing for working people and their families.  Many low-paid workers cannot keep up with rising rents and cannot qualify for mortgages due to the increasing gap between their incomes and house prices, which are very considerable.<\/p>  <p>  Low pay is not only absolutely irrational on a broad economic level; it is morally bankrupt.  The Government likes to brag about the low unemployment figures in Ireland in comparison to other EU states and to proudly show off statistics that say we have the highest rate of youth employment in the EU, but one must ask how much they are being paid.<\/p>  <p>  The hospitality and tourism industry has one of the youngest workforces.  It is predominantly made up of women, and between 33% and 40% of workers in the industry are migrants.  According to a recent study by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, 68% of them are being paid less than the living wage.  Is it any wonder that more than 40% of the sector's workers did not return to their jobs post-pandemic?  There is a problem with recruiting.  People are looking at it rationally, in terms of the cost of living and their earning power.<\/p>  <p>  For many people in the service industry, tips make up the difference.  The level of tips received can dictate whether there is enough money in the bank to put food on the table, pay the bills and live any kind of dignified life in such an expensive country.<\/p>  <p>  In light of that, I welcome much of this Bill.  Placing tips and gratuities outside the scope of worker's wages is a very important step forward.  When anyone leaves a tip, it is done with the implicit understanding that it will go to the person who has provided the service, and that it is an added bonus to the person's wages and an appreciation of his or her work on behalf of the person who receives the service.<\/p>  <p>  No one who leaves a tip expects or wants it to be taken by the employer.  It is up to every business in the service industry to calculate its profit in its pricing.  It cannot be left to the customer to provide extra money voluntarily to make up the basic business costs of the establishment.<\/p> <p>It is good to have legislation clearly setting out that tips taken electronically must be distributed to the staff.  Especially after Covid, this has become much more common and it is likely to become the dominant method of tipping, if it is not already.  It has been very unclear in recent months where those tips are going.  I have heard from many people that they have developed a habit of asking staff directly whether they receive the electronic tips before giving them.  Some people carry cash so that they can have a higher degree of certainty about that.<\/p> <p> In other establishments, I have noticed staff automatically clicking \"No\" to electronic tips before handing the card machine over, because they know they will not receive them.  That tells us something about the way people feel about the issue.  It is theft.  If people leave a tip, they want to be sure that the person serving them gets the tip.  A crucial and welcome aspect of this Bill is a right to redress for employees who do not receive electronic tips, which will be through the WRC.  However, this does not seem to be the case in respect of cash payments.  I understand the Department was advised by the WRC that ensuring cash tips go to workers would be unenforceable, but I feel some action must be taken.  This Bill makes great improvements to the situation in the sector around tips and optional service charges, but cash tips are a major avenue for people to earn an essential increase on their low salary.<\/p> <p> When it comes to the obligation for employers to display their policy of distributing tips among staff, it is absolutely crucial that the tips and gratuities notice is easy to find and is available to customers both before booking and before paying.  Such notices must be properly signposted and not hidden behind a plant where people do not see them but with employers fulfilling their obligations under the law.  We must be quite specific about that.  It is important to ensure the notices are prominently displayed.  The regulations need to be very clear about defining the concept of \"prominently displayed\" and, critically, it needs to be enforced.  That goes without saying.  I am not sure who would do the enforcing.  The Minister might come back on that point.<\/p> <p> The language in the Bill dictates that an employer must consult workers if he or she plans on making any changes to the distribution of tips.  Consultation is not enough.  It really is their money.  It is fundamentally not the employer's income, so it should be up to the workers to determine how they split their tips.  Any changes should be done with the consensus of employees.<\/p> <p> Service charges are the area in which I believe the Bill is weakest.  Under the current legislation, any business can implement a service charge - mandatory or voluntary - and take it as revenue.  Most customers do not realise this.  It seems fairly straightforward that the service change would go to the workers who are providing the service.  We most often see such a service charge when booking for groups.  Many people wrongly assume that the charge functions as a kind of built-in tip for the worker as a consequence of being responsible for a large table.  I assumed that as well, wrongly so.<\/p> <p> The Ivy restaurant was at the centre of a campaign and national conversation about tip theft, spearheaded by Unite's Julia - I always pronounce this name wrong.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700044#UU00300","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657205700,"counter":438,"content":"<p>Marciniak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700045#VV00200","speaker":"1569"},{"type":"speech","time":1657205700,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Collins.  Yes.  I met her.  She spoke at a May Day conference that we held just a few months ago.  She was very impressive.  It is easy to sit on the other side when you win, but she told us about the toll it took on her to get to the point where they did win on that and how nothing much has changed for other people that she knows, who she is trying to organise within the industry.  It is really important to listen to people like her because it shows just how vulnerable workers in that industry are.<\/p><p>At its appearance before the Labour Court, The Ivy admitted that it had introduced a mandatory service charge on every table, which negatively impacted on the amount of tips left for workers.  Because, of course, when you assume a service charge goes to service workers, then you are very unlikely to leave an additional tip or perhaps not as much.  Therefore, it is concerning that this Bill allows mandatory charges to be taken by an employer and used as general income of the business as long as they are no longer called service charges.  As mentioned by Deputy O'Reilly earlier in the debate, several members of the Restaurants Association have already identified this as a loophole and it is something that has been discussed on social media.  For poor employers who are already stealing the tips or service charges of their employees, despite the very clear moral issue, this gives them an avenue to continue the practice with a more consistent income.  It is important that we identify the loopholes.<\/p><p>Mandatory charges result in higher bills for the customer, which are not easily calculated by just looking at the individual pricing on a menu.  It significantly reduces the chances of customers leaving tips for workers.  I understand that the T&aacute;naiste listened to the concerns and introduced an amendment to exclude mandatory service charges from making up any portion of the basic wages of staff.  However, could he outline why it stopped at mandatory service charges?  Why is it that mandatory group booking charges, for example, can be included?  Again, it is down to the loopholes.  It is incredibly important to bring transparency into the processing of tips and gratuities in the service industry.<\/p><p>Unite's general secretary, Sharon Graham, has said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWhere tips policy is unclear it usually means it is also unfair, and it hits this workforce hard in the wallet.  We estimate that hospitality staff lose thousands a year in lost earnings when their tips go elsewhere. <\/blockquote>  <p>Of course, low pay and tip theft is only one of the issues facing workers in the service industry.  A F&aacute;ilte Ireland survey found that many staff complained of not getting proper work breaks, having their hours changed at the last minute, and approximately 33% did not receive any extra payment for working on bank holiday weekends.<\/p><p>It is a difficult and insecure sector to work in.  Given the make-up of its workers, short-term contracts, language barriers and low trade union density, the workers are very vulnerable to abuse.  Globally, low trade union density runs parallel to inequality.  Where workers have little or no collective bargaining power and have very little awareness of their basic workers' rights they are often open to exploitation.  A right to collective bargaining is essential.<\/p><p>When we look at social democratic Nordic countries such as Sweden and Denmark, they do not have a minimum wage, yet the average rate of low pay in those countries is approximately 8% compared to 20% here.  They do not need a minimum wage because they have collective bargaining.  More than 80% of employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, compared to approximately 33% in Ireland.  Crucially, in Ireland, the sectors with the lowest traditional pay have the lowest density of trade union membership.  I acknowledge that the fair distribution of tips will help people a lot, but if we are serious about ending the scourge of low pay in this country then we need to introduce a right to collective bargaining.<\/p><p>One of the stories in the media in recent months is some of the charges that are being levied in terms of room rates in some hotels.  I looked at some of them myself.  They are astronomical.  The sector is price gouging.  It does no service to it.  Low pay predominates in the sector and its workforce is very vulnerable.  When we consider the post-crash situation and the importance of non-domestic tourism in terms of the recovery, we are doing ourselves no service by having a situation whereby there would not be a secure employment base for the sector.<\/p> <p>That secure base will not be achieved unless there are attractive rates of pay and certainly rates above the poverty line.  Where there is activity like price gouging, it does not do anybody any favours in the longer run.  The totality of these issues must be considered and there must be engagement with organisations like the Irish Hotels Federation in this regard.  Of course, there are people who are running their hotels and restaurants fairly and diligently but the cohort of those who are not are doing everyone a disservice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700045#VV00300","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657206300,"counter":441,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for introducing this legislation, which provides legal protection for workers in respect of tips and gratuities.  It will mean any tips received cannot be counted towards an employee's basic pay; they must be counted as additional and separate.<\/p>  <p>  The treatment of tips and gratuities has been a long-standing issue that is regularly raised by employees and trade unions.  Historically, all good employers left it to workers to make their own arrangements around tips.  However, with the advent of card payments, particularly contactless payments during the Covid-19 pandemic, employers and management became involved in processing these payments.  In some cases, the distribution of electronic tips was facilitated but in many establishments, tips paid by card could not be processed.  There are also reports of tips and gratuities being included as part of basic wages by some unscrupulous employers, as referred to earlier.<\/p>  <p>  The aim of this Bill is to provide clarity on the meaning of tips, gratuities and service charges, to place tips and gratuities, but not service charges, outside the scope of a person's contractual wages, to oblige employers to display prominently their policy on the distribution of both cash and card payments and to oblige employers to distribute fairly, equitably and in a transparent manner tips that are received in an electronic form, that is, through debit or credit card payments or by way of smartphones.  This will provide a legal basis and certainty for employees in respect of tips.  It will also provide certainty to the public.  When paying for a meal, especially when paying by card or smartphone, many people are unaware of how, or whether, tips and service charges are distributed among staff.  Once this law is enacted, all employers will be required to show clearly how tips and service charges are dealt with in their businesses.  This will provide clarity for both customers and staff.<\/p>  <p>  Most establishments already treat their employees fairly with regard to tips.  For them, these provisions will mean no change beyond having to display their policy clearly, which is extremely welcome.  People working in hospitality and other service sectors have made tremendous efforts during the pandemic to keep services going.  In many cases, they did so at some risk to themselves and, indeed, their families.  This Bill will provide legal protections in respect of tips and gratuities and it is very welcome.  I thank the T&aacute;naiste and his officials for introducing it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700046#WW00200","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speech","time":1657206300,"counter":442,"content":"<p>I welcome this Bill, which will finally see protection in place for employees in regard to tips.  It will ensure those tips make their way into workers' pockets, regardless of the actions of bad employers.  It is sad that we need legislation in this area.  It is important to point out that most employers treat their employees well, but it is a reality that there are employers who use any opportunity to exploit their workers for financial gain.<\/p>  <p>  I commend my Sinn F&eacute;in colleague, Senator Gavan, on his work in this area and on pushing the issue forward even when Fine Gael, when it was in government in the previous D&aacute;il, was resistant to it.  I welcome that the party has finally seen sense and made a positive move to regulate the area of tips.  I congratulate all the people involved in pushing for this legislation, including those in the trade union movement who put in years of campaigning on this issue.  They have been great advocates for those they represent.  I hope this is the first move in the direction of proper protections for workers who may be exploited, particularly within the hospitality and tourism sectors.  We know those sectors have an issue with tips not finding their way into employees' pockets.  A range of research has demonstrated that anywhere between 30% and 50% of employees are not getting their tips.  These figures are shocking when one considers the number of people who are in jobs in which they may get a tip.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill makes a number of important provisions.  It will prevent the practice of tips being used to top up employees' wages, which we all agree is very welcome.  It places an obligation on employers to make their tip policy clear to customers in order that the latter know exactly who is getting any tip they give.  This will give peace of mind to people who are unsure about tipping electronically.  As proposed in Senator Gavan's legislation, this Bill will establish a right of redress for employees, as well as taking on the Senator's suggestion that service charges be treated the same as tips.  The Government has taken on Opposition parties' suggestions and I hope that continues as we work together to improve the Bill further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700046#WW00300","speaker":"1464"},{"type":"speech","time":1657206300,"counter":443,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this Bill, which is part of a major suite of changes we need to undertake.  There is no doubt that we are living at a time of extraordinary transition in the way our economy works.  We are in the aftermath of a financial crisis that shook people's faith in the regulators that had responsibility for keeping us safe financially.  We have passed through the Covid period, which rocked to the core many of our assumptions about how we can protect ourselves.  We are now in the midst of a digital and data revolution that is transforming the way enterprises operate and business is done.<\/p>  <p>  It is really important that we recalibrate some of the rights and responsibilities of enterprise in this period of extraordinary change.  I see this measure, along with many of the other measures the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, Deputy English, are seeking to promote as part of this recalibration of what we expect from a modern, responsible enterprise.  It is really significant that we have introduced legislation on sick pay, which was a major gap in employee protections exposed by the Covid crisis.  Legislation is being worked on to deliver a right to request remote working.  Today, the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, of which I am a member, published its response to the proposals put forward by the Government in this regard.  It is fair to say we would like the Government to be more ambitious in the development of those rights.  We are also seeing the development of the concept of a living wage, which recognises that many aspects of precarious living have been thrown up by the new digital models that are changing our world.<\/p>  <p>  There are some who would seek to stop open trading relationships and the open economy approach that has been so valuable to Ireland in its development over my time in the D&aacute;il.  Those who take that view see imbalances in the way some of that economy model has worked.  We have seen those imbalances acutely, not only in terms of how employees are impacted but also in how our environment is treated.  We must come to a position whereby new responsibilities are articulated by the Government in respect of data, consumer protection, sustainability and the adoption of circular models, and flexibility in regard to working relationships.  I see this Bill as part of the suite of measures we need to undertake, recognising that people in vulnerable working situations can often be abused if what customers think in good faith is a payment they are giving for the benefit of workers is instead being pocketed by others.  The new regulatory obligation that is coming in the direction of enterprise under these proposals will be described as a burden by some.  In my view, however, it is the means by which we can protect the sort of business model that has been so important to a small, open trading economy like ours.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State has done more than many in this House to strike the balance we need between small enterprises struggling to keep their heads above water and to keep a complex set of relationships going, and, at the same time, the need to transform and to take on the greater public responsibilities that enterprises have to internalise.  I wish the Minister of State well.  One of the most significant initiatives I have seen in this D&aacute;il is a growing impetus from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to recognise this new direction of travel.  I urge that consideration be given to concepts such as the circular economy, which I believe are truly transformative.  At the heart of the circular economy is how we can take environmental damage out of the way in which we live our lives, just as we are seeking in this Bill to take some of the social damage out of the way we live our lives.  I urge the Minister of State, the senior Minister and the staff of the Department to continue to also develop new ways of ensuring, as we strive in respect of enterprise and success, that we do not undermine our environment, the rights of our consumers or the rights of our employees and that we promote upskilling, flexibility in the workplace and gender equality, an aspect we will debate later.  These are the values that must be at the heart of a modern, high-performing enterprise and this is what we seek to strive to achieve with this Bill.<\/p> <p> We must of course try to strike a balance between the pressures on the day-to-day activities of enterprises, but the Minister of State has performed extraordinarily well in this regard.  He has been willing to sit down and talk to people and to talk through the requirements.  This legislation is a good approach.  It embodies fairness.  It is not overly prescriptive.  It relies on display notices and on the power of enforcement.  This is the right balance to strike.  It also has, ultimately, the teeth to enforce its provisions to ensure these requirements cannot be ignored.  I wish the Minister of State well in his work.  I am thankful to have had the opportunity to speak on this important Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700046#WW00400","speaker":"1549","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657206900,"counter":445,"content":"<p>I thank my colleague, Seanad&oacute;ir Gavan, for his work in forcing this Bill onto the agenda.  In 2017, Sinn F&eacute;in brought forward a Bill on this issue that was supported by the trade union movement.  That Bill passed all Stages in the Seanad despite the opposition of Fine Gael and it was influential in driving the conversation about tips and the importance of legislating for the protection of employee tips.  Following pressure from Sinn F&eacute;in, Unite the Union and others, the Government amended the Bill in the Seanad to have service charges treated as the same as tips and gratuities.  Prior to this change, service charges imposed by employers could have been used to pay workers&rsquo; wages.  This is a significant win that will benefit workers.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill puts tips, gratuities and service charges outside the scope of workers' contracted wages, ensuring that tips cannot be used to top up workers&rsquo; wages, but rather that they will be in addition to workers&rsquo; wages.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports this Bill, but there are several areas where we would like to see it strengthened.  We want to see the penalties for contravening sections of the Bill increased to a class A fine of &euro;5,000 instead of a class C fine of &euro;2,500.  Contraventions of sections of the Bill equate to employers robbing money from their workers.  In the last decade, nearly &euro;18 million in stolen wages have been returned to workers after investigations by the WRC.  Employers also have an obligation to display prominently policies on the distribution of cash and electronic tips.  This is welcome, but additional provisions could be added to ensure that every customer knows the policy.<\/p>  <p>  As a former shop steward, I recommend that all workers join a trade union.  Campaigning unions, like Unite and Mandate, have been to the fore of social change, along with furthering the rights of workers.  There has never been a more important time for unions.  We saw during Covid-19 that workers had been exploited and this situation needs to change.  Insecure contracts and poor pay and conditions, along with the need for a living wage, have all been highlighted as issues that need to be addressed.  Studies have shown that workers in unions are better paid than those in comparative non-union jobs.  Workers&rsquo; rights have been under attack for many years and were dealt a serious blow with the passing of the Industrial Relations Act 1990.  It is time that workers&rsquo; rights were prioritised, and Sinn F&eacute;in has demonstrated time and time again that we are on the side of workers.  We need an election so that people can pass judgment on this Government&rsquo;s miserable record on workers&rsquo; rights.  When workers&rsquo; rights are under attack, we will stand up and fight back.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700047#XX00200","speaker":"1588"},{"type":"speech","time":1657206900,"counter":446,"content":"<p>I compliment the Minister on taking the initiative and bringing this Bill before the House.  I also acknowledge his capable and competent stewardship of his Department and his willingness to meet various representative groups and to listen to their advice and requests.  This Bill offers fairness and prioritises equality for ordinary workers in businesses.  This is a positive and welcome acknowledgement of the major role that employees play in keeping businesses afloat.  This legislation does that.  It has the potential to increase the payments that employees receive in businesses, such as in the services and hospitality sector.  It will also increase their incentive to excel and their determination to provide the best possible service to businesses' clients and customers.  News about this Bill is not a banner headline.  All too often, the media favour more sensational stories but this is, in fact, a good news story and one that has been sought from the industry for a long time.<\/p>  <p>  This legislation is going to provide bigger earnings for employees and service providers across the country.  It also puts right a wrong that has long existed, which most people seldom, if ever, thought about.  When most of us go out for a meal, attend the barber or hairdresser, travel by taxi, have luggage carried to a hotel room or have groceries carried to a car, we feel that giving a tip to the person who helped us is the right and proper thing to do.  It is a way of saying \"Thank you\" to the person who has helped us by providing a service for us.  It is also good manners and common decency.<\/p>  <p>  Let us take the situation of a porter carrying our bags to a hotel room.  We may hand him or her a couple of euro for the effort and we are grateful for having received that help.  Yet when we checked into the hotel, we did not give any tip to the hotel receptionist who has also provided us with a service.  Was he or she less helpful?  No.  We could not have checked into the hotel without that assistance.  At the end of the week, the porter could have earned a nice amount of extra money, whereas the receptionist would still just be paid the usual wage.  This scenario is just a simple and over-simplistic example of how the payment of tips is unbalanced and inequitable.  It serves to show how some staff benefit while others are overlooked.<\/p>  <p>  The situation becomes more complicated and confusing when people go out for a meal.  The waiter or waitress looks after them throughout the meal, brings them what they ordered and gets them anything they want to ensure that they enjoy their dining experience.  The customer is satisfied, the meal was perfect, delivered promptly and nothing was overlooked.  Those people look at their bill and they are happy to note that a service charge has been included.  They feel they have been provided with a top-class service and have no problem paying the charge in the belief that they are giving a little extra tip to the staff member who helped them.  The vast majority of us believe that the service charge is another word for a tip.  It stands to reason, in most people&rsquo;s minds, that the charge is being made for the service that has been received.  <\/p>  <p>  Some people who have been less than happy with the service they have received have refused to pay this charge, in the same way as they would refuse to leave a tip.  They do so with the honest conviction that their waiter or waitress did not deliver a service worthy of additional payment.  Most people never query a service charge, pay it willingly as part of their bill and do not question where the money goes.  What people do not realise is that this service charge is not a tip.  In most cases, the money received through the service charge goes towards paying the staff their basic wages.  There is nothing wrong with this.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070700047#XX00300","speaker":"1609"}]
