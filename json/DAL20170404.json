People are extremely frustrated, annoyed and angry by the lack of activity at Government level to resolve this dispute.  The simple refrain across Ireland is that if this dispute was in Dublin, it would have been resolved a long time ago.  That is the general sense in regional cities, rural towns and across the countryside and one which we encounter all the time.  There is massive disruption.  Many businesses are reporting a significant decline in footfall and business activity in the towns and cities affected.  Some 2,500 staff are also very worried about their position, notwithstanding the 110,000 people who use Bus &Eacute;ireann services which are no longer available to them.<\/p>  <p>  We have insisted from the beginning that there are policy dimensions to this issue which the Government refuses to acknowledge.  The Minister has stated, for example, that one cannot have cross-subsidisation of the Expressway services from public service obligation, PSO, funding.  That is not true.<\/p><p>The NTA can through the reasonable profit mechanism, which is there and which is allowed under EU regulations, facilitate transfers under that facility to the bus companies.  It is interesting that under that arrangement Dublin Bus received &euro;4.5 million last year while Bus &Eacute;ireann received &euro;400,000.<\/p> <p> The Dublin-rural issue is evident again when comparing how Dublin Bus is funded under the PSO and how Bus &Eacute;ireann is funded.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is not getting its fair share and is not getting a reasonable deal.  The same applies to free travel.  Bus &Eacute;ireann recoups approximately &euro;4.70 per passenger availing of free travel on the Expressway service while the average fare is &euro;11.74.  There has been a significant reduction in the free travel subsidy since 2010.  The reasonable profit mechanism might sound complex as a formula but the bottom line is Bus &Eacute;ireann gets a lower subsidy per passenger than Dublin Bus under the PSO operation as well.  Whatever way you look at this, rural and regional Ireland is not getting its fair share.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is an indispensable part of the transport infrastructure of rural Ireland and of the towns and cities outside Dublin.  That sense of prioritisation is not manifest in the Government's response to this crisis.<\/p> <p> From the outset the company has insisted on preconditions before the unions enter into WRC talks, which is unacceptable.  The talks should be without precondition but they should be assisted.  Why will the Government not make an intervention on the policy front that would create the background, which would facilitate a resolution of this dispute at the WRC?  The Government and the NTA have options open to them if they see fit to use them but so far the Government has been determined to avoid any consideration of legitimate policy issues that could help here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400003#A00300","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491311100,"counter":9,"content":"<p>This is the 12th day of an all-out strike at Bus &Eacute;ireann and it has discommoded hundreds of thousands of people.  I condemn the wildcat strike which took place unofficially last week and which brought this city and so many other places, as well hundreds of thousands of people, to a standstill.  The Deputy mentioned that this would have been sorted out long ago if it was in Dublin, drawing an analogy that the country is being treated differently from other areas.  The Minister for Tourism, Transport and Sport has intervened in respect of policy decisions in so far as the PSO is concerned and his colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills has been looking at the question of the school transport system while the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has been looking at the question of rural transport take-up of any changes that might occur to the Expressway service.  The Deputy said it is possible to cross-subsidise the service; my information is different.  Subvention is only provided for PSO services and it cannot, under law, be provided for commercial services such as the Expressway service.  The Deputy seems to have a different view on that and that is something I will check.<\/p>  <p>  I hope the unions and management get together with the WRC.  As the Deputy mentioned whatever way you look at it - and whatever you look at it, the Deputy is correct - there is a strike on here and the only way to settle that is around the table between unions and management.  They have both agreed there are issues that need to be dealt with and the company needs to reform how it goes about its business to address the inefficiencies that exist.  The place to settle those issues is not on the airwaves; it is around the table assisted by the WRC.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has been more than encouraging that unions and management would get together on this matter.  The only parties that can agree a fair and acceptable deal to sort this out and have Bus &Eacute;ireann continue to do the job it has done for many years are those in management and in unions.  Nobody else can do that deal for them and no amount of taxpayer's money can solve the inefficiencies that both management and unions agree exist within the company.  They both want to talk about them and the opportunity is available through the WRC to settle this.<\/p>  <p>  On matters of policy, the Minister has been active.  On matters of encouraging both sides, unions and management, to get back to talks at the WRC, I hope an invitation to resume those talks will be extended to them quickly and that people will understand that realistic negotiations between management and unions are required to solve these internal issues.<\/p><p>The WRC and the LRC are ready to assist, as they played a leading role in dealing with previous industrial relations within the CIE group.  The biggest impact is on Bus &Eacute;ireann's PSO network.  Those who rely on those services have little alternative public transport options.  The impact is lessened on the loss-making Expressway network as there are numerous competitors providing bus services in addition to the rail network.  It is an issue that can only be sorted out at the WRC.  I hope an invitation is extended to both union and management again quickly to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400004#B00200","speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491311400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Since 2016, the NTA, under EU regulations, has had to pay a reasonable profit on PSO services to CIE companies.  Where a reasonable profit is paid to a director or operator, it is a matter for that company to decide how it wishes to apply these funds.  It goes through all the possible applications of reasonable profit.  No one is arguing that Bus &Eacute;ireann is not very successful at discharging its PSO service obligations because it is.  One of the anomalies that has arisen is with regard to the amount paid to the two semi-State bus companies.  Why is Bus &Eacute;ireann being paid so little in contrast to Dublin Bus?  In 2016, Bus &Eacute;ireann was only paid &euro;400,000 in reasonable profit while Dublin Bus was paid &euro;4.5 million.  That is 11 times more than Bus &Eacute;ireann.  That is despite the fact that Bus &Eacute;ireann is paid a lower subsidy per passenger than Dublin Bus for PSO services.  If the Government was serious about this and committed to it, there are ways and means of contributing to its resolution, not by saying it is entirely the workers of the company who have to bear the brunt of all of the restructuring, which is what has happened to date.  People are facing 30% cuts in their take home pay.  That is the Government position.<\/p>  <p>  The company is fortified by the position taken by the Government and the Minister, which is a race to a bottom in terms of wages.  It is a savage cut and a disproportionate burden on the workers in terms of the restructuring and the transport policy dimensions which not only involve what I have just spoken about but also the free travel issue.  The company has lost a lot since 2010 in terms of the subsidy it used to enjoy per free travel passenger.  The Taoiseach has an obligation for the Government to make sure this is resolved fairly quickly.  What I said to the Taoiseach at the outset is not my opinion.  It is the opinion of the people across the country that if this was in Dublin it would have been resolved a long time ago.

The extent of the damage done to the Garda cannot be overestimated - it is immense.<\/p>  <p>  This issue is bigger than any political party.  It is about the fundamental administration of justice.  People across the country in every community are left scratching their heads as they wonder how someone who has messed up so badly and presided over fiasco after fiasco is still in her job.  They are wondering how N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan is still the Garda Commissioner.  People rightly ask themselves how ordinary rank and file garda&iacute; can be expected to account for their actions when their boss, the top garda in the country, is immune from that same basic standard of accountability.

In no other walk of life would this be a matter for debate.<\/p>  <p>  The Commissioner is not a new kid on the block.  She has been the boss for three years and was deputy commissioner prior to taking the top post.  It is unbelievable that the T&aacute;naiste accepts the Commissioner's line that she must remain in her role to complete her \"journey of work\", as she describes it.  This is the same journey of work that has fostered the list of debacles in which the Garda finds itself embroiled.  Does this journey also include her speculating out loud as though she were some detached onlooker that the controversy around breath tests and motoring offences might not be the end of scandals surrounding the Garda?  Is the Taoiseach okay with this frightening lack of accountability?  He is in charge.  This corruption, malpractice and mismanagement in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is happening on his watch.

This is bigger than any political party, as the Deputy says.  It is bigger than any individual, and it is about trust and confidence, it is about respect, it is about pride, it is about an organisation of 14,000 people - that rises to 15,000 people - being able to be seen to do their job professionally, competently and in the interests of the State in which we reside and the people that they have a duty of care to in terms of both their security and their protection from criminal elements.<\/p>  <p>  This goes back quite a distance, as the Deputy is well aware.  I might say to her that the Government treats this with the utmost seriousness.  The T&aacute;naiste briefed the Cabinet this morning on her proposals for a commission on the future of policing in Ireland arising from the decision made last week by Government that there should be an independent analysis of the figures in respect of fixed notice penalties and the question of breathalyser statistics.  Both of those have been referred to the independent Policing Authority, which, as the Deputy knows, has the full right to contract in any expertise - national or international - that it so wishes to look at those statistics and determine how they happened, why they happened, who is responsible and who is accountable.<\/p>  <p>  The second decision that the Government made was on the longer term restructuring of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and that is not in any way to take from the valid propositions put forward by the independent Garda Inspectorate.<\/p><p>It is not to take in any way from the exceptional work now being carried out by the chairperson of the independent Policing Authority, Ms Josephine Feehily, or from the review and additional powers being sought by Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring in respect of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.

As he is in the mood for catching up, he might want to catch up on another issue as well.  I refer to the case of a young man who has narcolepsy, which is a lifelong debilitating disorder.  He can fall asleep without warning and has done so.  He has smashed his teeth and broken his bones.  He experiences terrifying hallucinations in a state of sleep paralysis.  He has to be given expensive anaesthetics so that he can get a few hours' sleep.  He has developed joint and muscle pain.  He suffers from anxiety and depression to the extent that he has tried to kill himself.  He is 14 years of age.  This condition, for which there is no cure, limits every aspect of his daily life.  While his condition is bad, the worst thing is that he did not always have it.  He was not born with it.  It is not a genetic disorder.  This was an avoidable catastrophe.  This young man, like 80 others, developed the condition as a result of receiving the Pandemrix vaccination for swine flu in 2010.<\/p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive and the State Claims Agency went into the High Court last week unnoticed and undocumented to obstruct this boy and people like him who are seeking documents under discovery.  The HSE and the SCA said they would voluntarily disclose these documents in 2015.  We need to be clear about the fact that the HSE decided to purchase Pandemrix and continued to distribute it even after it knew it was dangerous and untested and before most of the public in Ireland received it.  It knew there was a sevenfold or eightfold risk of serious adverse effects in comparison with its sister drug and alternative vaccinations for which there were no adverse side effects.  Poland, Switzerland and the US did not give a licence to Pandemrix, but Ireland gave GlaxoSmithKline, GSK, full indemnity against its harmful side effects.  Incidentally, the company made &euro;8 billion in profits out of it.<\/p>  <p>  In 2009, before 95% of Irish children were vaccinated, the Irish Medicines Board, which is now known as the Health Products Regulatory Authority, was told there was a huge difference between the safety profiles of these vaccines.  Did the board tell the Minister about this, as it had a statutory obligation to do?  Given that it was in possession of that knowledge, why did it continue to administer the least safe vaccine?  Was it cheaper?  Did the Government have a deal with GSK in return for jobs?  Sweden, Finland, Norway, Iceland, France and, recently, Britain have all compensated victims.  In contrast, this country's Government is continuing to deny the requests of victims for discretionary medical cards and other benefits.  I want to know why Ireland is the only country that does not operate a no-fault vaccine damage payment scheme.  Will the Government introduce such a scheme and order the SCA to co-operate with it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400008#F01700","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1491312600,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Daly for raising this matter, which is of intense personal sensitivity for the young person involved.

We will follow that up for the Deputy.  The Minister for Health has met representatives of SOUND, which is the support group for people with narcolepsy, in recent days.  He has sanctioned the go-ahead for the centre of excellence for sleep disorder at St. James's Hospital.  This has been sought for a very long time and has been welcomed by the group involved.  As Deputy Daly knows, the programme for Government includes a commitment to examine supports for people who have been harmed by vaccines.

Parents are distressed about the inadequate provision of care for their children as they get older.  Some parents are fearful that their adult children will be moved from congregated settings, where they have lived for most of their lives, to community settings.  Parents are struggling to transport their adult children to disability day centres.<\/p>  <p>  Is the Taoiseach aware that a significant number of parents, in particular those living in west Cork and Kerry, are driving their adult children for up to four hours a day to the nearest disability day centre?

The fact is that if one has a child with severe disabilities who is 18, he or she is not entitled to a free transport service to day-care centres.  If that child is a day younger than 18, he or she will get a free transport service.  That is a fact.  I have been approached by parents all over west Cork and Kerry and there are probably others throughout Ireland.  Parents have been travelling on a daily basis from Bandon, Bantry and Skibbereen to and from the service in Cork, which is a twice daily journey.  I have met with those parents and spent time discussing the matter with them.  I have been in contact with the HSE but I cannot succeed in getting people to sit around the table despite the fact that we still have a situation in which buses with only one or two people on board are passing very close to these centres already.  It is simply a matter of people sitting down and using their heads.  There must be a policy that can be applied.

He was to speak to the Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Shoukry, last week, but that meeting did not happen because he was held up in Washington on Middle East business.

The Government arranged for an Irish doctor nominated by the chief medical officer to go to Cairo last week.  He participated in a consular visit to Ibrahim Halawa at the Wadi el-Natrun prison on 29 March with the ambassador.  He was there for four hours.  They met Ibrahim Halawa for an hour and a half.  The doctor observed a medical examination of Ibrahim Halawa carried out by an Egyptian doctor.  It is not appropriate for me or any other Government spokesperson to reveal or comment on the details of Ibrahim Halawa's health condition.  As the Deputy knows, these matters are private and confidential.  However, I can say the Irish doctor, who is a GP, recommended that specialist medical evaluations take place and that Ibrahim Halawa be returned to Ireland for such assessments and on humanitarian grounds.<\/p>  <p>  Last evening I sent another urgent letter to President el-Sisi on the basis that he be released on humanitarian grounds.

We in the Social Democrats are committed to significantly extending both paid and unpaid parental leave in Ireland.  The Bill deals with the extension of unpaid parental leave.  It seeks to extend the rights of parents to parental leave from the current 18 weeks to 26 weeks.  The Bill would mean that all parents with qualifying children would have an entitlement to six months' parental leave.  The six month entitlement would also apply to those parents who have already exhausted their existing leave entitlement once they have qualifying children.  In effect, such parents would receive an additional eight weeks per child.<\/p><p>Parents in Ireland must rely on the European Union institutions rather than this country for parental leave rights because our current parental leave entitlements derive almost entirely from EU legislation.  While member states are allowed to go further, Ireland has stuck to just above the bare minimum of leave set down by Directive 2010\/18\/EU.  It is time we legislated for parental leave of our own volition, rather than being prompted to do so by the EU.<\/p> <p> The Bill is primarily about work-life balance.  Working parents lead very busy lives.  For many, there is a constant struggle to do the best they can for their children while trying to hold down a job.  For others, the cost of child care is so prohibitive that they forgo their employment because the cost of going to work outweighs their salary.  While reducing child care costs is important in itself, another help to parents is extending parental leave.  We must, therefore, go much further than the current provision.<\/p> <p> Extending parental leave has many benefits for families, employers and society as a whole.  It allows parents to hold on to their job while spending more time with their children.  It is very much in the interests of young children that they have engagement with their parents from an early age and can make strong bonds with and enjoy sustained attachment to their parents.  Various studies have shown that strong parental supports, including parental leave, improve female participation in the workforce.  This leave also provides flexibility to parents.  With no statutory entitlement to term time leave in Ireland, it can be used, with an employer's agreement, to cover term time.<\/p> <p> By reducing demand for formal child care, extra parental leave can help reduce the cost pressures for everyone in this sector.  There is no cost to the State and in most cases no net costs to employers.  From an employer's point of view, parental leave can be critical in retaining key employees.  It can help improve succession planning, reduce absenteeism and boost productivity.  Parental leave also opens up opportunities in the workforce for people who are unemployed. <\/p> <p> Ireland falls well behind other countries in terms of parental leave, both paid and unpaid.  Parental leave is paid in a majority of other European Union countries and only six EU countries, apart from Ireland, do not allow for income replacement when taking parental leave.  According to a recent European Commission staff working paper on this issue, the average duration of parental leave among member states is 86.9 weeks.  The Bill would begin the process of bringing Ireland closer to European norms.<\/p> <p> The Social Democrats are offering this Bill as a starting point.  We are open to working with any Deputy who wants to contribute to the legislation and improve it in any way.  We look forward to constructive engagement as the Bill progresses.  While we would like to go much further in making provision for paid parental leave, Opposition parties are not in a position to do so under current rules.  This is, however, an important starting point and we urge Deputies to support the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400016#O03200","speaker":"1222","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491317100,"counter":218,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400017#P00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1491317100,"counter":219,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400017#P00300","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1491317100,"counter":220,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1491317100,"counter":221,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400017#P00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1491317100,"counter":222,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400017#P00600","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1491317100,"counter":223,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Sale of Illicit Goods Bill 2017: First Stage","time":1491317100,"counter":224,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400017#P00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1491317100,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to make it an offence to purchase illicit alcohol, illicit tobacco and illicit solid fuel; to make it an offence to purchase such goods from an unregistered or unlicensed retailer; to provide for the imposition of a penalty in respect of such offences; to provide for an on-the-spot fine in respect of such offences; and to provide for related matters.<\/blockquote><p>Is m&oacute;r an on&oacute;ir domsa &eacute; mo ch&eacute;ad Bhille, an Bille um Dh&iacute;ol Earra&iacute; Aindleatacha 2017, a chur ar aithne na D&aacute;la inniu.  I thank Deputies Robert Troy and John Lahart and Retailers Against Smuggling for their input and help in preparing this legislation.  The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the introduction of a series of new measures which are directed at tackling the trade in illegal alcohol, tobacco and solid fuel.  One of the key measures proposed is to make it an offence for a person to buy illicit alcohol, tobacco or solid fuel.  The Bill also makes it an offence for a person to buy alcohol, tobacco or solid fuel from an unregistered retailer.  In addition, it introduces an on-the-spot fine of &euro;100, which will be imposed where a person buys alcohol, tobacco or solid fuel which is illicit or from a retailer who is not registered or licensed.<\/p><p>Illicit trade in Ireland is estimated to have cost the Exchequer in excess of &euro;2.4 billion in 2015.  As I indicated, the Bill makes it an offence to purchase illicit alcohol, tobacco or solid fuel or to purchase alcohol, tobacco or solid fuel from an unregistered or unlicensed retailer.  It provides for the imposition of a penalty and an on-the-spot fine in respect of such offences.  A &euro;100 fine would apply for the following amounts: up to one litre of spirits, and each additional litre or part thereof; up to 200 cigarettes, and each additional 200 cigarettes or part thereof; up to 150 g of rolling tobacco, and each additional 150 g or part thereof; and up to 10 kg of solid fuel, and each additional 10 kg or part thereof.  <\/p><p>  The Bill contains 14 sections and is divided into five Parts, which I do not propose to discuss in detail at this stage.<\/p><p>Lower alcohol tax rates and excise duties in other jurisdictions fuel the smuggling of alcohol into Ireland.  The production and distribution of counterfeit spirits is also common.  A key driver for the illicit trade in tobacco products is the level of excise duty.  Criminals are attracted to the high profitability of this market as taxation policies in Ireland have given rise to opportunities for illegal traders to make profits by not paying domestic rates of duty.  From a demand perspective, increases in excise duties and taxes have driven up the final price of cigarette products, with the price of a pack of 20 cigarettes currently standing at almost &euro;11.  This has increased the demand for cheaper products supplied by the illicit market.<\/p><p>With regard to solid fuel, the introduction of the carbon tax in the Finance Act 2010 had the effect of increasing prices for fuel products throughout Ireland.  This has given rise to a sharp increase in the growth of illicit trade in solid fuel products such as coal, peat briquettes and sod peat.  Most of this activity involves cross-Border smuggling and the illegal import of solid fuel from Northern Ireland into the Republic of Ireland.  The Bill provides a practical solution to the problem of trade in illicit goods.<\/p><p>Small shops are the lifeblood of local economies in towns and villages.  In an increasingly homogenised world we need to preserve our small local businesses as their distinctive character is what makes each town and village unique.  Locally owned businesses build strong communities and create more jobs in towns and villages.  For this reason, we need to protect small shop owners and businesses by creating a deterrent to stop members of the public buying from illegal sources.  The Bill makes it an offence to purchase such goods from an unregistered or unlicensed retailer and provides for the other offences I have outlined. <\/p><p>The effects of Brexit, including the significant weakening of sterling and concerns over possible customs and tariffs, will have a considerable knock-on impact on the level of illicit goods smuggled into Ireland.  I recognise that Revenue officials and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will need more resources to combat smuggling in the coming years because Brexit has created a political climate that is likely to make cross-Border smuggling more lucrative, with a fluctuating sterling and potential tariffs.  The Bill ensures that a major gap in the legislation surrounding illicit trade is closed.  We need to provide legislation in order that retailers and Revenue do not lose yet more money to criminals.  Every time a product such as tobacco, alcohol and solid fuel is purchased from an illegal source, not a single cent goes to the State, while the criminals involved in illegal smuggling get richer and richer.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400017#P00900","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speech","time":1491317100,"counter":226,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400017#P01000","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1491317100,"counter":227,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400017#P01100","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1491317100,"counter":228,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1491317100,"counter":229,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400017#P01300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1491317100,"counter":230,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400017#P01400","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1491317100,"counter":231,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Visit of Croatian Delegation","time":1491317100,"counter":232,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400017#P01600"},{"type":"speech","time":1491317100,"counter":233,"content":"<p>Before proceeding with business, I wish on my behalf and on behalf of the Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to offer a c&eacute;ad mile f&aacute;ilte, a most sincere welcome to Her Excellency, Mrs. Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovi\u0107, President of Croatia, who visits us during her State visit to Ireland.

The date of the next meeting of the Cabinet committee has not yet been confirmed.<\/p>  <p>  I attended the Rome Summit on 25 March, as well as an audience with Pope Francis in the Vatican the previous evening.  On the morning of 25 March, the 27 EU Heads of State and Government met without the UK in the room where the Treaty of Rome had been signed in 1957. The event included speeches by the Italian hosts, the Maltese EU Presidency, and the presidents of the three EU Institutions.  There were no interventions from other Heads of State or Government.  We agreed to adopt and then formally signed the \"Rome Declaration\".  This short document highlights the important achievements of the EU over the past 60 years, the continuing importance of our shared values, and our commitment to addressing our future in a united and coherent way.<\/p>  <p>  In discussions leading up to the event in Rome, and during informal conversations in the margins, I stressed that the EU, founded on the rule of law, democracy and human rights, has delivered peace and prosperity across the continent, and that this is best preserved and promoted through the Union.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased that, despite some differences, there was a strong sense of unity among EU leaders in Rome.  I also highlighted the need to focus on our core values, and to co-operate in areas where we agree, and where Europe can add value such as completing the Single Market and supporting jobs through trade.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I had no scheduled bilateral meetings in Rome.  However, I used the opportunity of the summit to engage with my EU counterparts and to reiterate Ireland's concerns arising from Brexit, specifically around Northern Ireland and the peace process, the common travel area, and our interwoven economies.  The UK triggered Article 50 on Wednesday 29 March.  Draft negotiating guidelines have since been circulated to member states, and I am pleased that these reflect Ireland's particular concerns, as, indeed, did Prime Minister May's letter to the European Council.  The draft guidelines will be further discussed at senior official and ministerial level over the next few weeks, with a view to agreeing them at a meeting of the European Council on 29 April.  We will continue our process of intensive engagement with member states and EU institutions during this period.<\/p>  <p>  I have not met bilaterally with Chancellor Merkel since Article 50 was triggered.  However, I will travel to Germany later this week, and am due to have a bilateral meeting with the Chancellor in Berlin on Thursday.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400018#Q00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1491317700,"counter":245,"content":"<p>The EU Council guidelines published last Friday reveal what I believe to have been a failure by the Government to stand up for Irish interests.  Article 11 deals with the island of Ireland, the peace process and the North, and it is vague and conditional.  It contracts starkly with Article 22, which deals with Spain and Gibraltar and gives a determining say to Spain on whether any trade deal beyond Brexit will apply to Gibraltar.  After Britain leaves the EU, any future trade deal that cannot be agreed until after Brexit will need the agreement of all members states but Spain is positioning itself by suggesting that the trade deal might only apply to Gibraltar in a situation of joint sovereignty between it and the British.  This has resulted in an outpouring of English jingoism not witnessed since the Brexit referendum campaign last summer.  Last weekend, former Tory leader, Michael Howard, evoked the memory of  Mrs. Thatcher and the possibility of war with Spain.  <i>The Daily Telegraph<\/i>went so far as to rush off to analyse which state had the better navy.

I do not have the exact date now but I will come back to the Deputy with it.<\/p>  <p>  I disagree with the Deputy that the document circulated by the EU in respect of the draft guidelines is a failure.  The guidelines are not a failure.  They include a very strong acknowledgement of our unique circumstances and special case, the need to protect the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement and our intention to maintain bilateral arrangements with the UK such as in respect of the common travel area.  The draft guidelines will be circulated among the 27 member states.  The priorities which we have outlined for some time are also referred to specifically in the letter from Prime Minister May to President Tusk of the Council.  They are also referenced specifically in the European Parliament paper.  The Parliament has to give approval to the negotiated document at the end of the day.  From that point of view, chief negotiator Barnier, President Tusk of the Council, President Juncker of the Commission, Prime Minister May and the European Parliament all recognise Ireland's particular, special and unique circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  It is also fair to say that Gibraltar is a different case from Ireland.  Ireland and Northern Ireland, the peace process and the common travel area are all guaranteed by the Irish and British Governments under the Good Friday Agreement and an internationally legally binding treaty registered with the United Nations.  Gibraltar joined the EU with the UK and any change in the status of Gibraltar is a matter between the UK and the Kingdom of Spain.  That is a clear position, which is different from what applies here where we have a peace process, a Border, an internationally legally binding agreement and where the priorities outlined by the Government are contained in the EU draft guidelines, the British Prime Minister's letter and the European Parliament paper.

These are not soft assurances at all.  They are written, specific intentions from the British Prime Minister's point of view.  That is correlated on the other side by the very clear statement from the European Council.  The third element of that is the very clear statements from the European Parliament.  The European Parliament should not be forgotten here because it has to give its consent to the outcome of the negotiations.  Deputy Burton spoke of an all-Ireland dimension.  Deputy Howlin, the leader of Deputy Burton's party, spoke at both civic forums on an all-island basis and made a valuable contribution, as did many of the other party leaders.  There is no Executive at the moment in Northern Ireland.  I hope that can come together very quickly so that common objectives and the voice of the North can be heard at these discussions.  The opportunity for all-island solutions in respect of water, energy and animal health are all possible.  We have a specific set of unique circumstances that apply in the case of Ireland.  Deputy Burton also talked about slippage.  Unemployment today is at 6.4%, which is down from 15.2% when Deputy Burton and the former Minister, Deputy Howlin, took up duty in the previous Government.  It is an extraordinary change in a few short years.  There have never been more opportunities in so many ways for creating employment.  Brexit is a challenge.  It contains uncertainties but these are all matters for us to negotiate hard on.  As I have often said, we have prepared assiduously in so many ways with long-term low interest, by hedging forward and with extra trade missions and support for small companies exporting out of here.  We will treat this as a very serious matter in respect of the protection of our economy and our citizens' jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400019#R00700","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1491318300,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I am conscious there is a further debate on Brexit later today and tomorrow during which we can address in more detail the events of the past ten days.  Some of the points raised during the Treaty of Rome commemorations deserve comment.  In both the United Kingdom's notification and the draft negotiating position, it is fair to say that certain of Ireland's concerns are addressed.  It is welcome that no one appears to be in favour of a hard Border but everything else is up for negotiation.  We have not really had a definition or fleshing out of what people mean by a hard Border versus any other kind of border.  One major point of concern is the failure of the United Kingdom Government to propose any provisions which might be specific to devolved governments.  Not only is special status for Northern Ireland not proposed, it appears to be explicitly ruled out.  It is looking at a pan-British approach to the relationship with the European Union.  Crucially it omits to mention that 1.8 million people in Northern Ireland will retain the right to European Union citizenship irrespective of the settlement.  There are a series of issues that we would like to see addressed in more detail in the European Union's negotiating document.  The most important is that it must acknowledge the unique position of Northern Ireland and its citizens.  Will the Taoiseach commit to seeking an acknowledgement of the EU citizenship of residents of Northern Ireland post-2019 in the EU's negotiating document?  It is a simple question.

I want to see in the negotiated outcome the language of the portion of the Good Friday Agreement relevant to the future opportunity that may present itself in Northern Ireland.  As the visionaries of the Good Friday Agreement foresaw, there may be a time when the people vote to have a united Ireland.  The language of the Good Friday Agreement that allows for that should be included as part of the negotiated outcome so in that eventuality, Northern Ireland would not then be asked to trigger Article 49 to rejoin the European Union.  It would be allowed to do so in a seamless transition in the same way as East Germany was able to form the federal republic with West Germany when the Berlin Wall came down.  It is important.  For those who drafted the Good Friday Agreement, it was quite a visionary thing to put in because that time may come.  It will be important that the negotiations include that language as the continuation of the vision and foresight of those who drafted the Good Friday Agreement in the first place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400019#R00900","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1491318300,"counter":257,"content":"<p>By way of clarification, the Taoiseach said the Government will publish a detailed list of actions.

A weekend report in <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>claimed that the Government was afraid that Irish companies would relocate to Britain to avoid tariffs and currency risks.  It also claimed to have received a series of internal Government documents under freedom of information request that showed the breadth of the Government's concerns across a range of sectors, including fishing, research, forestry and agrifood.  Apparently, one of the documents revealed the Government's concern about the possibility that, post Brexit, Britain would be in a better position to attract foreign direct investment.  Is that true?<\/p><p>The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's briefing notes warn that this State faces &quot;a very uncertain situation related to the management and sharing of a large number of different fish stocks&quot;.  The British fishing industry wants to exclude all foreign boats, including Irish ones, from its fisheries zone after Brexit.

I accept my responsibilities as Taoiseach in terms of the negotiating mandate and requirement that we have here, and that is why I have kept the Opposition party leaders fully briefed on the preparations for Brexit in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  It is true, and I agree with the Deputy, that we have never been down this road before.  Nobody has moved Article 50.  Nobody has left the European Union.  This is going to have an impact, not just nationally or internationally, but also globally, and it will have an impact on the economies of the island of Ireland.  That is why it is very important that the Deputy's own party would work with the other parties in the North and put together the Executive, which will speak for the economic aspects and the businesses and the trade unions and the workers in Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Yes, I think it is probably true that, over the last number of years, there have been Irish firms that set up subsidiaries or relocated some of their enterprises in Britain long before Brexit ever came.  It is also true that, in respect of the interest being expressed in Ireland from financial houses, banks or sectors of them, they are very interested in relocating to Ireland.  Many have multiple units at the moment.  They will want to continue to be part of the Single Market.  They have the second highest busiest route in the world, with connectivity, English language speakers and access to a churn of young talent, which is very important in terms of the products and services that are going to be provided in the future.  Clearly, we have lost &euro;500 million in value terms, because of currency fluctuations, in the drinks and food industry, and Enterprise Ireland has been very conscious of this.<\/p>  <p>  Fish stocks will probably be one of the most complicated arguments of all.  The Common Fisheries Policy is not something that can be unravelled in individual segments because it has been a traded business over very many years when some countries had no real interest in their fisheries potential, including ourselves, I have to say.  While it might be very much in Britain's interests that Brexit would suit it, in that a majority of the quota is caught in British waters, clearly there will be some very complicated negotiations to be held about the fisheries industry and fishery stocks in the time ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400020#S02400","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1491318900,"counter":289,"content":"<p>Clearly, agriculture has suffered some difficulties in the context of an approaching Brexit.  This applies in some areas of agribusiness, most notably the mushroom trade, which was partly brought on by changes in the value of sterling.  There are other issues, not just with fishing, but also tourism.  For the first time in a long while, tourism figures have fallen somewhat, although hopefully not much more.  Much of this relates to changes in the value of sterling, with people who have been planning a break in, for example, County Donegal finding that their pound sterling does not go as far.<\/p>  <p>  I am asked a certain question all of the time.  I am sure that other Members are as well.  What, if anything, is the Government doing to help businesses in agriculture, tourism and so on?  I have read everything from Enterprise Ireland and the IDA and I know that the Taoiseach and Ministers have run a series of conferences, but the Taoiseach just pointed to a key issue.  Notwithstanding his acknowledgement that certain areas face difficulties, he referred to Ireland potentially attracting new banking jobs to Dublin, for example, but that is exactly what the crisis is going to be about.  Jobs are leaving rural Ireland and tourism areas on the west coast, including in the north west, are facing falls.  Those who work in the west and the rest of rural Ireland in fishing, farming, agribusiness, mushrooms in Monaghan or elsewhere will not get those banking jobs in Dublin or Cork city.

The Wild Atlantic Way is a concept that has caught on.  The lakelands and the midlands districts are seeing a huge surge of interest from abroad, as is Ireland's Ancient East.  The Norwegian decision to fly from Cork, Shannon, Belfast and Dublin will do for long haul what Ryanair did for short haul.  I expect seriously increased numbers to come in.  Clearly, Ireland is seen as a very attractive location from a hospitality point of view.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, on the broader scene we are making a joint bid for the rugby world cup for 2023.  Advance preparation is very much in train there.  The British Open will be coming here in 2019.  The Irish Open will for one in three years go to Northern Ireland.  The opportunities for the hospitality sector are very strong.  It should be remembered that the Minister for Finance reduced the VAT rate during the Deputy's own time in Government, from 13.5% to 9%.  That is oftentimes forgotten, but not only did it sustain the industry, it created between 35,000 and 50,000 new jobs.<\/p>  <p>  Unemployment is at 6.4% today.  This is almost full employment, as the Deputy recognises.  That trend was in the downward direction when both she and Deputy Howlin were in the previous Government.  I see Microsoft and Indeed here in Dublin, NGINX in Cork, Allergan in Westport, multiple announcements of jobs in the Limerick area, and the advance factories in Sligo, Athlone, Castlebar and Tralee being completed and seriously investigated in terms of employment opportunities.<\/p><p>These are opportunities here for foreign directive investment.  That line of investment continues to be strong.  When I was in the United States recently I came across many people interested in following through either on initial assessments or existing investments here.  When I was in Davos earlier in the year with the Minister for Finance we met 20 chief executives, many of whom are looking seriously at Ireland in terms of investment.  On the other hand, we have given Enterprise Ireland additional resources, staff and facilities to help small and medium enterprises to export.  There were 100 trade missions abroad this year.  We can sell far more in the eurozone, the Nordic countries and beyond.  These are opportunities in respect of which we are working hard with the ministries for trade and diplomatic services.

In that context, has the Cabinet Committee on the Economy, Trade and Jobs commissioned or produced a position paper or analysis on the impact on trade of a hard Brexit and has it undertaken a sector by sector analysis in terms of the impact of the British decision to leave the European Union?  We have some idea of the likely impact on the agrifood sector.  The Taoiseach referenced fishing rights in terms of our capacity to fish our quota, a significant amount of which currently takes place in British waters.  It seems to me that we cannot take our eye off the ball in terms of trade.

As the Deputy will be aware, work in respect of the cross-city Luas project is ongoing, as is work on connecting bridges and extension of the DART line.

These are the issues on which we are following through.<\/p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Martin's question, all of the options have been examined.  The Deputy is correct that trade is the issue.  In regard to the negotiations that are to take place the nature of the trading relationship is still not clear.  The document from President Tusk is going through the 27 and will be signed off on, hopefully, on 29 April.  The document sets out the ground work and foundations of what will happen.  This goes back to the issue of full membership of the Customs Union, partial membership of the Customs Union, no deal and the consequences of that for tariffs, as pointed out by the Deputy.  In terms of where we are now, the letter triggering Article 50 has been put in place; an initial response has been issued by the European Union and the foundation document on the discussions and negotiations that will take place has been issued.  It remains to be seen what the eventual outcome will be.<\/p>  <p>  We launched the new trade, tourism and investment strategy entitled, Ireland Connected: Trading and Investing in a Dynamic World.  We have also made it clear that 135,000 of the 200,000 to be created by 2020 will be outside the Dublin region.  In regard to Deputy Haughey's point that Dublin is not ready for Brexit, I know there will be serious investment here by the different financial sectors but it will not all happen in 18 months.  A bank deciding to locate here will have to go through a regulatory process in regard to licensing and so on.  The Minister for Finance has made arrangements for the European Central Bank to provide expert personnel if that is needed.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the ports issue raised by Deputy Howlin, the Minister has already pointed out that following the opening of the European Investment Bank office in Dublin there are opportunities here for major pieces of infrastructure and there will be an income stream to deal with those loans.  Again, much depends on the trading relationship and whether tariffs will apply at ports because that could change the economic model of the port to be involved.

An issue seems to have arisen with litigation-based insurance, such as employer liability and public liability insurance, because of the lack of predictability and the inconsistency in court awards.  In some cases, businesses are taking the risk of not having any insurance at all.  They are being forced to take that crazy risk so that they can stay in business.

However, such services are part of the viability of businesses in the first place, therefore they cannot portion out that part of their business.<\/p>  <p>  The work we have done to date has identified particular problems, to which the Deputy alluded, regarding certain businesses taking on higher excesses which is difficult for them in terms of managing their bottom line.  Self-insurance is on the increase.  Businesses involved in self-insuring could be putting their entire business at risk if they encounter a problem in the future against which they had not provisioned.  It is a worrying trend.<\/p>  <p>  We are also considering the role brokers might be able to play and expanding the terms of reference to include that.  Fraud is also important.  We are receiving very good information from businesses on how fraud is affecting their businesses.<\/p>  <p>  We need to examine issues in order to bring greater consistency to this area, such as the personal injuries commission that has been set up already and is working, strengthening the PIAB and in the second quarter of this year, the changes to the legislation on that.

The creation of ISIF was a commitment in the last Government's programme for Government.  The previous Government gave ISIF a unique double bottom line mandate to invest on a commercial basis in a manner designed to support economic activity and employment in Ireland.  This mandate sought to demonstrate that the State was prepared to invest its limited investment funds in projects that would yield a commercial return, thus demonstrating its confidence in the future of the Irish economy.  The intention of this investment was to leverage additional private sector investment, which I am pleased to state has been higher than expected to date.<\/p><p>Given ISIF's new and unique mandate as a sovereign development fund and because of the uncertainty regarding investment opportunities in Ireland, it was agreed at the time that a formal review of the ISIF investment strategy would take place after 18 months.  This was to allow a sufficient period of time to elapse before considering the operations and impact of the fund.  The investment strategy review which is due to be completed shortly is examining the performance and impact of ISIF.  The review includes an appraisal of the success of ISIF's mandate to the end of December 2016 and requires engagement by both my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as part of the process.<\/p><p>I am sure the Deputy shares my view that ISIF's double bottom line mandate represents a unique strategic opportunity for Ireland.  The mandate is designed to ensure that ISIF's investment generates a return, attracts investors and recycles funds.  Without wanting in any way to pre-empt the review that is currently under way, I am encouraged by the quality and impact on the Irish economy of ISIF's investments.  ISIF has built up momentum already, including through its future pipeline.  ISIF has already committed &euro;2.7 billion and acts as a catalyst for other investors to invest in Irish projects.  This includes a commitment of &euro;361 million for infrastructure investment essential to the future competitiveness of the economy.  In addition, ISIF's ability to attract co-investment from the private sector means that &euro;7 billion of total investment has been committed to the end of December 2016.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>It is apparent from the investments already in the public domain that, as envisaged at inception, ISIF is utilising its unique investment characteristics of scale, long-term perspective and flexibility to target high economic value investment in Ireland in a way that other funds cannot.  ISIF has made investments in the following key economic sectors, namely, housing and construction, SME credit, venture capital and equity funds, connectivity, renewable energy, water provision, forestry and agriculture.  The fact that the proceeds of ISIF investment can, unlike State spending, also be recycled to support future economic activity in Ireland illustrates the potential that the ISIF model offers and on which ISIF is currently delivering.  I look forward to receiving the ISIF investment strategy review as it will be a useful opportunity to consider ISIF's work to date and the most appropriate use of the fund to help meet the forthcoming challenges that the State faces.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400024#W00100","speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1491321300,"counter":353,"content":"<p>At the end of 2016, the fund's global portfolio was &euro;6.65 billion.

When I look at the investments to date, some of them are very good.  Some of them are quite niche in nature, however, and it is clear that more mainstream investments which can meet the terms of the commercial mandate should be explored.  For example, is there more we can do in relation to investment in broadband through ISIF?  There are many unbuilt roads nationally which we know are to be tolled.  Would they meet the terms of the commercial mandate?  Similarly, a certain amount of housing has been provided in partnership with funds.  Should we be doing more in that area?  Public transport passengers pay fares and, as such, investments in this area can be commercial if they are properly constituted.  We should be doing more across all of those areas.

The public private model has worked to some extent.  ISIF has made significant progress and I am sure it is aware of this debate today.

I am aware of the report which was published by Oxfam on 27 March.  The report makes a number of comments about the level of tax paid by certain banks in respect of their operations in each country of operation, including Ireland.  The report also asserts that 31 different jurisdictions, including Ireland, should be considered tax havens.  I understand that the report relies on publicly available data published by banks under the capital requirements directive, CRD IV.  The report takes this data and uses it to assert the effective tax rate suffered by banks in the countries in which they operate.  While I will not comment on the tax affairs of individual taxpayers, there are a number of reasons that using this data to assert a company's effective tax rate may create a misleading picture.<\/p>  <p>  Calculating a company's effective tax rate requires looking at a company's profits as calculated under Irish tax law and the amount of tax charged on those profits under Irish tax law.  This information is not included in the public country-by-country reports.  For this reason, caution is needed when using the country-by-country information when commenting on a company's tax affairs.  For example, the profit figures filed in the CRD IV reports generally relate to profit calculated for accounting purposes.  Companies, however, do not pay tax on their accounting profits, but rather on their taxable profits.  There are a variety of legitimate differences in how these figures are calculated in each country.<\/p><p>For example, all capital expenditure is treated differently for accounting and tax calculations. <br\/><br\/>Similarly, the tax on profit or loss figure in the publicly disclosed information may relate to tax actually paid over to Revenue rather than the tax charge suffered by the company.  For example, where a company has losses carried forward from a previous year, this would reduce the amount of tax that must be paid over but does mean the company is not subject to a tax charge on its profits.<br\/><br\/>Officials in my Department are examining the report in more detail and have arranged a meeting with Oxfam to discuss the report's contents.<br\/><br\/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><br\/><br\/>I would like to point out that all companies in Ireland pay the standard 12.5% rate on their trading profits which are generated in Ireland.  Higher rates of 25% and 33% apply to certain profits.  My Department has previously worked with Mr Seamus Coffey, who is currently conducting a review on the corporation tax code, on a technical paper to provide clarity about the seemingly conflicting figures and methodologies for the effective rate of tax paid by companies in Ireland.  This paper found that the effective rate paid nationally is between 10.3% and 10.7%.<br\/><br\/>I strongly reject the report's suggestion that Ireland is a tax haven.  There is no clear analysis as to why Ireland would be considered as such and we do not meet any of the vague criteria that the report suggests are indicative of tax havens.  The report itself notes that international institutions, such as the IMF and OECD, do not consider Ireland to be a tax haven.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400024#W00900","speaker":"1326","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491321900,"counter":362,"content":"<p>As the Minister knows, and he has been quite concerned about it, Ireland's reputation on tax is a very tricky issue, particularly in the context of Brexit.

We are then talking to other companies that are not directly financial services companies themselves, but an element of their business is significant enough that they have a subsidiary that might be operating in a particular area, for example, for payments.<\/p>  <p>  We have the IFS2020 strategy,  which is a five-year strategy for increasing our international financial services offering.  We worked with industry to develop that strategy.  As a result of having that strategy in place since 2015, it meant we were ahead of the game in attracting financial services firms into Ireland to allow that continuity of service into the Single Market.  Not every company that relocates out of the UK is going to come here.  We have to be honest about this.  There is going to be a flow to this.  From the meetings I have already had and from the decisions that have already been taken by companies, there will be a strong flow to Ireland.  It is up to the companies themselves to decide when they want to notify the public, their customers, their staff, shareholders and regulators in jurisdictions in which they are currently based.  When they do that, then we will be in a position to comment publicly about that.  Companies will be relocating here, but they will also relocate to other jurisdictions in Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400026#Y00200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1491322500,"counter":383,"content":"<p>Here is the fear.

It still says two plays, which is FinTech and another one, which escapes me.  Brexit presents a big opportunity, which is now different, which is to say that we are not just going to try to get insurance companies, reinsurance companies, trading firms and so forth.  There is a real opportunity to say that we can bring the entire ecosystem over to Dublin or wherever it sets up in Ireland.  One of the reasons London is so strong is because it has the full ecosystem.<\/p>  <p>  A core piece of this is the infrastructure.  The fear from financial services players in Dublin is that we might bring some of these firms over, but because we do not create a sustainable infrastructure around them, in time they might move to Luxembourg, Frankfurt or elsewhere.  The information I have from very well-placed people within the industry is that the infrastructure firms are not being approached by the State and need to be.  The infrastructure firms are saying that they are being wined and dined by the French, the Belgians and the Spanish and by Luxembourg, and they are not seeing sight nor sound of the Irish.  Nobody is saying that the Minister of State is not busy.  We know he is busy.  My sense is that we could be more strategic, more clever and have a strategy that encompasses the full ecosystem so that when we get these firms over here, they stay here and grow rather than relocating here temporarily.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400026#Y00300","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1491322500,"counter":384,"content":"<p>We share the same ambition here.

It is part of the strategy that we are developing to make sure that every opportunity that might come from Brexit is there and available to us to take advantage of.  Companies will make relocation decisions based on a number of factors.  We have heard we are coming in the top three of companies' potential relocation options across the board.  They will pull a trigger for this jurisdiction, but they will also pull it for other jurisdictions and for other legacy reasons, for example.  One big international bank has decided to go to Paris.  It made sense because a legacy acquisition 12 years ago meant it already had the authorisation for its banking licencee.  If one looks at the action plan for 2017 under the IFS2020 strategy, there are two component parts.  The first component part is the Brexit narrative, talking about contingency planning, communications, the Central Bank piece in this and other areas like International Baccalaureate education and what we need to do.  The second part is the 40 individual action points and how we are going to address them just in this year alone.  There is the matter of IFS and how we plan to grow it for the year.  Some points are very Brexit-related and some are less directly so.  <\/p>  <p>  No one individual ecosystem in international financial services is going to relocate to another jurisdiction.  In insurance, for example, not all insurance companies are going to go to one place and it is good that they do not.  It is good that they operate from different jurisdictions, in different markets into the Single Market when they can.  The skill-set and having the people here are very important to us.  That is why one of the pillars of those 40 action points in the IFS strategy for this year is looking at education, trading and skills development, and also attracting Irish emigrants back home into these high-level jobs that are being created, not just in Dublin but also Cork and other parts of the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400026#Y00400","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Other Questions","time":1491322500,"counter":385,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400026#Y00450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Debt","time":1491322500,"counter":386,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400026#Y00475"},{"type":"question","time":1491322500,"counter":387,"qnumday":40,"qnumall":"[16418\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400026#Y00500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his Department has held discussions recently with the NTMA in relation to the national debt repayments which will fall due in 2018 to 2020; his views on the fact that a quarter of Ireland's national debt is due for refinancing in that period; the way this will impact the fiscal position; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The total balance outstanding on these bonds is currently just over &euro;42 billion.  In addition, the majority of the bilateral loans received from the UK, Sweden and Denmark as part of the EU-IMF programme also mature during that period.  This brings the total medium-term to long-term debt refinancing requirement over that three year period to approximately &euro;46.5 billion.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should be aware that although there are two loans from the European financial stabilisation mechanism, EFSM, totalling &euro;3.9 billion, with contractual maturity dates in 2018, these are due to be refinanced by the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, in light of the maturity extensions granted to EFSM and European Financial Stability Facility, EFSF, loans in 2013.

The expectation is that these bonds can be refinanced at lower coupons based on the current interest rate outlook.  The current interest expenditure forecast reflects this expectation.  For the period of 2018 to 2020, refinancing requirements have already been significantly reduced in recent years.\u00a0 Following the early repayments to the IMF of December 2014 and the first quarter of 2015 and their replacement with cheaper long-term market-based funding, the liability to the IMF in that three-year period has been reduced by approximately &euro;11.5 billion.  The maturity extensions granted to EFSF and EFSM loans in 2013 and bilateral bond switching have also helped to reduce the refinancing requirements over that period by over &euro;7 billion.  The NTMA has also built up significant cash balances as part of its pre-funding strategy.

However, the European Union excise regime which governs the production, processing and holding of excisable products imposes certain restrictions on intra-Union movements of these products.  These restrictions impact on the importation of mineral oils for vehicle and household use from Northern Ireland.  The EU excise regime governing the movement of excisable products, that is mineral oils, tobacco products and alcohol, does not apply to solid fuels such as coal and, as a result, solid fuel is not subject to cross-Border movement controls typical of other harmonised excises such as mineral oil tax and tobacco tax. <\/p><p>I will deal firstly with the importation from Northern Ireland of mineral oils for use as vehicle and household fuels.  Persons bringing mineral oil fuel for vehicles into the State from Northern Ireland must pay excise duty, that is mineral oil tax, on that fuel except where the fuel is present in the fuel tank of a vehicle at the time that vehicle is brought into the State or where the fuel is in a single portable vessel with a capacity of not more than 10 litres that is in that vehicle at the time of coming into the State, and where the proper UK excise duty applicable to the use of that fuel in the vehicle involved has been paid in that jurisdiction.<\/p><p>Persons bringing mineral oil into the State for use other than as road vehicle fuel, for example for heating use or for agricultural tractors or stationary motors, must pay the mineral oil tax on that fuel.  In the case of gas oil or kerosene, where a person wishes to pay only the reduced rate applicable to those fuels when intended for use other than as road fuel, the oil must be marked with the fuel markers prescribed by the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p><p>All commercial movements of mineral oil into the State from Northern Ireland are subject to a movement control system.\u00a0 Movements of duty-suspended mineral oil are subject to\u00a0an EU-wide electronic system, known as the excise movement control system.  In the case of movements of duty-paid oils, such movements may only take place under an equivalent paper-based control method.  Where a person intends to sell or deal in mineral oils the appropriate mineral oil trader's licence, issued by the Revenue Commissioners, must be held.  Other control measures include obligations on oil traders to provide detailed information on their fuel transactions to Revenue.  This allows Revenue to monitor mineral oil supply chains to identify suspicious or anomalous transactions and patterns of distribution for investigation.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>I am satisfied that the current restrictions on the importation of oil for vehicle and household use are comprehensive and support Revenue in tackling any issues regarding the illegal importation of mineral oil.<\/p><p>I will now deal with the importation of solid fuel, and specifically coal, into the State from Northern Ireland.  All solid fuel supplied in the State is liable to solid fuel carbon tax.  This tax was legislated for in 2010 but its commencement was delayed until 2013 to allow for a mechanism to be put in place to address the risk of coal products with lower environmental standards being sourced from outside the State.  Regulations to enable local authorities to regulate and control the type of coal supplied in the State were put in place by the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and are now the responsibility of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.<\/p><p>As I already explained, EU law does not require compliance with movement controls for solid fuels for excise duty purposes.  Therefore, no excise movement controls apply to imports of solid fuel from Northern Ireland, whether by private persons for their own use or by traders or businesses for commercial purposes.  Revenue collects solid fuel carbon tax on a self-assessment basis and enforces compliance by way of audit.  Excise law does not give Revenue an authority to stop vehicles and physically inspect loads of solid fuel.  Similarly, the transport or possession of solid fuel that originated in Northern Ireland are not, in themselves, Revenue offences and Revenue's officers have no authority to challenge such transportation or possession.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400028#AA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1491323700,"counter":407,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his answer.

I understand that a standard truck carrying 20 tonnes of coal from Northern Ireland to the South, without the application of carbon tax and with a differential in VAT, gives an advantage of more than &euro;2,000 to the person conducting the illicit trade.  It is very hard for the legitimate merchant and retailer to compete.  Hardware Association Ireland has put forward some suggestions to the Revenue Commissioners and to the Department, such as the registration of all solid fuel traders provided for in the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015, which requires a valid tax clearance certificate for such traders to register.  The association also called for a public awareness campaign to let the public who buy these cheaper products know that they are illicit and that carbon tax or the proper rate of VAT has not been paid in our jurisdiction.  Hardware Association Ireland also recommends very thorough audits by Revenue on the people involved in this illicit trade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400028#AA01000","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1491323700,"counter":408,"content":"<p>My initial reply dealt exclusively with controls on the importation of fossil fuels.  The collection of solid fuel carbon tax is heavily reliant on the regulatory regime for solid fuel put in place by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.

These environmental standards are higher than those that apply in Northern Ireland.  The regulations provide for the enforcement of the relevant environmental standards by local authorities.  Local authorities have powers to inspect premises and vehicles being used for the sale and distribution of solid fuel, to collect samples of coal to check for adherence to environmental standards and to prosecute traders involved in selling illicit coal.

At budget time, my officials estimated that the help-to-buy incentive would cost &euro;40 million per annum but &euro;50 million in 2017 due to the backdating of the relief in respect of properties which became eligible for the scheme since 19 July 2016.<\/p>  <p>  To avail of the incentive involves two stages.  Stage 1 is the application stage, wherein prospective applicants can query whether they qualify for the incentive.  They can also get clarity on the maximum amount of rebate they could potentially benefit from, based on their tax paid in a four-year period.  Stage 2 is the claims stage, wherein applicants who decide to proceed with purchasing or building a qualifying property must provide documentary evidence of the relevant property transaction or their mortgage drawdown.<\/p>  <p>  The estimates for the potential cost of the incentive that have featured in recent media reports are based on the number of applications received by Revenue to stage 1 of the scheme, rather than the number of claims to date.  However, many of these applicants may never make a claim to stage 2 for a variety of reasons.  These could include individuals who do not go on to obtain mortgage approval, who may decide to purchase a second-hand property, or who are not able to source the new home that they desire.<\/p>  <p>  As of 31 March 2017, Revenue had received 4,698 applications to stage 1 of the help-to-buy incentive.  Of these, 1,006 stage 2 claims have been created to date.  A total of 534 of these have been approved, at an estimated cost to the Exchequer to date in the order of &euro;8.2 million of the &euro;50 million allocated for the cost of the incentive in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's query concerning cost containment measures, the help-to-buy incentive is by its nature a demand-led scheme.  Therefore, artificially restricting its potential uptake in such a manner would be detrimental to its policy aims and would be unfair to those potential applicants who could lose out as a result.  In addition, should the cost of the incentive exceed the original estimate, it could be indicative of an increase in the supply of new homes, which is exactly what I intended to encourage through its introduction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400029#BB00700","speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1491324300,"counter":416,"content":"<p>Over the past 48 hours since the two reports have been published, households have been asking if we are in some kind of time warp.

Since the scheme is for people principally buying starter homes, then it is an incentive to put a deposit together.

This will attract foreign direct investment into Ireland and will create a substantial number of jobs.<\/p><p>NAMA has made a significant contribution to social and economic development in other respects also.  I refer the Deputy to NAMA's website, <i>www. nama.ie\/social-initiatives\/<\/i>,which contains extensive information on how NAMA seeks to manage its portfolio in a manner that complements the objectives of Government Departments, local authorities, State agencies and public bodies.\u00a0 NAMA's work in this respect includes the provision of homes for social housing and properties for schools and other public uses.  NAMA also works closely with IDA Ireland to identify suitable properties for companies investing in Ireland.  All this has been managed in the context of NAMA's overriding commercial mandate, as set out in section 10 of the NAMA Act.\u00a0 <\/p><p>NAMA has made\u00a0a substantial contribution in the social housing sector by working with its debtors and receivers, the Housing Agency, local authorities and approved housing bodies.  It established the NAMA asset residential property service, NARPS, as\u00a0an innovative model to expedite social housing delivery. \u00a0NARPS has significantly reduced the upfront capital costs for local\u00a0authorities in delivering to date more than 2,370 residential units for social housing.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>NAMA also played a key role in the resolution of unfinished housing estates within the State. \u00a0In 2010 NAMA had exposure to 332 unfinished housing estates.  That has now reduced to 11 unfinished estates at this stage and they are expected to be resolved by end-2017.<\/p><p>I would also\u00a0point out\u00a0that NAMA is seeking to facilitate the delivery of 20,000 homes over the period from 2016 to 2020, subject to commercial viability. \u00a0Since 2014, NAMA funding has facilitated the delivery of 4,700 units by its debtors and receivers.<\/p><p>As regards the Deputy's question as to the obligations on purchasers to build homes, I am advised that NAMA contributes to the delivery of housing in three ways.  First, as mentioned above, it seeks to facilitate and fund the delivery of 20,000 homes by 2020 through funding residential projects controlled by its debtors and receivers.  Second, its debtors and receivers sell sites to the market which enables other developers to contribute to housing delivery.  Sites for 40,000 units have been sold since 2010.  As the Deputy will appreciate, it is not possible to impose legal obligations on asset purchasers to undertake activity without significant loss in the site values.  Third, NAMA enters into licence arrangements with non-NAMA developers which require them to carry out development on sites securing NAMA loans in return for a fee.<\/p><p>Taken together,\u00a0I hope the Deputy will agree that NAMA has made, and continues to make, a significant contribution to the social and economic development of the State and that it does so successfully within the context of NAMA's overriding commercial mandate, as set out in section 10 of the NAMA Act.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware,\u00a0does not own property.\u00a0\u00a0owns loans. \u00a0As a\u00a0lender,\u00a0cannot force a borrower to take action which would reduce his or her repayment capacity such as providing a property for\u00a0social\u00a0or private\u00a0housing where that is not economically optimal.\u00a0 To do so would compromise a borrower's\u00a0capacity to repay his or her debts to\u00a0and would constitute\u00a0a direct breach of the borrower's property rights, as protected under Article 43 of the Constitution. \u00a0I am advised that a direction running counter to these obligations is not one lawfully open to me in all the current circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400030#CC03200","speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1491324900,"counter":463,"content":"<p>Section 2(<i>b<\/i>)(viii) of the NAMA Act provides that NAMA should &quot;contribute to the social and economic development of the State&quot;.

This is less than five months from now, which means time is short.  Parents are concerned by what they consider to be a lack of certainty and progress on the school.  I have repeatedly raised this issue and pressed the Department and Minister to progress the matter.  I understand the Minister has on his desk sufficient information to make a decision on who will be the patron of the school.  Will he identify the patron to allow it to proceed with the establishment of the school?<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of population growth in Ballincollig in recent years, a new school was announced in November 2015.  In September 2015, 448 children enrolled in the town's schools, one of which accepted 94 children and refused almost as many again.  Despite this, the next step in the process was not taken until one year later, in November 2016, when expressions of interest were invited to potential patrons.  Three patron groups submitted applications by 6 January 2017 and the new school establishment group has been reviewing these submissions in the intervening months.  In response to a question I asked the Minister in late February, he indicated a decision on patronage was due within weeks.  One month later, a decision has not been made and the school is due to open in less than five months.  A great deal of work must be done before September.  Staff must be hired and an open and transparent hiring process will add a number of weeks to the process.  The building must be finished and enrolments taken, which mean the timetable is very tight.<\/p>  <p>  The position in Ballincollig contrasts strongly with the position of the fourth school in the same school bundle, which is located in south central Dublin.  The Dublin school will have 18 months to do the same work as the school in Ballincollig.  The new school establishment group has made a recommendation, which is on the Minister's desk.  Will he release the name of the patron and allow the patron to establish the school?  Locals are concerned and have been outlining their concerns when they call into my office in Ballincollig or meet me on the street.<\/p><p>They are asking what is the story with the school and whether there will be a place for their child in September, which is less than five months away.  If they have expressed interest in another patron that is not approved, will there be a place for them in the new school?<\/p> <p> The school is only taking in one junior infants class.  What happens if there is more demand than that?  If a second class is required, will provision be made?  What will happen regarding children with special educational needs?  The Department is currently amending the way in which support for them is allocated.  How will SNA supports be allocated for the new school in Ballincollig?  Will it be done using the old model or via the new model using a baseline and profile of the area?  Given the tight timeframe, it is expected a temporary building will be in use from September.  How long with the children be in this building and what facilities will be available to them?  Will there be playgrounds, green areas and so on?  How soon will the new eight classroom permanent school be built and occupied?  These are realistic questions that are concerning for parents and they cannot approach a school authority to get answers.<\/p> <p> The New Schools Establishment Group, NSEG, has been reviewing the bundle of four schools for the past three months.  Three submissions were made regarding Ballincollig.  They have been reviewed and are on the Minister's desk.  Can he release the Ballincollig decision in order that the school can be developed?  That would clear up much of the uncertainty that is troubling parents.  It would mean the patron could finalise the details of the school building and offer places to children and it would mean parents would know where they stand.  There are less than five months remaining for the school to be opened and parents have numerous concerns.

As he rightly recognised, my Department conducted a study of the demographic pressures throughout the country and indicated that four new primary schools and nine new post-primary schools were justified.  Under the procedure operated within my Department, when it is identified that there is a demographic need, the Department runs a patronage process to decide who will operate the school.  The criteria used in respect of patronage of the new school place particular emphasis on parental demand for plurality and diversity of patronage, with parental preferences from the area to be served being central to the process.  In this regard, patrons and prospective patrons must collect and demonstrate evidence of parental demand from the area to be served for the model of provision proposed as part of their application under the process.  My Department invited applications for the patronage last November and that closed for applications in January.  The assessment stage of the process is rigorous and detailed and it has go through all the applications, identify whether they are within the catchment and so on.<\/p>  <p>  Once completed, draft assessment reports will be forwarded for the consideration of the NSEG, which is an external independent advisory group set up to oversee the process.  Contrary to what the Deputy said, the report has not arrived on my desk.  Following its consideration, the NSEG will submit a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision.  I will then announce who the successful patron of each of the four schools will be.  The assessment reports and the NSEG recommendations will be available on my Department's website following the announcement.<\/p>  <p>  I reassure the Deputy that care has to be taken in these matters because when there is a competition between different patrons, it has to be conducted in a fair and balanced way and, therefore, the time has to be taken to do that.  I recognise the concerns of parents regarding the delay.  However, the memorandum of understanding between my Department and the County and City Managers' Association helps us to identify sites for educational use.  My Department has been working closely with Cork County Council towards acquiring a permanent site to meet the needs of the new primary school for Ballincollig.  A number of potentially suitable sites were identified and were comprehensively technically assessed.  Further consideration is now being given to a preferred site option with a view to advancing the acquisition process.<\/p>  <p>  Given the commercial sensitivities associated with land acquisitions generally, the Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to comment further at this time.  Officials from my Department will be in contact with the relevant school authorities to inform them of the permanent location for the school once the site acquisition process has been completed.  A project for the new primary school is included in my Department's six-year capital programme.  Once a site is acquired, my Department will make the necessary arrangements to advance the school project concerned into architectural planning with a view to progressing the project to tender and construction during the period 2019-21, as outlined in the programme.  In the meantime the school will open in September 2017 in suitable interim temporary accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the issue of special education needs and how SNA allocations will be made to the school, I will revert to the Deputy as that was not covered in the briefing material, given it is a new enrolment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400032#EE00200","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1491326100,"counter":483,"content":"<p>Less than five months remain until the school opens in September.

Those Deputies are hiding behind and, at the same time, backing the Minister, Deputy Ross, in his attempts to run our public transport network into the ground to suit his agenda of privatisation.  Public transport, like education and housing, is a public service.  There are hundreds of thousands of people who depend on public transport on a daily basis.<\/p>  <p>  If the talks at the WRC do not work out and if the Minister persists with his agenda of privatisation and a race to the bottom of workers' rights the result will be the mother of all strikes.  The Minister and the Government will be directly responsible for the chaos that will ensue when that happens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400035#HH00800","speaker":"1333"},{"type":"speech","time":1491327900,"counter":515,"content":"<p>The Minister's reply is incredibly contradictory.

The underfunding of a public service like Bus &Eacute;ireann was destined to end in a crisis.  This crisis is not confined to Bus &Eacute;ireann.  We also need to look at what will happen in Dublin Bus over the next year when 10% of its routes are opened to private operators.

The Government cannot consistently allow routes to be cherry-picked by the private operators, while at the same time wondering why Bus &Eacute;ireann is having difficulties with its financial viability.

Conscious of its relevance for Ireland, the Government played an active role in advance of the referendum.  This included working to ensure a far-reaching agreement between the UK and EU last February, with a view to enabling the then Prime Minister, David Cameron, to campaign for a vote to remain in the EU and engage with the Irish community in Britain, who had the right to vote in the referendum, to ensure they were fully aware of the benefits of EU membership and the implications of a withdrawal.  The Government was unambiguous in its view that the UK's departure from the European Union would have significant political, economic and social implications for Ireland.  Clearly, therefore, the outcome of the referendum was not what we would have wished.  However, we fully respect the democratic decision of the UK electorate.<\/p>  <p>  Well before the UK referendum, the Government had started to analyse the main areas of concern and to prepare a contingency framework.  Following the referendum, this work intensified and since last summer there has been very extensive engagement with all sectors across the island of Ireland, including 16 all-island civic dialogue events involving over 1,200 representatives, as well as nearly 300 other meetings with individual stakeholders.  Restructuring took place, additional resources were put in place and all Departments and agencies were charged with making Brexit a top priority.  There is now strong co-ordination on Brexit at key levels across Government.<\/p>  <p>  Through the Cabinet committee on Brexit, which I chair, and which brings together all relevant Ministers and Departments, there has been a thorough analysis of our concerns, an identification of risks, mitigation measures and opportunities and the development of our negotiating priorities.  These priorities are to minimise the impact on our trade and the economy, to protect the Northern Ireland peace process, including maintaining an open border, to continue the common travel area with the UK and to work for a positive future for the European Union.  Our approach is to work towards the best possible outcome in the negotiations, maintain a close and constructive economic and trading relationship between the EU and the UK and to continue intensive work to make our economy resilient and future-proof.<\/p>  <p>  We have already taken important steps to repair our economy, including budget 2017 and the Action Plan for Jobs 2017, our new trade and investment strategy.  Brexit will, of course, be a critical factor in our longer-term economic strategy.  A new ten-year capital programme is in preparation.  We are reviewing our 2025 policy to align our enterprise base and policies to reflect new international realities.  We are in active discussions with the European Investment Bank regarding a potential increase in investment in the country.  In the meantime, the Government's enterprise agencies will continue to work with exporters and potential investors, helping them to deal with issues as they arise, making companies more competitive, diversifying market exposure and upskilling teams.<\/p>  <p>  Last Wednesday, 29 March, as expected, and in accordance with Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union, Prime Minister May formally notified the European Council of the intention of the UK to leave the EU.  This means that we have entered a new phase and the two-year exit process has commenced.  I was pleased that our particular concerns, including those relating to the Good Friday Agreement, were acknowledged in some detail by Prime Minister May in her letter.  This reflected our engagement with the UK, including my meetings with the Prime Minister through the mechanisms set up under the 1998 Good Friday Agreement and those established following the 2012 joint statement, while of course respecting the principle of no negotiations without notification agreed with our EU partners last June.<\/p>  <p>  Now that Article 50 has been triggered, we will publish before the end of this month a consolidated paper providing more detail about our priorities and approach to the negotiations ahead.  On Friday, 31 March, in response to Prime Minister May's letter, the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, circulated a draft EU negotiating guidelines among the 27 remaining EU Heads of State and Government.  These outlined the main issues to be addressed in the withdrawal negotiations and the principles and approach of the EU side.  The draft guidelines will be discussed at ministerial and senior official level over the next few weeks, and the 27 EU Heads of State and Government will meet as the European Council on 29 April to agree them.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased that the draft guidelines include a very strong acknowledgment of Ireland's unique and special circumstances, the need to protect the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement and our intention to maintain bilateral arrangements with the UK, such as the common travel area.  It is important to highlight in the House that the resolution on the Brexit negotiations adopted by the European Parliament on Wednesday also contains strong references to our specific concerns.  These outcomes bear testament to our programme of strategic engagement over recent months, which has included almost 400 meetings with EU partners and the EU institutions in which we have highlighted, explained and contextualised the unique and special circumstances pertaining to Ireland and the need for these to be addressed in the upcoming negotiations.  This programme has included engagement by me as Head of Government, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, other Ministers and our team of experienced senior officials and diplomats.<\/p>  <p>  This engagement has also enabled us to gain a useful understanding of the objectives of other partners and to start to look more closely at potential alliances for the negotiations and more generally for the future.  Once the guidelines are finalised, a more detailed negotiating mandate for the European Commission will be agreed by Ministers in May, and negotiations with the UK can then begin.  It is important to note that the European Commission Brexit task force, headed by Michel Barnier, will lead the day-to-day negotiations, but the European Council, that is, the 27 Heads of State and Government, will have constant oversight of the process.  They will discuss and review the negotiations regularly, revise the guidelines as required and take all final decisions.<\/p>  <p>  As the member state with, arguably, the most at stake, we are fully engaged in this process and are in regular contact with EU institutions and our EU partners.  I have just come from a meeting with the President of Croatia, the most recent EU member state.  On Thursday, I will meet with Chancellor Merkel in Berlin.<\/p>  <p>  Under Article 50, the exit negotiations, which will address issues such as the status of EU citizens living in the UK and UK citizens living other member states and the UK's financial commitments to the EU, as well as issues relating to the Border, should be concluded within two years, including time for the agreement to be approved by the European and UK Parliaments.  While I believe that the exit negotiations should also include discussions on the future relationship between the EU and the UK, the many complex and important issues involved, including trade, regulatory convergence and sectors such as fisheries, energy and deviation, are unlikely to be resolved for a considerable period of time.<\/p><p>It is my strong view, as I have stressed in my discussions, that a transitional arrangement between the exit agreement and the future relationship agreement will be required to ensure an orderly exit and provide certainty for our citizens and businesses.  While we have achieved our goal so far, we are only at the beginning of what will be a very long and difficult set of negotiations.  We will need to remain united and focused with a view to ensuring that the unique circumstances of Ireland and its particular concerns arising from Brexit continue to be understood and addressed.<\/p> <p> In any objective assessment, it is clear that European Union membership is central to the success of our open, competitive economy and the basis for much of our political and social progress.  Our place must remain at the heart of Europe and we will work with all our EU partners as part of the EU team to achieve the best possible outcome.  These negotiations are not a case of Ireland versus the UK, Ireland versus the EU or, indeed, the EU versus the UK.  Many of our EU partners share our concerns and want to achieve as close a relationship as possible with the UK.  For our part, we are determined to maintain our strong relations with both the European Union and the United Kingdom.  Despite the regrettable lack of agreement to date to establish an Executive in Northern Ireland, we will continue our process of engagement with a view to ensuring that the negotiations take full account of all-island issues and Northern Ireland.  Our Ministers understand the business of Europe and the diplomats and officials who support them have extensive experience of challenging international negotiations.  We understand our priorities and have our structures in place.  We have strengthened our relations with our EU partners and the EU institutions and we are well prepared for the challenges that lie ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400037#KK01000","speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491329700,"counter":536,"content":"<p>In the days before Prime Minister May formally triggered Article 50, the leaders of the EU's institutions and the remaining 27 member states gathered in Rome to mark the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome.  The declaration they issued was full of pious aspirations but very little substance and it is far from clear that there is a shared concept of what the Union's priorities should be.  In his speech to the leaders, Pope Francis took a very reflective and important look at the founding ideals of the Union and its current troubles.  He criticised what he termed \"today's lapse of memory\" which he described as being at the heart of how so many are ignoring the sustained achievements of the European Union.  In looking to the future, he stated the following as being especially the case in a time of uncertainty and the exploitation of fears: \"Those who govern are charged with discerning the paths of hope &ndash; you are charged with discerning the paths of hope\".  The next two years represent a moment when we will decide the future direction of our country and of the European community of nations and citizens.  It is a genuinely historic turning point.  The publication of the negotiating documents marks the end of the phoney war and a move to grapple with the substance of the hard, destructive and narrow-minded Brexit with which the British Government has decided to proceed.  While this is a matter between UK voters and their government, it should be noted that the form of Brexit which is now under way is very different from what was promised by the majority of \"Leave\" campaigners.  Exclusion from the Single Market and the customs union was dismissed by the prophets of having one's cake and eating it.  On this matter, the Article 50 notification marks only the first of many times when claims central to the Brexit campaign are casually abandoned.<\/p>  <p>  As I have already addressed the fundamental issue of the future of Europe in other speeches, I turn to address the focused issue of the situation currently facing Ireland and what we can do in the next month before the negotiations begin.  The Article 50 notification letter contains some welcome language in relation to Irish-British connections while the draft EU document also contains important reassurances in relation to protecting peace and avoiding elements of a hard Border.  However, on balance these documents are not encouraging and they only address one element of a much larger challenge for Ireland.  On the most basic level, it is extremely disappointing that the special circumstances of Northern Ireland have not been properly acknowledged.  As I outlined in detail in a speech in Belfast last year, post-2019 there will remain in Northern Ireland 1.8 million people who will be entitled to claim EU citizenship.  The frustration of their democratic decision to remain in the EU is an important issue which the British Government refuses even to reference let alone address.  However, this is an issue not just for the UK, it is one which should be addressed in the EU&rsquo;s negotiating mandate.  It would be unacceptable if an EU citizen were to find his or her rights within the EU to be compromised in any way following Brexit.  Only by explicitly acknowledging this in the negotiating document can there be any hope that the final agreement will deal with it.  EU citizenship is something which was loudly and aggressively campaigned against by Sinn F&eacute;in and our other knee-jerk anti-EU groupings, but it is now a right enshrined in international treaties and it must be protected.  We call on the Government to go back to President Tusk to seek the inclusion of a specific reference in the negotiating mandate to the fact that the EU is conscious of the continued citizenship rights of Northern Ireland residents and will seek to underpin them in any exit treaty.  We also believe that a form of special status for Northern Ireland and the Border region remains possible.  The deep interlinking of social, economic and cultural ties is unique across any border in Europe.  It would be absurd and incredibly damaging if basic supply routes across short distances were to be undermined.<\/p>  <p>  The Article 50 notification included for the first time the possibility that the British Government might seek credible transitional arrangements.  This includes the possibility that it would accept the continued role of the European Court of Justice in underpinning dispute resolution and enforcement.  This potentially opens the way for a transitional arrangement which is specific to the unique circumstances of Ireland.  For example, where traceability can be determined, a lengthy period during which we could operate a separate approach to some customs issues could be sought.  In particular, a transitional arrangement specific to Ireland which bridges any gap between Brexit and a permanent trade agreement should be sought.  A point which is now inescapable is that we have to establish a new approach to working with the British Government on an ongoing basis.  Protecting the many dimensions of the common travel area, including not just employment but also access to health, education, welfare and other services, requires more than a once-off agreement.  It requires a permanent and intense working relationship.  Currently, we do most of this through common EU policies.  Absent these, we need a new forum to ensure our engagement is structured and secure.  A new Irish-British agreement dealing with matters other than the peace settlement will be required and we should be progressing it now.  Because the British Government has chosen a hard Brexit and will opt-in to the very minimum of programmes, such as Horizon 2020, we know already that we need bilateral negotiations on other areas to define current practice and protect it for the future.<\/p>  <p>  Separate entirely from the Brexit negotiations, the EU needs to develop its own response to ensuring that the impact on member states is minimised as much as possible.  The UK Government has already announced a fund to try to move the supply chain in certain industries from EU states to the UK.  In effect, it has already fired the starting gun on using direct state aids to poach businesses.  Any attempt by the Commission to enforce EU laws in this area would be irrelevant given that such enforcement takes longer than two years.  We cannot simply stand by and do nothing, however.  At minimum, we should seek an immediate agreement that member states can take action during the next two years to combat any poaching efforts which are incompatible with current state aid principles.  This should include the right to support immediately the sectors most threatened by Brexit's disruption.<\/p>  <p>  Given the extent of the attention it has received in recent days, it is worth noting the controversy concerning the Gibraltar sentence in the EU document.  The scale of reaction in London merely confirms how little people there had thought through the implications of last year's vote.  There is nothing controversial about the Spanish Government's position and the clause merely acknowledges the concessions made by Spain during its accession negotiations.  I welcome the comments of the Spanish Foreign Minister relating to Scotland.<\/p><p>Should Scotland become an independent country and wish to join the European Union, it should be welcomed without delay.  It is a modern, liberal and democratic country which has demonstrated how in the modern world a national revival can happen with generosity to all and without any recourse to violence.<br\/><br\/> The acknowledgement of the Good Friday Agreement in the European Union document removes the need to specify at this stage that Northern Ireland would be immediately incorporated into the EU should a majority vote for unity.  This would be similar to the handling of German unification.<br\/><br\/> Some of the worst of the bombastic complacency heard from London since last June appears to have been replaced by elements of realism.  The first sense of the Tories trying to avoid a chaotic Brexit has emerged.  What we have not yet seen is a willingness to properly engage with the unique situation of Northern Ireland.  Equally, we have not begun the intense discussions required to have bilateral issues addressed in time for March 2019.<br\/><br\/> In Europe, the approach proposed by President Tusk is reasonable.  His openness and the openness of Michel Barnier to Ireland is welcome.  Before the final negotiating document is agreed we need to seek an explicit acknowledgement of the EU citizenship of Northern Ireland residents, and we should propose the immediate commencement of a parallel internal process in which European Union states can agree actions to mitigate the worst impacts of Brexit.<br\/><br\/> Brexit remains a historic mistake, driven by nostalgia for an imperial past and founded on crude attacks on outsiders.  There is no beneficial Brexit.  It is already causing damage and will continue to do so.  For Ireland there has been some progress, but equally we need urgent engagement to address the many serious issues we face but which have, so far, been ignored.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400038#LL00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491330300,"counter":538,"content":"<p>The publication of the European Union's draft Brexit negotiating guidelines demonstrate clearly the failure of the Taoiseach's approach to the threat posed to the island of Ireland by Brexit.  D&rsquo;&eacute;irigh leis an Sp&aacute;inn cros maidir le Giobr&aacute;ltar a bhaint amach.  Ba cheart go mbeadh an Taoiseach ag iarraidh a leith&eacute;id de ghealltanas a lorg agus a bhaint amach ar son na &Eacute;ireann.  Spain has achieved greater negotiating leverage on the issue of Gibraltar with a veto than the Taoiseach has achieved for Ireland in respect of the North.  Article 22 of the EU negotiation guidelines are clear and definitive.  After Britain leaves the Union, no agreement between the EU and the British Government may apply to the territory of Gibraltar without agreement between Spain and the British Government.  This is the type of veto the Taoiseach should have demanded.  Let us be very clear.  The British Government is seeking to impose Brexit against the will of the people in the North without any care or consideration of its impact across the island of Ireland.  Brexit is bad and will be bad for our economy, jobs and trade.  It has the potential to impose an EU frontier on the island of Ireland and undermine the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements.<\/p>  <p>  To date we have heard promises from the Government of an understanding at EU level and a shared approach with the British Government, and a lot of meaningless phraseology about friction-free borders.  Citizens in the North have the right to Irish citizenship, and as well as this they have a right to European citizenship, but the letter triggering Article 50 and the EU Council's draft negotiating guidelines contain little that is definitive or helpful to these rights or to the rest of the people of Ireland.  The EU draft is vague and conditional, and much clearer commitments are required.  There is still time to get these clear commitments and it is the duty of the Taoiseach and the Government to secure them.  An explicit commitment for the North to be designated special status in the EU is needed.  This is not just the position of Sinn F&eacute;in, it is supported by the majority of parties in the D&aacute;il and a motion to this effect was passed in February.  Is the Government ignoring the will of the D&aacute;il?  It is also supported by the majority of MLAs who were elected in the recent Assembly elections.  In the past, the EU has shown itself to be flexible in agreeing pragmatic arrangements for dealing with complex territorial situations.  Denmark is an EU member but Greenland is outside the Union.  It still receives EU funding.  The EU has said there must be an innovative and imaginative approach to Brexit.  Is eiseaml&aacute;ir de chur chuige mar seo &eacute; st&aacute;das sainithe laistigh den Aontas Eorpach.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, a task force of MEPs from throughout Europe visited Ireland at the invitation of my colleagues, MEPs Mr. Matt Carty and Ms Martina Anderson.  They saw at first hand the hugely negative impact Brexit would have on Ireland, particularly but not exclusively on the Border counties.  They met business, civic, agriculture and other sectors, elected representatives North and South and local communities.  They clearly acknowledged the need for the North to secure designated status in the EU.  Special status in the European Union is a solution that will allow for the economic prosperity, trade relations and jobs on the entire island to be protected and enhanced together.  Despite the talk of no return to the borders of the past, it is obvious that Brexit will see the imposition of a hard economic border on the island of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has a huge responsibility to defend the Good Friday Agreement and ensure the frontier between the European Union and Britain is not on this island.  Brexit threatens to tear asunder the Good Friday Agreement.  The British Government has already committed to scrapping the Human Rights Act and ending the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and the European Convention on Human Rights.  In her letter to the European Council president, Donald Tusk, British Prime Minister, Theresa May, referenced the peace process.  She spoke about the need to uphold the Good Friday Agreement, but it is the British Government's refusal to implement past agreements which has contributed significantly to the current political crisis in the North's institutions.<\/p>  <p>  The challenge posed by Brexit must be met with the intensity, urgency and vision that is demanded of this time in our history.  This requires a seismic step change from the Irish Government.  The Taoiseach must realise, and I think he has yet to realise it, that he has to stand up for the national interests of the people of the entire island of Ireland and that people have an expectation that he should do this.  He has a responsibility to articulate and uphold the rights of citizens in the North.  They voted to remain.  The Government cannot gainsay this vote.<\/p>  <p>  We also want to see the Government publish as a matter of urgency its own negotiating position so it can be debated in the D&aacute;il.  If the island of Ireland is to avoid a serious economic crisis arising from Brexit this response must be based on a comprehensive negotiation strategy with clear national objectives to protect citizens, workers and key sectors throughout the island.  This means the Government working meaningfully with all political parties and all stakeholders, something they have failed to do thus far.  Most importantly, this means the Irish Government must formally adopt the negotiating policy position of designated special status for the North.<\/p>  <p>  Sometimes I cannot hear myself talking because of the back feed from what is obviously a very interesting conversation between the Taoiseach and his colleagues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400039#MM00200","speaker":"1330"},{"type":"speech","time":1491330300,"counter":539,"content":"<p>Actually, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, was saying Sinn F&eacute;in has voted against nine referenda on European issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400039#MM00300","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1491330300,"counter":540,"content":"<p>And we were right to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400039#MM00400","speaker":"1330"},{"type":"speech","time":1491330300,"counter":541,"content":"<p>So why do you want to be in it then?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400039#MM00500","speaker":"1267"},{"type":"speech","time":1491330300,"counter":542,"content":"<p>Of course, yes.

The reason it has failed to do so is it wants to be diplomatically in tune with the fact the Northern state at this point remains part of the British state.  The Government dances around all of this, whereas what our Government needs to do is what they British Government does really well, which is stand up for the national interest, meaning the interests of the people of the entire island of Ireland.

They were a bit mesmerised by what the British were going to do and used many meaningless phrases and sound bites.  The British Government - the English Government - does not give any attention to, or care for, either the people of Scotland or the people of Ireland, specifically the people of the North of Ireland.  What we and our Taoiseach need to do is to take the proposition of a special designated status for the North within the EU and promote and actively advocate for that.  That is the way to protect the economies and communities of the island and to minimise the disruption Brexit will cause.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400039#MM01500","speaker":"1330","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491330900,"counter":553,"content":"<p>With the formal Brexit process now under way, and no certainty on what the outcome will be, Ireland clearly faces years of uncertainty.  The exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union will, as I said previously, present this country and island with the greatest social, economic and diplomatic challenges it has faced since the Emergency.  For some time, I have been calling for special recognition of the unique challenges faced by Ireland in the negotiating mandate from Mr. Donald Tusk and the European Council.  I want to acknowledge the success of the Government's efforts so far on that aspect of the process.  Major diplomatic work went in to securing it and I acknowledge that hard work.  However, it appears that Spain has also used the framing of the mandate to table political points against the United Kingdom.  This is the first of many hurdles we will face, some of which we have not yet become aware of.<\/p>  <p>  From securing the approval of the European Parliament to ensuring Spain will sign off on any ultimate free trade agreement, there is so much that we do not know yet and so much that is outside our control.  However, there are some actions the Government can take, through planning and through specific policy initiatives.  Last week, the Labour Party published our own Brexit document.  Throughout it, we detail the challenges we as a country will face and what we should do about it.  It outlines 20 concrete actions aimed at protecting our society, economy and our highly integrated relationship with Northern Ireland.  Every party has been talking about Brexit.  Fianna F&aacute;il went to the bother of recruiting a new Deputy, so it could appoint him as a specific spokesman on Brexit.  Only the Labour Party, so far, is proposing a tangible action plan that would protect Ireland against a hard Brexit.  We support the call made by our sister party the SDLP for special status for Northern Ireland.  We supported a resolution in this House to achieve that too.  It is an absolute requirement that the special status and circumstances of Northern Ireland be recognised throughout the negotiations from the start.<\/p>  <p>  Brexit will fundamentally alter the relationship between ourselves in this part of the island, Northern Ireland, the UK and the EU.  It will disrupt trade on the island, and could imperil the peace process.  It will impact every sector in ways that cannot yet be determined.  It will dominate public discourse for the next decade and present numerous challenges for all of us involved in politics on this island.  Many problems will be resolved as they arise, and there are practical steps Ireland can take to outline specifically what we want to achieve, and what we must secure.  Nine months on from the referendum, the Irish Government has only outlined in broad terms our objectives for the common travel area, preventing a hard Border, and protecting the peace process.  We have yet to see the detailed actions and policy priorities that Ireland wants to see implemented and secured.  The Taoiseach informed the House today that will happen before the end of the month.  At a minimum, we believe a new protocol to the EU treaties will be required to recognise the common travel area, the Good Friday Agreement, and the unique situation presented by the Irish Border.<\/p>  <p>  Europe must also adapt and we have proposed changes in the Stability and Growth Pact and fiscal rules, along with the implementation of a European pillar of social rights.  I attended a meeting of all member parties of the Party of European Socialists in Brussels last week to discuss in detail how the fiscal rules issue can be addressed.  Those rules are rigid, opaque and complex.  Worse, they stop us from making the vital investment we need right now to prepare ourselves for our future, much less what will happen after Brexit.  I raised this on Leader&rsquo;s Questions last week and I thought I got the support of the Minister for Education and Skills.  We now need to see the experience the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, have be brought to bear to bring about a change in the Stability and Growth Pact.  If the Government agrees, then those negotiations should be under way.<\/p>  <p>  We have also said that the &euro;1 billion rainy day fund must be deployed now for investment.  We need the infrastructure now.  The Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, budget must also be protected post-2020.  From an economic perspective, we have grave concerns about trade and employment.  A comprehensive EU-UK trade deal must be a priority for Ireland.  This will not happen in the next two years, however.  In the meantime, a transitional agreement will be essential to maintain our deep and most valuable trading relationship both on the island of Ireland and with our neighbour in Britain.  We have also called for a Brexit early warning system to be put in place.  Such an all-island warning system would bring together the trade union movement, employers and other stakeholders.  It would help to identify sectors and firms that are experiencing particular pressure points and are at particular risk as market conditions change, currencies fluctuate and so on.  We are also calling for state aid rules to be suspended for two years from the date of Brexit.  With this, a &euro;250 million Brexit trade adjustment fund should be set up to directly support businesses suffering from trade upheaval.<\/p>  <p>  Regional fora need to be established to help to foster and create new jobs, and to protect current ones.  These fora could work in tandem with the early warning system I have outlined in order to Brexit-proof our regions.  As the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, has dramatically illustrated, the impact of Brexit will not be uniform on the island.  There may be benefits for sub-regions like the greater Dublin area.  For some regions, like the midlands, the Border, and my own south-east region, it would be catastrophic.  The regional action plans for jobs drawn up in 2015 and 2016 are already out of date because of the new circumstances we face.  We need a full analysis of the potential and the risk to employment in our regions consequent to Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  In a worst case scenario, with a hard Border between the North and South of Ireland, an arsenal of funding must be available to support those worst affected.  It is no good to have rhetoric saying there will be a friction-free Border or no hard Border if Britain is outside not only the Single Market, but the customs union.  Some sort of border will have to exist.  Let us be practical about how to mitigate the impact.  It could be catastrophic if we do not have clear plans for it.  We should be very ambitious in what we need to do and begin to discuss it.  The current European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, EGAF, programme is now undergoing a mid-term evaluation.  Our Government needs to engage with the European Commission for the rules to change.<\/p>  <p>  We also believe that the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs should hold public hearings on the impact of Brexit.  I understand the Seanad has now set up its own Brexit committee, the Seanad Special Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, with Taoiseach&rsquo;s questions functioning largely as our main way of finding out the thinking of Government and Government strategy as we emerge down the road of Brexit.  The Oireachtas needs to speak with one voice, rather than through multiple committees.<\/p><p> We are also concerned at the prospect of the status of the English language being used as a bargaining tool or negotiating point, or even as a political football, before the final agreement is reached.  The small spat so far, although we heard one former Tory leader almost launching the gunboats, shows the potential for political point scoring on these matters.  Another colleague of his once described him as \"a creature of the night\".  Other issues, such as English remaining as a working language, are important.  The current designation of Irish as an official language also has to be protected in that regard.  The head of the European Parliament's constitutional affairs committee, Danuta H&uuml;bner, a person I worked very closely with when she was head of the regional affairs committee when we negotiated the Structural Funds during our own presidency, has warned that English might not be one of the European Union&rsquo;s official languages once the UK leaves the Union.  That might sound like rhetoric, but it is something we must have regard to and address.  To remove all doubt, the Irish Government should inform the EU that it also intends to notify English, as well as Irish, as an official EU language.  There is no prohibition on having more than one official language.  Indeed, many of our EU partner countries have more than one.  <\/p> <p>There is much to be done.  We have to act in concert and with clarity on these matters, and the Taoiseach has the support of my party in supporting Irish interests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400040#NN00200","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491331500,"counter":555,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Mick Barry.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Adams said that Theresa May does not care about the people of this island, North or South, and he is absolutely right.  Frankly, she does not care about the vast majority of people in Britain, but she certainly does not care about the people here, North or South.  She has allowed, and I suspect she will continue to allow, her cynical leaning on British jingoism, little England outlook, racism and anti-immigrant sentiment to trump any concerns about the potential adverse impacts of hard borders between the North and the South.  If that is true, and it most certainly is, Deputy Adams and all the others who rightly say we must have no hard border between North and South and that it must be resisted for all the obvious reasons are much more muted in their criticism of the European Union's role in all of this.  The European treaties were mentioned.  Why do we have no control over whether there will be a hard border between North and South?  The answer is that we signed the Lisbon treaty which ceded our rights on those matters to qualified majority voting, such that Germany and France will decide whether we have a hard border.<\/p>  <p>  While we know we have a problem with a British Government that has racist, anti-immigrant, little Englander policies, we also have a major problem with a European Union that has a fortress Europe policy and will insist on borders.  The idea that the enemy of our enemy is our friend, which has been peddled by many people in this debate, is simply not the case.  The British Government is parochial, nationalistic, racist in its immigration policy and does not care about what happens to people on this island, but so is the European Union.  Some 30,000 people have drowned in the Mediterranean because they insist on borders, and we will have to fight them and demand that there is no border, North or South.  It is their rules around state aid that will prevent us doing the sort of things that would be necessary to insulate our economy against possible adverse effects from Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  We know we have to stand up to Theresa May.  Will we stand up to the European Union and tell it that we are just not accepting a border, and that there will be instructions from the Executive in the North, if it exists, and from the Government in the South that we are not co-operating with any border posts and our officials will not man such posts?  We should just tell them both to hell with their rules, which are depriving us of our democratic right to set our own borders and to decide our relationships with others.  Similarly, we should make our own decisions about what industries and enterprises we can provide support to and aid in order to secure jobs, industry and so on.  That is the message that must go out to them if we are to deal with these issues.  <\/p>  <p>  From Brexit, Trump and the economic instability across Europe which pre-dates those things, we need to take the big lesson that we must diversify our economy urgently.  We do not need to have a strategy which equates to beggar-my-neighbour and see if we can get in some more financial services.  To exploit the instability, we need to diversify our economy and to have our own industrial enterprise base, which is indigenous and sustainable in the long term.  That is what we need, but that is not what the Government is doing.  We require a radical shift in our economic and industrial policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400041#OO00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1491331500,"counter":556,"content":"<p>Again, it is left to us on these benches to bring an explicitly left and working class perspective to the debate on the EU and Britain&rsquo;s exit.  One unfortunate aspect of the referendum campaign in Britain is that the justified working class anger at the EU on the sound grounds of its neo-liberal and anti-worker agenda did not find expression in the national debate in the UK.  Jeremy Corbyn, whose election to the leadership of the British Labour Party we welcomed and who we still wish well in the struggle against the Blairite wing of that party, made a bad mistake when he put aside his well documented reservations about the EU for the sake of inner party peace, thereby ceding the ground in the national debate to the right-wing, isolationist and xenophobic exit campaign instead of staking out the left progressive case for exit.  As a result, a rounded out understanding of the motivations behind the vote, particularly in working class areas of Britain, has been consciously obscured.  We should not forget that here too in recent EU referenda both large sections of the urban working class and the rural poor voted \"No\" to recent treaties.  The role of the EU as a driver of austerity here, in Greece and elsewhere, as well as high profile anti-worker judgments by the European Court of Justice, have fed this justified opposition.<\/p>  <p>  In the North, fear of the consequences of a bargain-basement Brexit is being used by the sectarian parties to stir up discontent and create greater sectarian division among the working class.  Although a majority in the North voted to remain in the EU, it must be noted and recognised that a majority of Catholics voted to remain and that a majority of Protestants voted to leave.  The UK leaving the EU has raised fears among Northern Irish Catholics that a hard border will be an impediment to them achieving their desire for a united Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Those living in Border communities are rightly concerned that a hard border will impede their travel back and forth to work, school and to visit family.  They are fearful that tariffs and custom posts will lead to job losses.  The UK leaving the EU raises the potential for Scottish independence and the break up of the UK, which has resulted in greater anxiety among Northern Irish Protestants about their future.  The vast majority of working class people in the North do not countenance going back to the conflicts of the past.  However, the reintroduction of custom posts and border checks would be a potential target for attack by dissident republicans leading to further instability and the possibility of a return to conflict between loyalist and republican paramilitaries.<\/p>  <p>  No one on this island, North or South, supports a hard border.  The political establishment has it within its power to stop a hard border.<\/p><p> It is time for the Taoiseach and this Government to stand up to the EU.  The post-UK exit trade deal must be agreed by all 27 EU member states and their parliaments.  The Taoiseach should send a warning to the European Commission and Theresa May that this Parliament will veto any trade deal which contains tariffs on trade between North and South.  He should tell the Commission that we will not accept a hard Border and put an end to the uncertainty which is causing widespread anxiety and which is increasing instability in Northern Ireland.  The exit of Britain from the EU and resulting trade-based conflict do pose concrete dangers to jobs in this State and the cost of living in certain areas, like energy imports.  The debate that will therefore confront us as to whether the Government will adopt an interventionist approach to save jobs and industries that will be hit, such as agri-foods, and if so what type of intervention.  We say that it is correct that the State underpin jobs but not via a mechanism of corporate welfare that will typically benefit the biggest companies, but rather through State enterprise initiatives and anti-poverty measures that will raise domestic demand for the products of industry.  Instead of this the greater part of the Government's focus seems to be the luring of financial companies from London to Dublin notwithstanding the fact that the impact, jobs-wise, in Ireland has already been demonstrated as negligible, not to mention the fact that their activities are far less socially useful than the other areas of the economy that are most under threat.<\/p> <p> These are precisely the values that will not be championed by the EU leaders or this Government but they are the values that are instinctually supported by many millions of working class people across Europe, Britain and here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400041#OO00300","speaker":"1432","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491332100,"counter":558,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Thomas P.

It is difficult to prepare for the unknown.<\/p>  <p>  I heard the Prime Minister, Theresa May's words recognising the unique relationship with the Republic and the importance of the peace process in Northern Ireland.  However, the UK electorate took an utter gamble with the Good Friday Agreement and there was a lack of thorough investigation and research into what Brexit would mean for the agreement.  Whether one agrees with the Good Friday Agreement or not it has ensured peace, ease of movement and no hard Border.  A generation of people in Northern Ireland and the Border areas have no memory of having to queue at Border crossings.  As a member of the foreign affairs committee and the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, the concerns and anxieties of Border communities and businesses are obvious in the area of agri-food, trade, education culture, sport, health care, transport and retail, not to mention the implications for North-South bodies.  While the Good Friday Agreement is recognised internationally and we hear that there will be no return to a hard Border and there will be respect for freedom of movement and the common travel area, there are no guarantees.  That raises concerns because if one leaves an organisation or club one cannot expect to enjoy the same benefits or advantages as when one was a member.  Everything is amicable at the moment but Ireland cannot get caught in the crossfire between the EU and the UK.<\/p>  <p>  There are unresovled issues from the Good Friday Agreement and there is a real danger they will continue to be left unresolved.  I refer to issues relating to flags and parades, legacy issues such as the continuing wait for information on the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, and prisoner issues.  These are very serious and continue to deteriorate.  Licences are still being revoked, with Tony Taylor being the most recent case.  He has been over a year in Maghaberry and he has a date in May for a parole commissioners' hearing, which may happen but is more likely to be cancelled.  The stock-take agreement and the work of the International Red Cross in the prison are being ignored and my fear is that, with Brexit, these human rights issues are going to move further down the scale of importance.<\/p>  <p>  Theresa May spoke of the responsibility to ensure nothing was done to jeopardise the peace process but some issues are jeopardising the process and they are likely to be ignored or treated in a high-handed, authoritarian way because we know how fragile peace is.  I was very struck by the evidence of a witness from the University of Ulster who was before the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement recently.  He had evidence from divided societies everywhere and the conclusion was that the implications of Brexit for identity and cultural issues may be more significant and potentially more dangerous in the long term than the specific economic consequences.  His point was that uncertainty about identity and political issues can rapidly escalate into direct confrontation.  We need to look at the potential implications for reconciliation and the need for a specific strand to deal with the protection of the Good Friday Agreement.  I do not believe for one minute that there is any comparison between Northern Ireland and Gibraltar.<\/p>  <p>  I am involved in official development assistance and am concerned about the implications for that of Britain leaving the EU.  The UK has been a major contributor to the EU's development budget and had a role in formulating development policy.  Its eligible share of the general budget was &euro;1.23 billion, out of &euro;9 billion in ODA spending, and its share of the off-budget development fund from 2014 to 2020 was &euro;4.48 billion, which will be a significant loss financially and from the point of view of policy.  We need to look at the implications for developing countries of financial regulation and taxation practices because Brexit could bring about changes to tax and regulation which have to be examined.  There is a real danger that the work of Irish Aid will be undermined.  If international business and finance firms relocate to Ireland we have to look at them in terms of tax transparency because we need to reaffirm our commitment to country-by-country reporting and a public register of beneficial ownership.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, we raised the question of where Britain stood on the European Convention on Human Rights and were assured by British politicians that Britain would not be withdrawing from it.  We have met groups who say there is great potential for Ireland from Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400042#PP00200","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speech","time":1491332100,"counter":559,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach referred to the EU negotiating guidelines and to how the negotiations would proceed.  Ireland needs direct representation at those negotiations because the sad Brexit decision by the UK is so significant for us.  The Taoiseach said negotiations will take place under Michel Barnier and his team, who will report back to councils, but they will not necessarily be responsive enough to the minutiae of negotiations.  Our vital national interests are at stake.  Countries on the other side of Europe, such as Slovakia and Slovenia, have fundamentally different interests from ours.  It is on the line for us as this is the most serious thing to have happened to us since the Second World War so it is not enough to be one of 27, as the Taoiseach suggested.<\/p>  <p>  The team comprises Michel Barnier, chief negotiator, President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, Jean-Claude Juncker from the Commission and Guy Verhofstadt, leader of the alliance of liberals and democrats.  One would wonder how, despite the balmy words of President Tusk, those officials will ensure that Ireland's interests are fundamentally protected when the chips are down.  Guy Verhofstadt, for example, is a very strong federalist and an advocate of ever closer union - the kind of point of view that ensured the UK would have a referendum in the first place.  Jean-Claude Juncker is associated in this country with the LuxLeaks scandal and President Tusk's own Government wanted to recall him so I am not sure I have that much confidence in them.  We have clear evidence that the North-South issues have been accepted at European level.  The common travel area has to be maintained because we cannot have the Border back in our country.  The president of Sinn F&eacute;in argued earlier that all of Ireland must stay in the European Union and I am very sympathetic to that viewpoint.<\/p><p>We do not seem to have got across sufficiently the east-west aspect of these negotiations.  I give credit to the Government for the reflections we have seen in the letter of the British Prime Minister, Mrs. May, and also in the response from the European Commission of the importance of Ireland's interest being protected.  I give credit to the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, and his colleagues for having achieved that.  I also give credit to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and our diplomats.<\/p> <p> The nature of our interaction with the island across from us is profound in trade, industry and culture.  My colleagues referred to culture and sport.  We operate as one area in so many respects.  Some 40% of all flights from Dublin Airport are to London, one of the busiest routes in Europe and the world.  We have massive agrifood exports to the UK and massive energy connections.  We have very fundamental east-west connections.  If we ended up with a hard Brexit, we would be facing a total disaster and whichever Government might be responsible to this House would have desperate situation to try to pursue.<\/p> <p> We need to ensure that a free-trade area is agreed with the UK enabling us to operate as close as possible to the way we operate at present.  That has to be our ambition.  We need a much more vigorous approach than what the Taoiseach seemed to outline this evening.  I feel we should have direct representation.<\/p> <p> This has been spoken about as if it was a divorce between people - make the settlement first and then deal with the future.  We need to deal with all aspects at the one time.  I note that President Tusk seems to be changing his tune on that and has accepted that when issues such as UK payments to the EU and so on are being progressed, there will be fundamental discussion then on the free trade area.  These are the most critical issues any Irish Government has faced since the 1940s.  I ask the Minister to bear those points in mind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400042#PP00300","speaker":"1361","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1491332700,"counter":561,"content":"<p>I now call Deputy Fitzmaurice, who is sharing time with Deputy Danny Healy-Rae.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400043#QQ00200","nonspeaker":"Acting Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1491332700,"counter":562,"content":"<p>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this debate.  The Europe we joined years ago - many people were in favour of it - was the European Economic Community, EEC.  A community in anybody's eyes is a good thing.  However, over the years it has changed considerably, some of it good, but an awful lot of it has intruded on the lives of people in different countries.  People wonder why the Brits voted to get out.  They did so because the ordinary person on the ground is fed up with the rules, regulations and red tape that come from Europe.<\/p>  <p>  It is good that Northern Ireland has been recognised in the document we have seen in the past week on the negotiating position.  It is vital that the peace process is kept going.  However, we were found wanting in one area.  Spain operated like a super-sub coming on at the end to win the game.  It jumped in at the last minute and got a veto on Gibraltar, which was a masterstroke.  Regardless of what position papers are in place at the moment, if we believe in democracy, the Irish people in one of the most important decisions of our lives deserve a referendum on this.  If this goes pear-shaped, it will have serious consequences for us.<\/p>  <p>  I am concerned that if there is no agreement, we will end up with a hard border.  Britain can relax regulations, red tape and all that, and it will put British businesses at an advantage compared with Irish businesses.  Not having an agreement would have massive consequences for the beef, dairy industry and sheep industries in this country.  To put it bluntly, Britain needs our food and we need the British to buy it.  If we end up with a hard border, farming in Ireland will be demolished.  Ireland will have to face hard questions.  Everybody knows London is no more than one day away from a shortage of food and Britain is a net importer of agricultural products.  Agriculture is vital to people throughout this country.<\/p>  <p>  The movement of people over and back has to be recognised irrespective of whether the Europeans like it.  The British have talked about this.  We should look at Gibraltar, Jersey and northern Cyprus.  There can be one section of a country - let us say for the sake of argument Northern Ireland - that does not have to be in the European Union and it should be allowed to trade.  This is bread-and-butter stuff for us.  Many Irish people, especially those from the west of Ireland where I come from, went to Britain and got good work.  They have come home and set up in Ireland after a while.  Tourism is also ferociously important to this country.<\/p>  <p>  We are like the hurler on the ditch; we are watching the game but we do not know who is playing.  There is a guy called Barnier on one side of the table.  The talk at the moment is lovely.  Everyone is talking about the Border and everyone is talking about Ireland.  However, at the end of the day, they will think about the 27.  The Taoiseach should go out there and announce to them that we will hold a referendum on this decision even if it puts their noses out of joint.  I think the Irish people should have a referendum.  If a hard border comes about and we lose the free travel area, and if there are tariffs on our produce, then we are entitled on a referendum to decide what we will do as a nation.  We cannot afford to lose the 40% of our agricultural exports that go to Britain.  I urge the Taoiseach to do this in the interests of democracy.  Europeans might have a lot of unelected representatives doing things for them, but if we believe in democracy, we will give that opportunity to our people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400043#QQ00300","speaker":"1341"},{"type":"speech","time":1491332700,"counter":563,"content":"<p>I am glad to get the opportunity to talk on this very serious and important matter facing our country.  At a presentation in Buswells, IBEC informed us this will seriously affect the regions, as it calls them - I call them rural areas and the farming community - but it may not affect areas around Dublin as much.  As Deputy Fitzmaurice said, I do not know how we can avoid a hard border, but I hope we can.<\/p>  <p>  We need our best team to take into account all the ways farmers will be affected if we do not maintain the markets we have had up to now, or at least to maintain most of them.  The farming industry is at a crossroads.  It will be very hard to maintain farming as we know it where farmers were proud to hand down the farm to their offspring and for them to continue to do the same.  There will be a burden on their shoulders to do just that.  They need every support.  We need to maintain trade with the UK.<\/p><p> As other Deputies stated, we will be severely affected if we have a hard border and cannot maintain the free travel area.  I do not know how it will be achieved.  We talk about Gibraltar and other places but will Europe and England listen?  The English people voted to protect their borders.  Given that Ireland is open to Europe, will we have people coming here to try to access Great Britain by crossing over the Border?  There are many challenges to be dealt with and much work needs to be done.  I am asking that our best team goes out and puts its best foot forward to ensure our interests are protected as much as possible in the upcoming talks.<\/p> <p> This evening we had a presentation from fishermen.  They say that if the UK takes back its waters, European fishermen such as the Spaniards will impinge more on our waters and further abuse the ability of our fishermen to survive in places such as Castletownbere, Killybegs in County Donegal and off the Dingle coast.  Those people will have a much harder time if this happens.<\/p> <p> An awful lot is involved and much is at stake for our country.  As I stated, we are at a crossroads.  Farmers are worried that we will lose the UK market.  If the UK starts buying food or produce from other countries, farmers' ability to stay on the land will be eroded and rural areas that are struggling to survive will be further decimated.  We cannot highlight enough the way farmers and those in rural communities will be hit.  As it is, places are very badly hit.  Down around the Ring of Kerry, many of the local parishes cannot field a team.  They have to amalgamate to put a team out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400043#QQ00400","speaker":"1320","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491333300,"counter":565,"content":"<p>Will the Deputy conclude, please?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400044#RR00200","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speech","time":1491333300,"counter":566,"content":"<p>We are told that the Taoiseach is respected in European circles.

In a sense, in that moment it became clear that the UK intended to leave and that our entire union was being undermined.  It was a bad day for everyone in Europe as it means a diminished Europe and a diminished relationship between us and our nearest neighbour, with whom we have built up a very good relationship in recent years.  That the UK decided to leave our union and take a different course was a day of sadness.<\/p>  <p>  In my mind, it is not necessarily conclusive.  There is still political opposition in the UK from the likes of my Green Party colleague, Caroline Lucas, as well as Nick Clegg and others who seem willing to say, \"No, we do not agree with this and think it a fundamental mistake\" and are looking to see what ways it might be averted.  My colleague, Steven Agnew, has joined with others in the UK and Green Party leaders in the European Parliament to test here whether Article 50 is revocable.  It is being taken here in order to be able to get to a European court to make a quick decision should that become a viable or desired outcome.  I support their case.  We are not taking the case ourselves because it has to come from outside the jurisdiction but we support the application as one of the ways available to fight the worst adverse effects of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  We are examining it because it has become obvious since the referendum almost ten months ago that what is being delivered is a much harder Brexit than anything that might have been expected or articulated during the referendum campaign.  A certain section of the Tory Party and UKIP seem to have control of the narrative and the political impetus in the United Kingdom since the referendum.  They have steered their Government in a way that rules out the Single Market and effectively rules out, it seems, the customs union, although that is not as conclusive, rules out the Court of Justice of the European Union as an arbitration court and articulates the view that no deal is better than a bad deal.  It is becoming increasingly clear the longer the process goes on that no deal would, in effect, be a terrible deal.  We all have to try to avoid that because a terrible deal for the UK would also be a terrible deal for Ireland.  We would be affected by the downturn in their economy that would happen and in terms of the relationships on this island, North and South.  Across the board, it would be hugely detrimental to our long-term interests.  Therefore, we have a particular obligation to try to avoid that no-deal scenario.<\/p>  <p>  We are in a sense in opposition.  It seems to me that those 70 or so Tory MPs, who seem to be driven by the idea of empires lost and national fervour around independence, are willing to go that no-deal route.  It seems they would be happy to end up with a crash in the negotiations that are about to take place and exit the European Union in a manner that would be deeply damaging.  We must avoid that outcome.  There are also those in Europe, on the other side of the negotiating table, who might similarly think that this is a good way of giving a punitive lesson and teaching the UK a thing or two.  We have to avoid their desired outcome.  We can and should play a conciliatory, intermediary and positive role in the negotiations to try to avoid those outcomes. <\/p>  <p>  What might that mean?  What might our negotiations strategy be?  In the coming weeks, before the European Union's negotiating position is absolutely finalised in the end of April or early May, I hope that the Government seeks to start discussions around some of the transitional or other arrangements that would follow on from the final completion of the Article 50 exit process.  The Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, made a statement during a debate last week that has been proven true in terms of what President Tusk stated, which is that the European Union wants a lag of three to nine months, or whatever it is, between any discussions about future arrangements before we have the discussion around what the Brexit exit Bill might be and how UK and EU citizens might be treated in different jurisdictions.  He wants, as it were, the divorce arrangements first.<\/p>  <p>  I understand in some ways how that might be a negotiating position to test the water in terms of how the negotiation process might proceed.  However, I think it is a mistake.  We should be willing to take the initiative and explicitly say not to start this with all the hard ball stuff and the difficult stuff.  For instance, how will we make the issue about how much of a bill is to be paid legally verifiable?  Who will be the final arbiter of the bill or how it can be legally tied down?  That issue is not the most important issue to get right and to debate.  There will be some transitional arrangements and the UK will have to pay costs and certain pensions and there will be many other arrangements.  However, it is not the fundamental issue at stake and should not be allowed to be come a stumbling block.<\/p>  <p>  We see this week with the issue around Gibraltar and the threat of military support being withdrawn how quickly this can be steered into a direction of negativity and adversarial conflict.  That is not in our interests.  It is in our interests to highlight some of the issues where we will need co-operation come what may.  I will give a few examples of what those transitional arrangements might be.  We are right to put the relationship on this island first and foremost in the debate on how UK and EU citizens will be treated in corresponding jurisdictions.<\/p><p>We should be upfront and quick in sorting out the issue of a common travel area on this island as well as east-west travel arrangements between Ireland and Britain.  We must also address the rights of European citizens in the North because their ability to work in the South may be a complicated issue.  While travel will not be restricted, restrictions may apply in respect of employment and so forth.  The island of Ireland could be used as a test case for addressing some of these issues. <\/p> <p> I was fortunate to visit Brussels two weeks ago to attend a major conference on the development of an energy union.  It is becoming increasingly obvious that energy co-operation will be essential to the economic interests of the United Kingdom, regardless of the outcome of the Brexit negotiations.  The UK recently completed a modelling exercise on its future energy mix in a low carbon world, which we must all move towards.  Included in the exercise was a ramping up of its strategy to achieve much greater interconnection.  Notwithstanding Brexit, Britain is planning to provide approximately 12 GW of additional capacity of electricity capacity between the UK and the rest of Europe by 2035.  Market rules and jurisdictional arrangements are needed should a conflict or dispute arise.  It is in everyone's interests, including those of the rest of Europe, to get this interconnection right.  We need to share and balance energy, achieve security of gas supplies and adopt common standards to be adhered to should a pollution incident arise in the Irish Sea, for example, from Sellafield.  We also have the whole EURATOM issue.  We need to get agreement on all these issues very quickly.  There is no reason to wait for divorce arrangements to be agreed between the UK and EU before starting negotiations on these issues.  Starting negotiations now would be a better European strategy that would wrong-foot the hard-line Brexiteers by focusing on some of the good outcomes co-operation would deliver.  This would change the nature of the negotiation strategy. <\/p> <p> My advice to the Taoiseach and his officials in advance of the European Council meeting is that he should state to Michel Barnier, his officials and the European Parliament that we should not wait for six or nine months but start now to create a safe space for discussions on these matters and numerous other areas.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, for example, faces significant issues on migration which need to be addressed.  Why wait or delay?  Let us get involved in negotiations now.  It would help us to shape our priorities if we played on a European pitch in this way, rather than concentrating only on our national effort. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400044#RR00500","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Bail (Amendment) Bill 2016: Instruction to Committee","time":1491333900,"counter":570,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400045#SS00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1491333900,"counter":571,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That, pursuant to Standing Order 200, Standing Order 154 is modified to provide that it be an instruction to the Select Committee on Justice and Equality that it has power to make provision in the Bail (Amendment) Bill 2016 in relation to:(<i>a<\/i>) the Criminal Justice Act 1984, Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996, Criminal Justice Act 2007 and Criminal Justice Act 2011, of a technical and drafting nature, to update cross references within the Acts; and<br \/><br \/>(<i>b<\/i>) the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 for detention and release arrangements where an arrested person is intoxicated to such an extent as would give rise to a reasonable apprehension that the person might be a danger to self or others; and to change the title of the Bill and make other consequential amendments required to take account of the changes above.<\/blockquote><p>The additional provisions to be included in the Bail (Amendment) Bill concern an amendment to the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 to allow the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to detain intoxicated persons who have been arrested and who are in custody in Garda stations where those persons would be a danger to themselves or others if released, and a technical amendment to be made to apply section 5A - questioning of persons detained under section 4 not generally permitted pending access to legal advice - of the Criminal Justice Act 1984, as inserted by section 9(a) of the Criminal Justice Act 2011, to the detention provisions of three statutes, namely, the Offences against the State Act 1939, Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996 and Criminal Justice Act 2007.<\/p><p>With regard to the proposed amendment to the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, the new provision concerns detention of intoxicated persons in Garda stations in circumstances where those persons, if released, would be a danger to themselves or others.  The Garda Commissioner has requested that consideration be given to making statutory provision for such detention.  It will allow the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to detain intoxicated persons who have been arrested for public order offences under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act and who, but for this new provision, would be released.  Such persons can be detained for a period not exceeding six hours where the member in charge of the Garda station in which they are in custody is of the opinion that they are intoxicated to such an extent as to be considered a danger to themselves or to other persons if released.<\/p><p>To date, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has relied on a presumed common law duty of care to intoxicated persons to justify such detention.  However, this practice has no statutory basis and the amendment to the Public Order Act will provide for such a statutory basis.  I stress that the new provision concerns dangerously intoxicated persons, persons who have been arrested for public order offences under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act and who, but for this new provision, would normally be released.  The definition of &quot;intoxicated&quot; in the Act is not limited to intoxication due to alcohol consumption but is defined in the Act as including drugs, solvents or other substance or a combination of substances.<\/p><p>This new provision will apply where a person would normally have been released, for example, on &quot;station bail&quot; in accordance with section 31 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1967 or section 68 of the Children Act 2001, but where the member in charge believes that the person is so intoxicated as to be a danger both to himself or herself and to others, if released.  The provision also provides for release prior to the expiration of the six-hour detention period.  This will ensure a person will be released once he or she is no longer considered a danger to himself, herself or others.  A similar provision is contained in section 16 of the Road Traffic Act 2010.<\/p><p>With regard to the technical amendments, these concern the application of a new provision dealing with detention, namely, section 5A of the Criminal Justice Act 1984, as inserted by section 9(a) of the Criminal Justice Act 2011, to the detention provisions of the three statutes mentioned, namely, the Offences against the State Act 1939, Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996 and Criminal Justice Act 2007.  Section 5A concerns the well established right of a person in Garda custody to access legal advice and is aimed at clarifying the circumstances in which questioning may proceed, notwithstanding that a suspect has not yet had an opportunity to consult a solicitor.<\/p><p>It is an established policy principle that relevant provisions of the 1984 Act relating to detentions made under section 4 of that Act should also apply to detentions made under the three criminal justice statutes mentioned.  This means the new section 5A, which has not yet been commenced, will have to be applied to these three statutes.  Sections 9(b), (13) and (14) of the Criminal Justice Act 2011 apply the new section 5A of the 1984 Act to the three statutes in question.  However, difficulties have arisen from the fact that both the Criminal Justice Act 2011 and Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act 2014, known as the DNA Act, amend the same provisions of the three statutes in question and while the amendments contained in the 2014 DNA Act have already been commenced those of the 2011 Act have not.  The question of whether provisions which have been amended by a 2014 Act could subsequently be amended by a 2011 Act, in other words, whether the 2011 Act could &quot;trump&quot; the 2014 Act, has been considered.  The fact that the provisions of the 2011 Act do not take account of some reformatting of the provisions by the 2014 Act has also given rise to uncertainty as to what will be the final outcome of the amended detention provisions.  The Office of the Attorney General has advised that the most prudent way to clarify the matter is to draw up new provisions providing for the application of section 5A to the detention provisions of the three statutes in question and to repeal the existing application provisions of the 2011 Act.<\/p><p>As the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality is anxious that these provisions should be commenced sooner rather than later, she has decided to include the amendments in the Bail (Amendment) Bill, which is currently before the Houses.  Members may recall that she indicated her intention to proceed on this basis during her Second Stage speech on 8 February 2017.  The T&aacute;naiste has been advised that this will necessitate changes to both the Short Title and Long Title of the Bill which, following agreement of the amendments on Committee Stage, would become the Criminal Justice Act 2017.  I commend the motion to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400045#SS00300","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1491333900,"counter":572,"content":"<p>We must adjourn the discussion at 8 p.m.  However, if Deputy Jim O'Callaghan wishes to make a brief contribution, he may do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400045#SS00400","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speech","time":1491333900,"counter":573,"content":"<p>I suspect I will need to speak again when the debate resumes after Private Members' business.<\/p><p>It is unsatisfactory that the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, which is due to meet tomorrow morning, is this evening being asked to deal with amendments to important legislation.

It is clear that when garda&iacute; are taking into Garda stations individuals who are very intoxicated and a threat to themselves and others they do so not without the protection of any particular law but because of an <i>&agrave;<\/i><b><i><\/i><\/b><i>la carte<\/i>system that appears to have operated over the years. <\/p><p>The Government should explain the reason this motion has been introduced with such urgency.  While I am happy to deal with the matter, I wish to record my party's dissatisfaction in regard to this particular issue.  We will deal with the substance of the matter tomorrow.  My party will not oppose the motion as we are trying to have this matter dealt with promptly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400045#SS00500","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1491333900,"counter":574,"content":"<p>We must adjourn the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400045#SS00600","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speech","time":1491333900,"counter":575,"content":"<p>On a point of order-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400045#SS00700","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speech","time":1491333900,"counter":576,"content":"<p>I am adhering to the rules of the House.

We all agree that the greatest asset the Defence Forces have is their personnel - the men and women of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann who serve the country with distinction - yet the Defence Forces are facing huge difficulties retaining and recruiting sufficient personnel.  The organisation is seriously below strength and it is way past time the process of rebuilding began.  We have reached a crisis point with critical staffing shortages across all arms of the organisation.  The decline in numbers in recent years has left the force with just 9,070 personnel, some 430 below the current agreed strength.  Even though a new recruitment campaign was launched last year, in the year up to February 2017, the numbers in the Defence Forces fell yet again.  Fianna F&aacute;il believes we should look to increase the force's strength to 10,500 in the coming year but we also believe it is just as important to retain what we have.<\/p><p>This question of why we need the Defence Forces is commonly asked but often poorly responded to.  To be a sovereign state with a functioning democracy, we need to have a properly resourced Defence Forces with appropriate capabilities.  We take for granted that the Defence Forces are loyal to the State and protect the Republic and our democracy.  It may seem trivial to say but other jurisdictions around the globe do not enjoy such a scenario.  The Defence Forces provide many vital services, often quietly and with little or no fanfare.  They just get on with their job and we take for granted that we have their protection and their loyalty as a state.<\/p><p>The Defence Forces provide aid to the civil power, assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when required, work with the Irish Prison Service, respond to bomb threats in the State, assist with flood relief, respond to national emergencies, provide air ambulance transfers for transplant patients, and assist with search and rescue, as was recently done off the coast of County Mayo, all the while fulfilling the State's obligations to the protection of peace and security internationally through UN mandated missions.  All these are vital services that citizens expect to be available when called upon.  No one is seeking a gold plated Defence Forces but we expect an adequately resourced organisation that can respond to basic needs of citizens.  Given the critical staffing shortages currently being experienced, do the Defence Forces have the ability to respond to the needs of citizens and the State?  Where now stands the security of the State given we are seriously lacking in sufficient manpower across the Army, the Naval Service and Air Corps?<\/p><p>The State's defence policy, its implementation and resourcing of the Defence Forces must be appropriate.  Fianna F&aacute;il is committed to a defence policy that is measured, fit for purpose, and appropriately resourced.  The Defence Forces have been an easy target for cost cutting.  Their unreserved loyalty and professionalism are perhaps often taken advantage of.  Policy has become a matter of fitting the Defence Forces into a particular budget envelope.  That is not policy-making but an emasculation of the organisation by stealth.  Defence expenditure last year was just 0.55% of GDP.  Given the EU average is 1.2%, this represents extremely low defence spending by any standard.  With the Defence Forces being reorganised eight times since 1992, there has been considerable upheaval, which has taken its toll.  Consistent underfunding and poor pay and conditions for serving men and women have led to a consistent and ever-escalating loss of experienced personnel.  We are haemorrhaging key highly skilled personnel at such an alarming rate that I cannot understand the Government's <i>laissez-faire<\/i>attitude to the situation.  What will it take for it to react and implement a meaningful retention policy?<\/p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il has consistently highlighted that the departure of many personnel could affect our Defence Forces' operations and capabilities.  That is happening and it has been a clear concern for me as spokesperson for defence since taking up my position only a year ago.  I have consistently questioned Government on this issue and, to date, I have not seen an improvement; in fact, the numbers keep dwindling.  Does the Government not realise that just over 9,000 members is too low for the PDF?  The current agreed strength is 9,500 and at this stage it would be progress to reach that level, but we are fast losing hope that the Government has any intention of attaining this figure.  This is hardly acceptable for a force that acts as a guarantor of State sovereignty.<\/p><p>There has been a 15% reduction in officer numbers since 2012 and that is set to worsen if an adequate retention plan is not put in place immediately.  It has been reported that last year, 76 officers left the Defence Forces early - a rate which is simply unsustainable.  Representative organisations say they have attempted to engage with management to have their concerns addressed but with little success.  The Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, has warned that the military is critically short of specialist officers, including pilots, aeronautical engineers, and bomb disposal experts, and that a contributing factor to this brain drain has been the Department's refusal to honour conditions of service.  The bomb disposal service is at half its officer strength and I have been informed that the Army cannot conduct live firing training in Kilworth camp due to a lack of corporals.  I am sure the Minister of State will agree that this is astonishing.  He will appreciate that this type of training is as close to real life combat as a soldier can get and is vital training for anyone who is to be deployed overseas.  I assume the Government has been made aware of this.  What does it intend to do about it?<\/p><p>The recent irish Coast Guard tragedy led to renewed scrutiny of Air Corps capabilities.  The Air Corps has been significantly short staffed in its aeronautical engineering department and has only 70% of pilots currently needed.  The Air Corps has 211 vacancies and it has been maintained by the Government that the 28 cadets in training, eight of whom are due to graduate later this year, is somehow adequate.  The Government will be a long time filling 211 vacancies.  Not one of these eight trainees will be qualified to even act as co-pilot of a helicopter or fixed-wing CASA in an Air Corps operational wing until the summer of 2019 at the earliest.  A service commitment scheme in respect of Air Corps pilots was in operation until 2010.  This gave pilots a &euro;20,000 payment in return for a three to five-year commitment to remain in the corps.  It did not bring the salary up to private sector level but it proved sufficient to retain people.  This scheme must be reinstated immediately.  Given it costs &euro;1.5 million to train a pilot, the scheme would save the State money and retain key capabilities.  How has the Minister of State allowed this to get to this stage?<\/p><p>The 2012 restructuring of the Defence Forces continues to generate controversy.  The organisation provides a contingency capability for the State across a wide spectrum of operational areas on land, at sea and in the air.  The requirement to increase the size of the Defence Forces rapidly in times of national or international emergency and having decreased manning levels in times of less need are essential to that contingency.  Maintaining the formation structures to facilitate such expansion is a centuries-old prudent policy.  In this light, we cannot ignore the challenges that Brexit might bring and there needs to be proper contingency planning in respect of the Defence Forces.  We should not be reactionary and wait for a problem to present itself before we consider what we might do.  We should do what we can now to plan ahead.<\/p><p>I hope we never see a border in this country again but we cannot ignore the possibility.  We need Defence Forces that can respond to such a situation.  This will likely involve the redeployment of personnel to different locations.  The re-establishment of the 4th Western Brigade and an increase in numbers up to 10,500 would certainly be a prudent measure in the short term as we prepare for this potential border.  The House should also consider that there has been an additional cost in the loss of the Western Brigade.  Troops from Dundalk, Athlone and Donegal carry out routine security duties in Dublin with associated fuel costs, wear and tear on vehicles, increased requirement for vehicle servicing, along with many other costs.  There is no doubt, having spoken to members of the Defence Forces, that this reorganisation and the loss of the three-brigade structure has caused hardship for soldiers, with increased travel, poorer work-life balance and less certainty around location.  These have all contributed to a decrease in morale across the ranks.<\/p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il has called for the three-brigade structure to be restored.  The move to a two-brigade structure was ill-advised and ignored long-standing organisational linkages and histories.  The savings which accrued were minimal and did not deliver appreciable benefits.  <\/p> <p> We must also address the matter of defence at the Cabinet.  In tabling the motion Fianna F&aacute;il is acting on its belief that the Defence Forces are of critical importance to both the State and society.  Sadly, it has not always been clear since 2011 that Governments have sufficiently valued the Defence Forces organisation.  The decision in March 2011 to assign the defence portfolio as a subsidiary role to the Minister for Justice and Equality indicated an essential lack of respect for the position.  While it was not unreasonable to assign it with another Cabinet portfolio, to do so with the Department of Justice and Equality, one of the busiest Departments, was a retrograde step.  We must commit to the restoration of defence as a lead portfolio in the Cabinet.  The Minister with day-to-day responsibility for defence policy should be a fully fledged Cabinet Minister, not a Minister of State, as is the case.  This would be a very clear affirmation of the value the State must place on the Defence Forces.  Overall, the intention of the motion is to convey the respect of the House to the Defence Forces, to recognise the extraordinary contribution every man and woman in the service give to the State, to acknowledge the very difficult period the organisation has gone through in recent years in terms of cuts and reorganisation and to say we hear the concerns of every serving man and woman serving in the Defence Forces and that are committed to addressing these concerns and ensuring the lot of each serving member is improved.  We cannot ignore the critical situation in which we find ourselves and the fact that this and the previous Government have allowed us to get to a stage where there is now a critical staffing shortage across every organisation of the Defence Forces.  The retention policy must be key.  That is why Fianna F&aacute;il is putting the motion to the House in the hope it will generate cross-party support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400046#TT00200","speaker":"1336","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491335100,"counter":583,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for giving us the opportunity to make a number of points on this issue.  I also thank our lead spokesperson, Deputy Lisa Chambers, for sharing time.  <\/p>  <p>  Shutting down the 4th Western Brigade was a retrograde step.  Now 45% of duties carried out in Dublin are carried out by troops from Finner Camp in County Donegal, just north of Sligo, and from Dundalk.  That involves personnel in places like Sligo where many Army personnel live getting up in the morning, driving to Finner Camp, collecting their gear, driving all the way to Dublin to carry out their duties and then returning again.  It defies logic.  Much more than that, as we, rightly, obsess here about the impact of a hard border as a result of Brexit, we have neglected the fact that as a result of the closing down of the 4th Western Brigade, the Government, the State and the Oireachtas have lost all corporate knowledge of the Border.  The personnel based on it were always the eyes and ears of the nation and carried back the necessary information to us.  There is obviously a difficult situation in the North and potential issues arise as a result of Brexit.  As Deputy Lisa Chambers outlined, it defied logic, therefore, to shut down the brigade.  The two-brigade system has not resulted in real savings but taken fundamentally from the capabilities of the State.  We have the ridiculous situation where 45% of duties in Dublin are carried out by troops from the parts of the country I mentioned.<\/p>  <p>  I will make a point about the many thousands who served on the Border during the years.  Many medals have been handed out in the past year, rightly, to various people who were deserving of them.  Everybody who served on the Border should be entitled to receive a Border service medal on the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Rising.  I would like the Minister of State to consider and respond to this suggestion.  I am sure it would not cost very much, but its value in terms of the State's acknowledgement of the incredible service given by Army families throughout the entire nation who served on the Border would certainly be priceless.    <\/p>  <p>  The Air Corps was mentioned briefly by my colleague.  I have a concern about value for money.  It costs about &euro;60 million to run the Air Corps annually, including payroll costs.  The CHC is costing us &euro;52 million a year for the lease of five aircraft.  In effect, there are two overheads.  A thorough independent audit should be conducted of the value for money achieved in that regard.  It seems there is an awful lot we require in terms of staff and so on, notwithstanding what Deputy Lisa Chambers said about the need for positions to be filled.  There are 32 aircraft and the cost is &euro;60 million, including payroll costs, yet we are dishing out &euro;52 million to CHC which does a very good job.  We all sympathise following the terrible tragedy.  <\/p>  <p>  There has been substantial commentary in the media in recent times on a bilateral air defence agreement between us and the British.  I am very concerned about it because I do not recall the issue coming before the Oireachtas since the agreement c0ame into being.  I believe it was renewed in August.  It is in contravention of Article 15.6 of the Constitution which states only the Oireachtas can make such a move.  I ask the Minister of State to check the position and respond to the House in order that we can bring up the matter on the Order of Business another day, if necessary.  It was supposed to have been signed by civil servants in the Departments of Defence, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Irish Aviation Authority and on the other side by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the RAF.  The Oireachtas is entitled to know what exactly is going on because the agreement allows British aircraft to enter Irish airspace.  While there may be some Deputies and Senators in Fine Gael who would like to see Ireland rejoin the Commonwealth, it will not happen as long as this member of Fianna F&aacute;il is party to a confidence and supply agreement.  I would like the Minister of State to inform the House of just what is going on in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400047#UU00300","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1491335100,"counter":584,"content":"<p>I commend my colleague, Deputy Lisa Chambers, for bringing this Private Members' motion to the floor of the House.  It is vital that the issue of island defence is highlighted.  It was neglected by the Government and the previous Fine Gael-Labour Party Government for long enough.  The actions of Fine Gael have imposed hardship on members of the Defence Forces and their families.  In the past six years we have seen the disbandment of one brigade, three infantry units, two artillery regiments and over a dozen units, while four barracks have been closed.  There have also been cuts to the numbers of peacekeepers in Lebanon.  It is clear that the Government, while in office in the past six years, has seen the Defence Forces as an easy target for cost-cutting.  The fact that one of the first moves the Government made in 2011 when it took office was to assign the defence portfolio as a subsidiary role to the Minister for Justice and Equality indicated a complete lack of respect for the position and that of the Defence Forces.  I say, \"Well done,\" to Deputy Lisa Chambers for attempting to put a stop to it.  The Defence Forces have shown nothing but loyalty and professionalism in carrying out their duties.  Not once have they been hit by scandal.  The Government needs to be reminded of this.  <\/p>  <p>  We need a defence policy fit for purpose.  I plead with the Minister of State to review the situation of the Army Rangers wing with regard to the making of the back payment due to them under the Lansdowne Road agreement, for which they have been waiting since 2010.  The Minister of State's Department has sidestepped the issue. Will he find a mechanism to ensure they will receive assurances on the making of that payment?  They have not sought an increase in pay; they have only sought the incentives owed to them.  The Army Rangers are the men who are called on in the event of a terror threat, a threat which is more likely to arise today than heretofore.  The Government's flagrant disregard of the Defence Forces means that this is one of the most unprepared countries in the western world should there be such a scenario.  The motion calls for our military professionals to be allowed to play a meaningful and worthwhile role in the formulation of policy advice to the Government.  Their advice on what we should do in the event of a terror attack would be most welcome and is needed.   In my county of Cork we are faced with a situation where the naval base in Haulbowline, the only one in the State, is severely understaffed.  Last year the Minister of State put politics before protocol and tradition when he chose to hold the Defence Forces international operational service medal ceremony in Rosslare, County Wexford in his constituency.<\/p>  <p>  I recognise the outstanding role the Defence Forces played last year in the national 1916 celebrations.  The Government could have made a small gesture by giving retired members of the Defence Forces recognition for past service by awarding the same 1916 medallions as those received by current members and even FCA members.  It was an opportunity missed by the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400047#UU00400","speaker":"1278"},{"type":"speech","time":1491335100,"counter":585,"content":"<p>I take great pride in the Army.  Army personnel are wonderful people who, in the view of most in the country, do a very good job.  Fianna F&aacute;il has always given priority to the Defence Forces.  As pointed out, there has been an alarming fall in the number of Defence Forces personnel which now stands at slightly over 9,000.<\/p><p>It is a pity that this and the previous Government failed to give a senior Cabinet position to the Department.  That has led, in part, to the demoralised state of the Defence Forces.  In recent years, the House has not given adequate time to discussions of defence matters.

That shows the lack of interest.<\/p> <p> The Reserve Defence Force is dying a slow death, with recruitment kept at a low level of just 184 recruits in 2014, a good level of 341 recruits in 2015, but only 47 new recruits trained up to November 2016.  Recruitment is crucial to the Reserve's survival.  If it does not increase, the Reserve will be wiped out.<\/p> <p> I will conclude on an important point.  I commend my colleague, Deputy Lisa Chambers, on introducing this motion.  The 4th Western Brigade must be re-established at Custume Barracks, Athlone.  It should never have been disbanded.  I look forward to the day that it is restored.  Its disestablishment and the removal of so many military positions from the midlands, west and north west have meant that no career-oriented military personnel could ever again put down family roots in those areas.  This is another example of government moving out of rural Ireland.  I appeal to all Ministers and Ministers of State from the midlands and west to support the motion.  We want the re-establishment of the 4th Western Brigade in Athlone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400047#UU00500","speaker":"1342","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491335700,"counter":587,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on the important issue of defence.  The motion has given the Government and the House a valuable opportunity to acknowledge the service of the Defence Forces and to reinforce the policy framework provided by the White Paper on Defence, the significant commitment of funding by this and previous Fine Gael-led Governments to the modernisation of the Defence Forces, the investment in equipment platforms and the continuous recruitment of personnel during the years of the worst recession in the history of the State and difficult economic conditions when the rest of the public sector was not recruiting.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the recognition by Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Labour Party of the dedication and commitment of the members of the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, and the Reserve Defence Force, RDF.  I also recognise Civil Defence volunteers.  We owe a deep gratitude to those who made the ultimate sacrifice in the service of the State.  I take the opportunity to recognise their patriotic service.<\/p>  <p>  While it is not covered in the motion or the amendments, I acknowledge the significant contribution that the members of the Defence Forces have made, and continue to make, to peacekeeping.  For close to 60 years, the Defence Forces have played a vital role as peacekeepers all over the world, including in Europe, Africa and the Middle East.  The Defence Forces's 66,000 individual tours of duty on UN and UN-mandated support missions to date is a tangible demonstration of the country's commitment to the pursuit of international peace and security.  Today, just under 600 members of the PDF are serving overseas in various parts of the world, which reflects the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to our peacekeeping responsibilities.  On Thursday morning, the 54th Infantry Group will return from serving with UNDOF in the Golan Heights.  I was privileged to meet its members when I visited a few weeks ago and I hope they will enjoy the break with their families and loved ones.  A new contingent recently began its deployment with UNDOF.  I wish its personnel every success in carrying out their duties.<\/p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence, approved by the Government in July 2015, provides the strategic and comprehensive defence policy framework for the next decade.  It was developed following an extensive consultation process with all interested parties and a comprehensive examination of all defence requirements over a ten-year planning horizon.  This policy framework is flexible and responsive, given the dynamic nature of the security environment, and enables the defence organisation to be adaptive to changing circumstances and to use resources as effectively as possible.  The development of flexible and adaptive military capabilities is a pragmatic approach to dealing with future uncertainty and the roles assigned by the Government.  Capability commitments outlined in the White Paper include maintenance of a PDF establishment of at least 9,500 personnel and the retention of the existing two-brigade Army structure and Air Corps and Naval Service structures.  I have indicated to the Oireachtas committee that I will provide updates on the White Paper projects that are under way and that the representative associations will be consulted where appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to state clearly that the Government is committed to supporting the men and women of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann, the one and only official Army of the State.  They serve the country at home and abroad with great distinction.  In 2011, the budgetary provisions for the Defence Forces were such that they risked reducing the numbers serving to below 8,000.  That was the legacy of Fianna F&aacute;il while in office.  The then Fine Gael-led Government secured additional funding to stop that happening and to stabilise the Defence Forces at 9,500.  It also took steps to ensure that recruitment continued in the Defence Forces even when there was an embargo on recruitment across the public service, something that was introduced by the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government.  Fine Gael's record is one of standing up for the Defence Forces and the men and women of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann who serve the country with loyalty and dedication.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2017 delivered an additional &euro;16 million for defence.  This provides enough resources to pay for the Defence Forces at a full strength of 9,500.  It is an extra &euro;7 million for capital spending, bringing the capital allocation up to &euro;74 million, a 10% increase.  It includes an extra &euro;6 million for pensions.  However, it is not just the men and women of the Defence Forces in whom we are investing.  We are also investing in the equipment and platforms that they have available to them so that they can carry out their duties in an effective and safe manner.<\/p>  <p>  The Naval Service ships replacement programme has delivered three new offshore patrol vessels, which is something that no one has mentioned yet.  Last year, the Government signed a contract for a fourth new ship.  When complete, the total contract value for the four ships will be close to &euro;270 million.  We are also investing in the Air Corps, with plans in place to buy new aircraft.  A replacement Pilatus aircraft will be delivered this year, the process of replacing the Cessna aircraft is under way and the White Paper provides for replacing the CASA aircraft.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I was delighted to award a &euro;50 million contract for refurbishing the Army's armoured personnel carriers, something that has not been mentioned in this debate.  Investment is being provided for armoured logistics and utility vehicles, which will further enhance force protection.  Capital funding will lead to significant construction works across barracks, including at Baldonnel, the Curragh, Haulbowline, Kilkenny and Limerick and in Cathal Brugha and McKee barracks in Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  At the end of February, the effective strength of the PDF stood at 9,070.  The Government is committed to maintaining the establishment of the PDF at 9,500 personnel and recognises that a key challenge for the Defence Forces is to return to and maintain this strength.  That is why we are recruiting at historically high levels.  This year, the Defence Forces are planning for the induction of approximately 900 new entrants.  Both cadet and general service recruitment campaigns are currently active.  The cadet campaign covers requirement for line and specialist officers, including engineers for the Army and Naval Service and pilots for the Air Corps.  Last year, 590 general service recruits were inducted across the Defence Forces, with 100 cadets between all services.  That is the largest cadet class in decades.<\/p>  <p>  Some Deputies wish to portray the Government as not taking steps to reach the establishment strength, but that is not the case.  Despite what some say, more people entered the Defence Forces in 2016 than left it.  As with other areas of the public service, challenges have arisen in terms of the recruitment and retention of personnel with scarce and highly marketable skills, including pilots and air traffic control staff.  However, significant work is under way by civil and military elements aimed at addressing these particular challenges, including a range of actions to improve pilot retention and return to a full level of air traffic control services in the Air Corps.  While there are challenges in filling these specific technical posts, the current position is that officer ranks are operating at 87% of the establishment strength.  In some areas of the Defence Forces, we bring on board direct entry recruits with specialist skills.  I have tasked my Department and the Chief of Staff to consider where else this may be possible, including the direct entry of those with required skills to the Air Corps, for example, pilots.<\/p>  <p>  The new Public Service Pay Commission has been tasked with providing objective analysis and advice to the Government on public service remuneration, including the Defence Forces, in the context of the FEMPI Acts 2009 to 2015 and is due to report in the coming months.  Once this report is available, the Government intends to initiate negotiations on a successor to the Lansdowne Road agreement ahead of budget 2018 considerations.<\/p><p>I also want to recognise that the Chief of Staff has raised with me the concerns brought to him by some serving members.  I have reassured him that future remuneration of Defence Forces personnel will be dealt with within this process.  I welcome PDFORRA&rsquo;s recent decision to sign up to the Lansdowne Road agreement.  This will deliver noticeable increases for its members.  Regarding additional payments for Operation Pontus, I can confirm that my officials are working with PDFORRA on finalising the conclusion of the negotiated settlement.  On my instructions, my officials have been in contact with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding measures to retain specialist personnel in the Defence Forces, including highly skilled pilots.  I assure the House that there is significant work under way in the defence organisation, civil and military, aimed at improving the capacity of the Air Corps.<\/p> <p> Recruitment of new personnel is also under way.  Currently, there are 27 cadets in three classes undergoing various stages of the Air Corps cadetship to become pilots.  Eight were inducted in 2016.  There are rolling cadet classes such that we will have additional fully trained pilots this year.  The Government continued recruitment in this area during the worst recession in the history of this State.  A return to previous levels of capability in the Air Corps will be a gradual process as pilots within the system progress to become aircraft commanders and newly qualified cadets become pilots.  Actions are also under way to return a full level of air traffic control services to the Air Corps.  Air traffic control training is taking place and options to ensure the longer-term sustainability of air traffic control, ATC, services at Baldonnel are being identified.  Some personnel are nearing completion of their training and a new class has recently been inducted.  The Defence Forces takes pride in being able to respond to requests for assistance but it must be borne in mind that capabilities are not specifically developed to support other agencies and for civil contingencies but, of course, their utilisation for such tasks maximises the utility of defence capabilities overall and value for money for the State.<\/p> <p> Some aspects of the motion and the amendments thereto look to the past rather than the future.  The 2012 reorganisation of the Defence Forces was designed to maximise operational capacity and to provide for an organisation that is flexible and can accommodate new or unexpected demands.  The reorganisation was carried out on the advice of the then Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces and the Secretary General of the Department of Defence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400048#VV00200","speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491336300,"counter":589,"content":"<p>The Minister of State's time has expired.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400049#WW00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1491336300,"counter":590,"content":"<p>I ask that the House allow me the latitude to conclude my speech.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400049#WW00300","speaker":"1365"},{"type":"speech","time":1491336300,"counter":591,"content":"<p>This is a two-hour debate.

As a result, the operational capacity of the Defence Forces has been maintained to the greatest extent possible within the available resource envelope and this has led to an impressive improvement in the deployment and sustainability of the Defence Forces at home and overseas.<\/p>  <p>  The emphasis must remain on maximising operational capacity and not on headquarters structures.  It should be noted that no member of the Defence Forces is exclusively or permanently based in any one location.  There is a constant through-flow of personnel into and out of their assigned barracks to other barracks.  This occurs because military service involves personnel moving into and out of particular postings as they serve at home and overseas and receive training and undergo educational and career development courses.  As a result of the reorganisation, there are now more troops stationed in barracks along the west coast.  There are now more personnel stationed in Donegal, Galway and Limerick.  However, I recognise that there have been issues regarding personnel travelling between barracks and I am working with the military authorities to minimise this.<\/p>  <p>  I restate the Government&rsquo;s commitment to Custume Barracks, Athlone.  Since 2009, more than &euro;6 million has been invested in the barracks.  Following the reorganisation, the establishment strength was maintained at around 1,000 personnel.  Last year, a &euro;2 million project for the planned refurbishment of the kitchen and dining hall complex in the barracks was announced.  This went to tender and work on the design is ongoing.  It is planned to provide a permanent base for an aeromedical service, which is currently operating from a temporary structure in Custume Barracks.  This will involve the construction of a suitable hangar facility.  This project is a priority for me and I am working with my officials on it.  It is my intention to get it to design-tender stage by the end of the year.  However, this is a joint service with the Department of Health and the HSE, and all parties must be involved in the project.<\/p>  <p>  At the beginning of my contribution I mentioned members of the Reserve who give valued service to the Defence Forces.  Last week, in reply to parliamentary questions, and recently in committee, I outlined my work with the military authorities to get more people inducted into the Reserve.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding Brexit, it does not give rise to fundamental strategic issues for Defence Forces operations or for Ireland&rsquo;s continuing engagement within the European Union in the Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP.  The outcome of the negotiation process will be considered in the context of existing structures and relationships to ensure the Defence Forces continues to fulfil the roles assigned to them by Government.  I assure the House that the Government is committed to funding the Defence Forces and equipping them to do their duties safely and effectively.  We are doing this through continued investment, engagement with other countries on an international basis and continued recruitment to the Defence Forces, which we have done even in the most difficult of times.<\/p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence provides the framework from which we will continue to develop and enhance the Defence Forces in the next decade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400049#WW00700","speaker":"1365"},{"type":"speech","time":1491336300,"counter":595,"content":"<p>Four minutes will be deducted from the time allocated to the Minister of State, Deputy Patrick O'Donovan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400049#WW00800","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1491336300,"counter":596,"content":"<p>Tairgim leas&uacute;

Measaim go bhfuil an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo an-thr&aacute;th&uacute;il.<\/p><p>This debate is timely coming as it does at a time when the operational capacity of the Army, the Naval Service, the Air Corps and the Reserve has been stretched to breaking point and morale among rank and file personnel has never been lower.  The pride people have in the Defence Forces is rightly acknowledged in Deputy Lisa Chambers' motion.  Their professionalism and dedication in terms of how they serve the State at home and abroad is inspiring.  Despite the high esteem in which military personnel are held, this and previous Governments have implemented policies that have greatly devalued the role of the Defence Forces to the extent that it is a poor imitation of what it should be.<\/p><p>Currently, the combined strength of the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps is marginally more than 9,100 rather than the desired minimum strength of 9,500.  Despite the somewhat belated recruitment efforts, there has been a marked failure to make up this shortfall as the significant haemorrhaging of personnel outstrips the minimalist efforts to replace them.  Of particular concern is the failure to retain specialist personnel, some of whom take up to five years to train, which means it could be years before the Defence Forces achieve their desired minimum strength.  By any objective criteria, the attempts at reorganising the Army have been an unmitigated disaster.  When combined with the cutbacks in pay and entitlements, it is not surprising that so many military families are struggling to cope.  It is against this backdrop that there has been an unprecedented drop-out rate, with on average between 50 and 60 personnel of all ranks leaving the three branches of the Defence Forces every month.  At the same time there has been an absolute failure to recruit and retain a greater number of females into the Defence Forces, the current percentage being only 6%.<\/p><p>The crisis in the Defence Forces was further highlighted in the recent well-being climate survey which identified how the reorganisation of the Defence Forces had resulted in widespread poor morale, with low pay, long-term isolation from family and home being identified as the primary drivers of the exodus of personnel from the Army in particular in recent years but also the other services.  There are, of course, human stories behind these statistics.  The plight of military families was reinforced to me recently when I met Women and Partners of the Defence Forces, a group that has been formed to lobby the Government to reverse the punishing cutbacks to the pay and conditions of their military spouses.<\/p><p>They explained to me that the starting salary for a private in the Army is &euro;21,000 a year and that a significant number of enlisted personnel are so badly paid that an estimated 7,000 of them are in receipt of family income supplement.<\/p> <p> The targeting of rank and file members of the Defence Forces has resulted in families enduring spiralling debt, with many finding themselves in mortgage arrears to the point that house repossessions are not uncommon.  Poor credit ratings are leading others to an enforced reliance on moneylenders.  The financial pressure on families is so pronounced that working in the Defence Forces can no longer be considered a secure career option with good long-term prospects.  It is hardly surprising that there is such a high dropout rate for recruits when their service to the State is not deemed worthy of a liveable wage.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes proper investment needs to be directed at the men and women of the Defence Forces, whose much-lauded peacekeeping role in some of the world's most dangerous conflict zones must be matched by fair rates of pay and adequate allowances.<\/p> <p> The impact of Government policy on the operational capacity of the Defence Forces across the ranks cannot be overstated.  In the past three years, over 12% of those in the officer ranks of lieutenant, captain and commandant have left the Defence Forces, taking with them the types of essential skills, experience and corporate knowledge that take years to develop.  It is not good enough to recruit at the lower levels without also focusing on the retention of those with higher skill levels, which is vital for the continuing ability and capacity of the Defence Forces.<\/p> <p> I am informed that some Army units are operating with just 50% of their required or desired officer numbers.  As other Deputies have said, the personnel crisis is so acute that troops are being sent from as far away as Donegal to perform routine barrack duties in Dublin.  One of the reasons that the Government has been able to impose such unfair cuts to pay and allowances is that the Department has taken advantage of PDFORRA and RACO being prevented from participating in national pay-bargaining bodies.  This has given the Government free rein to impose cuts to enlisted personnel and new entrants to the military.  The Department is refusing to reflect in law European Court of Human Rights ruling No. 280 of 2014, which found that the blanket ban on trade unions in the Defence Forces is an unacceptable violation of Article 11.  Sinn F&eacute;in fully supports the efforts of Defence Forces representative organisations to secure the right under the Council of Europe's charter of social rights to membership of representative organisations with the power to negotiate terms, conditions, pay and allowances.<\/p> <p> The alarming loss of specially trained personnel has dramatically reduced the ability of the Defence Forces to provide a minimal effective response to a future major security or humanitarian incident.  If these reductions continue at their current rate, the ability of the Defence Forces will be further undermined.  The impact on the Air Corps has been especially pronounced.  As a result of the loss of 12 air traffic controllers since 2010, the Air Corps cannot operate beyond a minimal efficiency outside the hours from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  The implications of this lack of capacity became apparent in the aftermath of last month&rsquo;s tragic loss of Coast Guard helicopter Rescue 116.  The unavailability of the Air Corps to provide top cover during the ill-fated search and recovery mission off the Mayo coast, despite being best suited for carrying out that role, can be directly attributed to the fact that air traffic control services at Baldonnel have been cut to office hours only.  I noted the Minister of State's comment that capabilities are not developed just to serve civilian organisations.  I believe the ability to provide services in these areas should be developed in light of the role the Defence Forces have played over the years.<\/p> <p> The scarcity of technicians and pilots in the Air Corps means it is ill-prepared to respond to major incidents or natural disasters because most of its helicopter fleet is grounded.  As recently as 1 December 2016, just eight of the Air Corps fleet of 26 aircraft were serviceable because of a shortage of pilots and technicians.  There are vacancies for 32 pilots.  This equates to 30% of the required established strength of the Air Corps.  It should have 317 technicians available to ensure the safe operation of fixed and rotary-wing aircraft, but it has just 215 at present, which is a shortfall of 32%.  The new recruits will support the service, but will not do anything to deal fully with the shortfall.  Similar shortages have resulted in just two of the Air Corps' six AW139 medium helicopters being in service at any one time.  I understand that one of these aircraft is permanently deployed as an air ambulance in Athlone, with a second on standby as backup.<\/p> <p> As a result of this significant reduction in capacity, the Air Corps has been prevented from transporting seriously-ill children to Britain for organ transplant operations when organs become available after 5 p.m.  This means that potentially life-saving operations have to be foregone.  The State&rsquo;s limited daytime aerial interdiction capability against slow to moderate speed targets no longer exists.  This role, which was undertaken by PC9 trainers, was discontinued because there are no radar guided intercept controllers due to the lack of air traffic control staff in Casement Aerodrome.<\/p> <p> In debating the motion, it is important to place on record the duty of care the State has to all its enlisted men and women in terms of health and safety and pay and conditions, especially when they are deployed overseas in dangerous conflict zones.  Therefore, it is scandalous that despite the possible serious side effects associated with the anti-malaria drug Lariam, it is still routinely administered to service personnel when they are abroad.  It is banned or considered a drug of last resort in most other countries.  The refusal of the Department of Defence to withdraw Lariam in the face of overwhelming evidence that it causes serious long-term and potentially fatal side effects is a damning indictment of Government policy and a reflection of the head-in-the-sand attitude of the military and health authorities.  It points to a worrying failure in the way the State protects the physical and mental health of troops.<\/p> <p> It is equally appalling that the State remains dogged in its determination to contest all claims by some of the men and women severely affected physically and mentally by this drug.  For this reason, Sinn F&eacute;in has placed on the Order Paper a motion that seeks the immediate withdrawal of Lariam.  This proposal has been supported by many other Members of the House.  We hope we will receive the support of Fianna F&aacute;il when we bring the motion forward shortly.  Perhaps the Government will support our request at that stage by sending an instruction to the military authorities to discontinue using Lariam and replace it with Malarone or Doxycycline for personnel serving overseas.<\/p> <p> The treatment of Air Corps personnel who served as ground crew at Casement Aerodrome has been equally damning.  I refer primarily to young cadets who served from the mid-1990s onwards.  As far back as 1995 - this issue might go back even further - serious health and safety concerns were being reported to the Department of Defence about the manner in which highly toxic and dangerous chemicals were being handled at Casement Aerodrome.  The extent of the exposure of trainee personnel to highly dangerous, corrosive and cancerous chemicals such as trichloroethylene has resulted in a number of protected disclosures to the Government.  These disclosures have highlighted wholly inadequate health and safety protocols at Casement Aerodrome, such as the cross-contamination of chemicals, the lack of personal protective equipment and a wide range of other issues which seriously compromised the health of Air Corps personnel.<\/p> <p> In spite of the presentation of overwhelming evidence to the military authorities, successive Ministers for Defence have denied and downplayed the extent of this problem and claimed to have been unaware of what was happening.  It is time for an immediate comprehensive health and safety review of existing procedures and protocols at Casement Aerodrome and other military installations where Defence Forces personnel work or have worked with hazardous chemicals and materials.  The State must deal with claims from serving and retired Air Corps personnel in a much more compassionate way.  The adversarial approach that seems to be the default position of the Department of Defence is unacceptable.  The Department and the Government should learn from the Australian military, which has introduced compensation schemes to assist retired and serving air force personnel whose health has been compromised as a result of a similar scandal involving the handling of hazardous chemicals and materials without proper training or equipment.<\/p> <p> Irish neutrality is not enshrined in the Constitution even though it is overwhelmingly supported by the people of Ireland.  This fact has been exploited by successive Governments when pursuing policies which, in my view and that of my party, have devalued the relevance of Irish neutrality.<\/p><p> Sinn F&eacute;in believes our neutral status has greatly enhanced Ireland&rsquo;s status globally over the years, particularly when the Defence Forces preformed honourably and admirably in carrying out their peacekeeping duties in volatile conflict zones under the UN flag.  However, we believe the international goodwill from across the world is being eroded by the retrograde policies of successive Governments to associate our international policies with those of the increasingly militarised European Union and its interoperability with the agenda of NATO rather than that of the United Nations.  This has been evidenced in recent years by a number of multilateral agreements to allow the Defence Forces to participate in NATO&rsquo;s Partnership for Peace and EU battle groups, as well as the scandalous use of Shannon Airport as a military staging post for US soldiers and munitions and the State&rsquo;s submission to the diktats of the European Defence Agency.  A referendum is necessary, therefore, to amend the Constitution in order to enshrine Irish neutrality in Bureacht na h&Eacute;ireann, and to withdraw Ireland's participation from the European Defence Agency.  The Government must oppose efforts to establish a European army and must cease Ireland&rsquo;s links to NATO&rsquo;s Partnership for Peace.<\/p> <p> Mar chr&iacute;och ar an m&eacute;id at&aacute; le r&aacute; agam ar an r&uacute;n seo, ba cheart don Aire St&aacute;it agus don Rialtas i gcoitinne aitheantas ceart a thabhairt don chruach&aacute;s, do na constaic&iacute; agus, go h&aacute;irithe, do na fadhbanna airgeadais lena bhfuil fir agus mn&aacute; na F&oacute;rsa&iacute; Cosanta ag cur suas.

However, we wish to add some important points that we believe are absent.  The Labour Party has regularly sought an upgrade of the ability of the Defence Forces to negotiate their terms and conditions of employment.  Such an upgrade would, in turn, have an impact on the ability to earn an income without having recourse to family income supplement.  We also have concerns regarding the health and safety of Defence Forces personnel, particularly in the context of the use of Lariam.  We have raised these concerns in our amendment, which takes the form of an addendum, and hope they will be acceptable to all Members of the House.  As I said, the Fianna F&aacute;il motion contains a lot of good measures which we in the Labour Party support.  That is why our amendment takes the form of an addendum.<\/p>  <p>  PDFORRA has long held the belief that for truly effective and equitable negotiations to be undertaken on behalf of its membership, affiliation to ICTU is imperative.  This would allow the Defence Forces to have access to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, for dispute resolution and to be involved in national pay bargaining like other workers.  This view has been held by the membership of PDFORRA since 1995, when a vote on the matter was passed unanimously by delegates at its conference.  Speaking at the conference in 1995, Peter Cassels, the then ICTU general secretary, informed the delegates that while he recognised that the Defence Forces had a special role to play, members should still have a say on pay, taxation, social welfare and health, and this should be conducted through ICTU.  Subsequent attempts by PDFORRA to petition various Ministers on the granting of affiliation status have been rejected.  In a not too dissimilar situation two years ago, the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI, had a successful petition to the European Committee of Social Rights.  PDFORRA reviewed the determination and considered the parallels between the circumstances of PDFORRA and the AGSI, and also petitioned the committee.  PDFORRA believes that the protections enshrined within the European Social Charter should apply to its members and the Labour Party supports that call.<\/p>  <p>  National pay agreements have been the norm in this country for many years.  In the absence of an ability to highlight matters affecting its members at central negotiations, PDFORRA's effectiveness at negotiation is severely hampered.  While there is a conciliation and arbitration scheme in existence for members of the Permanent Defence Force, it is, for a number of reasons, limited in scope and power.  It is also identical to the scheme enjoyed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which was the subject of its complaint to the European Committee of Social Rights.<\/p>  <p>  We will continue to push for PDFORRA to have recourse to the WRC.  The Bus &Eacute;ireann dispute is now into its 12th day.  Recourse to the WRC has always been available and talks will resume through that channel.  Unfortunately, this option would not be open to members of the Defence Forces.  This is wrong and needs to be rectified.  In our addendum, we ask for this to be rectified and I hope it receives majority support in the House.<\/p>  <p>  The cost of living crisis is not limited to one sector, it affects all sectors.  The fact that over 20% - one in five is an incredible number - of the members of the Defence Forces are in receipt of family income supplement highlights a shameful aspect of our economy.  The fact that there is an unwillingness or inability on the part of organisations in the private and public sectors to adequately pay their workforces in order that they can meet their basic living needs of housing, light, heat, food and raising children is a shame.  If the Defence Forces were permitted to fight their corner in pay negotiations, their members would not have to avail of family income supplement in such high numbers.  A plan should be put in place to ensure that pay is commensurate with the needs of ordinary members of the Defence Forces and, in doing so, to ensure the need for members to rely on family income supplement becomes a distant memory.<\/p>  <p>  On 11 November 2016 an agreement was reached, through an independent adjudicator, that crews serving as part of Operation Pontus in the Mediterranean should be paid an armed allowance of &euro;15 per day.  These payments are still owed to the personnel and are long overdue.  The Minister needs to rectify this situation with immediate effect.<\/p>  <p>  We recognise the ongoing concerns of personnel and their families due to the continued use of Lariam and the lack of proper support and after-care services for members of the forces.  There are very real fears about the impact on people's careers if any mental health side effects from Lariam are noted on medical records.  An independent outside review in respect of the continued use of Lariam should be carried out.  I have said this to the Minister on previous occasions.  It is vital and long overdue.<\/p>  <p>  Every day, the members of our Defence Forces bravely defend vulnerable communities worldwide from exploitation, violence and death.  They keep the peace on the most dangerous parts of the planet.  They rescue hundreds of refugees from the waters of the Mediterranean, where many perished fleeing violence and persecution.  What our addendum and the original motion seek to achieve are relatively modest when weighed against the contribution the Defence Forces make to our security and that in theatres of conflict throughout the world.  We ask for support for the addendum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400051#YY00200","speaker":"1301"},{"type":"speech","time":1491337500,"counter":600,"content":"<p>The Minister of State said, \"The Fine Gael record is one of standing up for the Defence Forces and the men and women of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann who serve our country with loyalty and distinction.\"  What he should have said is, \"The Fine Gael record is one of treating the Defence Forces and the men and women of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann who serve tge country with loyalty and distinction to a diet of low pay which is completely unacceptable.\"  Low pay is rampant in the Defence Forces.  Some 20% of Defence Forces personnel, that is, one in five, are paid such a low wage they are forced to apply for and survive on family income supplement.  Has that cohort not served their country with loyalty and distinction?  PDFORRA has calculated that, taking into account the long hours they work, naval personnel on tours of duty in the Mediterranean have been working for &euro;9.15 per hour.  This is a minimum-wage rate.  Is that what the Minister calls standing up for the Defence Forces?<\/p>  <p>  The month of April is upon us.<\/p><p><i>9 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>Boys and girls around the country are being prepared for their First Holy Communion.  It is a costly exercise with clothes needing to be bought and preparations made for the day but parents are prepared to sacrifice to do it properly.  How many members of the Defence Forces will be forced this year to seek loans to pay for the communion because their pay is so low?  How many will be forced to get loans from moneylenders in towns and villages throughout the country let alone being unable to pay a mortgage or afford a holiday in 2017?  Full pension rights in the Defence Forces are reserved for members with 21 years of unbroken service.  How does the Minister of State justify the fact that taking one's statutory parental leave constitutes a break in service and means one does not receive a full pension?  Is that not unfair, particularly for female members of our Defence Forces?<\/p> <p> Against this background, we have seen the establishment of the group of wives and partners of members of the Defence Forces.  They have called for protests at barracks across the country on the part of Defence Forces wives, partners and families on Thursday, 20 April, assembling at gates at 12 noon and continuing the protests until 2 p.m. under the slogan \"Pay our forces a fair wage\".  These wives and partners stand in the proud tradition of the National Army Spouses Association which rocked the political and military establishment with protests and election challenges to the exploitation of Defence Forces personnel.  They were effective.  The development of this new group is a positive one, as is their protest.  I wish them good luck on their bold initiative which deserves to be a great success.<\/p> <p> The motion is extremely watery.  It is aimed at making Fianna F&aacute;il look good while putting no real pressure on the Government to address these issues.  The addendum and the amendment are good.  I support the idea that the Permanent Defence Forces Other Ranks Representative Association should have the right to go to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the Labour Court and to affiliate with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  They should have full trade union rights up to and including the right to strike.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400051#YY00300","speaker":"1432","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491338100,"counter":602,"content":"<p>A Defence Forces climate survey of 2015 found that staff had broadly become less happy with their work in the military over the intervening years from 2008 when the previous report had been put together.  According to the report, there is a perception of a lack of justice in the organisation, especially among the lower ranks, and that the espoused values of the Defence Forces are not effectively enacted daily.  The majority of respondents do not feel a sense of belonging and identification with the organisation.  While Fianna F&aacute;il's motion sounds notes of great patriotism and the pride and honour that goes with saying it is a great and wonderful Army and noting the sacrifices it makes, I am left cold when I think about the survey and how this and previous Governments, including those of Fianna F&aacute;il, have allowed the pay and conditions of soldiers to be run down to the point that 7,000 members of the Defence Forces have to claim family income support from the State while PDFORRA has no right to provide them with official representation.<\/p><p>I experienced <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu<\/i>when Deputy Mick Barry announced the protest at barracks by wives and families of soldiers.  It was the wives and families of soldiers who had to come out and protest in the past at the conditions military personnel were working under.  They deserve to be treated as patriots.  There is a very good part of the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment which states that Ireland should remain exempt from having to increase its spending on weapons and military capabilities from 0.6% to 2% of GDP because of the European common security and defence policy.  We should amend that to state that if we have to increase to 2% of GDP, the money should be used to treat soldiers properly, to pay them properly and to get them out of the state of low morale and poverty wages on which they exist.  It is shocking.<\/p><p>I feel a sense of pride in our Defence Forces not because I adhere to any policy of war or aggression but because they do wonderful things like go to the Mediterranean and pull refugees from the sea, saving the lives of children, men and women.  That is something of which to be enormously proud.It is also something to be proud of when they are involved in rescue missions like the one we saw in the west of Ireland and save people there.  However, there is underfunding of the rescue service capacity of the Defence Forces and that needs to be addressed.  Our amendment to the motion attempts to address some of these issues.  In the context of speaking about the military, we should welcome the opportunity to reiterate the role the Defence Forces can play in saving lives and protecting people from climate change and other disasters.  We should also note the attempt by this and previous Governments to rubbish the policy of neutrality in this country by continually allowing Shannon Airport to be used as a stopover by other military powers on their way to death and destruction across the Middle East and elsewhere.  It is not just an abuse of our neutrality but an insult to the idea of our independence and the role our own military should play in maintaining peace and security at home and abroad in the services they nobly provide to save lives due to climate change and war.  While I support many aspects of the proposed amendments, I do not support the substantive motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400052#ZZ00200","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1491338100,"counter":603,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Lisa Chambers of Fianna F&aacute;il for moving the motion on which I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak, two members of my family having served in the military in Galway, as well as two members who also served in the city in the FCA many years ago.  I am proud to say I am a great friend of D&uacute;n U&iacute; Mhaoil&iacute;osa in Renmore, which the Minister of State has visited a few times.  I call there regularly and it is great to see a number of the soldiers from the barracks serving currently in the Golan Heights.  I thought we might get an opportunity to visit them but, unfortunately, we did not.  Members of the Defence Forces are serving on many duties abroad and I note in particular the Naval Service which has saved many lives in the Mediterranean.  That must be acknowledged.  Irish soldiers command a great deal of respect abroad and that must be acknowledged also.  It is a pity one hears so many Members talk about the terrible pay and conditions they have and that some of them are availing of family income supplement.  I ask the Minister of State to address the issue of their pay.<\/p>  <p>  The role of the Defence Forces was central Ireland's memorial celebration of the centenary of the 1916 Rising last year and its members were magnificent in the execution of their duties.  They represented the Defence Forces at local unveilings of commemorative stones and memorials, as well as at the impressive formal ceremonies of Easter week.  I was in attendance at D&uacute;n U&iacute; Mhaoil&iacute;osa when the Minister of State gave serving members the special medals which had previously been awarded to those who had taken part in the Rising.  However, what should have been a joyous celebration left a sour taste in the mouths of former and retired members of the Defence Forces who were not included.  Those soldiers, sailors and Air Corps personnel who also gave great service to the country feel very aggrieved that they were excluded from receiving those 1916 medals.  Some members of the Defence Forces had only served for a matter of weeks when these medals were awarded whereas retired members who had given over 40 years of service at home and abroad were not awarded a medal.  I ask the Minister of State to look at that matter again.<\/p><p>It would surely cost the Government comparatively little to right this wrong now, and in doing so acknowledge the valuable contribution to the security of the country made by those not currently serving.  It would mean a lot to them.<\/p> <p> I am already on the record as saying the reorganisation of the Army structure into two brigades in 2012 has been an unmitigated disaster resulting in endless problems and a suspected fall in morale among members of the Defence Forces.  I fully support the motion to restore the fourth brigade based in Athlone, encompassing D&uacute;n U&iacute; Mhaoil&iacute;osa barracks in Galway.  The first infantry Battalion stationed in Galway is now overseen operationally from a regional headquarters in Cork, which is just ridiculous.  I suspect the reorganisation of 2012 was a significant factor in the negative findings of the well-being in the Defence Forces survey of 2015.  This study found that less than half of serving members were satisfied with their life in the military.  Significantly, the study found that satisfaction has dropped greatly, from 64% in 2008 under the old three brigade structure to 48% in 2015, three years after the changes.<\/p> <p> The falling strength of the Defence Forces in recent years is also undoubtedly affecting morale.  Staffing shortages caused by the voluntary outflow of trained personnel has resulted in operational units being unable to deploy sub-units to platoon-sized strength, 30 persons of all ranks, which is compromising operations.<\/p> <p> A total of 45% of Dublin-based security duties must be conducted by regional units.  Units such as those in Donegal, Dundalk and Athlone are like Grand Central station, with troops being transported to and from Dublin.  The majority of Army units are now concentrated in the east and south of the country, leaving the Border with Northern Ireland bereft of troops at a time of political uncertainty there and the upcoming upheaval of Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400052#ZZ00300","speaker":"1313","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491338700,"counter":605,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Noel Grealish for sharing time and I compliment Fianna F&aacute;il on tabling the motion.<\/p>  <p>  We need to salute the soldiers throughout the country and the work they do.  We have seen the work they have done rescuing people in foreign lands.  It would make one proud to be Irish.  They have worked with the United Nations on peacekeeping duties for many years and the Irish soldiers have stood out.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to ensure the number of personnel is maintained.  There is a shortage of pilots.  I know we cannot train pilots overnight, but I question the figures I hear on how much it costs to train them.  We need contracts to keep them in the Defence Forces to recover the cost of training.  Figures of &euro;1 million and &euro;1.2 million are thrown about, given everything that is involved.  We need to ensure we entice these people to stay in the Defence Forces because they are important.  Some pilots may go to foreign lands for a while.  We are stuck for personnel and the Army should be open.  We should ensure there is a transparent way to allow people to return to the Defence Forces.  I hope the Minister of State will address this issue.<\/p>  <p>  Last year when flooding was at high peak, in fairness to the Army it went to various places which were in trouble.  When an area in County Roscommon was under pressure the Army came from Galway but Athlone was up the road.  Deputy Noel Grealish stated that for some duties personnel travelled from the four corners of Ireland to Dublin, which makes it a little nonsensical.  Some thinking needs to be done or something needs to be sorted out.<\/p>  <p>  Athlone barracks has been discussed.  The air ambulance is in Athlone, and this has been helpful, but it cannot fly at night which is an awful drawback.  If a hospital in a county is closed, and for all citizens in Ireland, it is important this facility is there day or night so if someone is badly injured or has to be rushed to a distant hospital in an emergency we have helicopters which will do this.  The Department of Defence was brought into this, but perhaps it should be the Department of Health which should look after it.  As the Minister of State has responsibility, I ask him to examine this issue.<\/p>  <p>  The numbers in Athlone barracks need to be kept stable.  It is a rural part of Ireland, no more than Galway, Donegal and other places, and it is important that Army bases are held and the numbers are maintained.  We do not know what it will be like in six months time or two years time, when the Brexit talks have finished.  Will we be back to the same ding dong as before?  We must ensure we have an Army that is ready at any given time.  I know there is not money to throw at everything, and I am not unrealistic, but we need to ensure as a nation we put the best possible resources into the Army.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400053#AAA00200","speaker":"1341"},{"type":"speech","time":1491338700,"counter":606,"content":"<p>I compliment my party colleague, Deputy Lisa Chambers, on tabling this very important motion.  It is a comprehensive motion, and those of us who participate in the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence, and Deputy Noel Grealish is a member, know Deputy Lisa Chambers has consistently highlighted the issues of concern to the Permanent Defence Force and to us as a society.  There is an obvious need, as the motion points out, for recruitment and retention of personnel.  I am told quite a number of people leave the Permanent Defence Force and join the British Army.  I do not know whether this is a case of pay and lack of remuneration but I sincerely hope it can be addressed.  Other speakers have outlined the need for better pay and conditions.  I sincerely hope these issues can be addressed.  There is no point in all of us speaking about the value, importance and great standing of the Permanent Defence Force if it is not adequately resourced.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Noel Grealish quite rightly pointed out the reorganisation of the Defence Forces in 2012 and 2013.  At the time, the Minister of State participated in some of the debates in the D&aacute;il as Government Chief Whip.  We trenchantly argued against the closure of D&uacute;n U&iacute; N&eacute;ill barracks in Cavan and other barracks.  If we take the northern half of the country, we have one barracks in Finner, south Donegal, and the only other barracks along the Border is Aiken barracks in Dundalk.  We have a huge central Border area with no Army military installation.  This was a very retrograde step.  It was deplorable that the then Government decided to close the most modern purpose-built barracks in Europe.  The Minister of State may recall, and the statistics are available to him, it was the most efficient barracks.  It was the cheapest to run because of modern facilities and good management.  It was a very backward step for the Permanent Defence Force that D&uacute;n U&iacute; N&eacute;ill barracks was closed at the time.<\/p>  <p>  Last week at the Estimates meeting, the Minister of State will recall we discussed participation by Irish Permanent Defence Force members with the United Nations.  At the meeting, Deputy Lisa Chambers proposed we should have a full debate in the D&aacute;il, on the service by the Defence Forces with the United Nations.  I supported this proposal, as did all other committee members.  The most recent report on this applies to 2015.  We do not have discussions in the House near often enough on the Defence Forces and their importance, their role and the respect in which we all hold them.  I sincerely hope we can have this debate at an early date, with the agreement of all the party Whips.<\/p>  <p>  All of us are proud of the very considerable role played by members of the Permanent Defence Force in United Nations missions in many difficult and troubled areas of the world.  One of the best public occasions I attended as a public representative was a number of years ago, in my county town of Cavan, at the official ceremony marking the departure of a large number of people to Lebanon at D&uacute;n U&iacute; N&eacute;ill Army barracks.<\/p><p>It was a magnificent occasion.  The formal part of the proceedings for the departure was held in Cavan town.  Thousands of people turned out to show their appreciation of the role those people would go on to play in troubled places in the world and the role so many people from our own area have played in peacekeeping missions over the years.  It is an area in which we need to continue to have full involvement.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State will also recall that at the committee in the past year we have discussed the lack of numbers in the Reserve Defence Force on a number of occasions.  The submission made by the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association painted a very grim picture with regard to the maladministration, the way recruitment to the Reserve Defence Force is conducted and the delay in inducting people into the Reserve Defence Force.  We sincerely hope those issues which were very well amplified by the president of the association and the general secretary will be addressed without delay.  The Reserve Defence Force Representative Association has played a very important role in society over the years.  I consistently highlight the fact that I know many young people who would have been vulnerable at the time to be targeted by paramilitary groups and other thugs.  The Reserve Defence Force Representative Association provided an outlet to those young people who were vulnerable and who went on to play a meaningful and important role in society.  There is a role for the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association and I sincerely hope it will be treated with the respect that it deserves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400053#AAA00300","speaker":"1270","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491339300,"counter":608,"content":"<p>I pay tribute to my colleague, Deputy Lisa Chambers, for the very robust motion that she has put before the House today.  I come from south Kildare where people are very proud of the fact that we have the home of the Defence Forces training centre in the Curragh.  All of the Defence Forces officers that we have were educated and trained in the military college there.  There is a huge military tradition in the county, and I acknowledge the pride that Irish people, those from Kildare in particular, have in our Defence Forces and the contribution that is made by the Permanent Defence Force, the Reserve Defence Force and Civil Defence to society.  In Kildare, we regularly remember those members who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the service of the State, in particular those on overseas peacekeeping missions.  The Organisation of National Ex-Servicemen and Women, ONE, plays a remarkable part in annual services throughout the county, especially Mr. Philip Coy.  I acknowledge the great work of the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, and the Permanent Defence Forces Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA.  One of the first public meetings that I was ever involved in was back in the early 1990s with Mr. Jim Lucey and Mr. Jim Brady at the inception of that organisation, which continues to do tremendous work on behalf of its members.<\/p>  <p>  Being from Kildare, I continually meet soldiers' families and I am acutely aware of the many areas of concern within the forces at present.  Many personnel are not happy with their work situation.  This has resulted in over 10% of commissioned officers and 25% of enlisted personnel leaving the Defence Forces since the 2013 reorganisation, leaving significant gaps in capability, expertise and unit manning levels.  This is particularly alarming.  My party has always been committed and continues to be committed to a defence policy that is measured, fit for purpose, appropriately resourced and which allows the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces to go forward with confidence in an ever-changing world of new and emerging threats.  \"Fit for purpose\" is the appropriate phrase that has to be used here.  It entails personnel being fit for purpose using equipment that is fit for purpose.  With so much turmoil and reorganisation in the Defence Forces, one must ask if the organisation is able to meet all of its commitments.  The Minister never ceases to make promises that the Defence Forces are in a position to meet and to face current threats.  Late last year, as we were 24 hours from all-out industrial action by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we were assured in the House that the Defence Forces could fill the void.  Are we sure the Defence Forces have that capability at this point in time?  Are the Defence Forces currently able to meet the terrorist threats which are faced in modern Europe?  Are we leaving ourselves open to risk as a society?<\/p>  <p>  It seems that with the lack of expenditure and investment, which amounted to just 0.25% of GDP this year, Ireland is lacking the minimum conventional capability to provide a credible defence based on deterrence.  The Defence Forces should have a designated strength of 9,500, but their numbers have now fallen well below that.  With 12% to 13% of military personnel in full-time training or education at any one time, which is required to prepare for and perform the range of operational tasking assigned to the Defence Forces by Government, the numbers have fallen well below what is required to carry out operational tasks.  The Defences Forces have had eight reorganisations and reviews since 1992.  That is an average of one every three years.  The exploitation of the loyalty of the members has resulted in turmoil, relocation, uncertainty and confusion for members of the Defence Forces and their families.  Such tensions and family displacements are not conducive to optimal operational viability, certainty and good morale.  I meet families in south Kildare every week who are victims of this turmoil.  The Defence Forces have been an easy target for cost-cutting.  Its unreserved loyalty and professionalism has perhaps been taken advantage of.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400054#BBB00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1491339300,"counter":609,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Tony McLoughlin.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome Deputy Fiona O'Loughlin's contribution.

There is utter confusion in Fianna F&aacute;il, because in 2010, when it was last in government, it provided for 8,000 members of the Permanent Defence Force, which would, as the Deputy quite rightly suggests, have left us in an even worse position.  When Fianna F&aacute;il's spokesperson takes the opportunity to sum up on behalf of the party, there might be an apology for the state Fianna F&aacute;il left the Defence Forces in when it was last in government and the morale which it ran into the ground when it drove the country over the cliff.  I would welcome that also.  I am sure the other members of the Defence Forces around the country and those people who could not join the Defence Forces because of Fianna F&aacute;il's stance in its time in Government would welcome it too.  That was only in 2010.  I welcome that the Deputy said there was confusion.

I recognise the Deputy's genuine concern to ensure the approach to defence is undertaken in ways which respect the wishes of the people.  I recognise the high esteem in which the Defence Forces are held and the appreciation of the often dangerous work they do at home and overseas.  Several Deputies have referred to this and, in acknowledging the positive features of the debate, it is important to point out that it is the Executive, that is the Government which has to seek practical policies that are feasible in the interests of citizens and taxpayer.  In the interests of any democracy, management of defence through the civil and democratic control of the armed forces is paramount.<\/p>  <p>  Irish people have a realistic and well grounded sense of expectations for defence.  It is a matter for Government to deliver.  The amendment that is tabled by the Government is realistic in its approach and takes cognisance of the actual position with regard to the Defence Forces as it currently stands.

The position is that, at the end of February 2017, the effective strength of the Permanent Defence Force stood at 9,070.  The Government is committed to maintaining the establishment of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500.<\/p><p>It is recognised that a key challenge is to return to and maintain this strength.  It important to clarify that, in total, 590 general service recruits were inducted in 2016, with 100 cadets between all services.  Recruitment remains a priority in 2017 and, significantly, more personnel will be recruited this year, with funding secured to ensure delivery of this outcome.  Both cadet and general service recruitment campaigns are currently active, with historically high levels of recruitment being pursued.  The Defence Forces are planning for the induction of 900 new entrants in 2017.  While the Fianna F&aacute;il motion fails to recognise that the Defence Forces are the only arm of the public service in which there was continuous recruitment and promotion during the years of austerity, it does include a call to increase the establishment strength of the Permanent Defence Force to 10,500.  However, it is important to remember that there are challenges, particularly in the Air Corps, in filling certain posts not related to the establishment figure of 9,500.  <\/p> <p> As in other areas of the public service, challenges have arisen in the recruitment and retention of personnel with scarce and highly marketable skills, including pilots and air traffic control staff.  Significant work is under way aimed at addressing these challenges.  While there are difficulties in filling specific posts, the position is that officer ranks across the Defence Forces are currently operating at a figure of 87%.  Any increase in numbers must, in monetary terms, be supported by spending adjustments in other areas, including military equipment and support services.  The cost implications would have a multiplier effect, in that each additional member of the Defence Forces employed would involve the incurring of costs in other areas of defence spending.   Therefore, any decision to increase the establishment figure of 9,500 must be considered in the light of the total cost the taxpayer would incur, not simply pay and allowances.  The cost of an increase of 1,000 personnel, expressed in terms of pay and allowances only, is estimated at almost &euro;50 million.  When the costs of training, equipping and maintaining and other expenses are added, the figure will far exceed &euro;50 million per annum.  It is recognised internationally that the pay to non-pay ratio of military spending should be no lower than 70:30; thus every &euro;50 million increase in payroll costs needs to be matched by the expenditure of at least another &euro;21 million.  That is an important aspect to be considered in this debate.<\/p> <p> The White Paper also takes a developmental approach to the Reserve Defence Force.  It confirms its role as augmenting that of the Permanent Defence Force in a crisis and contributing to State ceremonial events.  At the end of February the effective strength of the Reserve Defence Force stood at 1,970.  Recruitment to both the Permanent Defence Force and Reserve Defence Force remains a priority in 2017.  Membership of the Reserve Defence Force is voluntary and the quest for recruits must compete with that it other organisations within the voluntary sector.  These conditions, with the unique demands imposed by military service, make attracting recruits challenging at the best of times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400054#BBB00400","speaker":"1343","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491339900,"counter":612,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Niamh Smyth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400055#CCC00200","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1491339900,"counter":613,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue.  I compliment Deputy Lisa Chambers on tabling this important motion.  <\/p>  <p>  As someone who comes from the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, the Government closed four provincial military barracks, namely, the facilities in Cavan, Mullingar, Clonmel and Castlebar.  The majority of the 540 staff affected were Army personnel who were relocated to other facilities further afield.  Of the affected personnel, 136 were based in O&rsquo;Neill Army Barracks in County Cavan.  They were redeployed to Athlone following the announcement.  At the time the move by the Government caused huge angst, worry and upheaval for local families.  There was as a result a significant downside.  The decision resulted in turmoil and relocation, uncertainty and confusion for members of the Defence Forces.  Such tensions and family displacements are not conducive to achieving optimum operational viability, certainty and good morale.<\/p>  <p>  The Defence Forces have been an easy target for cost-cutting, with perhaps their unreserved loyalty and professionalism being taken advantage of.  Policy has become a matter of fitting the Defence Forces into a particular budget envelope.  We all agree that the single greatest asset of the Defence Forces is their personnel, yet the Defence Forces are facing huge difficulties in retaining and recruiting sufficient personnel.  They are seriously below strength and it is time to rebuild significantly.  The decline in recent years has left them with just 9,000 personnel, 430 below the agreed strength.  The exit from the Defence Forces, at all ranks, is ongoing, with the number running at between 40 and 50 a month.  <\/p>  <p>  In the light of Brexit, possibly the single biggest issue facing the Government in the history of the state, it is time to give the Department of Defence the focus and importance it deserves.  The decision in March 2011 to assign the defence portfolio as a subsidiary role to the Minister for Justice and Equality indicated an essential lack of respect for the position.  While it was not unreasonable to assign it with another Cabinet portfolio, to include it with the Department of Justice and Equality, one of the busiest Departments, was regressive.  <\/p>  <p>  I come from a Border constituency where Brexit and all of the concerns associated with it are to the forefront of everyone&rsquo;s mind, including checkpoints, a need for security or worse and a return to smuggling and criminality in the Border region.  Ireland needs to recommit to the Defence Forces.  Fianna F&aacute;il believes we should seek to increase the strength of the Defence Forces to over 10,000 in the coming year.  We also believe it is important to retain what we have.  The State&rsquo;s defence policy, its implementation and resourcing, must be appropriate.  For our part, Fianna F&aacute;il is committed to a defence policy that is measured, fit for purpose, appropriately resourced and which allows the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces to move forward with confidence in an ever-changing world, with emerging threats such as those I have outlined.  In tabling the motion Deputy Lisa Chambers is acting on the belief the Defence Forces are of critical importance to both the State and Irish society, not to mention the Border region.  Fianna F&aacute;il consistently raised this issue between 2011 and 2014.  It is welcome that the Minister for Defence is also not the Minister for Justice and Equality.  However, we believe we must move forward and commit to the restoration of defence as a lead portfolio in the Cabinet.  The Minister with day-to-day responsibility for defence policy should be a fully-fledged Cabinet Minister, not a Minister of State, as is the case.  That would be a very clear affirmation of the value the State must place on the Defence Forces.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400055#CCC00300","speaker":"1271"},{"type":"speech","time":1491339900,"counter":614,"content":"<p>It is a pity the Minister of State, Deputy Patrick O'Donovan, decided to exit the Chamber so quickly.  He appeared to be confused in supporting a non-existent Government amendment.  Perhaps his colleagues might inform him of same.<\/p>  <p>  The suggestion the motion is somehow inconsistent with the White Paper needs to be considered in the light of the fact that the failures of the reorganisation in 2012 did not manifest until 2014.  The Green Paper consultation process commenced in 2013.  No consultation took place after this until the final consultation forum prior to publication of the White Paper in 2015.  The current human resource failures and the financial resourcing inadequacies confirm the requirement to revisit the White Paper in the light of current circumstances where it has been clearly demonstrated that the Defence Forces are unable to meet the demands of the State. <\/p>  <p>  During Leaders' Questions today the Taoiseach stated morale in the Defence Forces was high.  Is he contradicting or contesting the findings of the University of Limerick climate survey conducted in 2016?  The Minister of State knows from many discussions in this Chamber in the past year that morale is not high.  In fact, it is quite low.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State touched on the issue of recruitment and the retention of personnel.  We have to acknowledge that the skills required in the Defence Forces need to be grown organically as we cannot recruit externally.  We have to train people from scratch.  This takes a considerable period of time and in the absence of a clear retention policy the Defence Forces are going to continue to haemorrhage personnel.  The Minister of State has done nothing to show me or any other Deputy what the plan is to ensure retention.  He is rumbling through and speaking about recruitment campaigns, which is fine.  Last year's recruitment campaign actually resulted in a net loss of Defence Forces personnel.  Defence Forces numbers are down again.  <\/p>  <p>  The White Paper is a soft strategy.  Its real test is the operational results.  Is it true that the White Paper project team had to redesign its approach after establishing that the Defence Forces could not meet the identified threat analysis? <\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State mentioned the purchase of key equipment by his Department.<\/p><p>We all welcome that but is the Government financing the purchase of those items with payroll savings?  That appears to be where the savings are being made and the money is coming from.<br\/><br\/>Fine Gael made a poor attempt to have a pop at Fianna F&aacute;il in this debate but it is Fine Gael which has downgraded the Defence portfolio and removed it as a full Cabinet portfolio.  We did not do that.  Fine Gael did that and it has continued with that policy.  The Minister of State said the Fine Gael record is one of standing up for the Defence Forces but there would have been a mass rolling of eyes across the country as people listened to that statement.  The Fine Gael record is low morale, haemorrhaging of key and highly skilled personnel and persistent under-resourcing and understaffing of our Defence Forces.  That is Fine Gael's record to date.<br\/><br\/>Did the Minister of State review the Department's submission to the Low Pay Commission?  Did the four pages reflect the significance of the remuneration issues that exist in the Defence Forces?  Did the submission comment on the retention crisis?  The answer is &quot;no&quot;, so where in that submission has the Minister of State or Fine Gael stood up for the Defence Forces?  What does the Minister of State think members of the Reserve Defence Force are going to feel about Government support for their organisation?  They are currently at below 2,000 effective members when the figure should be more than 4,000.  I have made numerous suggestions in questions in this Chamber and on Committee Stage on how we might address the issues affecting the Reserve Defence Force.  I did this because the Minister of State asked me to do so.  I have made very reasonable suggestions for things might work but the Government has yet to implement any one of them.  The Minister of State will excuse me if I do not feel his commitment to the Reserve Defence Force is obvious, because it is not.<br\/><br\/>The Minister of State said the reorganisation of the Defence Forces was designed to maximise operational capacity and provide for an organisation that is flexible and can accommodate new or unprecedented demands.  Does he really believe the 2012 reorganisation has achieved this?  In my view it has failed miserably.  The removal of headquarter structures has removed critical layers of management and officer levels are at 50% in some units.  Command and control are key to maintaining an operational Defence Forces.  To have command and control, one needs to be close to one's troops but that is not the current situation in the Defence Forces.  This is a clear example of where the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces organisation have diverged, with the Department clearly winning out in this case.<br\/><br\/>I thank every Deputy who contributed sincerely to this debate.  I acknowledge the constructive nature of Labour Party and Sinn F&eacute;in amendments.  Neither proposed to delete anything from the Fianna F&aacute;il motion and only sought to add to it.  In that spirit I wish to be as accommodating as possible.  This motion is not about me or any party but about the Defence Forces and those who serve in them.  It is a shame that Deputies Mick Barry and Br&iacute;d Smith who exited the Chamber fairly swiftly did not appreciate that and are more concerned as usual with having a go at Fianna F&aacute;il than with making a genuine contribution to the issue at hand.  There is a lot of merit in the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment and I am happy to accept parts (<i>a<\/i>) and (<i>b<\/i>), as previously discussed, but unfortunately I, on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, will not be able to accept part 1(<i>c<\/i>).  If Sinn F&eacute;in had inserted a part (<i>d<\/i>) to the amendment about the domestic terms of employment of the Defence Forces, we would have been happy to accept it.<br\/><br\/>There is clearly a crisis in the Defence Forces.  This has come to the fore in recent years.  I appreciate that it was not all the Minister of State's doing.  He was handed a very depleted organisation by his predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, who has happened to walk away scot free on this.  The Minister of State will have been made aware by me and other Deputies in the past year of the serious deficiencies in the Defence Forces and the fact we are lacking key skilled personnel.  We are haemorrhaging people at an alarming rate, but to date the Minister of State has not put forward any retention policy to show how he is going to address that issue.  We will not sit here and hear him talk about the ongoing efforts of the recruitment campaign.  While it is commendable and necessary, it does not address the lack of a retention policy in order that we can keep the personnel we need.  In the light of Brexit, an ever-changing international defence environment and emerging threats that the Minister or I may not be able to see at the moment but could be there tomorrow, we need to ensure the Defence Forces are adequately resourced, fit for purpose and able to adapt and respond to the challenges our country may face.  In the light of this, the motion is broad and comprehensive and deals directly with those deficiencies.  We call for the re-establishment of the 4th Western Brigade, increased enlistment up to 10,500 and monitoring of the implementation of the White Paper.  All these are very sensible and reasonable suggestions and I commend the motion to the House.  Fianna F&aacute;il is willing to accept parts 1(<i>a<\/i>) and 1(<i>b<\/i>) of the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment but not part 1(<i>c<\/i>).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400055#CCC00400","speaker":"1336","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491340500,"counter":616,"content":"<p>Is the Deputy proposing that the amendment be amended by the deletion of part 1(<i>c<\/i>)?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400056#DDD00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1491340500,"counter":617,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400056#DDD00300","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1491340500,"counter":618,"content":"<p>Amendment to amendment put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1491340500,"counter":619,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 70(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time on Thursday, 6 April 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400056#DDD00500","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Message from Seanad","time":1491340500,"counter":620,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400056#DDD00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1491340500,"counter":621,"content":"<p>Seanad &Eacute;ireann has passed the Knowledge Development Box (Certification of Inventions) Bill 2016 without amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400056#DDD00700","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Bail (Amendment) Bill 2016: Instruction to Committee (Resumed)","time":1491340500,"counter":622,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400056#DDD00800"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1491340500,"counter":623,"content":"<p>The following motion was moved by Deputy David Stanton on Tuesday, 4 April 2017:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1491340500,"counter":624,"content":"<p>I re-emphasise that it is unsatisfactory that members of the Committee on Justice and Equality who are meeting tomorrow at 9 a.m. are being asked to deal with wholly new amendments in respect of the Bail (Amendment) Bill.  The amendments are such that the T&aacute;naiste has seen fit to amend the Title of the legislation, and instead of the Bail (Amendment) Bill, we will now be dealing with a Criminal Justice Act 2017 if it gets through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton, gave two reasons for the urgency that has been inputted into this matter.  First, the Garda Commissioner has requested that consideration be given to making statutory provision for detention under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 of individuals who are severely intoxicated.  The Minister of State has also said that it is the T&aacute;naiste's wish that these provisions be commenced sooner rather than later.  These may be genuine objectives on the part of the Garda Commissioner and the T&aacute;naiste but it is unsatisfactory that such significant amendments and such changes to legislation are being made in this way.  Notwithstanding that, it is important that we get on with our business tomorrow morning at the Committee on Justice and Equality.  I will deal with the substance of the amendments tomorrow morning, should this motion be approved.
