Some 114,000 children are expected to benefit, many of whom will be children of stay-at-home parents. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore the current targeted childcare schemes are available to families where parents are in receipt of certain social welfare payments, medical cards, or GP Visit cards, again many of whom are stay-at-home parents. <\/p>  <p>  A universal childcare subsidy is available to all parents of children under the age of three, or whenever the child becomes eligible for ECCE, regardless of whether parents are working or not. The Affordable Childcare Scheme, ACS, which is under development will make childcare subsidies available on the basis of family income and will be available to stay-at-home parents. This is underpinned by the Childcare Support Act 2018.<\/p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding for local parent and toddler groups to organise activities for parents and young children in the community to support their development through play. Working parents and stay-at-home parents participate.  <\/p>  <p>  More widely across Government, there are various initiatives that support stay-at-home parents.

The final report was received by the Board in February 2017.<\/p>  <p>  It is imperative that a report of this kind should observe due process and fair procedures, so that all persons referred to are treated appropriately. The Board of Oberstown has taken legal advice on the question of publication. <\/p>  <p>  On the basis of careful examination, the Board was not in a position to satisfy itself, or me, that fair procedures had been applied before the report was finalised and submitted. In light of this advice, and of my own careful consideration of the matter, I have concluded that it is not appropriate to publish the full report.<\/p>  <p>  However, the recommendations of the report, all of which are at the kernel of how we move forward, were published in July 2017 and are being implemented as part of a significant package of reform in Oberstown. <\/p>  <p>  I am pleased that over the past 2 years there is evidence of positive change in the day to day operations. I met with some young people when I visited Oberstown on a number of occasions in recent months. These young people were anxious that the many positives about Oberstown should be highlighted.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the Operational Review, the Board commissioned a number of other reports at the same time, with a view to engaging external expertise to support the development of the Campus. These reviews included security, health and safety and behaviour management.<\/p>  <p>  I established a Review Implementation Group which began work in March 2017 and has collated, categorised and analysed these recommendations. The Group&rsquo;s final report, received in December 2017, produced a coherent plan to implement the various recommendations. Many of the recommendations are matters relating to the operations of the Campus. <\/p>  <p>  Others relate to the oversight, strategy and policy activity of both the Board of Management and the Irish Youth Justice Service within my Department. The updated Action Plan from the Review Implementation Group was completed in May 2018 and was published on my Department&rsquo;s website. <\/p>  <p>  HIQA is authorised by me under Sections 185 and 186 of the Children Act 2001 to undertake inspections of Oberstown Children Detention Campus. The most recent was an unannounced inspection over 5 days last March. <\/p>  <p>  In this context, HIQA accepted an invitation from Oberstown to review the report of the Operational Review. I would hope that the report of the findings from the inspection, which is due to be published shortly, will reflect the positive improvements at Oberstown. I understand the report will be published in the next few weeks.<\/p>  <p>  A key priority for my Department is the implementation of key recommendations to bring about improvements in standards, which is now well underway. My Department will support and, where appropriate, monitor the changes which need to take place to ensure that international standards and best practice are observed and that any barriers or challenges to maintaining an ethos of care are identified and addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092000049#WRA01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Family Resource Centres","counter":17,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092000049#WRA01600"},{"type":"question","counter":18,"qnumday":16,"qnumall":"[37972\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092000049#WRA01700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her views on whether family resource centres are in receipt of an appropriate level of funding; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":19,"content":"<p>Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, administers the Family Resource Centre Programme. <\/p><p>Among my key priorities for 2018 was further investment in Family Resource Centres in local communities that deliver services to families, especially in disadvantaged areas across the country. <\/p><p>In 2018, I was pleased to secure a budget allocation of some &euro;753 million for Tusla, an increase of some &euro;40 million over 2017. <\/p><p>This increase in funding included an additional allocation of some &euro;3 million for the Family Resource Centre Programme, bringing the total funding this year to &euro;16.5m. <\/p><p>The investment has allowed Tusla to expand the Programme this year, with the inclusion of 11 additional centres, which brings the total number of Family Resource Centres to 120. <\/p><p>I allocated additional funding of up to &euro;10,000 to all pre-existing Family Resource Centres this year.

My Department will continue to monitor this situation as registrations are received for the 2018\/19 programme year. <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, I recognise that there can be pressure in some localities.

A recent survey conducted by ICTU found that childcare costs sit alongside housing costs within the top two out of pocket expenses for families and this can only be amplified in the case of lone parents. This is consistent with more extensive research elsewhere. The early years sector has suffered from historical underinvestment over the last decades, resulting in Ireland lagging behind the European average for investment in this critical infrastructure. <\/p>  <p>  It is for this reason that I have worked tirelessly since becoming Minister for Children &amp;amp; Youth Affairs to address this issue affecting so many Irish families. The investment in this sector has increased by 80% over the period 2015- 2018. Last year I introduced a range of measures focused on lowering the cost of childcare including a new non means tested subsidy of up to &euro;1,040 for young children under three years of age and an increase of up to 50% in targeted subsidy rates for families that need it most with up to &euro;145 per week available to children up to 15 years of age. <\/p>  <p>  The response to these measures has been extremely positive.

The development of the IT and administrative infrastructure for the Affordable Childcare Scheme is also continuing apace.

The scheme will provide financial support for parents, establish a sustainable platform for investment in the childcare sector for decades to come and- crucially- allow us to continue to invest in giving our children the best start in life.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation establishing the new Affordable Childcare Scheme, the Childcare Support Act 2018, was signed by the President on Monday, 2nd July.  The Act will be underpinned by detailed secondary legislation and formal policy guidelines.  Work is currently ongoing on both of these and also on the development of regulations to provide, for the first time, for the registration of school-age childcare services by the Tusla Early Years Inspectorate.  These latter regulations will be introduced in advance of the Affordable Childcare Scheme to allow school-age childcare services to register and thereby participate in the scheme from its inception.    <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the ICT system to underpin the scheme, my Department recently concluded a full open tender public procurement process and I have awarded a contract for the development of the system.  The launch of the scheme is dependent on this ICT system.  As such, now that a contractor is in place, my officials are finalising a detailed project plan and I will shortly confirm and communicate a planned start date for the Affordable Childcare Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Work is also progressing well on the administrative and communication elements of the scheme.  This includes significant work in preparing timely and user-friendly information, resources and supports for parents, providers and other stakeholders.  In tandem with the development of these resources, I am also committed to ongoing consultation and engagement with all stakeholders in the run-up to the introduction of the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The Affordable Childcare Scheme is ambitious in scale and complex in its design but I am delighted that we are making good progress and confident of the lasting impact it will have once launched. <\/p>  <p>  In order to fast-track some of the benefits of the new scheme, last September I introduced a series of measures to make childcare more affordable for Irish families. These involved an increase of up to 50% in current targeted childcare subsidy rates and a new universal subsidy for all children aged between 6 months and 3 years who are in a Tusla-registered setting.  To date, these measures have seen very good take-up rates and 84,000 children have benefited. The measures will continue to be available over 2018 and 2019, remaining in place until the Affordable Childcare Scheme goes live.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092000049#WRA06900","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Abuse Reports","counter":71,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092000049#WRA07000"},{"type":"question","counter":72,"qnumday":35,"qnumall":"[38030\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092000049#WRA07100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the status of a report (details supplied); the implications for the funding of the organisation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1284","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":73,"content":"<p>Scouting Ireland commissioned Mr Ian Elliott to carry out a review into the organisation&rsquo;s handling of an allegation of a serious sexual assault on an adult volunteer by another adult volunteer.  I have not yet received a copy of this report.<\/p>  <p>  While this alleged assault took place in 2009, it was only reported within the organisation in 2016.  Following on from Mr Elliott's report on child protection matters, Scouting Ireland engaged a barrister to conduct a full investigation into this allegation, particularly with regard to the handling of the matter by certain senior volunteers.  I will be receiving both reports once the investigation is completed.<\/p>  <p>  In 2017 Scouting Ireland previously engaged Mr Ian Elliott to conduct a review of its child safeguarding\/protection policies and procedures.  An interim report was produced in October 2017 and a final report was produced in January 2018.  Both of these reports were subsequently submitted to my Department in March 2018.<\/p>  <p>  In view of the information available to me relating to the governance arrangements within Scouting Ireland I decided, in April this year, to withhold the drawdown of further funding to the organisation under the Youth Service Grant Scheme until I could be satisfied that the organisation's governance standards were up to the required level.<\/p>  <p>  In May, I appointed Ms Jillian van Turnhout, as an independent expert, to examine the governance and related issues within Scouting Ireland. In accordance with her Terms of Reference she was asked to provide me with a clear assessment of Scouting Ireland's governance arrangements.  Ms van Turnhout submitted her final report on the Review of Scouting Ireland to me on 14th June. The report contained a number of recommendations in the areas of safeguarding, management of the organisation, governance proposals and charities regulation.  Ms van Turnhout also indicated that the restoration of funding to Scouting Ireland should be clearly linked to the successful implementation of these recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  The Board of Scouting Ireland subsequently confirmed its decision to fully implement all the recommendations contained in the Review of Scouting Ireland report. On 25th June I decided to provide Scouting Ireland with interim funding for a further three month period up until the end of September.  This funding was provided in view of the significant progress achieved by Scouting Ireland in the implementation of a number of the required recommendations and to provide it with an opportunity to implement the outstanding recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  In providing this interim funding I requested that Scouting Ireland provide me with a further report by 24th September detailing progress in the implementation of the outstanding recommendations contained in the Review of Scouting Ireland.  On receipt of this report I will be in a position to consider if Scouting Ireland has achieved the strong governance standards required of organisations in receipt of public funding which would allow for the full restoration of funding to Scouting Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  My hope is that Scouting Ireland will address all the outstanding issues relating to the standards of governance within the organisation.  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I believe the organisation does very good work and I would love to see it continue to play an important role in the lives of our children and young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092000049#WRA07200","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":74,"content":"<p>Question No. 36 answered with Question No. 15.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":75,"content":"<p>Question No. 37 answered with Question No. 33.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":78,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092000050#WRB00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":77,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092000050#WRB00200"},{"type":"question","counter":78,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[38054\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092000050#WRB00300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the land his Department or agencies under its remit own in County Meath; the location of same; the use to which the land is put; the location of the land that is vacant, not in use or being used for agricultural purposes; the land which has been made available to Meath County Council or other housing agencies for the purpose of house building; and the amount of this land that could be made available for housing.","asker":"1235","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":79,"content":"<p>The following properties in Co.

Although Bahrain has repeatedly stated its commitment to improving its human rights record and safeguarding human rights as enshrined in the Bahraini Constitution, there are ongoing instances of violations of fundamental freedoms there, including violations of freedom of opinion and expression.

A legally operable &lsquo;backstop&rsquo; which avoids a hard border and protects the integrity of the single market is essential for agreeing the Withdrawal Agreement, so as to provide the certainty that no matter what the outcome of the negotiations on the future relationship, there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  While our preference would be to see these issues resolved through the future relationship, this &lsquo;backstop&rsquo; must be legally operable and, in the event that it is triggered, must be in place unless and until another solution is found. It cannot be temporary. This is what we agreed to, and what the UK committed to in December last year, and it is what the EU will hold them to.<\/p>  <p>  On Tuesday I met with Michel Barnier and heard from him his assessment that it is time to &lsquo;de-dramatise&rsquo; the Protocol and focus on agreeing the workable solutions that it offers at its core. Ireland fully supports this approach. Barnier confirmed once again his view that without a backstop there can be no Withdrawal Agreement. <\/p>  <p>  This support was echoed by our partner EU27 Member States at the GAC Article 50 the same day, and I remain grateful to them for the unity displayed in recognition of this as an essential element of the Withdrawal Agreement. <\/p>  <p>  Both sets of negotiators have committed to bringing new energy to the talks, including on the Irish specific issues, and I welcome this.

This decision was based on Article 41.3.1 of the Constitution where the State pledges to protect the institution of marriage. The decision held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.   <\/p>  <p>  Where a couple is cohabiting, rather than married or in a civil partnership, each partner is treated for the purposes of tax as a separate and unconnected individual. Because they are treated separately for tax purposes, tax credits, tax bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other. Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership which is why they are not accorded similar treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law.<\/p>  <p>  From a practical perspective, it would be very difficult to administer a regime for cohabitants which would be the same as that for married couples or civil partners. Married couples and civil partners have a verifiable official confirmation of their status. It would be difficult, intrusive and time-consuming to confirm declarations by individuals that they were actually cohabiting and it would be difficult to establish when cohabitation started or ceased.  Furthermore, while there may be an advantage in tax legislation for a married couple or civil partners as regards the partial transferability of the standard rate band and tax credits, their legal status as spouses\/civil partners has wider consequences from a tax perspective both for themselves and persons connected with them. To counter tax avoidance, numerous restrictive provisions regarding transactions between \"connected persons\" are contained in the various Tax Acts and the definition of \"connected persons\" extends to relatives and children of spouses and civil partners. Such provisions could be very difficult to prove and enforce in respect of persons connected with a cohabiting couple where the couple has no legal recognition.<\/p>  <p>  To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances while at the same time respecting the constitutional requirements to protect the institution of marriage. Any change to the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092000050#WRB04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Revenue Commissioners Enforcement Activity","counter":116,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092000050#WRB04100"},{"type":"question","counter":117,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[38107\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092000050#WRB04200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount paid to Revenue Commissioners sheriffs in poundage fees payments for each of the past three years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":118,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that the execution of Revenue warrants by Sheriffs in respect of tax debts is specifically provided for in Section 960 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, as amended. <\/p>  <p>  Sheriffs are entitled to fees and expenses in relation to collection of tax debts and\/or seizure of goods.

Both the Minister of State for Financial Services and Insurance, Mr. Michael D&rsquo;Arcy TD, and I are very conscious of the problems arising from false or exaggerated personal injury claims and the impact that the volatility in insurance prices generally in the last few years has had on Alliance members, as well as other businesses and organisations.<\/p>  <p>  Minister D&rsquo;Arcy has formally met with the Alliance on a number of occasions, mostly recently on Tuesday last (September 18), and issues related to the Alliance&rsquo;s &ldquo;10 asks&rdquo; were discussed to some level of detail, including the four specifically related to the issue of insurance fraud highlighted in the Alliance&rsquo;s press release last week.<\/p>  <p>  All four relevant issues were comprehensively examined and considered by the Cost of Insurance Working Group in the course of producing its two reports, namely the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance and the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance.  Indeed, at least two of the four measures proposed by the Alliance are in the process of being implemented.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality has prepared Draft Heads in relation to amending section 8 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 to ensure defendants are notified within one month of a claim having been lodged against their policy and it is expected that the amendments will be progressed by the end of the year. <\/p>  <p>  Pursuant to Recommendation 13 from the Liability Insurance Report, a procedure to ensure exaggerated and misleading claims are referred to the Garda&iacute; for investigation and prosecution, if appropriate, has been established. In particular, a new set of guidelines in respect of the reporting of suspected fraudulent insurance claims has been agreed between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and insurance entities.  These guidelines are due to become operational shortly.  A separate stream of work relates to an examination of the court process in circumstances where the court believes there to be an element of fraud or exaggeration in the claim which should be investigated by the Garda&iacute;. Measures which could be taken to ensure that the appropriate action is taken in such circumstances are being examined.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, another &ldquo;spin-off&rdquo; occurrence from the implementation of this recommendation has been a commitment for the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and Insurance Ireland&rsquo;s Anti-Fraud Forum to meet on a regular basis in order to discuss and act upon current and ongoing general issues which arise in the area of insurance fraud.  This positive development is an opportunity for greater communication and improved processes and it is hoped that it will lead to a better understanding on both sides of the issues arising in the investigation and reporting of fraud.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the establishment of a dedicated Garda insurance fraud unit, Insurance Ireland communicated the outcome of its cost\/benefit analysis at the start of July 2018, recommending industry funding of such a unit.  I understand that the new Garda Commissioner has yet to form a view on the proposal, and there are a number of serious issues which will require further consideration before any decision whether or not to proceed in this manner is taken.  It is important to note that while the idea of a dedicated Garda Fraud Unit has been the focus of a lot of attention, it was in fact one proposal within the overarching Recommendation 26 in the Motor Report which called for &ldquo;further cooperation between the insurance sector and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to insurance fraud investigation\", and, as outlined above, significant progress has been achieved in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, in relation to the proposal to regulate claims management companies, my officials have been looking at this issue to understand the precise scale and nature of the perceived problem. Engagement has taken place with the relevant regulatory authority in the UK, as well as relevant parties here, including the Law Society of Ireland and the insurance industry.  It should be noted that the Law Society has taken a very proactive role against &ldquo;claims harvesting&rdquo; websites operating in Ireland, and its investigations have led to a number of websites having been taken down over the past couple of years.  I understand that the number of such websites operating in Ireland has decreased significantly over the past couple of years overall, but my officials will continue to examine this issue and take appropriate action accordingly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092000050#WRB06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Reports","counter":135,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092000050#WRB06100"},{"type":"question","counter":136,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[38196\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092000050#WRB06200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the progress to date in implementing the report of the cost of insurance working group; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":137,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the Cost of Insurance Working Group undertook an examination of the factors contributing to the cost of insurance in order to identify what short, medium and long-term measures could be introduced to help reduce the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses.  <\/p>  <p>  The initial focus of the Working Group was the issue of rising motor insurance premiums and the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017, containing 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions.<\/p>  <p>  In its second phase, the Working Group examined the cost of business insurance, in particular employer liability insurance and public liability insurance.  This work culminated in the publication in January 2018 of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance, with 15 recommendations and 29 associated actions to be carried out.<\/p>  <p>  Both of the primary Reports contain an Action Plan, setting out the agreed timelines for implementation, and also a commitment that the Working Group will prepare quarterly updates on its progress.  The Working Group has published six such updates, most recently in August.  <\/p>  <p>  The Sixth Quarterly Update shows that 58 of the 71 deadlines placed on actions across the two reports to date have been completed.  One of the actions achieved during this time was the delivery of the final report of the Personal Injuries Commission, which merges the content of what had been intended to be two reports.  This report was published on Tuesday this week and the implementation of its key recommendations should have an impact upon the awarding of personal injury damages in the future.<\/p>  <p>  As well as the actions which have been finalised, it is important also to consider the continued progress being made on some of the large scale actions.  One area of significant progress has been the markedly enhanced levels of engagement and cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the insurance industry since the creation of the Fraud Roundtable.  This has led not only to the agreement of a protocol between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and insurers in relation to the reporting of suspected fraudulent personal injury claims but also a commitment for the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and Insurance Ireland&rsquo;s Anti-Fraud Forum to meet on a regular basis in order to discuss and act upon current and ongoing relevant issues in this area.<\/p>  <p>  Much progress has also been made on putting in place a National Claims Information Database with the recently published Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Bill 2018.  The second stage debate on that legislation is scheduled to take place in the D&aacute;il today.  The enactment of this Bill will provide us with much greater insight into, in particular, the identification of settlement channel information which should lead to a greater consistency in award levels and a greater use of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  This would result in a more stable claims environment, in turn positively influencing the price of insurance paid by consumers. <\/p>  <p>  I believe that the reforms which we have been implementing since January 2017 are already showing positive results.  The cost of private motor insurance as measured by the Central Statistics Office on a monthly basis has fallen by over 20% since the high premiums seen in July 2016.  I appreciate that these figures represent a broad average however we have to recognise that these are the same figures that showed the large increase that many commentators regularly reference.  Therefore, I think it has to be recognised that the overall trend currently is downward, which is welcome.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092000050#WRB06300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Yield","counter":138,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092000050#WRB06400"},{"type":"question","counter":139,"qnumday":59,"qnumall":"[38199\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092000050#WRB06500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the revenue received from the vehicle registration tax in the past five years and to date for 2018 by CO2 bands in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":140,"content":"<p>I am informed by Revenue that the receipts received from the Vehicle Registration Tax in the past five years and to July 2018 by CO2 bands is as set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>Bands<\/th><th>2013<\/th><th>2014<\/th><th>2015<\/th><th>2016<\/th><th>2017<\/th><th>2018*<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>gCO2\/km<\/td><td>&euro;m<\/td><td>&euro;m<\/td><td>&euro;m<\/td><td>&euro;m<\/td><td>&euro;m<\/td><td>&euro;m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>A1 (0 - 80)<\/td><td>0.08<\/td><td>0.39<\/td><td>1.60<\/td><td>4.45<\/td><td>6.39<\/td><td>8.90<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>A2 (81-100)<\/td><td>26.94<\/td><td>59.93<\/td><td>85.01<\/td><td>109.76<\/td><td>102.66<\/td><td>70.82<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>A3 (101-110)<\/td><td>36.18<\/td><td>72.04<\/td><td>136.89<\/td><td>178.51<\/td><td>183.14<\/td><td>146.49<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>A4 (111-120)<\/td><td>116.70<\/td><td>124.44<\/td><td>125.95<\/td><td>189.80<\/td><td>198.97<\/td><td>176.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>A5 (121-130)<\/td><td>65.64<\/td><td>74.53<\/td><td>84.89<\/td><td>106.83<\/td><td>113.42<\/td><td>105.22<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>A6 (131-140)<\/td><td>89.31<\/td><td>93.67<\/td><td>87.08<\/td><td>77.10<\/td><td>85.35<\/td><td>68.72<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>A7 (141-155)<\/td><td>46.31<\/td><td>46.35<\/td><td>44.86<\/td><td>53.79<\/td><td>53.70<\/td><td>51.50<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>A8 (156-170)<\/td><td>16.31<\/td><td>19.86<\/td><td>21.80<\/td><td>18.59<\/td><td>24.49<\/td><td>21.54<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>A9 (171-190)<\/td><td>11.77<\/td><td>9.07<\/td><td>15.07<\/td><td>15.23<\/td><td>18.73<\/td><td>18.18<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>A10 (191-225)<\/td><td>9.57<\/td><td>12.96<\/td><td>6.54<\/td><td>6.16<\/td><td>6.76<\/td><td>5.37<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>A11 (226 &amp;amp; over)<\/td><td>2.95<\/td><td>3.92<\/td><td>4.35<\/td><td>4.97<\/td><td>4.90<\/td><td>4.17<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total Cars<\/td><td>421.77<\/td><td>517.17<\/td><td>614.03<\/td><td>765.17<\/td><td>798.53<\/td><td>676.92<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total Other Vehicles<\/td><td>15.54<\/td><td>24.93<\/td><td>35.56<\/td><td>49.04<\/td><td>42.07<\/td><td>42.62<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total Net Receipts<\/td><td>437.31<\/td><td>542.10<\/td><td>649.59<\/td><td>814.21<\/td><td>840.60<\/td><td>719.54<\/td><\/tr><\/table>*provisional data as at end July 2018<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092000050#WRB06600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vehicle Registration","counter":141,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092000050#WRB06700"},{"type":"question","counter":142,"qnumday":60,"qnumall":"[38200\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092000050#WRB06800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the impact of the new worldwide harmonised light vehicle test procedure on the vehicle registration tax; if VRT is likely to increase due to the new test; the amount by which it is expected to increase; when the WLTP will be in use for VRT purposes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":143,"content":"<p>Ireland&rsquo;s Vehicle Registration Tax regime is based on CO2 emissions in order to encourage the purchase of vehicles with lower CO2 emissions.

In relation to single teacher schools generally with an enrolment of 15 or more pupils the school can apply to the staffing appeal board for a second post where the single teacher has children across 6 or more class groups.  <\/p><p>Improvements to the staffing schedule announced in Budget 2018 brings the teacher allocation ratio in all primary schools to the most favourable ever seen at primary level and these improvements were introduced in the current school year.<\/p><p>The staffing process includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit a staffing appeal under certain criteria, including small schools that were affected by the Budget 2012 changes, to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board. <\/p><p>Any additional improvement in the pupil teacher ratio would have to be considered as part of the next annual budgetary process, alongside the many other demands from the education sector. <\/p><p>The enrolment thresholds required for 2, 3 and 4 teacher schools since 2010 are as follows.<table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th><\/th><th>2 teacher school<\/th><th><\/th><th>3 teacher school<\/th><th><\/th><th>4 teacher school<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Appointment<\/td><td>Retention<\/td><td>Appointment<\/td><td>Retention<\/td><td>Appointment<\/td><td>Retention<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010\/2011<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>49<\/td><td>49<\/td><td>81<\/td><td>81<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011\/2012<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>49<\/td><td>49<\/td><td>81<\/td><td>81<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012\/2013<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>51<\/td><td>51<\/td><td>83<\/td><td>83<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013\/2014<\/td><td>17<\/td><td>17<\/td><td>54<\/td><td>54<\/td><td>85<\/td><td>85<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014\/2015<\/td><td>20<\/td><td>20<\/td><td>56<\/td><td>56<\/td><td>86<\/td><td>86<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015\/2016<\/td><td>20*<\/td><td>19*<\/td><td>56<\/td><td>53<\/td><td>86<\/td><td>83<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016\/2017<\/td><td>19*<\/td><td>18*<\/td><td>55<\/td><td>52<\/td><td>85<\/td><td>82<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017\/2018<\/td><td>19*<\/td><td>18*<\/td><td>55<\/td><td>52<\/td><td>85<\/td><td>82<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2018\/2019<\/td><td>18*<\/td><td>17*<\/td><td>54<\/td><td>51<\/td><td>84<\/td><td>81<\/td><\/tr><\/table>* A threshold of 15 pupils applied for the appointment and retention of the second teacher in schools situated 8km or more from the nearest school of the same type of patronage and\/or language of instruction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092000051#WRC03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Data","counter":184,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092000051#WRC03500"},{"type":"question","counter":185,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[38123\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092000051#WRC03600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of children in west County Dublin diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder who are leaving primary school and require a secondary school place.","asker":"1434","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":186,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[38124\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092000051#WRC03700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of children in west County Dublin diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder in receipt of home school grants;

This indicates a national ASD prevalence rate of 1.55% or 1 in every 65 students.<\/p><p>The greater proportion of children with ASD attend mainstream class, where they may access additional supports if required. <\/p><p>Some students with ASD, although academically able to access the curriculum in mainstream, may find it too difficult to manage full-time placement there and placement in an ASD special class is an option for them. <\/p><p>Special school placements are provided for other students with ASD and very complex special needs who wouldn&rsquo;t manage in a mainstream school even for part of the week.<\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) which is a separate independent statutory body, plans and co-ordinates the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs, in consultation with the relevant education partners and the Health Service Executive (HSE). The NCSE is responsible, through its network of Special Needs Organisers, for the development and delivery and co-ordination of education services to children with Special Educational Needs, including the establishment of special class and special school placements.<\/p><p>Since 2011, the NCSE has increased the number of such classes by over 130% from 548 in 2011 to 1,456 across the country now, of which 1,192 are Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) special classes. This network includes 129 ASD early intervention classes, 742 primary ASD classes and 321 post-primary ASD classes in mainstream schools.<\/p><p>There are 37 special schools and 235 special classes attached to mainstream schools in Dublin. Of these, 17 are ASD early intervention classes, 138 are primary ASD classes and 40 are post primary ASD classes. The number of ASD special classes in Co. Dublin have increased from 66 in 2011\/2012 to 195 in 2017\/2018.<\/p><p>The NCSE is aware of emerging need from year to year in Dublin, and where special provision is required it is planned and established to meet that need. I have arranged for the Deputy's question on emerging need to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply. <\/p><p>My Department continues to work with the NCSE to ensure that there is appropriate planning in place to ensure that all children who require special class placements can access such placements in schools within their communities.  <\/p><p>All children must be enrolled in the primary school system, whether through placement in mainstream classes, in special classes or in special schools in the September prior to their sixth birthday.<\/p><p>Where there is no placement available for a child with Special Educational Needs, my Department will consider applications under the Home Tuition Grant Scheme, where a student can receive up to 20 hours home tuition per week as an interim measure until a placement becomes available.<\/p><p>Applications can be made at any point of the school year, based on when the child receives a diagnosis and recommendation for a specialised placement.  <\/p><p>The Home Tuition Grant Scheme also makes provision for early educational intervention for children with ASD aged 3 &ndash; 5 years seeking an early intervention placement who meet the scheme&rsquo;s criteria. <\/p><p>Over the course of the 2017\/18 school year, 60 children with special education needs over the age of 6 availed of this interim provision (20 in Co. Dublin).<\/p><p>Over the course of the 2017\/18 school year, 804 children aged 3-5 years of age availed of home tuition provision. (330 in Co. Dublin).<\/p><p>Statistics for the current school year are not readily available. While the scheme has commenced, Statistics have yet to emerge as the Department has only begun to receive applications under the 2018\/19 scheme.<\/p><p>The cost of providing funding for 1 child towards the provision of 20 hours home tuition per week during the 2017\/18 school year was approx. &euro;31,000 per annum.<\/p><p>The NCSE also works in collaboration with the Educational Welfare Services (EWS) of the Child and Family Agency which is the statutory agency that can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child or can offer assistance where a child is out of school. The local service is delivered through the national network of Educational Welfare Officers (EWO). Contact details are available at .<\/p><p>Circular 11\/95 and the Rules for National Schools provide that the minimum length of the normal full school day at primary level comprises of a period of not less than 5 hours and forty minutes (www).<\/p><p>The Rules for National Schools also provide that pupils in infant classes may have a school day that is one hour shorter than the length of the normal school day. <\/p><p>It is a matter for the Board of Management of a particular school to decide whether this concession should be applied in the case of its school. If pupils in infant classes are being given a shorter day, their parents should be notified accordingly and invited to collect them at time of dismissal.<\/p><p>Where the implementation of the shorter day for pupils in infant classes may cause issues for some parents, the Department would encourage school authorities to engage with parents locally with a view to arriving at a mutually acceptable resolution.<\/p><p>The Department does not support the position of any school which may take a unilateral decision to shorten the school day for any pupil, irrespective of whether the pupil may have a special educational need or not. It is the position of the Department that all school children are entitled to participate fully in their school. If there are reasons why an earlier finishing time should be applied in the case of any child, any such arrangements should be agreed with the parents of the child in advance of their implementation.<\/p><p>As per the EWS guidelines on a code of behaviour, suspending a child for part of a school day (or reducing their hours without the parent&rsquo;s agreement to do this) is considered a suspension.<\/p><p>If a child is suspended like this for more than 20 school days in a school year, the parent can decide to take a Section 29 appeal if they wish.<\/p><p>My Department does not hold information on specifics of special needs for parents taking appeals under Section 29 and accordingly the figures requested by the Deputy in relation to the number of children with Autism that may be either on reduced hours or excluded from school is not readily available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092000051#WRC03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pupil-Teacher Ratio","counter":189,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092000051#WRC04200"},{"type":"question","counter":190,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[38134\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092000051#WRC04300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the estimated cost of each one point reduction in the primary school pupil-teacher ratio.","asker":"1222","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":191,"content":"<p>The criteria used for the allocation of teaching posts is published annually on the Department website.

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.  <\/p>  <p>  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:<\/p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,<\/p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,<\/p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, I announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022).  This announcement follows nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country and the 4-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the new schools announced, there will be a need for further school accommodation in other areas in the future.  Based on the current analysis, this need can be addressed through either planned capacity increases in existing schools or additional accommodation or extensions to existing schools. <\/p>  <p>  While the announcement did not include a new post-primary school in Kinnegad (which is located in the Killucan school planning area), I have highlighted that the requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular would have regard for the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092000051#WRC07400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teachers' Remuneration","counter":223,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092000052#WRD00200"},{"type":"question","counter":224,"qnumday":88,"qnumall":"[38212\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092000052#WRD00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he has received a submission from a group (details supplied) advocating changes to the pay and conditions of teachers and principals, including issues pertaining to the allocation of a release day per week to principals, the creation of national clusters of panels to enable release time to be covered and the restoration of pay equality to all teachers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":225,"content":"<p>The Department received a submission from the National Principals' Forum in September 2018. <\/p>  <p>  Building on measures in previous budgets to enhance school leadership, Budget 2018 made &euro;0.4 million available to fund almost 4600 additional release days for teaching principals in primary schools. This additional funding will see an increase in the number of release days available to teaching principals in the 2018\/19 school year to 17, 23, or 29 days depending on the size of the school. <\/p>  <p>  I recently announced an extension to the arrangements for school with teaching principals to cluster their release days into full time posts, with one teacher covering the release days of all the schools in the cluster. Up to 50 principal release cluster posts will be put in place for the 2018\/19 school year.

The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledges that, during the financial crisis, there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education). Addressing any issues arising from changes which are not specifically detailed in the report would give rise to additional costs over and above the foregoing figures.<\/p>  <p>  The matter of new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector alone.

Further talks were held on the 27th of April with all public service unions in relation to new entrant pay.

The objective of the Working Group is to identify and examine the drivers of the cost of insurance, and recommend short, medium and longer term measures to address the issue of increasing insurance costs, taking account of the requirement for the need to ensure a financially stable insurance sector. A significant factor identified by the Working Group in its reports, which are available with action updates on the Department of Finance website, is the impact of fraudulent insurance claims. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to workplace health and safety, it should be noted that responsibility for policy in this area, and for the governance of the Health and Safety Authority, rests with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation which also includes the Personal Injuries Assessment Board within its remit and advocates across Government to ensure the needs of small and medium size enterprise are taken into account in the execution of national policy.  Both that Department and my own and a number of the key State Bodies concerned are, therefore, represented on the Cost of Insurance Working Group and are working together on the implementation of its recommendations. Moreover, the relevant representative bodies of the business and enterprise sectors are actively engaging with the Working Group in making their respective concerns known.<\/p>  <p>  In its Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance published in January 2017, the Working Group reviewed sections 25 and 26 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004.  Section 25 deals with false evidence and provides that a person who gives false or misleading evidence in a personal injuries action is guilty of an offence.  Section 26 deals with fraudulent actions and provides for the dismissal by the court of a personal injuries action where the plaintiff gives evidence that is false or misleading. <\/p>  <p>  The Cost of Insurance Working Group noted that the number of recorded prosecutions and convictions for the offence of false evidence in section 25 is very low and that this suggests a need for further co-operation between the insurance industry and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Working Group noted its understanding that while the majority of the initial applications in respect of fraudulent actions under section 26 were refused it would appear from more recent reported judgments that more claims are now being dismissed following a successful action under section 26. The Working Group concluded that it is satisfied that sections 25 and 26 do not need further review. <\/p>  <p>  However, a number of other measures are being taken by way of ensuring that sections 25 and 26 can have their intended effect in relation to insurance fraud. Key to this approach has been the convening of a roundtable by the Department of Finance in late 2017 to listen to the views of key stakeholders in relation to insurance fraud and which has met several times since to progress a number of specific recommendations contained in the Cost of Insurance Working Group&rsquo;s Report of January 2018 relating to the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance. <\/p>  <p>  Recommendations 11 and 12 of that report concern the production of statistics by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service on complaints, investigations, prosecutions and convictions relating to fraud within the personal injuries area. My Department has actively engaged with the Garda authorities and the Courts Service this year in relation to the implementation of these recommendations, and I am informed that a Garda PULSE release comprising a number of new fraud incident types, including insurance fraud, will go live on 27 September 2018. This PULSE release will facilitate the production of statistics on complaints, investigations, prosecutions and convictions relating to insurance fraud by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 13 of the same report recommends that Insurance Ireland, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions agree a set of guidelines in respect of the reporting of suspected fraudulent insurance claims. While guidelines were published in 2004, the Working Group noted that these were used to a very limited extent over the years. The Working Group proposed that a new set of guidelines should be developed, using the 2004 iteration as a starting point. In line with the intention to use the existing guidelines to inform the drafting of new, more fit for purpose guidelines, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na produced a draft document, which proposed a number of changes to the section of the existing guidelines concerning the station or section within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to which a formal complaint should be made. Insurance Ireland signalled its agreement with the changes proposed, following which further consultations were arranged with other key stakeholders, including insurance providers not represented by Insurance Ireland. I understand that the guidelines are now ready to be finalised, in the context of all of the feedback received, and the intention is to publish the guidelines by the end of the current month. <\/p>  <p>  As I think the Deputy will appreciate from these developments, a concerted policy approach is being taken with the support of the Cost of Insurance Working Group to address the issue of insurance fraud including as it impacts on small and medium enterprises and the broader business community. This is being done by means of a series of mutually reinforcing measures. At the same time they are intended, in their collective implementation, to give greater effect to the existing provisions of sections 25 and 26 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092000052#WRD06700","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Resources","counter":289,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092000052#WRD06800"},{"type":"question","counter":290,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[38203\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092000052#WRD06900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to restore the budgets for the Garda divisions in the northern region which were recently reduced; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that such reductions impede the essential policing requirements of Border divisions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":291,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that the Garda Commissioner is the Accounting Officer for the Garda Vote and as such is responsible for the effective and efficient use of the resources at his disposal.

The report of the Commission has approached policing from a fresh perspective and has redefined policing as a multi-disciplinary, cross agency effort built on the foundation of protecting human rights.

The penalty on conviction for this offence is a fine of up to &euro;1,270 for a first offence and up to &euro;1,904 for a second or subsequent offence. In addition, the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2000 provides for the mandatory temporary closure of licensed premises in cases where a licensee is convicted of an offence under section 31 of the 1988 Act (up to 7 days for a first offence, or at least 7 and not more than 30 days for a second or subsequent offence).<\/p>  <p>  Under section 17(3) of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003, it is an offence for a licensee, with intent to evade the conditions of the licence, to take intoxicating liquor from the licensed premises for the purpose of its being sold on the account or for the benefit or profit of the licensee, or to permit any other person to do so.

The Parliament voted to endorse its approach at its plenary session on 12 September. Trialogue negotiations are now expected to begin in early October.<\/p>  <p>  I fully support the proposed Directive which is vitally important to both the digital economy and to rightholders seeking greater protection of their works in the digital age.  Our focus has always been on achieving the best balance for the competing interests of all stakeholders, including digital economy actors, rightsholders, and citizens.  To that end, there has been extensive engagement with stakeholders across the various issues in Ireland, Brussels, and with other EU Member States, including at Ministerial level. <\/p>  <p>  My Department will engage positively with the negotiations on the proposal going forward to ensure that Ireland can benefit from its many merits as soon as possible. <\/p>  <p>  In the domestic context, the Deputy will also be aware that Minister Halligan is currently progressing the Copyright and Other Intellectual Property Law Provisions Bill 2018 (the &ldquo;Copyright Bill&rdquo;) through the Houses of the Oireacthas.

This Bill incorporates the patient safety elements of the Health Information and Patient Safety Bill, dealing with the external notification of patient safety incidents, clinical audit and extending HIQA's remit to the private health service.  The Bill also provides for the provision of mandatory open disclosure which compliments the provision made by the Houses of the Oireachtas for voluntary open disclosure in the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act, 2017, which comes into effect on 22 September 2018.  <\/p>  <p>My belief in mandatory open disclosure has been further reinforced by Dr Gabriel Scally's recent final report of the Scoping Inquiry into the CervicalCheck Screening Programme.  The report provides an enormous opportunity to examine the system failures in the care process based on patient and family accounts of their experiences and incorporate the learning into ensuring patient safety is paramount to driving and shaping policy.<\/p>  <p>  I have consistently maintained that creating a culture of open disclosure and learning from the things that go wrong is the bedrock of making services safer.  Mandatory open disclosure, is an open and consistent approach to communicating with patients and their families when things go wrong in healthcare.  This includes expressing regret for what has happened, keeping the patient informed, providing feedback on investigations and the steps taken to prevent a recurrence of the adverse event.  The Scally Report clearly identified significant deficits in the current HSE open disclosure policy and HSE\/State Claims Agency guidelines and these account for 5 of the 50 recommendations in the Report.  The Report also makes recommendations in relation to the open disclosure policies of both the Medical Council and CervicalCheck.<\/p>  <p>  The questions raised by the Deputy are service issues and as such I have referred them to the HSE for direct reply.  However, I wish to assure the Deputy that I wrote to the Director General of the HSE in June last, asking him to identify a clear governance framework at national level for open disclosure in the HSE and ensure an update of the HSE Open Disclosure Policy to take into account the current and pending legislation.

At my request, the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) is preparing a report which will make recommendations in relation to the clinical and technical issues involved.  I am informed that following policy actions in relation to mesh by health authorities in the NHS and in Northern Ireland in July 2018, as set out below, further engagements with the HSE, the Health Products Regulatory Agency, the professional bodies and colleagues in other jurisdictions were needed for the purpose of finalising the report.  I am informed that the CMO&rsquo;s Report is anticipated to be completed in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  Pending finalisation of the report, a number of significant system actions in relation to mesh implants have already been advanced.<\/p>  <p>  The CMO wrote to the Acting Director General of the Health Service Executive on 20 July 2018 to request that the Executive put immediate measures in place to: <\/p>  <p>1. Pause the use of all procedures involving uro-gynaecological\/transvaginal mesh implants for the management of Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI) or Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP) in HSE funded hospitals, in cases where it is clinically appropriate and safe to do so. <\/p>  <p>2. Ensure that in situations where expert clinical judgment is that there is an urgency to carry out the procedure and no suitable alternative exists, surgery should proceed only if a delay would risk harm to the patient and should be based on multidisciplinary team decision and fully informed consent.<\/p>  <p>  This pause is to remain in place pending confirmation of implementation by the Health Service Executive, working in conjunction with the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (IOG) and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI), of three urgent recommendations relating to: <\/p>  <p>  (i) Surgical Training, <\/p>  <p>  (ii) Informed Consent and <\/p>  <p>  (iii) the Development of an agreed Dataset of Mesh Procedures.<\/p>  <p>  The Department also wrote to the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and the Continence Foundation of Ireland on requesting that they assist the HSE in progressing these recommendations on an urgent basis.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has published information for patients on its website concerning the pause.<\/p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that there may be concerns that restricting the availability of mesh procedures, particularly SUI mesh procedures, which are widely accepted to be less invasive and more effective than non-mesh alternatives will delay access to treatment procedures for distressing symptoms. Advice received in relation to this is that uro-gynaecological mesh procedures are largely elective procedures and it is not anticipated that a postponement of weeks\/months will materially affect health outcomes for the majority of women affected.  Given the limited number of surgeons and units carrying out these procedures in HSE funded hospitals, it is anticipated that the Executive will be in a position to indicate to the Department that these recommendations have been implemented within a number of months.<\/p>  <p>  The decision to institute a pause in vaginal mesh procedures in HSE funded hospitals followed a review by Department officials, together with representatives of the HSE and the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), of the NHS England decision of Tuesday 10 July to institute a similar &lsquo;pause&rsquo; in their use.  This decision in the NHS followed a recommendation by the Independent Medicines and Medical Devices Safety (IMMDS) Review established in February 2018 by the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, the Rt. Hon Jeremy Hunt MP. On Wednesday July 11, a pause was instigated by health authorities in Northern Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  It has been clarified by the NHS that there is no concurrent change in the evidence base concerning these devices.  The recommendations of the IMMDS to NHS England arose because of a lack of certainty or confidence that critical clinical governance measures to assure the safety of mesh procedures are demonstrably in place.  The Department considers that similar concerns in relation to the visibility and consistency of such measures apply equally in the public health system here.<\/p>  <p>  There is understandable public and patient anxiety about the ongoing safety of mesh devices in light of the considerable publicity that this issue has received and this has been heightened by recent developments in the NHS.  It is important that this be addressed as comprehensively as possible.  A pause on the use of mesh procedures, pending confirmation by the Executive that the recommendations as set out above have been implemented, is considered proportionate and necessary to provide public assurance that these procedures are being carried out in accordance with internationally accepted good practice. <\/p>  <p>   The advice of the HPRA to the Department is that it is supports a temporary restriction on all procedures involving uro-gynaecological\/transvaginal mesh implants, pending the introduction of the further clinical mechanisms proposed relating to the delivery of care for patients.  The regulatory status of uro-gynaecological mesh implants at a European level remains unchanged in that they are CE marked medical devices.  As such, the benefit-risk profile for the devices is considered positive. Ensuring that the use of transvaginal mesh is appropriate and as safe as possible requires, not only that the device is safe and performs as intended, but also that the healthcare system has appropriate measures for patient selection, treatment and follow-up in place. <\/p>  <p>   In relation to the provision of appropriate aftercare for women suffering from mesh complications, including appropriate diagnostic facilities, this has already been identified as one of two priority recommendations for immediate advancement by the Executive in the course of preparation of the CMO&rsquo;s report.  The CMO wrote to the Acting Director General of the HSE, and to the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (IOG), the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI), and the Continence Foundation of Ireland (CFI) on May 28 2018,  requesting that the Executive commence work on (i) the development of appropriate patient information resources and consent materials and (ii) clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering from mesh-related complications, in conjunction with the IOG, the RCSI and the CFI.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed that work has commenced by the National Women and Infants Health Programme (NWIHP) in the HSE to progress all of the recommendations above.  A Learning Notice concerning mesh devices in uro-gynaecological procedures was circulated by the NWIHP on 26 June 2018 to all maternity hospitals and acute hospitals with gynaecological services to highlight the importance of appropriate patient selection, adequate information and consent and also to inform the service providers that a Response Group has been convened to propose remedies for and address the provision of aftercare for complications. This learning notice has been posted on the NWIHP website.<\/p>  <p>  The experiences of women concerned will be an essential element to informing the assessment of need and identifying the aftercare services required.  I am informed that a Synthetic Mesh Devices Advisory Group has been convened by the NWIHP which includes three patient representatives, as well as representatives of the HPRA, the IOG, the RCSI, the CFI and all Hospital Groups to advise on and action all of the recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  This work is ongoing and will include identifying the appropriate specialist clinical expertise and facilities required at hospital group level and nationally to provide comprehensive aftercare services.  It will also include an examination of the role of and requirement for specialist diagnostic services such as translabial scanning.  The outcome of this work will clarify if there is a need to look at sourcing services from abroad to address any shortfalls identified at national level, either through utilisation of the treatment abroad scheme or by commissioning services from abroad.<\/p>  <p>  The information provided by the HSE is that approximately 700-800 procedures are carried out annually for pelvic organ prolapse repair and similar numbers of sling procedures for stress urinary incontinence are performed.  However, the HSE Hospital In-patient Enquiry (HIPE) system does not record the numbers of these procedures that involve the implantation of a mesh device.  The HIPE system also does not code for repair or revision procedures which involve the removal of mesh.  Information about mesh procedures and mesh removals in private hospitals is not available at national level.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE advice is that all patients who have experienced complications due to mesh devices are advised to contact their consultant&rsquo;s clinic in the first instance.

The agreement will run for 3 years.<\/p>  <p>  The Child Care Law Reporting Project is an independent project authorised under Section 29 of the Child Care Act 1991 (as amended by the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2007), and in accordance with Regulations made under that Section to report on child care proceedings.  The project is supported in this work by my Department.<\/p>  <p>  These cases reveal the complexities that can arise in child care proceedings and the challenges that arise in certain cases, including delays in obtaining appropriate placements and services for young people with severe therapeutic needs, and the prevalence of substance abuse, learning disabilities and mental health issues among parents in child care cases. The reports clearly highlight the variety and complexity of factors present in certain child care proceedings that come before the courts. The reports also include examples of successful outcomes &ndash; one young man, having spent three years in State care, had turned his life around and was hoping to attend third-level education; there was also an example of family reunification. <\/p>  <p>  Aspects of the reports including the lack of adequate facilities for children with severe psychological and psychiatric needs, and the prolonged nature of court proceedings, especially those involving allegations of child sexual abuse, have received attention in the media. <\/p>  <p>  To address this lack of adequate facilities, Tusla are currently working towards increasing capacity of special care beds. Furthermore, Tusla are aiming to achieve positive outcomes by implementing a new model of care; this will provide staff and young people with a framework that focuses on all aspects of their lives and not just behaviour, leading to improved relationships and understanding of the young person&rsquo;s needs and how, in partnership with them, these needs might be met. It also provides a visible assessment tool where progress can be clearly demonstrated, strengthening and extending the governance process in special care to include the remodeling of the current referrals committee (for special care) and extend and strengthen the governance of special care placements with direct accountability from the Area Managers.

The programme is delivered in 13 areas of disadvantage in Ireland, each led by local consortia who co-ordinate the planning and delivery of a wide range of services and supports in their local area. Each of the ABC sites deliver a range of universal and targeted interventions designed to support parents and improve outcomes for children, from home visiting programmes to community based supports.  <\/p>  <p>  In June 2018, several proposals supporting parenting projects were also awarded once off funding under the Quality and Capacity Building Initiative (QCBI) Innovation Fund. The aim of this funding measure is to support organisations testing out new approaches or programmes in communities around the country, in order to address unmet needs of families with children and young people and their families facing disadvantage. <\/p>  <p>  My Department, as part of its commitment to highlighting the critical importance of parenting in children&rsquo;s lives and influencing social, emotional and physical outcomes, hosted an Open Policy Debate (OPD) on the theme of Parenting Supports in Ireland in May 2018. The OPD gathered stakeholders including policymakers, providers, practitioners and national and international experts from across this sector. The findings from this event are informing the Department&rsquo;s approach to developing the theme of parenting.<\/p>  <p>  My Department operates a number of targeted programmes to support families. CCS (Community Childcare Subvention) is a childcare programme targeted at parents on low income so that they can avail of reduced childcare costs at participating community childcare services. <\/p>  <p>  The CCSP (Plus) programme supports parents on low income to avail of reduced childcare costs at participating privately owned childcare services and at community not-for-profit childcare services. CCSRT (Transitional) is a CCS programme which provides access to free childcare for children of families experiencing homelessness and is designed to help those transitioning from homelessness to permanent accommodation. CCSR (Resettlement) is a programme which provides access to free childcare to children of parents who are programme refugees, in order to help support their resettlement and integration into Irish Society. <\/p>  <p>  The TEC (Training and Employment Childcare) programme is an overarching childcare programme specifically designed to support parents on eligible training courses as well as certain categories of parents returning to work, by providing subsidised childcare places. Notwithstanding the above, all children meeting the minimum age requirement of 2 years and 8 months are eligible for a full two programme years on the Early Childhood Care and Education programme (ECCE). <\/p>  <p>  My Department also introduced the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) as a way of providing a programme of supports to enable children with a disability to access and meaningfully participate in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme. The key objective of AIM is to support pre-school providers to deliver an inclusive pre-school experience, ensuring that children with a disability can fully participate in the ECCE programme, thereby reaping the benefits of quality pre-school education. <\/p>  <p>  My Department also introduced a universal (non-means tested) subsidy, Community Childcare Subvention Universal (CCSU), for all children in Tusla-registered childcare aged between 6 months until they are eligible for the ECCE programme, which amounts to up to &euro;1,040 per year for children in full-time childcare.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has a key role in supporting and promoting child protection and welfare, and the effective functioning of families. Family support services provided by Tusla, include, but are not limited to, counselling services to vulnerable children and families in local community settings, and universal services through Family Resource Centres nationwide. Tusla also provides services for the care and protection of victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092000056#WRH04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Agencies Staff Data","counter":561,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092000056#WRH04400"},{"type":"question","counter":562,"qnumday":202,"qnumall":"[38245\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092000056#WRH04500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the extent to which a staff augmentation has been undertaken throughout the front-line services under the aegis of her Department over the past three years; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":563,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that this is an operational matter with regard to workforce planning for the two agencies within my remit that provide frontline services, namely Tusla and Oberstown Children Detention Campus.  <\/p><p>I am advised by Tusla and Oberstown respectively, that their Whole Time Equivalent (WTE) staffing numbers from 2015 - 31st July 2018, the most recent numbers available, are as follows: <table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>2015<\/th><th>2016<\/th><th>2017<\/th><th>As at 31\/07\/2018<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Oberstown<\/td><td>222.5<\/td><td>248.5<\/td><td>245<\/td><td>244<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tusla<\/td><td>3460<\/td><td>3597.27<\/td><td>3696.32<\/td><td>3778<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>Tusla has informed me that the vast majority of the 3778 whole time equivalent (WTE) staff focus on responding to the needs of children and families at risk.
