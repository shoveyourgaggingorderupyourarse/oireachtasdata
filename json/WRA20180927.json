There are now 21,000 separate landlords and agents currently in receipt of monthly HAP payments.<\/p>  <p>  As HAP is a social housing support and consequently households are not eligible to remain on the main housing waiting list, Ministerial directions have issued to ensure that, should they so choose, HAP recipients can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support through a transfer list.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, guidelines on inter-authority movement were introduced in 2017, to allow for local authorities to facilitate movement of HAP households in cases where a tenant, currently on a local authority waiting list, wishes to access rented accommodation with HAP support in another local authority area, subject to conditions.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to specific HAP supports available to homeless households, the Homeless HAP Place Finder Service operating in the Dublin local authorities, and in Cork City Council, is a targeted support for homeless households who are finding it difficult to secure HAP tenancies.

Harnessing private investment remains an important element in the overall delivery of social housing, including through supporting local authorities in meeting the needs of households on their waiting lists.  <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the cost comparisons set out in the review, it remains the case that it would not be possible to deliver the same number of social housing homes in higher value rental areas exclusively through capital funded build and acquisition programmes.  This will continue to be an important consideration in the context of the future availability of capital funding and the resourcing and capacity required to escalate local authority build and acquisition programmes to the level required to meet the current level of social housing need. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to there being a greater emphasis on construction and acquisition, it should be noted that of the 50,000 social housing homes to be delivered under Rebuilding Ireland out to 2021, 33,500 of these will be built and 6,500 of these will be acquired. In addition to these 40,000 social housing homes that will be built or acquired, a further 10,000 homes will be leased under long term leasing arrangements and a further 87,000 households will have their housing need met through HAP and RAS.  <\/p>  <p>  Clearly, it is important at this time that a blended approach to the delivery of social housing homes is pursued in order to deliver and provide immediate housing supports to those households on local authority waiting lists across the country. Earlier this week, I published the 2018 Summary of Social Housing Assessments, which shows that there are 71,858 households on local authority social housing lists, a reduction of 13,941 or 16.2% on the last assessment in June 2017. The findings of the IGEES review highlight the need for a blended approach to delivery at this time in order to meet urgent housing need and are consistent with the planned evolution of the composition of the social housing programme over the years ahead under Rebuilding Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700052#WRB03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Data","counter":43,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700052#WRB03900"},{"type":"question","counter":44,"qnumday":28,"qnumall":"[38901\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700052#WRB04000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the estimated cost of an affordable home under the Land Development Agency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":45,"content":"<p>To enable more delivery of social and affordable homes on public lands, the Government, in parallel with the establishment of the new Land Development Agency (LDA), has approved a new affordability requirement in relation to publicly owned lands, whereby a minimum of 30% of any housing developed must be reserved for affordable purposes in addition to the 10% statutory social housing requirement under Part V of the Planning and Development Act, whether such development is being progressed by the LDA or any other market operator.

Across all schemes and funding programmes, my Department provided a total of &euro;1.26bn to local authorities in 2015, &euro;1.45bn in 2016 and &euro;1.849bn in 2017.  My Department works closely with all local authorities to ensure the local government sector can meet existing and emerging challenges.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of local authority staffing, my Department oversees workforce planning for the local government sector and has agreed and approved workforce plans with each of the individual local authorities.  Since 1 January 2014, my Department has received 876 housing-related staff sanction requests from local authorities, 861 of which have been approved.<\/p>  <p>  Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each Chief Executive is responsible for the staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities, for which he or she is responsible.  In this regard, it is a matter for each Chief Executive to ensure that staff are optimally deployed to ensure that appropriate service levels are provided.  It is within the remit of the Chief Executive to reassign staff between programme areas to meet emerging demands and it is clear that local authorities have increased staffing numbers in their Housing Departments to deliver on increased demands.<\/p>  <p>  The accelerated delivery of housing, including social housing, is of critical importance to this Government.  My Department has recognised the need to support local authorities in their efforts to increase both capacity and output in this regard. In addition to substantial capital and current funding provided under Rebuilding Ireland, my Department is providing a range of staff related supports including:<\/p>  <p>  Local authorities have designated Vacant Homes Officers, to act as a central point of contact and to provide information and advice for owners of vacant homes and to deal with queries from members of the public in respect of private residential vacant properties in their administrative area.  My Department has provided funding for each local authority (&euro;50,000 per annum, for a period of two years (i.e. a total of &euro;100,000 to each local authority for 2018 &amp;amp; 2019) to support the work of the Vacant Homes Office.  This provision of central funding will allow for focus to be given to the role of the Office in establishing a co-ordinated approach to the implementation of their Vacant Homes Action Plans and will reinforce the capacity of the Department&rsquo;s Vacant Homes Unit to liaise with and seek information\/statistics from a dedicated contact point within each local authority.  The Vacant Homes Office is expected to play a key role in the co-ordination of this work within the local authority.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year my Department advised local authorities of arrangements for the appointment (where required) of a dedicated staff member to provide assistance in seeking out potential properties; establishing relationships with local property agents and landlords; and supporting those homeless households to exit emergency accommodation and secure a tenancy.  An allowance towards the staffing cost of this officer is recoupable from the      Department via the homeless services (&lsquo;Section 10&rsquo;) recoupment arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme, the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) and a range of different leasing schemes funded by the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP) all provide local authorities with administrative payments in respect of new households entering the schemes and for certain on-going monitoring and management expenses.  The purpose of these payments is to recognise the resources required by local authorities in respect of the set up and management of tenancies under these programmes.<\/p>  <p>  Local authority in-house professional services assigned to the delivery of new capital funded social housing build projects can be recouped from my Department at a percentage of the approved tender cost, with the actual percentage depending on the services provided.  Services covered include architectural and other design team professional services, contract monitoring and management and the assigned certifier role.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700052#WRB05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Provision","counter":62,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700053#WRC00200"},{"type":"question","counter":63,"qnumday":35,"qnumall":"[38910\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700053#WRC00300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he has reconsidered the proposal for a dynamic housing executive for the greater Dublin region in view of the low delivery of new social and affordable housing in the region and especially by Dublin City Council; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":64,"content":"<p>I refer to the reply to Question No. 258 of 26 September 2018, which sets out the position on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700053#WRC00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Assistance Payment Data","counter":65,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700053#WRC00500"},{"type":"question","counter":66,"qnumday":36,"qnumall":"[39095\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700053#WRC00600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the amount of funding paid to landlords through the housing assistance payment in the past year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1432","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":67,"content":"<p>The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is a flexible and immediate housing support that is now available to all eligible households throughout the State.

This Order was made under the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act 1971. <\/p><p>The Agency will act as a national centre of expertise, working with and supporting local authorities, public bodies and other interests, to harness public lands as catalysts to stimulate regeneration and wider investment and to achieve compact, sustainable growth, with a particular emphasis on complex regeneration projects and the provision of affordable housing.<\/p><p>The LDA has a number of financing options available to it, including direct funding by the LDA from its own capital, the deployment of third-party capital or a combination of both. <\/p><p>Significant preparatory work is required in relation to the initial portfolio of eight sites and as part of this process, funding structures will be devised on a case by case basis, taking account of the scale of each project, value for money for the State, risk and pace of delivery.<\/p><p>To enable more delivery of social and affordable homes on public lands, the Government has, in parallel with the establishment of the LDA, approved a new affordability requirement in relation to publicly owned lands, whereby a minimum of 30% of any housing developed must be reserved for affordable purposes in addition to the 10% statutory social housing requirement under Part V of the Planning and Development Act, whether such development is being progressed by the LDA or any other market operator. Furthermore, public bodies, such as local authorities and the Housing Agency, engaging with the LDA in relation to their lands will also be in a position to condition their release for development reflecting their own policy requirements.<\/p><p>Therefore, complying with the Government's new public lands affordability requirement above, the LDA will be capable of progressing a significant level of both Affordable Purchase Scheme based and cost rental-based projects on lands forming part of its portfolio of sites, working within the broader policy framework for the delivery of affordable housing set by the Government.<\/p><p>In line with the general internationally accepted principle that households should not be spending more than a third of their income on housing costs (e.g. rent or mortgage), and using similar maximum gross income thresholds to the new affordable scheme (i.e. &euro;50,000 for single-income and &euro;75,000 for two-income households), my Department is working with the LDA to ensure that it can deliver housing for both purchase and rental purposes within such parameters.  <\/p><p>In relation to affordable homes for purchase, the Rebuilding Ireland Home loan sets a maximum value of homes that can be bought\/built at &euro;320,000 in the Greater Dublin Area, Cork and Galway cities, and &euro;250,000 elsewhere in the country.<\/p><p>A maximum dual-income threshold under the new Affordable Purchase Scheme is set at &euro;75,000 (which would enable a first-time buyer to afford repayments of around 35% of net income on a 90% LTV mortgage, using the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, of around &euro;285,000), enabling an overall maximum house purchase price of &euro;320,000.<\/p><p>Analysis of projects supported under the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund indicates that, on just under three-quarters of all 30 sites funded, there will be homes available to purchase for less than &euro;320,000 (at today&rsquo;s prices).  <b><\/b><\/p><p>In relation to affordable rental delivery, my Department believes that, in line with the public lands affordability requirement mentioned above, the availability of such public lands at low or no cost to underpin cost rental projects, including those progressed by the LDA, would be capable of delivering rents at around 20% below comparable market rates in the area, but this will vary, depending on the development potential of a given site, costs of providing site  infrastructure, etc.<\/p><p>In addition, the LDA will have to demonstrate and report on how it is meeting the policy requirements under Part V and the new public lands affordability requirement, using the range of relevant affordable schemes and mechanisms.<\/p><p>The LDA is in the process of commencing feasibility, planning and other preparatory works on its sites immediately, with construction envisaged to be commencing on the first homes in 2019 for delivery in 2020, with progress ramping up in line with an overall business plan which is also being advanced as a matter of urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700053#WRC01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Provision","counter":72,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700053#WRC01200"},{"type":"question","counter":73,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[39096\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700053#WRC01300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his views on whether his Department's insistence on mixed tenure developments is having a negative consequence on the delivery of social housing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":74,"content":"<p>The scale and relevant tenure mix for new social housing developments are, in the first case, matters for the relevant local authority, whether those developments are contracted by the authorities themselves or by Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) operating in their areas.

These crimes include the widespread killing of civilians; rape and sexual violence; torture and enforced disappearances.

These include the following:<\/p>  <p>Key Employee Engagement Programme (KEEP):   The policy objective of KEEP is to assist small to medium size businesses in competing with larger companies when attempting to attract and retain key employees. Share options can provide key employees with a financial incentive linked to the success of the company and may improve the attractiveness of an SME employment offer. The incentive provides that the value of the benefit to the employee on exercise of a qualifying share option will be subject to capital gains tax when the employee subsequently disposes of the shares. In the absence of the KEEP incentive, such gains would be subject to income tax, USC and PRSI at the time of exercise.  <\/p>  <p>  As this is a new measure, there will be no immediate cost in 2018 as the share options must, with limited exceptions, be held for a minimum of twelve months before they can be exercised under this scheme. It is also likely that employees may hold the KEEP share options for a number of years before exercise, as the options must be granted at not less than market value on the date of grant, so a benefit will only arise to the employee if the shares increase in value from that date. It is estimated that the eventual full-year cost of the Key Employee Engagement Programme will be in the region of &euro;10m. <\/p>  <p>  Key Employee R&amp;D Tax Credit:   Separate from KEEP, this key employee provision allows for the transfer of the financial benefit of the R&amp;D tax credit from a company to an individual employee.  The key employee measure is designed to assist companies in the State to attract and retain employees with key skills in the field of R&amp;D.  Such skills are necessary to allow companies innovate, expand and develop. The generation of new products, processes and innovations should lead to more jobs being created in the economy.  The cost of the measure in 2015, the latest year for which data are available, was less than &euro;0.05m.<\/p>  <p>  The Employment and Investment Incentive:   The Employment and Investment Incentive (EII) is a tax relief incentive that provides tax relief for investment in certain corporate trades and is targeted at job creation and retention. The scheme replaced the Business Expansion Scheme (BES) which had been in place from 1984. The incentive allows an individual investor to obtain income tax relief on investments, up to a maximum of &euro;150,000 per annum, in each tax year up to 2020. Relief is initially available to an individual up to a maximum of 30% of the amount invested.  A further 10% tax relief is available where it has been proven that employment levels have increased at the company at the end of the specified period (3 years) or where evidence is provided that the company used the capital raised for expenditure on research and development. The cost of EII in 2016, the latest year for which data are available, was &euro;32m. A review of the scheme is currently underway.<\/p>  <p>  The Special Assignee Relief Programme (SARP):   SARP is aimed at reducing the cost to employers of assigning key individuals already employed by their companies from abroad to take up positions in the Irish based operations of the employer. The intention is that the recipients of SARP will assist with the establishment of additional functions for their companies in Ireland and, due to a transfer of skills, these functions will be able to operate without the assistance of SARP after a period. The existing SARP scheme is limited to existing overseas employees of companies and is not available to new hires. The cost of SARP in 2015, the latest year for which data are available, was &euro;9.5m. This scheme is subject to a sunset clause with an end date of 31 December 2020. <\/p>  <p>  Start Up Relief:   Three Year Start Up Relief (Section 486C TCA 1997) provides for relief from corporation tax for start-up companies in their first three years of trading. The relief was introduced to provide support to new business ventures in their critical early years of trading, thereby supporting the creation of additional employment and economic activity in the State. The relief is granted by reducing the corporation tax payable on the profits of the new trade and gains on the disposal of any assets used for the purpose of the new trade. The relief exclusively supports start-up companies that create and maintain jobs, by restricting the relief available to a company by reference to its Employers&rsquo; PRSI payments. The cost of the measure in 2016, the latest year for which data are available, is provisionally set at &euro;5.7m.  <\/p>  <p>  Film Relief:   Section 481 of the TCA 1997 requires that a producer company that receives the relief employs a certain amount of trainees on the production for which the relief is received. The number of trainees is directly linked to the amount of corporation tax relief claimed. A production must have two trainees for every &euro;335,000 of relief claimed, this is capped at a maximum of eight trainees per production.  There isn&rsquo;t a specific costing for the trainee element of Film Relief as this measure is a requirement for obtaining the relief.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700054#WRD04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Budget Submissions","counter":163,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700054#WRD04400"},{"type":"question","counter":164,"qnumday":69,"qnumall":"[39261\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700054#WRD04500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if consideration will be given to the request of an organisation (details supplied) on the rate of VAT applicable to a sector in view of its importance to the economy and particularly rural Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":165,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[39317\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700054#WRD04600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if consideration will be given to the requests of representative organisations (details supplied) on the rate of VAT applicable to a sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":166,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69 and 77 together.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, it is a longstanding practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment, in advance of the Budget, on any tax matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700054#WRD04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sale of State Assets","counter":167,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700054#WRD04800"},{"type":"question","counter":168,"qnumday":70,"qnumall":"[39276\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700054#WRD04900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the location the proceeds from the sale of Bord G&aacute;is currently lie in view of the fact that &euro;10 million is allocated per year for a pilot scheme on social housing; the rate of return these proceeds are earning; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1217","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":169,"content":"<p>There is an obligation under Article 11 of the Constitution to pay moneys due to the State in to the Central Fund unless there is a law stating that they can be paid somewhere else. <\/p>  <p>  The special dividends related to the sale of Bord G&aacute;is can be divided into two categories:<\/p>  <p>  (i)  As the Deputy will be aware from a number of previous PQ responses to him on this issue, the &euro;648 million in net proceeds from the sale of Bord G&aacute;is is being paid by way of special dividends from Ervia to the Exchequer, based on a payment schedule agreed with Government in order to maximise the potential to use the funds in a manner which is efficient from the point of our general government balance.  <\/p>  <p>  (ii)  Payment of additional special dividends by Ervia to the Exchequer of &euro;330 million over time, where the debt originally associated with the Bord G&aacute;is Energy business that was repaid from the sale proceeds is effectively replaced over time.

This regime, which imposes higher environmental standards on coal in the State than applies in Northern Ireland, enables local authorities to undertake enforcement action to prevent the sale or distribution of coal that does not meet our standards.  <\/p>  <p>  European Union Single Market constraints preclude the use of any cross-border movement controls in the administration of Solid Fuel Carbon Tax.

Section 110 companies can only hold certain qualifying assets. Real property is not an asset that these companies can hold, however they can hold loans and other financial assets that derive their value therefrom. The Finance Act 2016 changes related to the taxation of profits which were derived from Irish land and buildings and provided a restriction on the amount of interest which is deductible against such profits, thereby excluding businesses with loans which are secured over, or derive their value from, an interest in Irish land from using the provisions of section 110 to avoid payment of Irish tax on profits made on Irish property transactions. Those changes took effect from 6 September 2016.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware of the REIT regime introduced in Finance Act 2013 and the IREF regime introduced in Finance Act 2016.  Both regimes, which apply to collective investment vehicles, in general terms provide that profits arising from Irish rental property are taxed at the investor level rather than at the investment vehicle level.  That is, the vehicle is not subject to corporation tax or capital gains tax because the income and\/or gains are taxed at the level of the investor when they receive a payment from that vehicle.  Under both regimes a 20% withholding tax applies on dividends paid out of Irish property profits or gains to non-resident investors.  <\/p>  <p>  There are a number of exceptions from the operation of the IREF and REIT withholding tax such as for pension schemes and charities as they are more generally exempt from tax.   <\/p>  <p>  DIRT does not apply to deposits held by companies who have supplied their tax reference number to a deposit taker.

This was &euro;152 million, or 0.4 per cent, below profile and &euro;2,874 million, or 7.9 per cent, higher than expenditure for the same period in 2017. Gross voted current expenditure of &euro;36,770 million was &euro;209 million, or 0.6 per cent ahead of profile and &euro;2,353 million, or 6.8 per cent ahead of the same period last year. At the end of August 14 out of 17 Ministerial Vote Groups were either broadly in line or below profile, with an aggregate underspend of &euro;207 million versus their current expenditure profiles. Health, Education and Skills, and Justice were ahead of their gross current expenditure profiles by an aggregate amount of &euro;416 million. <\/p>  <p>  Given the scale of gross voted expenditure, &euro;62 billion in aggregate for 2018, the need for Supplementary Estimates or the surrender of funds to the Exchequer at end-year can arise for a number of reasons. Additional funding requirements in one area may be partly offset by underspends in another area. The exact scale of any underspends is difficult to assess at this stage in the year. However, the expenditure outturns for the last two years provide an indication of the potential range. <\/p>  <p>  As reported in the December 2017 Fiscal Monitor, gross voted expenditure in 12 out of 17 Vote Groups was in line or below profile for the year. These profiles reflected the allocations set out in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2017 published in December 2016 and the Further Revised Estimates presented to the D&aacute;il on 17th October 2017. The aggregate underspend on current expenditure across these 12 Vote Groups was &euro;208 million. As set out in the December 2016 Exchequer Statement, gross voted expenditure in 11 out of 16 Ministerial Vote Groups finished the year at or below their total expenditure profile. The aggregate underspend on current expenditure across these 11 Vote Groups was &euro;238 million. Consequently, based on the level of current expenditure underspends over the last two years in Vote Groups that underspent relative to their profiles, voted current expenditure underspends in the region of c &euro;0.2 billion could be expected to partly offset the expenditure pressures emerging in Health, Education and Justice.<\/p>  <p>  At the end of each financial year, unspent voted allocations must be surrendered to the Exchequer. However, as set out in the Public Financial Procedures, there is an exception in relation to voted capital. Section 91 of the Finance Act 2004 provides that a maximum of up to 10% of the capital envelope of each Vote may be carried over to the following year by way of &lsquo;deferred surrender&rsquo; to be spent that year on priority capital programmes. The total amount of capital carryover at end-2017 was &euro;70.3 million. <\/p>  <p>  At the end of August, gross voted capital expenditure of &euro;1,679 million was &euro;361 million, or 11.9 per cent below profile and &euro;521 million ahead of end-August 2017. The Department of Housing was &euro;175 million below profile with a significant proportion of this capital underspend being due to a timing issue relating to Irish Water, which is expected to revert to profile. Consequently, excluding the Department of Housing, gross voted capital expenditure is &euro;186 million below profile. At end-August 2017, the equivalent underspend was &euro;163 million. At end-December 2017, after taking capital carryover of &euro;70 million into account, the equivalent capital underspend, excluding the Department of Housing, amounted to &euro;54 million, which is approximately 1 per cent of the overall capital allocation. However, given the nature of spending on capital projects there is a particular difficulty in assessing the potential full year outturn at this point in time.<\/p>  <p>  Managing the delivery of public services within budgetary allocations is a key responsibility of each Minister and their Departments. Taking into account the level of underspends in previous years outlined above, it is important that where Departments have expenditure pressures arising in certain programmes the scope to reallocate expenditure from other programmes is fully examined in order to mitigate the risk of an overspend. Any increase in expenditure in one sector, unless offset by expenditure underspends elsewhere, either voted or non-voted, or additional revenues, would result in a deterioration in the general government deficit from a projected 0.2 per cent of GDP this year and 0.1 per cent of GDP next year. Consequently, as part of the Budget process, work is ongoing to determine the scale of any potential Supplementary Estimate requirements for this year, the potential impact on aggregate voted expenditure in both 2018 and 2019, and potential offsetting revenue or expenditure across all areas of General Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700055#WRE01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes Supervisors","counter":203,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700055#WRE01300"},{"type":"question","counter":204,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[39360\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700055#WRE01400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his plans to provide funds to address the issue of providing a pension and gratuity to retiring and retired community employment supervisors as per a recommendation of the Labour Court; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":205,"content":"<p>I refer the deputy to my previous response to PQ 35780\/18.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700055#WRE01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":207,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700055#WRE01700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Grant Scheme Eligibility","counter":206,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700055#WRE01600"},{"type":"question","counter":207,"qnumday":85,"qnumall":"[39309\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700055#WRE01700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the estimated cost of removing the anomaly in which lone parents in receipt of one-parent family payment and jobseeker's transition payment and rent supplement are not eligible for SUSI maintenance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1294","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":208,"content":"<p>In general terms, there is nothing preventing a lone parent who is in receipt of Rent Supplement, One Parent Family Payment and\/or Jobseeker's Allowance Transition payment(s) from applying to SUSI for maintenance funding under the Student Grant Scheme.

I negotiated, together with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, a 15-22% pay increase for new teachers. <\/p>  <p>  As a result of these changes, from 1 October 2018 the starting salary of a teacher will be &euro;36,318, and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692. <\/p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that &ldquo;the Minister [for Public Expenditure and Reform] shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  The report laid before the Oireachtas on foot of this provision by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011. The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledges that, during the financial crisis, there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education). Addressing any issues arising from changes which are not specifically detailed in the report would give rise to additional costs over and above the foregoing figures.<\/p>  <p>  The matter of new entrant pay is a cross sectorial issue, not just an issue for the education sector alone.

In this capacity, he is working closely with all Ministers, including myself, to address the many challenges Brexit will present . However, I do want to emphasise that it is this Government&rsquo;s firm intention that the same border arrangements as currently apply on the island of Ireland will continue into the future. In its approach to the Brexit negotiations, the Government has ensured that protecting the gains of the Peace Process and the avoidance of a hard border\u00a0is a\u00a0high priority for Ireland, our partner Member States and the European Commission.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware,\u00a0the Garda Commissioner is the Accounting Officer for the Garda Vote and as such is responsible for the effective and efficient use of the resources at his disposal, including personnel.\u00a0Those resources have reached unprecedented levels, with an allocation for 2018 of more than &euro;1.6 billion.\u00a0This budgetary provision as well as the significant capital investment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in recent years are in support of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country, to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Garda management keep the distribution of resources under active review in line with operational and security demands, as determined by the Commissioner, including any possible policing requirements post Brexit. In that respect, I am assured that\u00a0An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na\u00a0is preparing for Brexit with a wide-ranging focus\u00a0to determine operational requirements, including personnel and technology.\u00a0 I am assured that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to progress their contingency preparations, and is committed to ensuring the organisation is prepared for the associated policing implications and challenges arising therefrom. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is engaged on an on-going basis with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as part of the deep and detailed work being undertaken right across Government and the public sector in response to the UK's decision to leave the EU.\u00a0Indeed, in June Department officials and a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na\u00a0met with the European Commission in Brussels to discuss North-South cooperation in the areas of law enforcement and police and judicial cooperation. \u00a0Earlier this week, in the latest in a series of such meetings, senior officials from my Department met with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to further discuss Brexit preparations. Furthermore, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is represented at a senior level in the ongoing\u00a0discussions between my Department and the\u00a0UK's Home Office in relation to the operation of the Common Travel Area. <\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na works very closely with the Police Service of Northern Ireland in combatting cross-border crime, including in the pursuit of individual criminal investigations.\u00a0 This ongoing close co-operation, across the full range of policing responsibilities of both services, is in place and will continue in place regardless of the final shape of Brexit. Joint working\u00a0is central to the shared objectives of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland to combat crime of all sorts and to promote community safety on the island of Ireland.\u00a0 There are many collaborative policing initiatives in place including the cross border policing strategy, updated and published by both\u00a0police services\u00a0in 2016, the annual cross border policing seminar on organised crime as well as formal protocols for secondments and exchanges between the two jurisdictions. \u00a0In November 2015, the British and Irish Governments and the Northern Ireland Executive agreed a series of measures in the agreement A Fresh Start, The Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan, as part of a concerted and enhanced effort to tackle organised and cross jurisdictional crime.\u00a0 These measures\u00a0included the creation of\u00a0the Joint Agency Task Force, which\u00a0builds on existing law enforcement frameworks and to increase the collective effectiveness of operational law enforcement actions.\u00a0 These examples of the intensification of police co-operation are driven by a shared imperative to ensure normalisation in the security and policing environment, to promote reconciliation and to enhance community safety for all communities on the island.\u00a0 It is imperative that strong political leadership is in place to drive and further develop these initiatives on both sides of the border.\u00a0 In this regard I am sure that the Deputy will join me in calling for the full restoration of the Executive in Stormont as a matter of urgency.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  And so I want to assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the full support of the Government in dealing with the implications of Brexit\u00a0and will provide whatever resources are required to keep our people and our communities safe.\u00a0This is clearly demonstrated by this Government&rsquo;s track record of investment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in the Government\u00a0plan for\u00a0an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, including 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014,\u00a0almost\u00a02,200 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide of whom\u00a0214 have been assigned to the Northern Garda Region. Taking account of projected retirements, Garda numbers are expected to reach 14,000 by the end of this year and 15,000 during 2021. <\/p>  <p>  Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and enhance visibility within our communities and will enable the Commissioner to deploy additional resources to meet the challenges of Brexit, should he deem it necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700056#WRF00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Status","counter":271,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700056#WRF00800"},{"type":"question","counter":272,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[39335\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700056#WRF00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of residency in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":273,"content":"<p>I refer the Deputy to the reply given to his recent Parliamentary Question No. 277 of Tuesday 18th September 2018.

As the Deputy\u00a0may also be\u00a0aware, wardship funds are not public funds.

The Strategy contains 35 priority and additional actions and its implementation is being led by the National Dementia Office in the HSE. The office has made substantial progress towards developing evidence-based care pathways for people with dementia. Progress made to date and future plans, are recorded in the mid-term review of the Strategy's implementation, which was published in May this year.<\/p>  <p>  The Strategy&rsquo;s implementation was boosted at the time of its launch through a joint programme of investment by the HSE and the Atlantic Philanthropies. This &euro;27.5 million investment allowed for a number of key actions within the strategy to be resourced and implemented. It funded the PREPARED programme, which offers education and clinical resources for GPs and Primary Care Teams; intensive homecare packages for people with dementia; the Understand Together awareness campaign; and the establishment of the National Dementia Office, which has an important role in implementing the Strategy. The Office has made substantial progress towards developing evidence-based care pathways for people with dementia. Additional projects are being funded through &euro;6.26 million in Dormant Accounts funding secured by the Department of Health in the 2016, 2017 and 2018 Dormant Accounts Fund Action Plans.<\/p>  <p>  In 2016 and 2017, the National Dementia Office partnered with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland on a project to map dementia-specific community-based services and supports. It provides a useful snapshot and baseline study into what, where and when dementia services are being offered. The study has also been used to inform a service finder hosted on the National Dementia Office&rsquo;s website. This allows people to search for dementia-specific community services in their area. There are gaps in access to services and a large variance in what services are provided across the country. The National Dementia Office has met with senior HSE officials in each Community Healthcare Organisation region to highlight gaps in each area and to develop local action plans to improve service provision.<\/p>  <p>  The National Dementia Office has also developed a needs analysis framework to support local dementia service planning and development. This framework is a mechanism to help the Office direct time, energy and resources into dementia care that most appropriately meets the needs of people with dementia. It will be used to make dementia service development more responsive and consistent across the country. <\/p>  <p>  The National Dementia Strategy calls for the HSE to consider the provision of dementia advisers, based on the experience of demonstrator sites. An evaluation of the Dementia Adviser Service was published on 26th September. It recommends the continuation and expansion of the service to ensure equity of access countrywide.<\/p>  <p>  A priority action in the National Dementia Strategy is the appointment of key workers to coordinate each patient's care and promote continuity, and ensure that the patient knows who to access for information and advice. It is proposed that the key worker will be responsible for the coordinated planning and delivery of individually tailored care plans, developed in consultation with the person, their family carers and a range of health and social care practitioners. The key worker will also provide expert knowledge and leadership in dementia. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health has secured funding through the 2018 Dormant Accounts Action Plan to continue funding in 2019 for the Dementia Community Activation Coordinator post which has been co-funded through a partnership between the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and the HSE during 2018. The Community Activation Coordinator is working with national organisations and key community stakeholders to support community dementia champions across Ireland. The Coordinator will seek to grow the number of champions and people within communities to take action to create sustainable dementia inclusive communities.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the specific request for additional support for dementia services in Co. Wexford referred to by the Deputy, the level of funding available for the Department of Health in 2019 and the quantum of services to be provided by the HSE will be considered as part of the national Estimates and budgetary process and National Service Planning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700056#WRF07600","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pharmacy Regulations","counter":341,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700057#WRG00200"},{"type":"question","counter":342,"qnumday":130,"qnumall":"[39153\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700057#WRG00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the definition of temporary absence arrived at by an organisation (details supplied) with the permission of his Department in the case of pharmaceutical assistants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1258","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":343,"content":"<p>Under the Pharmacy Act 2007 the sale and supply of medicinal products must be carried out by or under the personal supervision of a registered pharmacist at all times.

Council of the PSI requested that a policy position be developed to enable and facilitate the drafting of rules in line with the requirements of Section 30(2) of the Act. <\/p>  <p>  In March 2017, the PSI Council considered the matter of temporary absence and a proposed draft set of rules under section 30 of the Act. At this meeting the Council heard a presentation from the Chair of the Pharmaceutical Assistants&rsquo; Association, following an invitation. The Council decided to reject the proposal presented at that time and requested further examination of the issue of temporary absence, and what would be covered within the scope of the rules. <\/p>  <p>  A Working Group was established to produce a report, which was submitted to Council on the 17 May 2018.

This legislation provides that all equines must be identified with a passport no later than 12 months from the date of birth of the animal. Each equine must be implanted with a microchip by a veterinary practitioner, the number of which must be recorded on the corresponding passport, on the database of the issuing Passport Issuing Organisation (PIO) and on the central equine database maintained by my Department. This establishes the link between the animal and its passport document.<\/p>  <p>  The implantation of a microchip in an equine by a veterinary practitioner became a requirement under the provisions of Commissions Regulation (EU) 504\/2008, which came into effect on 1st July 2009 in respect of all equines identified with a passport from that date.<\/p>  <p>  Equines identified with a passport prior to 1st July 2009 are deemed to be properly identified even though they have not been implanted with a microchip.  <\/p>  <p>  Proper identification of an equine cannot be established visually.

My Department's policy is to adopt a fair and proportional approach in dealing with breaches of equine identification legislation. In this regard, authorised officers engage with keepers to ensure that they understand their responsibilities and where breaches of the legislation are identified, they generally provide an opportunity for non-compliant keepers to rectify the position within a specified timeframe.

The disease does not affect other animal species or humans and there are no food safety implications.<\/p>  <p>  Specific EU legislation (Directive 2002\/60\/EC) is in place that sets out the control measures to be implemented in the event of an ASF outbreak in an EU member state in order to control the disease and prevent any spread. These control measures include, for example, culling of animals in affected herds, animal and animal product movement restrictions, investigation into the source of disease and surveillance of susceptible populations.  These control measures are being implemented in the affected countries. <\/p>  <p>  ASF has never been detected in Ireland. A significant risk factor for the introduction of ASF into Ireland would be the illegal or inadvertent importation of meat or meat products from infected pigs particularly as the virus is very stable and can survive for months in uncooked or cured pork and pork products e.g. salami, sausages. The feeding of such products to pigs could then result in a disease outbreak here. A further risk would be the inadvertent spread of the virus by humans on clothing, footwear etc, who may have been exposed to the virus in affected countries. Wild boar which are also affected by the disease have played a major role in the spread of ASF in Eastern Europe. Ireland does not have a sustained population of wild boar. <\/p>  <p>  DAFM has a contingency plan in place setting out the procedures and protocols that would be followed in the event of a suspected or confirmed case of ASF here. DAFM also has an ongoing early warning system and awareness campaign in place for all exotic diseases including ASF. Measures to protect the Irish pig industry from the threat of ASF have been stepped up in recent months and include for example:<\/p>  <p>  - Close monitoring of the situation in EU member states and liaising with our EU neighbours on a regular basis.<\/p>  <p>  - Circulation of regular information on ASF to targeted stakeholders to keep them informed of the current situation in Europe and the risk to Ireland. These documents are also made available at the disease control section of the DAFM website.<\/p>  <p>  - Production of disease factsheets on ASF for both vets and farmers and their circulation to stakeholders for example as part of the annual pig census. They are also available on the DAFM website.<\/p>  <p>  - Production of a multilingual poster warning of the dangers of visitors or staff returning from affected regions of the EU and bringing back meat or meat products onto Irish pig farms and its circulation to over 300 commercial pig farms in recent months.<\/p>  <p>  - Biosecurity advice detailing measures that can be taken to prevent entry of the disease is available on the disease control section of the DAFM website for both the intensive commercial sectors and the less intensive pig farmers such as organic and outdoor production systems.<\/p>  <p>  - Posters advising members of the public of the risks of ASF are in place at airports and ports.<\/p>  <p>  -Specific advice regarding the risk of ASF was recently circulated to Irish livestock transporters who may travel to or transit through areas of the EU affected by ASF this summer.<\/p>  <p>  - DAFM regularly tweets exotic disease information including biosecurity advice for farmers and specific information on ASF.<\/p>  <p>  - Staff from DAFM&rsquo;s veterinary service manned an information stand at the Ploughing Championships 2018 where ASF was a featured disease.<\/p>  <p>  The Department continues to review all aspects of its contingency arrangements in relation to ASF in light of any emerging veterinary or scientific information and introduces such measures as are considered appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700058#WRH03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Aid","counter":447,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700058#WRH03200"},{"type":"question","counter":448,"qnumday":165,"qnumall":"[39353\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700058#WRH03300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the status of the European Commission&rsquo;s proposal to increase the state aid threshold for farmers to &euro;25,000 per producer following the Commission's public consultation process on this matter; the latest discussions and timeline for agreement at European Council; and his proposal for the national threshold limit.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":449,"content":"<p>The CAP <i>de minimis<\/i>regulation covers the provision of small non-market distorting aid that can be paid to individuals without requiring notification to the Commission or the seeking of a block exemption. <\/p><p>Discussions on the Commission's proposals as part of its review of the agriculture de minimis regulations took place earlier in 2018 and a final decision is awaited.As part of its Impact assessment, the Commission undertook an economic analysis of the potential distortive effects of increased threshold ceilings.

I note also the broad agreement among Member States at the Trade Policy Committee meeting in Brussels on 14 September that this issue should be resolved quickly, a view that Ireland shares. This is a long-standing issue, with both political and economic sensitivities, and the most important consideration is the need to avoid a return to sanctions.<\/p>  <p>  I have been in close contact with Commissioner Hogan on this issue. The intention is that the existing hormone-free beef quota of 45,000 tonnes will remain at exactly the same level, with the main change arising in relation to the amount of the quota to be &ldquo;ring fenced&rdquo; for the US. This amount is still to be finalised, but Irish and European beef producers need have no fears that the adjustment to the quota arrangements would see any more than the existing quota limit of hormone-free beef enter the EU. It is also clear that any change in the existing arrangements will have to be in compliance with WTO rules. <\/p>  <p>  On the question of increased market access into the EU for beef from third countries, Ireland's position is well-known, in that we vigorously defend the interests of the Irish and EU beef sectors against any outcome from trade negotiations that would have negative consequences for the sector. For example, all through the EU-Mercosur negotiations Ireland has been very strong in its opposition to concessions from the EU in relation to beef, a position that has been maintained by myself, my colleague Andrew Doyle, the Taoiseach, and by my colleagues in Government, as well as by my officials and officials from other Departments in the course of our ongoing engagement with EU institutions at all levels. <\/p>  <p>  I believe there is a need for continued vigilance in relation to the conduct of trade negotiations. I will continue to insist that they are handled appropriately and in a manner that safeguards the interests of the Irish and European beef sector. I will also continue to work very closely with Member State colleagues in this regard. In particular, I believe full account must be taken of the findings of the Commission&rsquo;s own assessment of the cumulative impact of trade deals on the agri food sector, and the potentially very damaging impact of Brexit on an already delicately balanced EU beef market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700058#WRH04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Directives","counter":462,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700058#WRH04700"},{"type":"question","counter":463,"qnumday":170,"qnumall":"[39358\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700058#WRH04800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on the joint statement by a group of European farming and food organisations (details supplied) calling for all participants in the food supply chain to be protected from unfair trading practices regarding EU proposals on unfair trading practices.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":464,"content":"<p>The draft Directive on Unfair Trading Practices  proposes the prohibition of certain Unfair Trading Practices (UTPs) which occur in relation to the sales of food products  in the food supply chain across the EU:<\/p>  <p>  - by an SME supplier, including farmers<\/p>  <p>  - to a buyer, that is a large entity, i.e. larger than an SME.<\/p>  <p>The EU definition of SME is  : \"Enterprises which employ fewer than 250 persons and which have an annual turnover not exceeding &euro;50 million, and\/or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding &euro;43 million.\"<\/p>  <p>The legal basis on which the Directive is based is Article 43(2) of the TFEU (Common Agricultural Policy) which allows for the Council to establish the Common market for Agriculture and Fisheries to pursue the objective of Article 39(b), which &lsquo;is to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, in particular by increasing the individual earnings of persons engaged in agriculture&rsquo;. The Directive is therefore seeking to contribute to    ensuring a fair standard of living for those producers who are particularly vulnerable to UTPs, who have the least bargaining power, and are least able to address UTPs without negative effects on their economic viability, particularly as  agricultural products are  perishable and seasonable, and subject  to adverse weather conditions. <\/p>  <p>  The issue of the scope of the proposed Directive in terms of the size of the entities concerned has been a key issue for debate at the working groups and  the Special Agriculture Committee.

Ireland also recognised the possibility, set out in Article 8 of the draft Directive, for Member States to lay down or maintain stricter rules, to extend the scope to other types of buyers and suppliers and to prohibit other UTPs in national legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700058#WRH04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","counter":466,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700058#WRH05100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electricity Transmission Network","counter":465,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700058#WRH05000"},{"type":"question","counter":466,"qnumday":171,"qnumall":"[39129\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700058#WRH05100","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if areas on boil water notices will be prioritised for power restoration in the event of power outages due to poor weather in view of the added cost and implications for households; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1344","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":467,"content":"<p>The priority for the restoration of outages caused by severe weather is\u00a0an operational matter for ESB Networks, but\u00a0my Department has raised this matter with the ESBN, which has\u00a0 provided the following information:   - Prioritised power restoration proceeds when conditions allow for this to be undertaken safely.

They\u00a0have extended the scheme payments on several occasions since then\u00a0and\u00a0last year they decided to continue payments up until the end of 2018.\u00a0\u00a0No other electricity supplier has chosen to provide such a tariff, to either domestic or commercial customers, although they have been invited to do so by the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities (CRU). Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is a matter for the CRU, which is an independent statutory body.    Last year, my Department assessed micro generation, across a number of renewable electricity generating technologies, as part of the economic analysis to underpin the new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS). The assessment identified technical and financial challenges which may need to be addressed before a broader support scheme for micro generation can be introduced. This is in line with\u00a0international and EU\u00a0experience, where many member states who have introduced supports for micro generation have had to reform them or cancel them altogether.\u00a0In March 2017 the UK Government closed down the Renewables Obligation (RO) Scheme\u00a0to new applicants.\u00a0\u00a0Under the RO scheme generators (including homeowners and farmers across Northern Ireland) received payment for each unit of electricity they produce from solar PV.\u00a0Interestingly, prior to closing the scheme, the UK Government had reduced the generation tariff from 16p per unit of electricity generated, to 12p and finally down to 8p.<\/p>  <p>  The reality is that bringing micro generation onto a system designed for large generators is complicated. It impacts how we pay for the network, how we manage regulation and how we technically manage the system. <\/p>  <p>  In July, I announced details of a new pilot scheme to support micro generation, initially targeting solar PV, homeowners and self-consumption.\u00a0The data gathered during the pilot scheme will inform potential future phases of support for micro-generation in Ireland that may be appropriate, as we align with the ambition and requirements of the recast Renewable\u00a0Energy\u00a0Directive (RED) that recognises the rights, entitlements and obligations of renewable self-consumers. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is continuing to work closely with the micro-generation sector and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) to better understand how to validate and further develop these policies in a fair and cost effective manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700058#WRH06600","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":482,"content":"<p>Question No. 176 answered with Question No. 174.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fisheries Protection","counter":483,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700058#WRH06800"},{"type":"question","counter":484,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[39163\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700058#WRH06900","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"when the eel fisherman hardship fund will be introduced; and the amount of compensation that will be available to affected fisherman.","asker":"1327","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":485,"content":"<p>Ireland&rsquo;s Eel Management Plan (EMP), including the closure of commercial fishing, was approved, in 2009, by the European Commission under EU Regulation 1100\/2007.

Lone parents who move to WFP may also apply for the Back to Work Family Dividend (BTWFD).<\/p>  <p>  The concurrent payment of JST and WFP contradicts the policy goal of the changes to the OFP scheme, which were to tackle long-term social welfare dependency - and its associated poverty risks - through a tapering of income supports and a more active engagement process offering enhanced educational, training and employment supports.  <\/p>  <p>  Lone parents currently on JST who increase their working hours to 19 or more per week can transfer from JST to WFP.

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household. <\/p>  <p>  My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance at an estimated cost of &euro;237 million in 2018.  <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a special heating supplement may be paid to assist people in certain circumstances that have special heating needs.

This Strategy is spearheaded by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  It sets out the Government&rsquo;s commitment to protecting vulnerable households from energy poverty through a combination of supports, investment in schemes to improve energy efficiency, and energy efficiency awareness initiatives.  One of the best ways to tackle fuel poverty in the long term is to improve the energy efficiency of the dwelling through proper building and household insulation.  The Warmer Homes Scheme, administered by Sustainable Energy Authority Ireland, is designed to do that.  Earlier this year, this scheme was expanded to include recipients of Domiciliary Care Allowance and further expansion to include carers is under consideration.  I understand the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is reviewing the scheme and my officials will participate in that.

To this end, details of some 1,700 hectares of land in local authority and Housing Agency ownership were published on the Rebuilding Ireland Housing Land Map, with the potential to deliver some 42,500 homes nationally. This includes circa 135 hectares in the functional area of Kildare County Council. These mapped sites can be viewed at the following link:<\/p><p><i>.<\/i><\/p><p>Local authorities will continue to maximise the use of publicly owned lands for social housing, affordable purchase, and cost rental.<\/p><p>In addition to the active management of the publicly owned land bank, assessments of population and housing need are required. The Summary of Social Housing Assessments is conducted annually, specifically assessing the social housing needs of the population. The 2018 summary which has been published this week and is available on the Department's website, show that 71,858 households were assessed as qualified and being in need of a social housing support as of 11 June 2018; this represents a decrease of 13,941 households or 16% on the last assessment in June 2017. Indeed, since Rebuilding Ireland, the numbers of those waiting on social housing homes, has dropped from 91,600 to 71,858.  In Kildare, there has been a 22% in 2018 in the number of households qualifying for social housing support, down from 5,103 households in June 2017 to 3,962 in 2018.<\/p><p>With specific reference to Co Kildare, the Council has prepared the Kildare County Development Plan 2017-2023, which seeks, amongst other things, to address housing needs specific to Kildare, particularly in section 2.8 - Population and Housing Growth. The plan is available at the following link:<\/p><p><i>www.kildare.ie\/countycouncil\/Planning\/developmentplans\/KildareCountyDevelopmentPlan2017-2023\/<\/i>.<\/p><p>Also, an overall Housing Need Demand Assessment (HNDA) will be required to be undertaken in future planning, in accordance with the vision as set out in Project Ireland 2040 and the National Planning Framework.<\/p><p>With regard to social housing delivery in County Kildare, this data is published quarterly. The most recent report which I published today, reflects the position at the end of Quarter 2 of 2018 and is available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link:<\/p><p><i><\/i>.<\/p><p>This latest report shows 544 homes added to the social housing stock in County Kildare through build, acquisition and leasing in the first six months of this year.<\/p><p>Regarding affordable housing, a multi-pronged approach is being pursued, targeting households on low to moderate annual gross incomes of maximum &euro;50,000 for a single applicant and maximum &euro;75,000 for joint applicants.  <\/p><p>In terms of affordable housing for purchase, the relevant provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 have now been commenced.<\/p><p>In terms of affordable rental I am determined that cost rental homes become a major part of our rental landscape in the future, making a sustainable impact on housing affordability, national competitiveness, and the attractiveness of our main urban centres as places to live as well as work. Two cost rental projects have previously been announced for Emmet Road, Inchicore, and at Enniskerry Road, Dundrum. On foot of these pilots, cost rental will be rolled out across other suitable sites.<\/p><p>In order to support local authorities to get their sites ready for affordable housing, I am providing Exchequer funding of &euro;75 million for enabling infrastructure via the Serviced Sites Fund over the four years to 2021.  When local authority co-funding is included, an overall minimum investment of &euro;100 million will be available under the Fund to offset the costs of providing both on-site and off-site enabling infrastructure for sites in order for them to be brought into use for affordable housing. <\/p><p>A total of &euro;15 million Exchequer funding has been allocated for 2018, to which the local authority minimum contribution of &euro;5 million will be added. This should enable the provision of infrastructure for some 500 affordable homes this year, based on a maximum level of &euro;40,000 infrastructure investment per home. The bids that have been received from 9 local authorities, including from Kildare County Council, under the first call are now being assessed, and I expect to make initial funding awards next month.  <\/p><p>From engagements with the local authorities in Dublin, the wider Greater Dublin Area as well as Cork and Galway cities, their initial estimates suggest that they have lands with the potential to deliver some 4,000 new affordable homes.  My Department is continuing to work with the key local authorities and the Housing Agency to identify sites for at least 10,000 new affordable homes from local authority owned land.  <\/p><p>In addition, the Government has now launched the Land Development Agency, which will be aiming to deliver some 150,000 new homes over the next 20 years. The new Agency has an immediate focus on managing the State&rsquo;s own lands to develop new homes, and regenerate under-utilised sites, and will deliver at least 40% of any housing potential on such lands for both social and affordable housing purposes.<\/p><p>My Department is continuing to work with all local authorities and State bodies to ensure that housing is delivered from appropriately located and publicly owned sites to meet our current and future housing requirements.<\/p><p>My Department does not maintain a record of private contractors. Rather, construction tenders are publicly available online at <i>www.etenders.gov.ie<\/i>, where contractors may tender for public construction work available in local authority areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700062#WRM00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":716,"qnumday":256,"qnumall":"[39319\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700062#WRM01100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will address the issue whereby applicants for local authority and affordable houses are excluded from the local authority housing lists on the basis of excessive income and excluded from Rebuilding Ireland loans on the basis of insufficient income; if regulations to address this issue will be introduced as a matter of urgency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":717,"qnumday":257,"qnumall":"[39320\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700062#WRM01200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the steps he will take to address the housing need of extra applicants for affordable and local authority housing in view of housing repossessions by lending institutions in respect of buy to let developments and individual households; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":718,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 256 and 257 together.<\/p><p>The income eligibility bands for access to social housing support, and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.<\/p><p>The accepted benchmark of housing affordability is that households, particularly low- to moderate-income households, should not be paying more than one third or 35% of their disposable income on accommodation costs and the income thresholds for access to social housing support generally achieve this. Recognising that there are people who do not qualify for social housing but find it very challenging to purchase or rent at market rates, the Government has brought in new measures specifically targeted at delivering affordable homes. <\/p><p>Affordable housing is generally targeted at households earning a maximum gross income of &euro;50,000 (single applicant) or &euro;75,000 (joint applicant). Affordable homes to buy will be delivered under a new statutory Scheme; the relevant provisions of Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 have been commenced and regulations &amp;amp; guidance are being finalised. <\/p><p>This new Scheme replaces all previous affordable purchase schemes; is led by housing authorities; is a shared equity scheme with a fully repayable equity share\/discount; eligibility and priority are set out in the legislation and will be expanded upon in the regulations; and the equity repayments will be pooled into a strategic affordable housing fund managed by the HFA. <\/p><p>The Scheme is complementary to other Government schemes which help first-time buyers to buy a home, such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the new Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan. The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan was introduced from 1 February 2018, following a review of the two existing local authority home loan schemes, the House Purchase Loan and the Home Choice Loan. The new loan enables credit worthy first time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range.  The low rate of fixed interest associated with the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan provides first time buyers with access to mortgage finance that they may not otherwise be able to afford at a higher interest rate.<\/p><p>Single applicants for the loan may earn up to &euro;50,000 gross per annum, while the combined income of joint applicants may be up to &euro;75,000 per annum.  These income limits are unchanged from the previous local authority loan offerings. The maximum dual-income threshold also applies to the new Affordable Purchase Scheme which will enable a maximum purchase price of c. &euro;320,000, which is in line with the purchase limits set out under the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan.<\/p><p>It is important to note that there are no set minimum income limits for the scheme; however, applicants must be capable of repaying the mortgage in accordance with the statutory credit policy underpinning the loan.<\/p><p>Full details of the loan&rsquo;s eligibility criteria and other information are available from the dedicated Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan website:<\/p><p><i><\/i>.  Subject to certain conditions, any person who meets the eligibility criteria may apply for a loan regardless of whether or not they are on the local authority housing list or qualified for social housing support.<\/p><p>There is also a gap between social housing and the rental market that needs to be filled, in order to support housing affordability, national competitiveness and the attractiveness of our main urban centres as places to live as well as work. Cost rental is an important component of progressive housing systems around Europe and after detailed financial modelling by my Department, the National Development Finance Agency and the European Investment Bank\/Housing Finance Agency, Dublin City Council is working on the first major cost rental project  to deliver over 300 cost rental homes at Emmet Road, Inchicore, as part of a mixed-tenure development of some 470 homes in total. <\/p><p>In parallel, the Housing Agency, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and a number of Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) have been working on a smaller-scale cost rental pilot, at Enniskerry Road, the tenders for which have been issued.  Learning from these pilot projects, cost rental will now be rolled out across other suitable sites.<\/p><p>As part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports is underway. The Housing Agency is carrying out the detailed statistical work which will underpin this review on behalf of my Department. The review will obviously have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700062#WRM01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Repossessions","counter":719,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700062#WRM01500"},{"type":"question","counter":720,"qnumday":258,"qnumall":"[39321\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700062#WRM01600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will approach the lending institutions with a view to the temporary cessation of home repossessions in order to reduce the number of applicants being forced onto the local authority waiting lists; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":721,"content":"<p>As Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, I have no role or function in the regulation or policy making in relation to the banking sector.

My Department does not directly collect information on the number of loan applications received by each local authority.<\/p><p>However, as is currently the case, my Department will continue to publish information on the overall number and value of (i) local authority loan approvals and (ii) local authority loan drawdowns.  Information up to Q4 2017 is available on the Department's website at the following link:<\/p><p><i><\/i>, and this information will be updated on a quarterly basis as additional data is compiled.<\/p><p>In addition, the Housing Agency provides a central support service which assesses loan applications that are made to the local authorities and makes recommendations to the authorities as to whether loans should be offered to applicants.  I have asked the Agency to centrally compile figures on the numbers of applications that it has assessed and the most recent figures, as at the end of August, indicate that the Agency had received a total of 2,628 applications for assessment from local authorities. Of the 2,628 applications received, 2,074 were deemed to be valid. Of these valid applications, 1,989 had been assessed and 1,024 of these (51%) had been recommended for approval. <\/p><p>As has been the case since the introduction of the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, applications are made directly to the local authority in which the applicant wishes to purchase a property. Applications are then processed by the local authority before being sent to the Housing Agency for assessment. Based on this comprehensive financial analysis, the Housing Agency makes a recommendation to the local authority on each application. <\/p><p>Each local authority must have in place a credit committee which makes the final decision on applications for loans, in accordance with the statutory credit policy issued in accordance with the Regulations and having regard to the recommendations made by the Housing Agency.<\/p><p>The purpose of the scheme is to enable credit-worthy first-time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range, where they have been unable to obtain sufficient mortgage finance from a commercial lender.  However, in accordance with the statutory credit policy, as with any other loan, potential borrowers must be credit-worthy and must demonstrate that they have the ability to repay the loan. It would be irresponsible to give individuals approval for loans that may see them placed under undue financial strain. The creditworthiness checks that are part of the approvals process for the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, and which may result in individuals being refused, help to safeguard against this eventuality and assist in protecting both the applicant and the Exchequer.<\/p><p>Of the 1,989 applications underwritten to the end of August 2018, 49% were not recommended for approval. Reasons for applications not being reconsidered under the scheme include an inability to satisfactorily demonstrate sufficient repayment capacity for the loan, or having an unsatisfactory savings record.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700062#WRM03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":739,"content":"<p>Question No. 270 answered with Question No. 261.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":741,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700062#WRM04200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Areas of Conservation Management","counter":740,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700062#WRM04100"},{"type":"question","counter":741,"qnumday":271,"qnumall":"[39157\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092700062#WRM04200","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if she will liaise with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to review a more workable system to allow farmers in designated SAC areas who are not in REPS or GLAS to farm their lands sustainably; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1321","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":742,"content":"<p>Ireland is bound by the EU Habitats and Birds Directives, as transposed in the 2011 Natural Habitats Regulations, and must therefore protect habitats and species in the sites for which they are designated.
