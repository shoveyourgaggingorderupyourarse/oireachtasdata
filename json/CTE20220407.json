No apologies have been received.  In order to limit the risk of spreading Covid-19, I ask that all those in attendance wear face coverings if not engaging with the committee.  The service requests people to continue to wear face coverings when moving around the campus or when in close proximity to others and to be respectful of other people&rsquo;s physical space.  I ask people to adhere to any other public health advice.<\/p> <p>  Members of the committee attending remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of the Parliament.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that, in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of Leinster House.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.<\/p> <p>  This morning we will engage with officials from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, to examine its 2020 financial statements.  The meeting will be suspended for an hour at 12.30 p.m.  When we resume at 1.30 p.m., we will engage with the Policing Authority to examine the appropriation account for Vote 41 for 2020.<\/p> <p>  We are joined in the committee room this morning by the following officials from GSOC: Mr. Justice Rory MacCabe, chairperson; Mr. Hugh Hume, commissioner; Ms Emily Logan, commissioner, who has been here many times previously in a different role; and Ms Aileen Healy, director of administration.<\/p> <p>  When we begin to engage, I ask those who are attending remotely to put their microphones on mute when not contributing so that we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.<\/p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  As the witnesses are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty, as Cathaoirleach, to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Justice MacCabe is very welcome.  As detailed in the letter of invitation, he will have five minutes for his opening statement.

The commission can also investigate matters relating to Garda conduct when it is in the public interest, even if a complaint has not been received.<\/p> <p>  The Commission is structured as a non-commercial State body.  The commission prepares accruals-based annual financial statements.  These are presented together with a governance statement and statement on internal control, as required under the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  The commission operates under the aegis of the Department for Justice and its income is derived from the justice Vote.  The commission&rsquo;s income in 2020 was &euro;11.3 million, while its expenditure was slightly higher at &euro;11.4 million.  Two thirds of the expenditure relates to staff costs and the commission had 127 employees at the end of 2020.<\/p><p>The bulk of the other expenditure comprises almost &euro;1.7 million related to rent, upkeep and overheads of premises, and &euro;1.4 million in general expenses, much of which relates to information technology costs.

This is the first occasion that GSOC has had the opportunity to address this committee.  I am accompanied by Hugh Hume and Emily Logan, commissioners., and Ms Aileen Healy, GSOC&rsquo;s director of administration.  There are additional members of the staff of GSOC also in attendance as observers.  Commissioner Hume has a background in policing at a senior level in the Police Service of Norther Ireland, PSNI, and also served as deputy chief inspector in the Garda Inspectorate.  Commissioner Logan was Ireland&rsquo;s first Ombudsman for Children and also served as the first Chief Commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.<\/p> <p>  GSOC was established under the 2005 Act and commenced operations in 2007 to provide independent oversight of policing in Ireland.  It is a vital interface between the people and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Our work is challenging and results depend on the skill and dedication of our staff, each of whom carries a heavy caseload.<\/p> <p>  GSOC operates seven days a week and 24 hours a day.  We deal with complaints from the public concerning the conduct of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, whether criminal or disciplinary.  We conduct investigations into matters referred to us by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Minister for Justice and the Policing Authority, as well as into matters we judge to be in the public interest to investigate.  We make recommendations arising from the results of our investigations.  We do not conduct prosecutions, which are a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions, nor do we or impose or enforce disciplinary sanctions, which are for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, following the recommendations we make.<\/p> <p>  GSOC&rsquo;s budget allocation for 2021 was &euro;11.272 million.  This paid the salaries and covered the normal day-to-day running costs of the organisation.  We have a staff of 135 at present.  Our headquarters are in Dublin and we have offices in Cork and Longford.  In the course of the year, GSOC sought and received an additional allocation of &euro;300,000 to cover unanticipated additional costs relating to a number of particularly complex investigations that require intensive and extensive resources.<\/p> <p>  There has been a notable increase in the volume and complexity of our cases year on year.  In 2021, there was a 12 % increase in complaints received and a 40% increase in statutory referrals from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where death or serious injury occurred.  It is to the credit of the staff that last year saw a 21% increase in the number of cases that were closed, even in the face of the pandemic, the increase in complaints and referrals, and the loss of some key personnel.<\/p> <p>  By their very nature, some investigations are straightforward and others are not.  Some can be dealt with quickly and others require a commitment in terms of staff, resources and time that we know can be frustrating for all concerned.  This is understandable from the point of view of complainants, who are anxious as to the outcome, and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na whose careers can be, in effect, on the line.<\/p> <p>  GSOC is bound by the principle of due process and human rights legislation.  These apply to complainants and those we investigate so we cannot and should not prioritise speed at the expense of rigour in completing our investigations.<\/p> <p>  Some of the challenges we face arise from the mandate under which we operate.  This is likely to change by dint of the broad reforms proposed in the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill.  Another related challenge is resourcing.  When I came to this job in January, I took the opportunity to be briefed on staffing, resources and on the details of all cases so that I could be sure that cases were being given proper priority.  We have engaged with our teams in Dublin, Longford and Cork.  As a commission, we took the opportunity to visit our teams on the ground in Longford and Cork.  It was apparent that our staffing complement, particularly our complement of investigative staff, falls well short of what is required.  High caseloads and staff turnover, including loss of experienced staff due to retirement or normal civil service mobility, have made this worse.<\/p> <p>  We secured additional funding in 2022 and this will allow us to recruit some additional staff.  I sought immediate approval to recruit 22 additional staff and this was granted by the Department of Justice without hesitation.  Recruitment is, however, not a fast process, particularly with such a range of regulatory organisations fishing in the same pool as we do.  All our staff require special skills to investigate and analyse complaints of negligence or wrongdoing.  <\/p> <p>  The Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill proposes sweeping changes in the law and will change the composition and mandate of GSOC.  The commission will have additional powers and functions, which will, by definition, involve more work and more staff if that work is to be carried out properly.  It is my belief that the Department and the Minister are alert to the ongoing resource issues faced by GSOC and will support us.  We welcome this draft legislation.  It fills a clearly defined and long-signalled gap in Ireland&rsquo;s policing accountability.<\/p> <p>  My responsibility, working with my commission colleagues and staff, is to oversee the work of GSOC and the transition to whatever new organisational structure is mandated by the committee members and their Oireachtas colleagues.  I hope that when they do this, they will be mindful that nothing as complex as investigating wrongdoing in the modern world we inhabit comes cheap.  I hope the committee also recognises the service the staff give and the importance of the work they do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022040700002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Justice Rory MacCabe"},{"type":"speech","time":1649320200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Justice MacCabe.

We did not and do not see ourselves as party to that dispute.  In answer to the Deputy's question as to whether staff work on call, as a relatively new commissioner I would say the organisation is a very dynamic one.  Our investigators do not sit beside a desk or at a desk where they do their work.  They are a very active group of people.  The legislative framework to which they operate is our Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.  Regarding Commissioner Hume's comments on death, when there has been a fatality or serious harm, a group of our investigation teams go out and they are on call at any time, 24 hours a day.  In fact, some of our teams have been called out on five occasions in the space of one week.  They do everything from managing and preserving a scene and its forensic evidence to trying to support and interact with families who are distressed or traumatised.  It is not only the investigatory nature of what we do that is important but the pieces around that too.<\/p> <p>  In response to the Deputy's original question about the public perception of GSOC, we are very sensitive to the current legislation and the perceived question as to who is carrying out investigations in the organisation.  What I will say, as somebody who was an ombudsman for 12 years, is that the dynamic in GSOC is quite different.  When we get to the final phase of an investigation, the commission actively participates in the direction an investigation takes.<\/p><p>We are not sitting in some ivory tower but have very close proximity to the investigation teams.  We are regularly briefed in our supervision of what is going on.  We also have policies which recognise, both for ourselves and for our investigation staff, that there may be an occasion when any of us might have a conflict of interest.  We have policies to support our staff in making those decisions and we ourselves make decisions where it may not be appropriate, with reference to the Deputy's earlier question, for people who may have a policing background in this jurisdiction, to be involved in certain investigations.  That is given very significant consideration.  The Deputy's question about the public is something that is constantly on our minds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022040700002#C03000","nonspeaker":"Ms Emily Logan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649320200,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I thank Commissioner Logan for that.

Whatever Judge Haughton is doing in relation to his scoping inquiry, he needs to be let do that but that does not prevent GSOC from providing those reports to the family.

While he was supposed to be signing on at a Garda station on a daily basis for a period of that time, he was in custody north of the Border.  It is a litany of failures.  The real answers and the causation of all of those failures have never been revealed.  GSOC, the organisation that one would have hoped would have been part of finding those answers, instead was subjugated to a significant delay during which time every other actor in this process refused to answer questions.  The then Minister for Justice and Equality, the then Department of Justice and Equality, the Garda, the DPP and the Courts Service - everybody who was responsible for failures in this case - stated for almost eight years that they could not answer questions because GSOC was carrying out an investigation.  Now GSOC is coming in here and stating that it cannot provide information because there is a scoping inquiry taking place.

There is no member of their family or no solicitor, yet the person about whom the complaint is being made would obviously have somebody there.

We investigate and we have special procedures for interviewing children.  Only staff with a certain level of specialist skills can interview children.  Our general policy is to interview children with an advocate.  Most often in the complaints, children are either victims or are witnesses to a crime.

The Policing Authority is an independent agency established by the enactment of the 2015 Act and we commenced functions on 1 January 2016.  Our key role is to oversee the performance by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of its functions relating to policing services.  The oversight approach of the nine-member Policing Authority, supported by the executive, prioritises meaningful engagement with the Garda Commissioner and senior Garda personnel through regular public and private meetings as well as a comprehensive programme of fieldwork and stakeholder engagement.  They all inform policing performance oversight across a wide range of themes.<\/p> <p>  Our net estimate provision in 2020 was &euro;3.3 million and a net surplus of just more than &euro;615,000 was returned.  Having conducted his annual audit, the Comptroller and Auditor General issued a clear audit certificate in respect of our 2020 appropriation account, with no findings or recommendations issued in respect of that year.  The year 2020 brought challenges that no one could have foreseen.  The authority recognised early in the pandemic that policing and its oversight held huge importance during this time of increased Garda powers, and it responded with agility to the Covid-19 crisis.  It was a very full and demanding year with more authority meetings than ever before, 63 senior Garda appointments, and a programme of oversight work engagement to inform oversight across a range of topics, including anti-corruption, the adult cautioning scheme, the Garda review of DNA samples, and the policing of children and youth.  Members will find a one-page overview of our work and achievements for that year in their briefing pack.<\/p> <p>  At the request of the Minister for Justice in April 2020, the authority embarked on what would be a series of 16 reports published across 2020 and 2021 on policing during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Since we recognised that the proportionate use of powers through the graduated approach adopted by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was very important for public confidence, the authority&rsquo;s executive attended at checkpoints and met with community organisations, NGOs and statutory organisations throughout 2020 to listen to the lived experience of policing during Covid from those being policed, as well as from Garda members.  This informed our engagement with the Commissioner and senior management, which continually emphasised the need for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to respect the human rights of those it was policing, while exercising the new powers afforded to it during the emergency.<\/p> <p>  It is the authority&rsquo;s position that restrictions to our rights must be shown to be necessary, legal, proportionate and non-discriminatory.  It is also important for public confidence that the policing service is held to account for the use of these powers.  An ongoing challenge to the authority and to the Commissioner is knowing whether policing during Covid or at any time is non-discriminatory in the absence of information about the distribution of policing or, in other words, who is being policed.  For example, because ethnic indicators are not collected or recorded, one would not know whether members of a particular community were policed or restricted during Covid to a greater extent than others.  This requires legislative change and remains of continued relevance to our work.  The authority recognised the importance of this consistency and engaged continually with members of diverse communities to enrich our reporting to the Minister.  These 16 reports were considered by the Cabinet and provided information and, at times, assurance, as to the manner in which the Garda was using its increased powers.<\/p> <p>  In 2020, we saw the emergence of an issue concerning the inappropriate cancellation of 999 calls.  The independent report to the authority from phase 1 of this work was published in November 2021 and we are currently overseeing the implementation of the recommendations arising.  Phase 2 is currently planned and is intended to take place in late May.  It continues to be dealt with as a high priority matter for the authority and provides an example to the committee of how the authority&rsquo;s proactive oversight of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has brought transparency to an issue that is crucial to public confidence in the policing service.  It stands along other critical issues we have dealt with that have arisen in the lifetime of the authority, such as mandatory intoxicant or alcohol tests, commonly known as breath tests, fixed charge notices, governance in the Garda training college in Templemore, youth diversion, and the review of homicide investigations.<\/p> <p>  The 2015 legislation that established the authority was intended to make a difference.  We believe that it has, in that it has created a public, independent, external oversight arrangement for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where none had ever existed before.  The legislation also sought to, and did, create an appropriate distance between politics and policing through the creation of a greater structural distance between the Department of Justice and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>In 2018, the Government published A Policing Service for our Future and the Department of Justice is currently drafting legislation to implement that report.  Under this plan, the existing Policing Authority and the Garda Inspectorate will come together to form a new body, the policing and community safety authority, in the coming years.  We welcome this development.  It is our intention to work to ensure that any changes in our functions brought about by this new legislation will not in any way diminish the robust public, independent, external oversight that has been provided by the authority to date and which the Oireachtas saw fit to establish in 2015.  We have identified some potential risks in the new legislation that may slow and inhibit, rather than support and encourage, the programme of change to which the authority and the Garda Commissioner are committed.  These have been shared with the Department of Justice to facilitate its further development of the legislation.  Until such time as the new policing and community safety authority is established, the Policing Authority&rsquo;s existing statutory functions will continue, along with policing performance oversight that is robust, proactive and independent. <\/p><p> In conclusion, I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, and his colleagues for the work that they do each year.  I also thank committee members for taking the time to listen to this opening statement.  We look forward to providing any further information that might facilitate the committee&rsquo;s consideration of the 2020 appropriation account. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022040700002#Z00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Hall","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649320200,"counter":435,"content":"<p>The lead speaker this afternoon is Deputy Hourigan, who has 15 minutes.

I am aware that the review process is not complete but, of the 2,316 incidents that have been reviewed for invalid closures, it was found that 134 crimes had not been recorded.  Is Ms Hall satisfied that this is a fair and reasonable reflection of the level of unrecorded crimes in the context of what we know about domestic violence, when you may be going back to people many days or weeks after an incident has occurred?

The review looked at a certain period and the number of calls within that period was 1.4 million.  Of that number, 200,000 were cancelled.  As it was not possible to look at 200,000 cases, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na rightly looked at the priority 1 calls or emergency calls as the top issue.  Emergency calls involve a threat to life and priority 1 calls involve other very serious threats of harm.  Things like domestic violence fall into that category.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na took the category of priority 1 and emergency calls as the first piece.  Within that, there were approximately 23,000 or 24,000 calls that needed to be looked at.  It then rated the calls for risk and looked into those 23,000.  Health calls, domestic violence calls and missing persons were taken.  These amounted to approximately 5,000 calls, which were then looked at.  Of that, it was found that approximately 3,000 were inappropriately cancelled, which represents quite a high percentage.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na then looked at those calls for further information and drilled down.  That is where the figure of 134 has come from.  To answer the Deputy's question, no, I am not satisfied.  There is more work to be done.  While the approach was appropriate, it involved looking at a subset of the 200,000 cancelled calls.  If you look at Mr. Penman's report, you will see that there are still unanswered questions and that, while we do not want to tie An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na up with looking into these 200,000 calls for the next ten years, we have to ask how much we have learned and focus on what will happen in the CAD call room tonight and in the future.  That must be the approach.  Having said that, there are still questions in my mind.  What about the other priority 1 calls?  What about looking at the other 175,000 priority 2 and priority 3 calls?  Are we sure they are classified properly?

We did that and, if you look at Mr. Penman's report that was published in November, you will see that he was satisfied with the process An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na undertook so, yes, the authority is satisfied that this might be the number of items that were not crimes.  Let us go back to the residual concern.  What are we concerned about here?  Of course, crimes may not have been recorded but the bigger concern and my personal worry, particularly in the context of domestic violence, is that, if something does not get into the system, that may have an impact on the ability to record on the system a risk against a woman who is potentially in danger.  It also means evidence is not being gathered for barring orders and so on.  That is not being built up.  There are other adverse impacts outside of crime not being recorded and prosecutions not getting across the line.<\/p> <p>  However, I will say that An Garda is very seized of this matter and that it is investing a lot of time in trying to remedy it.  We are dealing with 13 recommendations as part of phase 1.  We also had a concern about the tone of the responses given to people.  We hope that will be the next phase.  There has been a little bit of a legal difficulty in that.

You cannot force a decision but, looking at the statistics on our website, we have found that, when women do apply, they perform.  That is common to many organisations.  Women perform a lot better if they can be encouraged to put applications in.  That is the first step.  During the last competitions that were run, in 2021, we spoke to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about encouraging people to put their names forward.

I will also ask my colleague, Ms Tumelty, to speak on this in a moment.  Looking at spending first, the role of the Policing Authority in legislation is relatively limited in terms of the money given to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Our role is really just to advise the Minister annually.  We do not have a very strong role.  That said, we have nudged our way into trying to be more influential in that.  We have been pressing the Commissioner to cost the policing plan and say what can be done for the money.  It is difficult.  There are very few police services that do that sort of activity-based thing.  I do not think any do.<\/p> <p>  The second is clear from some of our performance reports, which we do twice a year.

Who decides what we measure?  Is there a process in the Policing Authority, for example, where there is a new undertaking?  I will give an example.  Last year An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na formally established the organised prostitution unit.  Sex work in general is a matter that I am very interested in.  It would be interesting to have information regarding violence against sex workers.  It seems that data is very hard to get.  At what stage does the process kick in?  Who decides what we measure and how do you get things measured?  Does the authority have a role in saying that we need to have certain data?  I am also a member of the Joint Committee on Health.

Every month, we receive reports from the Commissioner as part of our holding the organisation to account for the performance of those.<\/p> <p>  Returning to the specific question, all the data to which the Deputy refers would be housed within the PULSE system.

There has been a mix of crime statistics, milestones for the achievement of individual pieces of work and a public attitudes survey.  These are very useful, but on their own they do not give a full picture.  Crime statistics can be affected, as happened during Covid when the number of burglaries went down.  That was not because of any action by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, however.<\/p> <p>  Similarly, with milestones, it is a question of whether an activity or an input happened but also whether either of these had an impact on someone's experience of policing on, for example, any given Wednesday.  I do not know the answer to that.  While useful, the public attitudes survey arguably does not hit enough people in particular cohorts in order to be able to give a real sense of what their experience is.  This year, we have been pushing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and having really good engagement around having new reporting that would place better emphasis on outcomes for people.  This is something we are doing in our engagement work.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned sex workers.  We met with the sex worker organisations twice in the past year, because it is about the lived experience.  The policing plan does have a tick beside whether a certain policy has been implemented.  We will then go out and listen to garda&iacute; and ask them if a policy has been rolled out.  Have they the resources to do it?  What is their experience at station level?  We will then go and talk to the domestic abuse organisations and ask if it is happening in practice.  Those things in concert give a picture.  The big emphasis in what we are trying to do is see what is of value to the public in terms of people's confidence in the police service and confidence to report.  If I am in a certain part of Dublin, say, will I report?  If I am a member of a particular community, have I any confidence in reporting my crime or that I will get a response?  The tone of policing is important to people, as is how it is done.  It is also in terms of legitimacy.  Is there corruption in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  What about the recording of the use of force?  We are trying to recognise that those tangible, quantitative measures have a place but so does bringing in the lived experience of policing and what people tell us is impacting them as suspects, as victims or as people who just engage with the police.  That is what we are trying to do.  We are trying to talk to garda&iacute; about how they are listening to communities and how do they know they are being successful.  What are their measures of success beyond the quantitative?  There has been really positive engagement on that in recent months.  We hope that reporting will have good outcomes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022040700002#BB01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Margaret Tumelty"},{"type":"speech","time":1649320200,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I know I am out of time.

First of all, even in our very early days, when we first got our functions in 2016, we thought that information and data were incredibly important not only for public policy but also for the oversight of the Garda.  This goes back to Deputy Hourigan's earlier questions about indicators and so on.  We are responsible for appointments of very senior Garda staff as well as other Garda members.  We recommended the appointment of a chief information officer, who has been in place for a number of years.<\/p> <p>  As for the matter of homicides I was talking to Deputy Carthy about a few moments ago, some of that came to light initially, back in 2016 and 2017, through the classification of homicides as to whether incidents were being appropriately classified and whether that had an impact on the quality of investigations.  That was an element of it and it was a very concerning one.  We had a deeper concern about the quality of the investigations.  The argument is that if a sudden death is not treated as a homicide, will it get the resources it should get in respect of investigation?  The matter of homicides was a critical part of and a really important link into the data.<\/p> <p>  We meet regularly with the CSO.  Going back to the Vice Chairman's original question about whether we are concerned about the reservation, I think the Garda has made a significant number of changes and improvements in the past three or four years, particularly on data.  It has invested heavily in the Garda information services centre, GISC.  It receives the data in Ballina, records the data on PULSE and owns the quality of that, taking some of the burden off garda&iacute; who are out in the middle of the night.  They can dial into GISC.  That is one area where we want to make sure there are sufficient resources.  I think it will take a number of years for that reservation to disappear, but our interaction with the CSO would indicate that it is quite satisfied that the Garda is making good progress in the right direction.  Something like the CAD 999 issue last year might push things back a little because there are concerns there about classifications and things not getting on PULSE.  If I were sitting in the CSO, that might make me a little wary.  I will ask my colleague, Ms Tumelty, to chip in on this.  The plan, as I understand it, is that the CSO, before it lifts that reservation, will do a detailed review of quality.  Could Ms Tumelty add when that will happen?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022040700002#DD00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Hall"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649320200,"counter":524,"content":"<p>They have been doing work on that as they have gone along.  There is a data quality improvement plan between the Garda and the CSO.  As Ms Hall said, the CSO has expressed satisfaction with the pace and the investment the Garda has been making.<\/p> <p>  As for calls having to go through GISC, it has review teams there now.  There have also been merger teams because there was an issue with multiple identities on PULSE.  Another key part is the Garda's information technology vision, which is very much not about kit and hardware but about how we deliver information that will allow for information-led policing.  The Garda knows its data reach.  The difficulty over the years has been the ability to rely on those data, to access those data and to generate the type of reporting that can improve policing.  There is a lot within that vision.  I refer to the mobility project and the improvement in accuracy achieved through garda&iacute; being able to put fixed charge notices, FCNs, directly into their mobile phones.  Data quality comes up across most the big areas we have dealt with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022040700002#DD00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Margaret Tumelty"},{"type":"speech","time":1649320200,"counter":525,"content":"<p>I have been a regular reader of policing plans over many years.  Part of the reason I have been interested in them is that I have looked at the distribution of resources, which of course is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner.  If you do not have a sufficient number of garda&iacute;, you get a reactive type of policing.  It has a real impact.  There are particular types of crimes that do not show up if road checks and things like that are not being done.  I was looking at the ingredients of the policing plans over the years.  I looked at them before and after the most recent census of population.  We have just taken a new census of population.  I do an update every couple of years on the distribution of resources.  I raised this with the Garda Commissioner last week.  The same pattern keeps on cropping up and has cropped up for the past 15 years, and that is only since I have been looking at this.  The pattern is that the areas that are growing rapidly in population consistently have a lower ratio of garda&iacute; to population.  It is important then to factor in things such as the reliability of data because population will not be the only metric.  There will be crime statistics, but can you rely on the crime statistics?  Then the Garda is not detecting some crimes, so the crime statistics are lower than they would otherwise be and you are almost at a kind of revolving disadvantage.  Does the Policing Authority address that resourcing issue, or can it address it, with the Garda?  Does the authority look at the policing plans?  The quality of the public experience was mentioned.  The quality of that experience relies on visibility as well as everything else.  Having a sufficient number of garda&iacute; is important, but garda&iacute; also have to be safe in their workplace rather than going out to do their jobs on their own as opposed to in pairs.  There is the reactive element, safety and so on, but what does the Policing Authority do in interrogating those policing plans in respect of the distribution of garda&iacute;?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022040700002#DD00400","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649320200,"counter":526,"content":"<p>We have a very direct role in that in respect of, first of all, the adequacy of resources, on which we advise the Minister, but also in respect of effective policing.  That people experience is the bottom line of the service, as the Vice Chairman rightly said.  I share some of her questions about the distribution but, obviously, that is a matter for the Commissioner.  Sometimes you hear local joint policing committees, JPCs, or local councillors say they do not want a reduction in the number of garda&iacute;, but that should be a moving thing because it should be dependent on need, priority and, as the Vice Chairman said, population.  That is important.  I tend to be an optimist.  One of the big things I see as positive is that the Commissioner introduced in late 2019 - it has got a little delayed due to Covid but it is getting back on track - the biggest change in the structure of the Garda since 1922, which is what is called the operating model.  That is changing the way the Garda will resource and manage the organisation.  Where there were 98 districts which rolled up into 28 divisions, now there will be 19 divisions.  Some divisions will cut across two counties.  They will have their own resources but it will be on a needs basis.  That is looked at.  The decisions around those divisions were made based on population, crime and things like youth and socioeconomics.  There was a whole decision on that.  I think that will help because if a district is run by just a superintendent and the resources are not shared across the division, that becomes a little tricky.  That is one positive thing.<\/p> <p>  I go back to Deputy Hourigan's point about having the data.  One of the things we have been concerned about and one of the things we have pressed in our advice to the Minister is that there needs to be significant investment in IT.  It is hard sometimes.  This is an organisation of 18,000 people, and the Commissioner needs to know at his or her fingertip where people are, what they are doing and what they are assigned to in order that some of those operational decisions can be made and the force is not, as the Vice Chairman said, being reactive but planning ahead, looking at particular areas that have, for example, population explosions and therefore more young people, looking at the risks in that regard and the socioeconomic indicators and saying we need to take garda&iacute; away from certain areas.<\/p><p>Those are hard decisions that will also not be popular politically, but they are necessary at times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022040700002#DD00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Hall","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649320200,"counter":528,"content":"<p>I have had meetings over the years with senior officers of the Garda who told me that the outlook of divisional officers was, essentially, \"what we have, we hold\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022040700002#EE00200","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649320200,"counter":529,"content":"<p>Culturally, that must change.

Workforce planning, certainly, is central to the work we do.  The running of the senior grade competitions is our responsibility, so we must constantly have an eye on this issue.  One of the concerns the Vice Chair might be alluding to is that this time next year seven of the eight current assistant commissioners will no longer be in place.  We are very much aware of this issue and a competition is ongoing to fill these posts.  Therefore, we are aware of this issue in respect of the competitions we are responsible for.  We also approve the numbers of Garda staff and make the senior appointments.  If the Vice Chair looks back at some of our reports, she will see that workforce planning has been an issue we have been like a scratched record on.  I refer to getting workforce planning details from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This subject again goes back to some of the systemic aspects, but progress is being made in this area and we await a current workforce plan.<\/p> <p>  Concerning things like discipline and suspensions, we do not get involved in the detail of individual cases.  We would, however, want to see that such matters are being dealt with appropriately and independently and that they are being appropriately referred to GSOC.  We do not want to see themes arising from complaints that might indicate the presence of systemic issues we should be following up on from an organisational oversight perspective.  Therefore, we certainly would be cognisant of these matters.<\/p> <p>  On early retirements, we think this is common and we factor it in.  One provision of the contractual arrangements of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is that they can retire after 30 years' service, in contrast to those working in other sectors, and probably rightly so.  This means that there are people who could continue to work until they are 60, but who choose to retire at 50 because they can.  Personal choice comes into this context, but this arrangement has also always been a feature of the force.  Those of us who have friends and family members in the force, or who know garda&iacute;, know that some choose to go and have a different career, while others wish to continue their service up to the maximum permissible age.  It is an aspect that must be factored in and it makes Garda workforce planning a little difficult, but no more than any other organisation facing issues with retirement dates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022040700002#EE00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Hall"},{"type":"speech","time":1649320200,"counter":534,"content":"<p>Regarding suspensions, I have some responses to parliamentary questions on this issue.

Talking in the broadest terms possible, I refer to any information or third-party recommendations that come to the attention of members of the force and how they would act on them.  Deputy Commissioner Coxon is doing some work from the Garda's perspective on how the force can be assured that things are happening fast enough in this context.  I refer to something like a complaint or a grievance, and whether that is being handled.  I comment on this point because we had concerns, in the context of our clearance processes over the years, that sometimes the handling of internal procedures was inefficient.  Much work remains to be done in this area.  We want attention to be given to this matter, and we have already discussed with the Garda Commissioner how this aspect can be improved.

Those who are at the disposal or in the service of the people should be a coherent workforce.  It should not matter whether somebody is a sworn Garda member in uniform or a Garda staff member doing analysis, photographing a crime scene or doing tests on things.  There has been a huge shift in the Garda in the six years we have been overseeing it and we have encouraged that.  It is moving towards the professionalisation of certain areas that could be covered by non-sworn members and it is prioritising that and giving funding and positions to it.  There are a now a little over 4,000 Garda staff members.  We have several very senior people enrolled in areas like finance, HR, ICT, which were previously garda roles.  That is a positive thing,  A cultural shift is beginning to happen within the organisation to accept those people as peers.  However, it is only beginning; it will take time.<\/p> <p>  Going back to the operational model, the chief superintendent having a senior person at his or her disposal who will look after all the business services is crucial.  They can work together with a superintendent who is involved with all the serious crime across the division, not just silos in each district.  It is about having somebody who is looking at the performance and accountability and somebody who is really focused on community policing.  That is potentially a game changer and should be encouraged.  It is a change.  The idea that Garda staff members are not just typing up the notes and making the tea but are sitting peer to peer is a huge cultural change.  I know the Commissioner feels this as well.  There are policing roles that can be undertaken by Garda staff.  Do not tell me a 25-year-old cybercrime expert is not just as much a part of that policing investigation team.  The Garda members value that now.  It is about that mingling.  We have a role in that workforce mix, in encouraging diversity and having the right people in the right places.<\/p> <p>  The one thing the public, and the committee as Oireachtas Members, can do is not to automatically say they want more garda&iacute; in the street.  A lot of crime now comes into private spaces.  It comes in behind closed doors in the form of violence, child sexual abuse happening online or elder abuse happening online.  Having a garda walking down the street may not solve that.  It may be somebody sitting behind a computer with the right skills.  As a public we need to be careful and acknowledge that.  The committee should not get me wrong; there is an element of visibility making people feel safer.  That is also important but that is not the only thing and it is not always about more boots on the street.  It might actually be better to invest in the ICT that could save time so that when those boots are on the street, they are much more effective.<\/p> <p>  The Garda has made considerable progress with the mobility devices it has put into the hands of members but it is not just a question of handing someone a phone.  It is a question of the ICT and the stuff behind that, which costs money.  Our latest resource advice to the Minister related to this issue.  We sent a second letter in 2021, so seized was the authority of the matter of investment in ICT.  It is critical.  It needs to be ring-fenced, invested in and prioritised above all else.  I have no doubt it is a hard political decision to say we will not bring in 800 garda&iacute; this year but will bring in 600 and use the extra 200 worth of money to do something else.  These are hard decisions that will need to be made.  That non-visible policing has to happen if we are going to keep pace with the crime that is actually happening behind closed doors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022040700002#GG00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Hall"},{"type":"speech","time":1649320200,"counter":574,"content":"<p>I will just come back in on a few things.

From the beginning when the Commission on the Future of Policing made its report in 2018, and it was one of the things it noted.  To be fair, it was an issue we had been trying to do in any event, and we decided that on an administrative basis that there would be plenty of scope for us and the inspectorate to work closely, without needing to have legislation in place.  Myself and the chief inspector, Mark Toland, have been working closely together over the past number of years.<\/p> <p>  I will give the committee examples of such work as in anti-corruption, where the inspectorate would have done the report, would have kept us informed of what it was, and we would have then been pressing the Garda on implementation, would have had a public meeting on that, and would have received briefings from the Commissioner.  There has been a great deal of close working.  We have taken some of the reports, such as the report on child sexual abuse, and I will defer to Ms Tumelty on that, where we have worked quite closely with the inspectorate.  The recent custody report that was published by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate was taken at our meeting last week.  That work is a first step.<\/p> <p>  The second and more practical step is that the inspectorate is an office of the Department of Justice and the authority has been set up as an independent agency with its own Vote.  Myself and the chief inspector have already recognised that there will be some easy ways to do a merger in respect of this aspect.  We will start the talks and I am aware that the Department is leading out on that this year in looking at a stream of the things that are needed so that we are ready for much of it.  When we were developed in 2015&ndash;16, much of the legwork was done in creating an agency and in having just the basics such as having the lights on, an office, and all the financial statements.  We have started conversations on those issues but it is more important to look at ways in which we can work together in respect of the staff of both agencies.  <\/p> <p>  One of the positives is that we are both relatively small agencies.  Our staff number is 39 in total and the inspectorate has ten to 12 staff.  The organisations are not very big and I hope that that will make it a little bit easier.

One might actually want forensic accountants rather than garda&iacute; in uniform for something like that, or, again, to go back to those ICT specialists.  That sort of crime is quite complex.  There will be a pass-over between the CEA and something that then comes into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but there is a line for that there, which is the economic crime, the fraud, and the elder abuse which the committee has discussed earlier is financial crime and is directly within the remit of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

Forgive me if I go over areas that have already been covered.  I was caught on some other issues during the day.  I thank Ms Hall for her presentation, which I have read.<\/p> <p>  I compliment the Garda on the work that has been done from 2020 onwards in dealing with the issue of Covid and the way in which it worked with local communities in providing help and support, especially to people living on their own.  It was an extremely important contribution.  The Garda also worked with other people, getting them to assist as well.  As for the issue of policing and the work of the Garda, I wonder about community involvement.  I have seen it in my area.  I do not live that far from University College Cork, and there is very good co-operation between the local community and local garda&iacute;.  However, in areas where we have a high level of drug use and where cocaine and other drugs are now more prevalent - I suppose that applies everywhere but it is higher in some areas than in others - do the witnesses think a lot more could be done to have more garda&iacute; at street level than is currently the case?  Do we need to focus a bit more on policy and getting more garda&iacute; to areas where that is prevalent?  It is about getting garda&iacute; more involved with the community and working to resolve those issues.<\/p> <p>  The other issue I want to deal with is the challenge we face of having a growing elderly population and how we can change mechanisms.  I know it is not the responsibility of the Garda to provide the level of support it provided during Covid, and it went way beyond its call of duty in that regard.  It is about getting more co-ordination between the relevant State authorities, including the Garda, in dealing with issues like this.  Has that been looked at?  Have we looked at other jurisdictions in respect of that issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022040700002#JJ00700","speaker":"1523"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649320200,"counter":600,"content":"<p>I will start.  I may ask my colleague, Ms Tumelty, to chip in as well.  I could not agree more with the Deputy that the idea of multi-agency co-operation is key.  I echo what he has said, and other Deputies have said the same.  The job the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does for us in the middle of the night, in very difficult circumstances, is not to be underestimated.  Sometimes garda&iacute; deal with issues of addiction and mental ill health in the middle of the night.  They are the ones left trying to deal with that.  The new legislation is predicated on community safety.  It is in the Bill.  The new policing and community safety authority will have a role in overseeing that.  One question I have about the Bill is whether it goes far enough in delivering on the ambition of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, which was about requiring real inter-agency co-operation, working in inter-agency teams, but also that there would be money for that in order that it becomes real at a community level.  That is one potential for the future.<\/p> <p>  We have spent quite a bit of time on drugs policing in respect of oversight because we hear about that from communities suffering from the effect of dealers on the streets they are living on, with their children not being able to go out safely.  That feeling is not just a feeling of a lack of safety; they are not actually safe, and there is a sense and a concern that the Garda cannot resolve that for them.  There have been a lot of discussions with the Commissioner and his team about the fact that the Garda has made very good inroads at a very senior level in cracking organised crime gangs, but does that make a difference to the communities on a day-to-day basis?  One of the strategies the Garda has is to try to look at that.  The other thing that is important is the new emphasis on community policing.  That is a really important part and should not be considered a softer end of policing.  The Commissioner and the team are giving a new emphasis, and that is something we will be pressing for and encouraging.  There are things in the policing plan to ensure that that happens apace.<\/p> <p>  As for rural crime and people feeling safe, we have joint policing committees and there are some pilots out there for what will happen under the new legislation.  They are the community safety partnerships.  It is a matter of making sure that the initiatives that come from those community safety partnerships, or indeed the joint policing committees, truly come from the needs of the community and that they can see that as a way for them to be able to hold not just the garda&iacute; but also perhaps the local authorities or the local health service to account, looking at how, as a public or a community, we can encourage and engage the multidisciplinary piece.<\/p> <p>  I do not know if Ms Tumelty wishes to add anything.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022040700002#JJ00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Hall"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649320200,"counter":601,"content":"<p>I will just echo what the Deputy said about the experience of policing during Covid for an awful lot of communities.  We talk about Garda visibility; they talked about Garda presence.  Very often, having large numbers of garda&iacute; does not actually guarantee a sense of presence of garda&iacute; in one's community.  I remember one conversation in an inner-city area outside of Dublin.  The person talked about how the Garda station was within 100 yards but many of the garda&iacute; had never come into their community unless it was for enforcement reasons.  The person said that to have the garda&iacute; interacting with them on a positive basis was a very new thing and something they relished.  There is also the tone of policing.  We heard phrases such as \"Community policing got back to where it should have been\".  The operating model will be important in that regard and for the community hubs.  The community policing framework is being rolled out at the moment.  Our emphasis in overseeing that is that it cannot be just an allocation-of-numbers job; it must be asked whether presence is being delivered for communities.<\/p> <p>  As for drugs, we have heard very strongly from communities that they know that work is going on where there are large hauls of cash, guns and drugs but that this is not impacting their existence from Monday to Friday or from Monday to Sunday in their communities.  This year the Garda located drugs policing not in the section of the plan that typically deals with organised crime but in the community.  It is interesting that this can be seen as a small administrative thing or something that actually has meaning.  We have had a great deal of engagement with the Garda Commissioner and his team over the years on the need for the drugs policing side to look at the impact on communities.  We were hearing very strongly that, in respect of the type of policing, the emphasis on guns and tonnes, which is a phrase we have heard, was not necessarily delivering impact for people in terms of their fears about drugs and intimidation of their kids.  We heard from those communities that what we need is good, solid community policing, that garda&iacute; need to be in the community, not just for enforcement, and that they are needed to develop relationships with the young people.<\/p> <p>  To come to Deputy Burke's point about multi-agency work, that affects not only drugs policing but also elder care.  What has come across strongly from our talking to the organisations that work with the elderly is that the garda&iacute; are very often the first people to encounter the vulnerability and have the job of trying to discern where there is risk but that, after that point, there needs to be that multi-agency working and that safeguarding in respect of elderly abuse.  During Covid, we heard of people signing over permission to their relatives to collect their pensions.  Was that ever signed back?  Where was the safeguarding in that regard?  The Garda cannot do everything.  That is where the multi-agency competence and capability have to come in.  The community safety partnerships offer a way of doing that, but it is also a matter of that development of multi-agency working at a local level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022040700002#JJ00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Margaret Tumelty"},{"type":"speech","time":1649320200,"counter":602,"content":"<p>I will go back to the multi-agency approach.

Putting them through the centre was a far more effective way of getting the young people back onto the system so that they could earn a living for themselves.  I am wondering whether we are doing enough of that especially for young people who, for some reason or other, do not fit in to the educational system and end up on the street, starting illegal activity.

We would have seen it in our own work in overseeing the youth diversion programme, where there were some difficulties with there not being a consistent referral of people, and the importance of diverting people into precisely what Deputy Burke is talking about.  Sometimes we hear from the garda&iacute; and communities that it actually needs to go further and extend to primary school children in some areas because the organised crime gangs are becoming more directed at and are targeting younger children, particularly those who cannot be prosecuted, to do some of their running.  Children need to be diverted and I would say that the garda&iacute; are doing an immense amount of work.<\/p> <p>  During Covid some of the youth services closed, which in a way is a learning.  In the second phase of Covid lockdown, they were considered more of an essential piece because there were some children who were not getting into those sort of programmes.  They were stuck at home in situations where they should not have been.  That is where I see the ambition of the new Bill in terms of community safety and trying to get people much further upstream.  Why is someone in the court now?  Is it something that could have been addressed by investment in education or investment in the poverty situation he or she is in?  It is a complex issue but if agencies work together they could support children who are quite young and divert them into education before they ever get near that, or support a family so that they do not live in poverty.  Much more is involved.<\/p> <p>  The garda&iacute; are picking up the impact of some of the societal pieces downstream.

This opportunity has been a long time coming for me.  Therefore, pardon me if I sound a little emotional.<\/p> <p>  I am the national secretary of PII.  I am a 55-year-old citizen of this State with physical impairments and I am from County Laois.  PII is a national voluntary DPO founded on Monday, 29 March 2021 by physically disabled people, family members, carers and advocates of persons with physical impairments from a number of different counties.  Our DPO is made up of members with differing physical impairments, including people with congenital disabilities like myself, those being, disabilities that exist at birth or shortly thereafter; amputees or persons possibly awaiting amputations due to accidents, illnesses or disability; and wheelchair users, mostly following accidents, illnesses or disability.<\/p> <p>  In PII's opinion, a DPO is one that is managed, regulated and guided by people with disabilities, our families, carers and advocates.  It must be open to everyone in its particular constituency, as required by general comment 7, paragraph 11 of the UNCRPD.  The members of PII have agreed that a clear majority of our DPO must have a physical impairment.  Following legal opinion sought, DPOs are the only representative organisations in respect of disability matters under general comment 7, paragraph 10 of the UNCRPD, and I would like to remind the committee that DPOs are at the heart of the convention, as per general comment 7, paragraph 1.<\/p> <p>  One of the main aims of PII is to engage with our Government on the UNCRPD in addressing all human rights issues faced by physically impaired people and their families and carers.  Furthermore, one of our objectives is the full implementation of all aspects of the UNCRPD in our State without any further delay.  The members of PII see the UNCRPD as an agreement on the human rights of all people with disabilities, but also their families and carers.  The Government signed the convention in March 2007.  However, it only ratified the convention 11 years later in March 2018.  Ireland was the last country in the EU to do so.  In doing so, the State has agreed to stick to what it has agreed under the UNCRPD.<\/p> <p>  A citizen of this State may make an individual complaint to the UN under the UNCRPD's optional protocol.  Strangely, our Government decided not to ratify the optional protocol until 2020 when it was due to make its first report to the UN.  The State's report was finally published on 10 November 2021, much to the annoyance of many people with disabilities.  To rub salt in the wound, the optional protocol has still to be ratified almost four years after the UNCRPD was finally ratified by the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>  In the opinion of PII, the State must ensure that people with disabilities can access and exercise all the rights listed in the UNCRPD.  The Government and public organisations must now work alongside people with disabilities so that we can use transport and access buildings, matters that usually do not concern able-bodied people.  They must produce information in a format that people with disabilities can use and understand.  The State must ensure that people with disabilities have an adequate standard of living and enough money to live on, especially in the current economic climate.  People with disabilities must have the choice of where they live.  The Government must organise a register of all DPOs, as required under general comment 7, paragraph 61 of the UNCRPD, in conjunction with people with impairments without any further delay.  The State must provide core official funding to all DPOs and offer all possible supports to allow them to develop and flourish.  In 2022, DPOs have to be prioritised, distinguished and involved in the design development process as regards all of the State's policies and plans to confirm that they are disability proofed.  This must be done solely by people with disabilities, their families or carers.  The State must highlight, prioritise and distinguish all DPOs in all consultations related to disability and closely consult with and involve people with disabilities in all processes, as per Article 4.3 and general comment 7, paragraph 13 of the UNCRPD.<\/p> <p>  Physical Impairment Ireland, the national DPO of which I am proud to call myself a co-founder, met last Monday night, as we have for more than the past year.<\/p><p>My physically impaired friends and colleagues have requested that I respectfully inform this important committee that a person who requires a made-to-measure wheelchair should not have to wait six months for it.  People with mobility issues that require an ordinary wheelchair should not have to wait six weeks before receiving one from the HSE.  Medical cards should be made available to all people with disabilities and they should not \"lose\" them if they take up either part-time or full-time employment.  Furthermore the difficulties accessing health services and supports for people with physical impairments is becoming a nightmare.  The cost of prosthetic limbs has increased by 30% since Brexit and the cost of a silicone sock used by amputees is now about &euro;1,000 in some cases.  That equates to five weeks' invalidity pension in this country.  Just reflect on that for a few seconds.  These silicone socks protect the skin, absorb perspiration from a residual limb, absorb friction, cushion impact, compensate for shrinkage or swelling of the residual limb and provide a way to adjust to fit the socket.  These socks are not a fashion statement they are a necessity.  The tendering process for mobility aids and supports such as artificial limbs and devices such as wheelchairs must be looked at immediately.  Since Brexit the prices of limbs and wheelchairs have skyrocketed and many people with physical impairments cannot afford them.  However, they most certainly cannot afford to be without them.  Markets for them will have to be sought in mainland Europe.  <\/p><p> Our voluntary disabled person organisation, DPO, often discusses the lack of access to employment for people with physical disabilities.  In many cases in 2022 our well-educated members still fail interviews due to a visible disability.  That is just a fact.  When a person with a visible disability asks for feedback as to why they were unsuccessful prospective employers unfortunately still refuse to engage.  For many people with physical disabilities there are barriers to participation in political life in this country.  There must be sufficient supports for people with physical impairments trying to enter politics.  The lack of people with disabilities in both national and local politics is staggering.  Perhaps the Government and members of this committee need to start seriously looking at a quota system for people with disabilities to encourage them to enter politics as there is a serious under-representation of people with a living experience of disability in political and decision-making roles in this country.  DPOs are too often discounted and at best our expertise in having living experiences as people with disabilities is overlooked.  Since 2022, based on the findings of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, the committee has the power to make significant change to the lives of more than 250,000 people in this country.  I ask members to please use the power bestowed upon them wisely.

The DPO Network is an alliance of disabled people and their organisations of which we have five in Ireland which have joined together with a common interest in the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in Ireland.  The five DPO member organisations of the DPO Network are: AsIAm, Ireland's national autism advocacy organisation; Disabled Women Ireland, DWI; Independent Living Movement Ireland, ILMI; the Irish Deaf Society, IDS; and the National Platform of Self Advocates.<\/p> <p>  The DPO Network is committed to human rights and a social model of disability which says that exclusion, inequality and discrimination in disabled people's experience is not a consequence of their impairments but a result of the economic, cultural, social and political forces at play in society.  All of our work is led and informed by the active participation of disabled people based on their lived experience.  Given the broad membership base of the members the network gives a unique space for a genuinely cross-impairment discussion and analysis of the issues faced by disabled people and provides a space for networking between the organisations. <\/p> <p>  DPOs work from an explicitly human rights and equality approach.  Our aim is to build a more inclusive society.  We are informed by the social model of disability and, therefore, in all the documentation we use and in our discussions we use the term \"disabled people\".  That represents our values of equality and empowerment which are core to the DPO Network.  The term \"disabled people\" comes specifically from a view from disability advocates as in the social model of disability.  The social model of disability looks at how society is structured and how it disables people.  It is not based on a person&rsquo;s impairment.  It specifically looks at the barriers that exist in terms of attitudes, policy development, access or lack of access to supports that prevent people from fully participating in society as equals and ensuring they have choice and control over their lives.  Within this model it is society that disables people from achieving their hopes and dreams, not the person&rsquo;s impairment.  The social model informs the work of the DPOs and the members of the DPO Network.  Central to the way we work is to ensure that policy decisions that will directly affect disabled people's lives must be made in consultation with and influenced by those whose lives they will directly affect.  The work of the DPO is to work with policymakers, legislators and statutory bodies to develop policies and campaigns based on disabled people&rsquo;s lived experiences in order to remove these barriers that restrict the life choices of disabled people.  When these barriers are removed disabled people can become independent and equals in society, with choice and control over their lives.<\/p> <p>  The barriers are not just physical, they also relate to attitudes which we often find in society, based on prejudice or stereotyping, often called disablism.  These also disable people from having equal opportunities to be part of society.  Disabled people developed the social model of disability because the traditional medical model did not sufficiently explain the lived experience of disability or help to develop more inclusive ways of living within society.<\/p><p> DPOs are civil society organisations of disabled people as distinct and completely separate from disability service providers and charities for\u00a0\"clients\" or \"service users\".  Disability service providers, most of whom are funded at least in part by the State, often comprise boards and staff who are non-disabled people.  A more detailed discussion about this along with a number of other points related to terminology and definitions are covered in the submission we submitted to the joint committee.<\/p><p> I will now talk about the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  It is just four years since Ireland ratified the UNCRPD in 2018.  We are now at a very important juncture where leadership must be shown by Government in the implementation of the convention to progressively realise the rights of people with disabilities in Ireland.  Implementation of the UNCRPD will require the full and active participation of disabled people in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies to promote effective social inclusion through their representative DPOs.<\/p><p> The UNCRPD is not solely about policies and frameworks concerning disabled people's lives.  It is about ensuring that disabled people and their needs are given full regard in all aspects of public, cultural, economic, civic and political life in Ireland.  Ireland's implementation plan for the UNCRPD needs to be ambitious, robust and outline specific and measurable targets.<\/p><p> A key deliverable, as part of the programme for Government, is the development by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth of a plan for the implementation of the UNCRPD.  It is important that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Disability Matters focuses on and promotes the importance of a joined-up collaborative approach between Government and those delivering this implementation.  There is also a need for a co-ordinated cross-departmental approach to disability and the implementation of the UNCRPD.<\/p><p> \u00a0One crucial aspect of the convention's implementation is the ratification of the optional protocol.  The benefit of the optional protocol is that individuals or groups of individuals can make direct complaints against the State to ensure that their rights are being realised under the UNCRPD, and that they can lodge a complaint themselves.  The majority of European countries have ratified the optional protocol and Ireland should follow suit.<\/p><p> My colleague, Ms Browne, will continue with our statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022040700002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Lianne Quigley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649286000,"counter":619,"content":"<p>I am chair of the DPO network, which comprises five organisations.  I will continue on with the remaining items of the agenda that the joint committee is covering today.<\/p> <p>  First, I will talk about meaningful consultation.  In order to achieve meaningful equality, disabled people and our representative organisations must be consulted on all decisions that impact our lives and not just on legislation that specifically focuses on disability.  We live a full life and we do not only focus on disability issues.<\/p> <p>  We believe that consultation processes at all levels of Government and decision-making, including local government, must be accessible and underpinned by the principles of universal design.  Accessibility planning must also consider reasonable timelines to allow DPOs to participate fully.  We need that time. <\/p> <p>  There needs to be a robust and continuous forum for engagement with DPOs, both nationally and locally, in order to identify key areas of expertise and input.  One weakness that we have found is that too often in society the ideas around what we might be consulted about are decided by others who are mostly non-disabled people.  We do not even get a chance to set the agenda around the issues that we want to be consulted about.  We need ongoing dialogue where we can raise areas of priority, identify our own areas of expertise and be involved in setting the agenda as much as replying to the agenda.  Consultation should result in meaningful engagement.  That means that DPOs input must be genuinely taken on board, adopted wherever possible and that clear explanations are provided wherever DPO recommendations cannot be adopted.  We also need to ensure there is adequate representation of additionally marginalised groups who are often excluded.  For example,  people of gender, different backgrounds, ethnic minorities, children, and people with very high level and profound needs in terms of support.  We must bring everyone with us at the same time. <\/p> <p>  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act, and the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill, are probably the most significant pieces of legislation affecting disabled people's fundamental rights and freedoms currently before the Oireachtas.  We are concerned that the joint committee tasked with ensuring Ireland's implementation of the convention is not involved in its review in order to ensure its compliance with the principles and obligations of the convention.  We are also very concerned at the implications of the resistance shown to involving DPOs in consultation on the amendment Bill based on the erroneous belief that a focus group consultation, which took place way back in 2013 and before the convention was even ratified, suffices.  That is not the case.  We have similar concerns regarding adult safeguarding and other future legislation failing to involve DPO expertise from the earliest stages in terms of design and implementation.<\/p> <p>  In terms of enabling inclusion and participation, it is essential that DPOs are adequately funded and resourced to fulfil our duties.  This must include capacity building, funding of accessibility measures, governance support, training development, and access to information needed to influence policy and monitor the implementation of the convention.  Attention must also be paid to ensuring that disabled people are not expected to work for free on a voluntary basis and that we do not face negative consequences for engaging in any DPO-related work due to rigid means-testing restrictions on disability-related payments and other similar type supports.<\/p> <p>  Levels of resourcing and access requirements for DPOs must also be considered when developing frameworks to ensure meaningful consultation.  Some DPOs, indeed, members of our DPO network, even on the national level, are not in receipt of any funding whatsoever and rely solely on the volunteer work of disabled people who often have other day jobs.  This means we need longer consultation timelines and it is obvious that we do not operate on an equal basis to others around disability issues.  For example, should Irish Sign Language interpreters be required for internal consultation most DPOs will have to book them weeks in advance.  Therefore, if we are to be truly inclusive we cannot simply decide to have a meeting tonight at 8 o'clock unless we have pre-booked sign language interpreters.  It is important that these factors and examples like this are considered well in advance to ensure equal participation for everyone.  Similarly, people with intellectual and-or learning disabilities must also be given adequate time, resources and necessary supports to fully understand processes and be enabled to contribute in a meaningful way that respects their needs.<\/p> <p>  Consultation with DPOs, while useful, is not sufficient for the full realisation of our rights and, indeed, those contained in the UN convention.  Disabled people need to have decision-making power, oversight and monitoring of mechanisms and systems designed to implement the convention.  This requires continuous engagement with DPOs and developing working practices that are inherently accessible and universally designed from the start.<\/p><p>DPOs and disabled people need to be resourced on a continual basis to participate in such mechanisms.  It cannot just be one-off projects and pilots.<\/p><p> The final agenda item the committee asked us to address was around the cultural shift required through awareness-raising and local mechanisms.  The network has two points to make here.  Awareness-raising campaigns, while very useful, have limited value and so we need to be very careful in how design and develop them and what the purpose of them is.  They must be conducted in a way that is accessible, respectful and, most of all, not tokenistic to disabled people.  Awareness-raising campaigns have their place but are most effective when they are tied to a particular issue or issues that can be acted upon and result in meaningful change and where the goals of such campaigns are clear, reasonable and achievable for disabled people.  Historically, we often had non-disabled people going around towns to check out how accessible they were.  That is tokenistic.  That is not accessibility auditing.  We need to really think through this and the only way you can do so is by working with and talking with disabled people, and involving them in the development of such awareness-raising.  Much emphasis is sometimes placed on delivering training and equality awareness around disability issues on the basis it will solve the problem.  That is not necessarily so.  Any disability awareness training delivered to public and civil servants must be developed in partnership with DPOs and delivered by them.  Such awareness-raising is of little use if it continues to perpetuate harmful stereotypes or misinformation.<\/p><p> I have a couple of concluding remarks.  I believe members of this committee know we have an opportunity for Ireland to fully realise the implementation of the UNCRPD, including the ratification of the optional protocol.  How can this be achieved?  It can be achieved by taking action and recognising that now is the time.  Now is the time to bring our policies in line with our fellow European countries and adopt internationally-recognised standards.  Now is the time to resource and build the capacity of DPOs to support Government and service providers to achieve equality and access for all.  Now is the time to finally hear and prioritise the collective voice of disabled people and bring that voice and the value of it to the relevant local, national and international policy spaces.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022040700002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Jacqui Browne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":621,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Browne.

I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to present today.  I sent in a short statement but given my impairment it is not something I am going to be able to read out loud.  All I can say is I will use my notes from my phone and try to riff on the themes.<br\/><br\/>Voice of Vision Impairment was founded in July 2019 to specifically be a DPO space because we had read in November 2018 of the possibility of there being a DPO.  Many of us had been in the activist space prior to this and had achieved some notable victories.  However, the idea the UN committee itself and the UNCRPD gave priority status to DPOs over the service providers, allied groups, etc., that had been jumping in and speaking for us all those years, put a duty on us to step into that space.  We stepped up to the plate.  We fulfilled our part of the bargain.  We performed our civic duty to occupy that space not just because we were entitled to but because it is our gift to society to contribute to an equal society.  It is not a selfish act.  We are a collective.  It is collective agency.  In VVI we prioritise the experiences of those who are most disabled.  I mean those who are least resourced, etc.  For want of a better term, many of us use the phrase &quot;lowest common denominator&quot;.  We are looking at those with the least resources.  Very often, those perspectives are lost when you are dealing with individual disabled advocates or dealing service providers, etc.  It is about the voices members do not hear at the committee, or at their constituencies or in their constituency meetings in their offices.  They are the ones who most need to be listened to and the ones we prioritise.<br\/><br\/>We have a disadvantage in that most of us have difficulty using social media and so we do not have much of a social media presence, unfortunately.  We, therefore, rely mainly on visually-impaired network lists, etc., to spread the word and try to get as many visually-impaired people in the country to join us.  You might look at it like a trade union.  We are representative in the way a trade union is.  People have the opportunity to join, it is open and all visually-impaired people are welcome and their voices are equal.  We currently have 13 representatives throughout the country who have read our constitution and formulate our policies, etc.  We punch above our weight in that there is much enthusiasm and excellent work done by our representatives who are all completely unpaid because it is all completely voluntary.  All our members are blind or partially-sighted.  We do it through strategic policy committees representing public participation networks, PPNs, for instance.  We are also involved in local authority housing steering groups.  It is hard for me to remember all the stuff off the top of my head but by going through each of our representatives I can say something.  Last week we had a person join an Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, consultative committee for its research on disability.  We have people engaged with the HSE on very specialised committees on screening, etc.  We are also on disability user groups.  We have a very strong presence on public transport providers, etc.  This is all done by unpaid representatives.  We report back to our representatives as a core and update our members regularly as to what is going on.  Everybody has an opportunity to input.<br\/><br\/>I will move on to my next point.  Our core issues are travel and information.  By information, I mean that most State documents and even most stuff up on <i>gov.ie <\/i>are not accessible to visually-impaired people who use screen readers.  On travel, we need real input into the absolutely disablist long-term travel plans for most local authorities, which appear to be endorsed by the State.  It is more costly if we have to stay at home because it is just too dangerous to step outside.  On DPOs and the UNCRPD, Article 4.3, say states parties:&quot;.... shall closely consult with and actively involve [disabled people, as that is the term we are using] ... through their representative organizations&quot;.  That is the key part.<\/p><p>The point is that there is consistency and coherency.  One does not have to keep reinventing the wheel or depend on one person's experiences.  We can prioritise those who are most disabled or who have the least resources and put it into a framework so that we establish our positions, rather than each Department or committee doing independent research.  It is notoriously difficult for companies such as Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes or RedC to find blind people.  They can only operate through finding a friend of a friend.  It is not good enough.  There is a chance here for a coherent voice.<\/p><p> As Mr. Kavanagh said earlier, the only representative organisations are DPOs.  That is currently in the National Disability Authority's paper on language, as well as the legal opinion, and agreed with by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  The DPOs are key to the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Article 4.3 is part of general obligations and general comment 7 explains this in paragraph 3.  This means that there is no implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities without the prioritisation of DPOs in consultations.  Everything has to begin with co-design through DPOs.  They have to be distinguished.  One would not put trade unions in the same room as employers unless they are having a dispute, bargaining resolution or something like that.  Regarding the idea of ticking a box and putting all disability organisations, DPOs, and service providers in the same group, we often see service providers as being part of the problem.<\/p><p> Accountability is needed.  If matters that should be rights are to be outsourced to charities, there at least needs to be proper accountability and transparency.  That is a key role that DPOs can and should provide.  We do not use \"sector\" but the disability sector does, because it is an industry.  Too often, charities in it are treated as if they are a mix between Luke O'Neill and Mother Teresa, as if saying that they are experts but also that they are very good, too.  It is all well-meaning, but the UNCRPD points to a new way.<\/p><p> A clear majority in a DPO has to be disabled people.  It has to be led, run and directed by disabled people exclusively, not just by a clear majority.  It has to be an organisation that has been set up specifically to defend human rights.  It is not just a little bit of the purpose, but the main purpose of the organisation.  There is more, which can all be read in general comment 7.  Those are the main conditions.  DPOs should be distinguished from service providers under paragraph 13.  Ireland needs a register of DPOs, which does not exist at present.  Many local authorities do not even know what a DPO is, which is due to the lack of leadership shown by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, which is the key Department.  It should produce memos to let people know about DPOs and to prioritise them.<\/p><p> DPOs need to be registered.  We need core institutional funding, as mentioned by previous speakers, which is also covered in general comment 7.  Legislation is required to protect DPOs in several ways.  Our oxygen is being sucked up by some service providers, which are setting up would-be DPOs that are really under the control of the service provider.  That disempowers disabled people.  It is only through DPOs that they are empowered by the UNCRPD.  We do not have the resources, given that we have no income, to compete with charities that get millions to do their glossy magazines, presentations and so on, or to do things as regularly, because we are run not even on a shoestring budget, but with none at all.  It is just voluntary work.  Ultimately, the projects that do not involve DPOs need to be sanctioned as a result, which is laid out in general comment 7.  This is not reinventing the wheel.  We ratified this.<\/p><p> A massive cultural shift is needed in the State to overturn the idea that representative organisations are DPOs.  Non-DPOs have taken on the mantle of being representative organisations.  This has been shown in documents from this committee from July 2021.  We engaged with it on that matter.  It happened during the setting up of the Disability Participation and Consultation Network.  Disabled persons organisations and representative organisations were included.  Instead of being synonymous, with DPOs being the only representative organisations, this differentiated DPOs from representative organisations.  This happened as early as March 2020, in the national disability inclusion strategy review done by the Department of Justice.  This misconception is ingrained and a cultural shift needs to happen.  It does not matter if a charity or service provider is led by a disabled person.  It is still not a DPO under the conditions required to be a DPO.  Generally speaking, a service provider cannot be a DPO.  There are very rare exceptions, which I suspect would only happen in the case of persons with intellectual disabilities.<\/p><p> Rather than defining DPOs out of having a representative role, much balance needs to be redressed and lost ground needs to be made up for.  Much is happening right now.  The National Disability Authority was set up in 1999.  That subsumed many functions given to DPOs, such as advice to the State, which is embodied in the National Disability Authority.  That needs to be looked at.  We also have the disability steering group.  Only a tiny minority of representation on that is from DPOs.  The disability consultative committees in various Departments involve hardly any DPOs in their own right.  The Oireachtas disability group involves hardly any, or no, DPOs.  All of this needs to be reversed.<\/p><p> We have given many examples.  The most significant issue is the implementation plan for the UNCRPD.  It is astounding that we have not even been approached about that core topic.  Instead, the National Disability Authority and disability steering group have been approached.  It is no wonder that Article 4.3 does not feature at all in the State's report on the UNCRPD.  The core basis of the UNCRPD and of DPOs is missing.  Without that cornerstone, there cannot be any meaningful implementation of the UNCRPD.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022040700002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robbie Sinnott","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":624,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Sinnott.

A man who was visually impaired came to me during the last election.  There was hassle when trying to sort things out for him.

I am a firm believer in awareness and, like everything in life, it is unless one is affected by it or a family member is.  It is important that people with a disability have a say and that needs to be part of an awareness campaign so there is proper awareness of people who it affects.  I said previously in one of our meetings that for years Carlow had a beautiful train station, but there was no lift.  The lift was installed a few months ago, but it was unacceptable that a wheelchair user would have to cross the train track to get across to the other side.  Again, these are issues we cannot keep fighting for all the time.  We must make sure that there is an awareness and we must put funding into it.  I am a firm believer in funding an awareness campaign on where we are falling down.<\/p><p> Other speakers spoke about access.  That has to be addressed.  We also probably have to look at other countries and how they are doing it because I believe we are behind.  That is another area again.

If there is no framework in place or essential register of all public bodies to consult with, that needs to happen urgently to ensure a structure through consultation with regard to policies that affect people.  It is all about policies and we must make sure that we deliver them.  We also must implement them.<\/p><p> The other issue is funding.  For me, the core issue today is funding.

With approximately 80% unemployment, blind people will not be able to afford to get a taxi there.  I know things have improved somewhat with Covid-19, but previously many people wanted eye-to-eye contact.  It was not the blind people necessarily, who would be happy enough with the telephone, but the politicians themselves.  Even starting with that basic connection, we have had experience of that down through the years and we have raised it with party leaders.  At the same time, the very basic problem for visually impaired people is the fact that a lot of the information is not accessible.

I was struck by what he said about HSE waiting lists.  We were all very encouraged that a new budget was allocated for tackling waiting lists in the last budget.  However, people are waiting six months for wheelchairs, and the Brexit impact on the price of prosthetic limbs is an increase of 30%.  Combined with the fact that many people may ultimately lose their medical cards if they get to a point where they are starting full-time work, this definitely disadvantages people, from a healthcare perspective, who are already marginalised in our society.

Participating in politics or participating in a forum like today's is the very foundation of democracy.  In talking about Ireland being a truly democratic society, democracy demands that everyone is involved, including disabled people.  As mentioned earlier, we are nowhere near the proportional representation of disabled people in Irish society <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the number of disabled people in the population.  I make that broad point.<br\/><br\/>I will give a specific example related directly to this committee.  I did some research and my understanding is that this is the 37th meeting of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters.  While the committee has done some fantastic work, having gone through all the witnesses who have appeared before the committee to date at all its 37 sessions, this is only the sixth session to which DPOs have been invited which is a very poor record on the committee's part.  Before talking about what other people should be doing, we may need to look internally at our own practices.  Committee members need to be mindful of that.  There is nothing like a good example to illustrate a point as any parent will know from teaching their children.  It is the same principle and the committee should consider it a bit more when planning agendas for future sessions and whom it invites - and includes or excludes as the case may be.  Those are the critical points I would make.<br\/><br\/>Regarding capacity building, if the committee genuinely wants to see more participation and the development of DPOs in this country, we need to have ring-fenced funding.  It is required under Article 33.3 of the convention and is further developed under general comment 7 which specifies that organisations of persons with disability should have appropriate resources, including access to independent and self-managed funding.  We cannot be held with a tag line, &quot;You can only use this funding for X, Y or Z - our way or no way&quot;.  That is not the kind of funding we are looking for.  We need funding that respects the work of DPOs to promote the voice of disabled people across Irish society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022040700002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Jacqui Browne"},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":640,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses for their presentations and for attending the meeting.  In its recent report, Ensuring Independent Living and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the committee recommended that additional consultation should take place with DPOs.  Like everybody else, we are also learning the difference between a properly constituted DPO and some other representative organisations.  A proper register is needed so that public bodies that wish to carry out consultations, which they should do on all issues, know whom they should contact.<\/p> <p>  The term \"disability, participation and consultation networks\" suggests that is a body people should go to.  However, it is not made up of DPOs.  Therefore, that needs to be reconstituted or a different body put in its place to represent DPOs so that if different bodies need to consult on issues, they know they are recommended to whichever body represents the people they need to speak to.<\/p> <p>  I was struck by a point Ms Browne made about consultation.  Consultation is not enough; they need to be involved in the decision making.  Many disabled people to whom I have spoken may be involved with housing strategic policy committees, SPCs, or transport organisations.  They meet and give their recommendations which are subsequently simply ignored.  It needs to be more than just a box-ticking exercise for these bodies to say they have consulted with disabled people and then they can move on and do their own thing anyway.  These public bodies need to be held to account to ensure that when they consult with DPOs and get recommendations they implement those recommendations.  I would be interested in any thoughts the witnesses have on that how and how it can be improved.<\/p> <p>  What is the best way for children with disabilities to be represented?

Deputy Tully is right to point out how critical it is.  The convention calls for specific consultation with women, girls and children with disability.  This documentation and guidance on tiered level consultation - number one would be the pure DPOs, number two would be, as the Deputy pointed out, parents of minors or children with disability.  There would be others like a person nominated by disabled people to speak or support them in having their voice heard.  It is similar in ways to parts of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act where someone might choose to appoint a decision-maker to support them in their life.  It is that kind of idea.

Awareness raising cannot hold a candle to the fundamental structural need to embed meaningful consultations, as Deputy Tully said, in the decision-making process itself with DPOs.  That is the structure.  It is not possible to conduct a survey of 5,000 or 10,000 disabled people every time; that is what the DPOs are for.  We are the experts and we know what our members need.  We live it and we know it.<\/p> <p>  Regarding architects and engineers raising awareness about disability, they just think, \"There's that disability thing again.\" and just tick the box.  Their idea of universal design is to balance their desires with the so-called needs of disabled people.  We know who will win out there.  As I said before, there are no blind architects or civil engineers.<\/p> <p>  General comment 7 of the UNCRPD is also clear there is a hard line to walk in that they need to ensure where children's voices are represented it is their voice and not somebody on their behalf.

Where disability matters are concerned, the UNCRPD and the new paper from the National Disability Authority, NDA, make it clear that the only representative organisations are the DPOs.  There is a framework laid out in general comment 7 as to what properly constitutes a DPO.  It would be helpful if that framework was applied when the State organises its register.  This will be a cultural shift, but when the register is being put together, the State has to consult DPOs, although I know that is a bit like the chicken and the egg.  In everything directly involving disability, DPOs come first but DPOs also have to be involved in other ways because everything affects disability, as set out in general comment 7, paragraph 17.<\/p> <p>  Everyone filled in the census forms on Sunday night.  Since most severely visually impaired people were not able to do so independently, they were in the same position as they were in 1901.  That is not acceptable.  I am unsure about Wales or Scotland, but at least two of the three nations of Great Britain have allowed censuses to be filled in online since 2013.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, did not respond to us formally after we looked for something similar, only by phone.  This is a case where others literally have to be people's voices.  People will not discuss sensitive issues that need to be filled in.  For example, where they are asked whether they were previously married, they might have to say that they have never been married.  Who knows?  The service providers will only do one type of Braille, which they enforced in 2013 regardless of what the rest of us learned in school and have used for all the intervening years.  There is only a click of a button in the difference in a drop-down menu, but all of the Braille service providers in Ireland ideologically refuse to do it, so even when the questions were sent out in Braille, they were not accessible to many Braille readers.<\/p> <p>  I referred to our Capel Street consultation.  We made a submission to that, but it will be aggregated among the thousands of others, especially from cyclists.  Cycling is fantastic if you can cycle, but the rights of disabled people to access their own environment safely is enshrined in European and Irish law.  It is in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  This is something that we cannot take for granted.  For someone who is visually impaired, getting from one end of Capel Street to the other used to take 20 minutes.  Now, it takes well over an hour.  One of our members described it to me yesterday as \"traumatic\".<\/p> <p>  There is e-scooter legislation and, in 2019, the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport issued a ministerial order and announced that he was giving &euro;2 million to the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, NCBI, to set up a wayfinding centre.  Problematically, the intention is for the NCBI to be placed at the core of consultation on any matter relating to transportation in this country, but that is clearly inimical to the UNCRPD and the role of DPOs.  We were not consulted on the wayfinding centre and do not believe that there is a need for it.  It is an opportunity cost because people need to be trained and helped in their own environments first and foremost.<\/p> <p>  Ireland has to implement the European disability Act by June.  We wrote to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth &ndash; we sometimes call it the \"Department of Everyone\" &ndash; last July to see whether we could help with the consultations.  We were completely ignored and did not even get a response.  This is the sort of issue we are meeting.<\/p><p>This is the tip of the iceberg.  Our voice has either been aggregated among thousands of others at best or else just completely and utterly ignored.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022040700002#J01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robbie Sinnott","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649286000,"counter":654,"content":"<p>I thank Senator O'Loughlin for her questions.

I did a huge amount of work around supporting disability awareness and equality training.  I would really question the value of delivering or undertaking awareness-raising exercises unless they are tied to a specific expected outcome or behaviour one is trying to address or change.  Therefore, just going off and delivering a set of<b><\/b>PowerPoint slides, whether it is by disabled people or not, is not awareness raising.  We really need to get our heads around what the purpose is.  Why do we want to throw buckets of money at raising awareness unless it is tied to a specific task, objective or, ultimately, a change in behaviour, be that around how committees work or how a public participation network, PPN, might work and how it involves people?

I spent much of my childhood in Cappagh hospital with some injuries.  What I can say, and what I know from having to use the services is that, as Mr. Kavanagh said, it is actually very expensive.  It is very costly to be disabled in Ireland today.  I do not know how much it is to rent a wheelchair in the country nowadays but it was &euro;100 per week in 2012.  In one month, a person is out one month's wages from renting a wheelchair.  From a personal perspective, I have an awful lot of empathy for people who have to work really hard and then spend their money on basic needs.<\/p> <p>  Last week, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, presented to the committee on grants and money that is available for people.  I do not think that is enough, however.  We talk about people running for elections.  I remember speaking in 2020 about the reform of the Seanad and how it should be representative of people who have disabilities.  One Senator emailed me to let me know he had a disability.  My point was that just as it is not good enough to have one member of the Traveller community in our Parliament, it is not good enough to have just one member of our Parliament who has a disability.<\/p> <p>  A man who is deaf ran on the same panel as me for the Seanad elections, namely, the Labour panel, although, unfortunately, he did not get in.  He missed out on a few votes, similar enough to myself.  It is very difficult.  We should have a quota in our political systems at local and international level for people who are disabled.  That is a crucial piece of work on which we should all be working together.<\/p> <p>  In this committee in general, people do not really understand the difference between DPOs and Disability Participation and Consultation Networks, DPCN.  It is terrible when someone with dyslexia tries to read out those letters; it is a bit difficult.  We need to be very clear on our understanding as a committee around what it means.  What are the witnesses' takes on it?  I  know that DCPNs are different from DPOs and that much of the time, they overlap.  Ms Browne touched on that.  Could she give us a clearer understanding?  I think our language is critical.  I have so many questions but I will leave it there.  Again, Ms Browne talked about the 37 meetings we have had and that we only had six around DPOs.  How can we do better in engaging with DPOs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022040700002#K00400","speaker":"1657"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649286000,"counter":657,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Flynn for her questions.  I fully agree with her when it comes to setting up a disabled persons quota, particularly in the Seanad.  To have a deaf person or a person with a disability is important.  A deaf person ran for election but, sadly, did not get elected.  It is incredibly important to have that representation.<\/p> <p>  To go back to the point about the DPCN and DPO, the DPCN would include service providers within its meetings.  There is a broad range of members within that.  It can, therefore, sometimes be difficult to challenge those members within those meetings.  These meetings have been going on for approximately two years and it is very clear from them that the DPCN is not a DPO.<\/p> <p>  I will go back to Senator O'Loughlin's points about improving consultation and the involvement of disabled people.  It is so important to have access and resources in place to make sure to include all different kinds of disabilities, for example, to provide an Irish Sign Language, ISL, interpreter.  If there are no resources, that completely excludes some disabled people.  They are completely excluded straight away.  I know, for example, that sometimes deaf people would go to a meeting but no interpreter is provided so they are automatically excluded.  We need, therefore, to make sure we have the accesses in order to provide inclusion and access to everyone.<\/p> <p>  To speak briefly about disability awareness training, Ms Browne is right.  I fully agree with the idea that there is no point in just having presentations without them being tied to specific actions.  From my experience, I feel it is very important to have a disabled person actually leading the disability training because it has a greater impact on those who are attending it.  Again, it depends on what the specific aim is.  If, for example, deaf awareness or disability training were being provided to someone's workplace, it is important to have a disabled person there to actually be able to relate the lived experience.  Similarly, if it is in a school with a deaf child in a class, it is important to deliver training that is specific to that workplace or that environment's needs related to the disabled person's own experience.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022040700002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Lianne Quigley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649286000,"counter":658,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Flynn for her questions.  The Senator was seeking clarification on the whole issue of the DPCN.  We must remember, and it has been referenced a few times already this morning, that disabled people historically have been excluded.  We were hardly spoken about never mind having a place at the table.  However, because of, and thanks to, the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, we now have a rightful place at this table and many other tables to participate and not just be heard or asked what we think.<\/p><p>The days are long gone when people would pat a disabled person on his or her head and ask someone else whether he or she took sugar in his or her tea.  The problem is disabled people in this country still struggle with what I call disentangling historical attitudes where service providers for very large groups and organisations that provide services spoke on our behalf and represented what they believed were our needs to the Government, Departments, Ministers, politicians and, indeed, through their charity fundraising.  Where service providers are associated with representing the voice of disabled people, that must stop.  To be fair, some good service providers acknowledge that and are very supportive of DPOs.  There are some people who really support DPOs and are very mindful to step back in order to let disabled people take their rightful place in society and talk about their own lived experiences.  We referenced that in our submission last February and our opening statement today.  It would be great if the committee could get their heads around that.  I understand the Disability Participation and Consultation Network was invited to send representatives to attend today.  The network declined because it decided that, as it was not a DPO, it was not its place to attend a meeting for DPOs.

The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities obliges the State to closely consult with and actively involve disabled people, including children with disabilities, through their representative organisations.  This is an incredibly important provision and one that very clearly the Irish State is not adhering to.  The Disabled Persons Organisations Network rightly noted that the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill has been developed without proper engagement with DPOs.  In addition, the disability support services have produced draft codes of conduct without the involvement of DPOs.  Therefore, if the Department that oversees the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities cannot get this right, then we are right to wonder what hope there is for the rest of Government.<\/p> <p>  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  I want to let the witnesses know that the committee has just finished its report on the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill and one of the recommendations is to immediately revisit the codes of conduct in consultation with DPOs.  On Tuesday, I raised these concerns in terms of the Government's Electoral Reform Bill due to implications for facilitating disabled people participating in the democratic process and standing for election, which is an issue that has come up a lot during the conversation so far.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage does not seem to have engaged at all with DPOs on this incredibly important matter either.<\/p> <p>  My first question is for Ms Browne and Ms Quigley and concerns a point they made in their opening statements.  Can they outline whether Departments have engaged with DPOs on legislative or policy matters?  How would they recommend Departments go about meaningful consultation in the future?  If this committee is to hold Departments and public bodies to account, then any guidance they can give us on the standards they would expect, and we should all expect, would be very useful to this committee.<\/p> <p>  My next question is for Mr. Sinnott.  All of the witnesses who have come before the committee mentioned that Ireland has not ratified the optional protocol of the convention.  This committee is pushing the Government on that matter.  I ask Mr. Sinnott to elaborate on the significance of ratifying the optional protocol as it would be useful for us to put that argument and reference what he says.

We are not going to be idiots and we will not sit up until 2 o'clock in the morning writing responses to the State that will probably be left on a shelf.

In 2020, the DPCN was set up based on a misconception.  It refers to DPOs and representative organisations.  It does the opposite of acknowledging, in that it actually states that the only ones which are not representative organisations are DPOs when the opposite is true.  It is a very basic misconception by the \"Department of Everyone\".  That is fundamental.  As Deputy Cairns said, if the Department gets it wrong, and this is the focal point of the UNCRPD, then that is very serious and the Department should be accountable.<\/p> <p>  The DPCN and that space receives &euro;100,000 a year.  Is that purely to just get stuff?  We have a meeting with the DPCN tonight as we are on the steering group.  I have great respect for the colleagues we will meet there but that is not a DPO space.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make a related point that follows on from what Ms Browne and Ms Quigley said.  We are volunteers and we go to the trouble of working very hard on policies, etc.  There is no point in us going to meetings where we are in a tiny minority and everything must be filtered through, including if it is on the disability steering group.  As a representative we have to represent non-DPOs yet our own members are not properly represented.  Everything is filtered down and mediated but that is not what our members deserve.  I am only entitled to represent our members.  Our members are expected to go along to meetings that might last two hours, of which only five minutes might concern something directly related to us.  The whole structure needs to change.  People need to come to us and ask what is the best way for us to interact and not for them to decide the way to do things, and just deciding at the last minute as they do.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the optional protocol, if I were the State I would delay it for a very long time.  The State's performance on the UNCRPD has been so bad.  The cynic in me says the State will delay this as long as it can, and possibly until 2029.  Even when asked for feedback on the initial State report on the UNCRPD, it more or less ignored everything in the actual report published in November.  I am thinking, in particular as we are here with DPOs today and it is a very central issue, that it just passed it off and did not include the DPOs.  Shockingly, Article 4.3, which is the cornerstone of the UNCRPD, is not mentioned in the State's report.<\/p><p>I do not know why.  I think that, to a certain extent, it is just people doing what they do because that is the way they have always done it.  There is a perception that these are the new kids in town and a question over whether they are house-trained and so on.  There may be some prejudices in that way from a civil servant's perspective.  One key civil servant in the Department said to me in November, when we were talking about the role of DPOs, that we have to live in the real world, to which I responded that the real world is the UNCRPD.  I have not heard from him again but he was a key person within the Department.  Many civil servants do not get it.  They have to be told what the UNCRPD is, but we are always here to explain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022040700002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robbie Sinnott","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":665,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests.

It is disappointing to hear of that attitude among departmental officials.<\/p> <p>  I was attending a separate committee meeting, so I apologise if I end up going back over previous questions.  We in this committee have such good intentions and really want to do our best.  What are our guests' main asks in the context of what we could do very simply?  What could we do to push Departments?  Do we need to regulate for a process whereby DPOs will have to be included in consultations?  Time and again, at meetings of various committees of which I have been a member, this lack of meaningful consultation is a critical stumbling block in regard to so many issues, and the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act is just the most recent example of that, albeit a prime one.  One of our guests referred to the electric vehicle legislation and the blanket ban on cars coming into Dublin city centre.  These are ableist policies and we are not looking after our citizens.<\/p> <p>  I fundamentally agree with Mr. Sinnott and previous speakers that we have to fund DPOs.  We have been funding disability services and advocacy groups for decades, but we have not funded and supported disabled persons to be their own advocates.  I cannot see anybody being a better advocate for disabled persons than disabled people.  It is about time we shook that up and made sure we had meaningful change.  County Louth launched its first DPO in December and Ms Paula Soraghan attended the committee meeting.  She made a powerful contribution in explaining the importance of disabled persons organisations and of being her own advocate.  Who among us wants anyone else to speak on our behalf?  We should not expect a disabled person to accept that either.<\/p> <p>  I am a great supporter of the campaign Personal Assistance Service Now.  There is something of a grey area in regard to disabled persons being allowed to have a personal assistant, PA, at a political meeting.  How do those restrictions impact on disabled persons who might need a personal assistant in taking part in political campaigns or being active within their communities?  As we all know, we need more diversity at the political table.<\/p> <p>  In summary, would allowing personal assistants to attend political meetings help people partake in political activism?  What simple and clear asks do our guests have of this committee?  Finally, what are their opinions on the clear funding of DPOs and how that will impact on them personally and on the entire sector?

There needs to be a framework in order that they can set up.  That needs to be there.  That register is important.  These are immediate asks.  There is a much longer list in general comment 7.  I sent that document to the committee, including that, back in October.  I can send it again, that is, exactly what general comment 7 states needs to be done in terms of legislation.  One thing that can be done immediately is that the \"Department of Everyone\" needs to send out a memo to all 600 quangos, Departments and so on, letting them know that DPOs need to be prioritised in all consultations and decision-making and to be closely involved.  That memo needs to go out.  The Department clearly needs to get the memo itself, because it does not even act on that itself.  It has to be brought home to the Department that it has to live up to its obligations on behalf of the State under Article 43 and to take them very seriously.<\/p> <p>  Talking about personal assistants, if I had &euro;3,500 I could buy a Braille note-taker and I could be reading away here on Notes.

Funding, recognition and the comment from an official in respect of the real world is extremely telling.  It is extremely telling because whose real world are we living in?  We have to be all-encompassing and ensure everybody is facilitated.  Our committee has met on 37 or 38 occasions over the past while.  Our members are extremely committed to advancing the cause, to doing right and to making sure that when we are finished the life and the circumstances of people with disabilities are highlighted and improved.  Sometimes we speak almost in a vacuum.  We speak to witnesses every Thursday morning and very powerful evidence, no more than what was given today, is given to us in regard to the daily challenges the witnesses have.  We launched a report on some of the work we have done on Ensuring Independent Living and the UNCRPD four weeks ago.  No member of the media cared to turn up to go through the report with us.  If we started throwing rotten apples at each other, we would be on the front page of the <i>Irish Independent <\/i>every week but members of our committee put party politics aside when they come into the room and do what is right.  That is from our side.  If witnesses take that to their side, to the DPOs and the organisations they represent, and the invisibility within mainstream media, it is not trendy enough but it is the lived and the life experience.<\/p><p>Depending on the statistics, 20% of people have a disability of some form, which is one fifth of our population.  There is a huge challenge to try to make the case and highlight the challenges that are there.  On a Thursday morning, we hear the phrase &quot;the real world&quot; that reflects the attitude.  Our committee and the Houses of the Oireachtas have to make sure the real world shines a light on what the real world is for 20% of the people and make it better.<\/p><p>I hear the witnesses loud and clear in regard to the issues they have raised.  We will continue to bang the drum as loud as we can.  Maybe we need to bang the drum louder and get the percussion set going rather than just the drums to make it a bit louder but we will certainly do that.<\/p><p>I thank the witnesses for their powerful evidence.  Mr. Kavanagh made his point, although not in an adversarial way.  The stronger the witnesses are to us, the stronger we can be in highlighting the challenges.

Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Participants in the committee meeting who are in locations outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that the constitutional protections afforded to those participating from within the parliamentary precincts do not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether or the extent to which participation is covered by the absolute privilege with statutory nature.<\/p> <p>  Having given those formalities, I will now call on each group to make its opening statement.

This morning I am joined by AkiDwA representatives Ms Uruemu Adejinmi, chairperson, and Dr. Caroline Munyi, co-ordinator of migrant women&rsquo;s health.  Our organisation welcomes the establishment of this Oireachtas Joint Committee on Gender Equality and views it as an opportunity to advance gender equality in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Akina Dada wa Africa, or AkiDwA, which is Swahili for sisterhood, is a national network of migrant women living in Ireland.  Established in 2001, AkiDwA&rsquo;s mission is to promote equality and justice for migrant women, with a vision for a just society where there is equal opportunity and access to resources in all aspects of society: social; cultural; economic; civic; and political.<\/p> <p>  For AkiDwA, the term \"migrant women\" includes not only recent immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees, but also migrant workers, spouses of Irish and EU citizens, students, trafficked and undocumented women.  It also includes those who have acquired Irish citizenship but who still consider themselves to be outside the mainstream society in terms of their linguistic, racial or cultural backgrounds and who therefore still define themselves as migrants.<\/p> <p>  Today our presentation is focused on recommendations 37 to 41, inclusive, made by the Citizens' Assembly and mainly on how AkiDwA believes they can be advanced.<\/p> <p>  Domestic violence happens in families in all regions and from all social, cultural and ethnic backgrounds, regardless of age or disability.  However, some members of society face additional barriers in accessing services and getting to safety.  Migrant women indeed have certain vulnerabilities which need to be taken into account, which characterise the abuse that they suffer and their pathways to safety.  Ireland&rsquo;s response to domestic violence needs to be aware of these vulnerabilities and build cultural sensitivity into this framework.<\/p> <p>  Since the beginning of the pandemic, rates of domestic violence have increased substantially in Ireland.  In AkiDwA between 2020 and 2021, we dealt with 123 cases and our office remained open to support women.  As noted by the Immigrant Council of Ireland, the number of domestic violence cases experienced by migrant women increased to 12% in 2021 compared to the previous year.  According to Women&rsquo;s Aid's 2020 report, 941 women who called its helpline said that they were members of a minority group.  Some 93% of these were migrant women.<\/p> <p>  AkiDwA asserts that domestic abuse of migrant women in Ireland is an expression of power and control, which can further be aggravated by issues of culture, tradition and immigration.  It can be made worse for migrant women living in Ireland because they are far away from their home countries.  Most have no extended family support, due sometimes to family reunification barriers.  Some face difficult residency status situations that could be contingent on a husband&rsquo;s residency, cultural or religious factors, isolation from support networks and discrimination, and others may have language barriers affecting their access to services.<\/p> <p>  Recommendation 37 states that all Government action to prevent and counter domestic, sexual and gender-based violence should be co-ordinated by a Cabinet Minister with direct responsibility for immediate implementation of the national strategy.  AkiDwA supports this recommendation and additionally highlights the importance of including all forms of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, DSGBV, including female genital mutilation, FGM, early and forced marriages and trafficking in the national strategy to reflect diversity and lived experiences of women living in Ireland today.<\/p> <p>  According to AkiDwA's research and reports, there are 5,975 women who have been subjected to FGM living in Ireland.<\/p><p>Some 6,000 girls under 15 years old who are born or are living in Ireland but who originate from FGM-affected countries are at risk of female genital mutilation.  AkiDwA and those who have been following the news know that Ireland witnessed the first FGM prosecution in January 2020.  This case reaffirms the need to address this issue fully to ensure children from affected communities are fully protected.  I will return to this issue later.<br\/><br\/>While the issue of early and forced marriage is under-researched in Ireland, it has been happening.  According to a report by <i>thejournal.ie<\/i>in October 2016, over 400 minors were married in Ireland between 2004 and 2015.  The report pointed out that the Garda National Immigration Bureau was investigating several cases of forced marriage involving migrant children as young as 12 years old where the girls were typically trafficked into the country and coerced into marrying older men.  In 2019, the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>reported a case of a father who supported his 16-year-old daughter's marriage to a 29-year-old man against her wishes.<br\/><br\/>Trafficking of women for sexual exploitation and prostitution remains a major issue globally and in Ireland.  According to a Ruhama report on its provision of support in 2018, out of the 251 women supported by the organisation, 201 were migrant women.  We recommend that the national strategy include all forms of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, including FGM, early and forced marriages and trafficking, to reflect diversity and the lived experiences of women living in Ireland today.  FGM as a form of gender-based violence should be included in all the goals of the national strategy on DSGBV and should be highlighted in awareness-raising, training and education.  The Ministry or agency working towards the implementation of the national strategy with the Minister should have advisory members with representation from diverse backgrounds.<br\/><br\/>With regard to recommendation 38, time and again we hear from migrant women, particularly women applying for international protection, that they hesitate to report domestic violence out of fear that involving the authorities would make them be seen as troublemakers and that it would negatively affect their application for international protection or citizenship.  It is therefore imperative that a positive initiative is taken to educate migrant and refugee women on their rights in targeted information campaigns on recognising the signs of domestic violence and assurances that protection from domestic violence is available to all and will not affect immigration status.  Article 13 of the Istanbul Convention provides that states shall promote or conduct, on a regular basis and at all levels, awareness-raising campaigns or programmes, including in co-operation with national human rights institutions and equality bodies, civil society and non-governmental organisations, especially women&rsquo;s organisations where appropriate, to increase awareness and understanding among the public of the different manifestations of all forms of violence covered by the scope of the convention.  Under Article 19, states are to take necessary legislative or other measures to ensure that victims receive adequate and timely information on available support services and legal measures in a language they understand.<br\/><br\/>The impacts and harms caused by domestic violence are many for those involved, including the children.  For example, in the area of female genital mutilation, survivors are left with psychological, physical, social and sexual consequences.  <font color=\"#212100\">Current supports available to victims and survivors of FGM are not sufficient, as there is currently only one clinic targeting this cohort of migrants.  Supports can be considered in the following areas.  Regarding physical supports, the impact of FGM on women range from being unable to do or enjoy intimate activities with their significant others to difficult labour and childbirth, among others.  In terms of psychological supports, one of the adverse impacts of FGM is on women&rsquo;s psychological health.  This group needs culturally appropriate services to help them cope with the trauma caused by the mutilation.  We also need wrap-around supports.  The need for these supports is essential and long overdue.  We would be failing if we say that women suffering from FGM are not victims of other forms of violence such as domestic violence.  Due to the difficulty<\/font><font color=\"#212100\">to engage in intimacy, women who have undergone FGM suffer domestic violence in their homes and many times they have no one to whom they can disclose what they are going through.  I can offer an example of a woman who has gone through that.  However, due to time I will move to recommendation 39, to support justice for victims and survivors.<\/font><br\/><br\/>While other women have a choice of whether to avail of the safety and protections in place, migrant women often find themselves trapped by laws, policies and administrative decisions.  Immigration legislation impacts greatly on the lives and choices of migrant women, increasing their physical vulnerability and distress in situations of domestic violence and severely curtailing their options, particularly when social welfare restrictions apply.  Although the introduction of independent residence permissions was and still remains a welcome feature and a positive development in the work of combating domestic violence among the migrant community, there still remain gaps in the protection of migrant women.  Neither the domestic violence guidelines nor the policy document on non-EEA family reunification has a legislative footing.  Instead, access to independent status is based on ministerial discretion.  A more forward-looking approach is contained in Article 59 of the Istanbul Convention.  That article introduces the possibility of granting migrant women an autonomous residence permit if they are trapped in an abusive relationship because their residency status depends on that of their abusive spouse or partner.<br\/><br\/>There remain administrative barriers that hinder victims to fully exercise their rights and to avail of the current avenues in place, given that the domestic violence guidelines set out that the immigration status granted under the arrangements would be &quot;at the same level as that which was previously held as a dependant&quot;, normally stamp 3 holders.  This would not enable women to become economically self-sufficient and could act as a disincentive to women seeking independent status.  While it is known to service providers that it can be possible to obtain a stamp 4 with permission to work, this information is not stated in the policy.  Second, in cases of non-EEA migrant women, they are required to register or re-register with the Garda National Immigration Bureau.  Following a successful application for the independent status, a fee of &euro;300 has to be settled before one can be issued with a certificate of registration.  This registration fee may prove prohibitive for women in situations where they are highly financially dependent on the perpetrator and not in receipt of any other payment.<br\/><br\/>Ireland should opt-in to the EU directive on family reunification and introduce implementing legislation which provides for autonomous residence permits.  In addition to this, the protection of undocumented women from domestic violence should also be regarded as a priority in immigration reform.  We must place the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, guidelines on victims of domestic violence on a statutory footing, removing ministerial discretion and replacing it with a clear legal framework and a process.  We must clarify the position on stamp 3 permission to work, with clear guidelines for holders and employers.  Where granting independent status to a recognised victim of domestic violence, consider granting full access to the labour market to allow her to work to support herself and her family.<br\/><br\/>I will go to reviewing and reforming the courts system.  AkiDwA welcomes this recommendation because it is badly needed.  Front-line services and other service providers need to take up training, in particular on cultural competence, which AkiDwA has produced, to empower professionals and front-line staff who are working in this area.  AkiDwA agrees with introducing tougher sentences and with providing specialised, confidential healthcare.  AkiDwA emphasises the importance of language support, translation and access to legal support, which have been major barriers.  Most women do not understand the system in Ireland at all.  Ireland only has one clinic specialising in FGM, as I mentioned earlier.  There is a lack of specialised domestic violence refuges and support services for migrant victims of intimate partner violence.  Women&rsquo;s Aid has an interpretation service available for women presenting at its services.  However, in most services, especially in rural communities, there is a lack of resourcing for the general population, which has a knock-on effect on migrant women.  AkiDwA also agrees with recommendation 39(e).<br\/><br\/>I will proceed to recommendation 40.<\/p><p>Although the immigration guideline is a welcome feature that enables victims to apply for independent immigration status &mdash; I mentioned this area &mdash; migrant women may experience additional barriers to accessing support and safety in circumstances of domestic violence, especially where their immigration status is a problem.  I deal with this in my submission where I refer to the habitual residence condition.<\/p><p> The habitual residence condition is a qualifying condition for social welfare payments that was introduced in 2004.  Women who leave their partner because of violence and who do not satisfy the habitual residence condition may find themselves and their children destitute.  Even if they check into a refuge, given that its service is temporary and that those availing of it are not entitled to any payment while there, the chance of them or their children, or all of them, remaining there is quite slim.  In most cases, victims find their way back home to the perpetrator.  We ask that the habitual residency policy be examined, along with its impact on the lives of women.<\/p><p> Recommendation 41 relates to the area in which AkiDwA specialises: female genital mutilation, FGM.  FGM is a form of gender-based violence that affects women and girls in Ireland today.  Almost 6,000 women living in Ireland have undergone FGM, although the actual number may be higher because we did not get statistics from the CSO on some of the relevant countries.  AkiDwA produced the statistics from UNICEF 2016 and World Health Organization guidelines.  We have repeatedly called on the Government to establish an interdepartmental working group to co-ordinate the response to FGM to prevent it from happening to young girls and to provide adequate support to survivors.  In 2020 we saw Ireland's first case concerning this human rights abuse.  This sends a strong message that FGM will not be tolerated in Ireland, but we need to take steps to prevent girls from being cut.  We have outlined key policy steps that the Government should take to prevent such a crime from happening again.  These include the establishment of an intergovernmental working group that includes the relevant Departments, civil society, front-line services and representatives from affected communities; the development of a national action plan on FGM outlining and co-ordinating the response of Government agencies, with funding to support anti-FGM programmes and key targets and indicators to measure progress on elimination; and the establishment of funding for a network of community health ambassadors who would work with affected communities, including youth, religious groups and men, to change attitudes to FGM at a grassroots level.<\/p><p> AkiDwA welcomes recommendation 41 wholeheartedly.  AkiDwA has called for FGM to be recognised as a ground for asylum many times.  It has made attempts that include undertaking research into the gender component of asylum claims made by women in Ireland, particularly in relation to claims of gender-based violence, though without success due to a lack of data.  In 2011 and 2012, AkiDwA held meetings with the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, ORAC, on this matter.  We have been advocating for gender asylum guidelines, which I will now explain.<\/p><p> The threat of FGM provides strong grounds for claiming asylum, yet many women are not granted protection.  According to the 2013 UNHCR report, 29 female applicants in Ireland between the ages of 14 and 64 are likely to be affected by FGM.  This is 44.6% of the total number of female applicants from FGM-practising countries of origin.  The figure is from 2013, so it may now be higher.<\/p><p> The primary responsibility for protecting women and girls from FGM lies with each country.  However, if a woman or girl in genuine fear of being subjected to FGM flees a country where such protection is not provided by the state and arrives in Ireland, it is vital that Ireland fulfils its legal obligations and provides adequate protection.  Gender asylum guidelines allow decision-makers to examine women's asylum claims in a way that contextualises their experience and recognises the influence of gender inequality on perceptions of persecution.<\/p><p> In 2009, the UNHCR established guidelines on how to treat claims for refugee status relating specifically to FGM.  These state that a girl or woman seeking asylum because she has been compelled to undergo, or is likely to be subjected to, FGM can qualify for refugee status under the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.  Women and girls applying for international protection in the State should be interviewed in a gender-sensitive manner to ensure they have an adequate opportunity to identify the types of harm they fear as relevant to the protection process.  The 2013 UNHCR report Beyond Proof: Credibility Assessment in EU Asylum Systems, also known as the CREDO report, notes this.  Hence, gender-sensitive interviewing is essential to ensure the facts of a claim are brought to light and can be appropriately assessed by the decision-maker.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022040700002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Salome Mbugua","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":688,"content":"<p>I realise that Dr. Mbugua has very little left but I ask her to conclude shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022040700002#C00200","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649286000,"counter":689,"content":"<p>We recommend gathering data on asylum cases granted on the grounds of FGM, as is greatly needed in Ireland.

I congratulate the Chair on her recent elevation.  It is amazing what 25 years of hard work does for overnight success.<\/p> <p>  On behalf of the board of MDN, its staff, clients, participants and volunteers, I wish to express our gratitude on being offered the opportunity to contribute to the deliberations on gender equality, specifically domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  As a follow-up to our contributions to the Citizen's Assembly, we see it as both a privilege and necessity for men to be part of this discussion.<\/p> <p>  Having had that sense of privilege coming here today, I must not understate my network's sense of privilege, as a men's development organisation, in being part of this discussion.  To be in this room not only with our colleagues from Safe Ireland and AkiDwA but also with the members is a true privilege and a significant moment for a developmental organisation like ours.<\/p> <p>  I am the chief executive officer of MDN.  My aim today is to set out its stall and outline what it does.  With me is our head of programmes, Mr. Colm Kelly Ryan, who will reflect on the recommendations and what we feel should be done.  Also attending with me is our newest recruit, Mr. Kenny Doyle, our project development officer for research policy and advocacy.  He started on Monday and we trust him here today.<\/p> <p>  I offer apologies on behalf of one of our colleagues, Mr. John Doyle, our director of services, who intended to be here today but could not make it owing to a prior engagement with our facilitators and partner support organisations on our domestic violence intervention programme, MEND.<\/p> <p>  Before we share our reflections, it would be useful to give a brief introduction to MDN, its work and its methodologies.  The network celebrates its 25th anniversary this year.  It was established in 1997 in the south east of Ireland by a group of men who were supporting each other to be the best fathers and partners possible.  This group was developing greater awareness of how the system of patriarchy impacted negatively upon them, their partners and their families.<\/p><p>The men also readily acknowledge their own sense of privilege.  <\/p><p> We have our headquarters in the sunny south east of Waterford, but we also have offices in counties Carlow, Tipperary, Dublin and Wexford.  We have 17 core staff and a further 22 subcontracted staff working on various programmes.  We run four national programmes: MEND, the domestic violence intervention programme; Engage, the national mental health training initiative; our male advice line, a national freephone service for male victims of domestic abuse; and the all-Ireland White Ribbon campaign, which is men ending violence against women.  It is worth noting that in we are the only organisation which has dedicated programme to address victims and survivors of domestic abuse as well as perpetrators.<\/p><p> Over the initial years of the network, we ran a number of projects working with men who were at risk of or experienced marginalisation in the most marginalised communities.  During this time, the network developed its own methodology of engaging men that has influenced the development of all its programmes and practices.  These engagements with men also played a significant role in informing the first men&rsquo;s health policy with a strong emphasis on a social determinants model of men&rsquo;s health.  Ireland was the first country in the world to have such a policy.<\/p><p> As an organisation, we have five core values that when, adhered to, create the conditions for individuals to thrive and grow and for societies to adapt and change for the betterment of all.  These values of equality, being non-judgmental, partnership, professionalism and love underpin all our work and ensure that the principles of tolerance, respect and dignity are the cornerstones of our non-adversarial approach. <\/p><p> We see our work within a transformative framework that aims to create positive environments for reflection and analysis, leading eventually to action, whether this is as a society or as individuals.  Our approach as an organisation is similar to the process happening here today where we are reflecting on the work of the citizens' assembly at the second stage of a process of transformation.  That will eventually lead to a third stage where action will be taken in the form of agreed proposals for legislation or the holding of referendums.<\/p><p> Our work is about transforming masculinities by providing opportunities to engage men and boys on issues such as their health and well-being, gender equality and ending gender-based violence, not only in our national programmes mentioned earlier but also in programmes such as our parent support programme, walk the talk, FarmConnect, MenConnect, men's leadership, counselling services and our summer school, to name just a few.  <\/p><p> Over the past 25 years we have worked hard to develop partnerships and collaborations with the women&rsquo;s movement and acknowledge the leadership shown by women in creating the more equal society we have today.  I hope as a men&rsquo;s development organisation we are viewed as strong allies and supporters of the quest to end inequality and the elimination of violence against women.  Although many strides have been taken to address inequality, there is much to be done.  <\/p><p> The policy and legal frameworks are generally in place.  The next step, we feel, is the transformation of hearts and minds.  The rationale and evidence is now in place to positively engage men and boys in becoming catalysts and agents for change.  This is only one piece of the puzzle, but a significant piece nonetheless, in creating the cultural shifts that engage the silent majority of men and boys in becoming their most authentic selves and standing together with women in the ongoing process of creating a society of equality, respect and non-violence.  I hope this gives the committee a context for our contributions and reflections on the various recommendations today and that our mission statement, Better Lives for Men, Better Lives for All, is seen in the context of what I outlined earlier and that we are here today with an open mind, a tender heart and willingness to engage.   <\/p><p> Before my colleague, Mr. Colm Kelly Ryan, takes over and continues our opening statement on the specific recommendations of domestic sexual and gender-based violence, I also wish to offer the committee, in light of the breadth of our engagement on all aspects of gender equality, our willingness to further engage with committee in the other seven areas of recommendations, especially those on the Constitution, care, leadership, norms and stereotypes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022040700002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Cooke","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649286000,"counter":693,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to appear here today.

I would also like to note that it is an honour to be here today with our friends from AkiDwA and Safe Ireland.  They are wonderful allies for human rights, gender equality and an all-around better society for all.  It is an honour to share this day with all of them.<\/p> <p>  In the remaining time available, I will briefly outline the Men's Development Network position on recommendations 37 to 41, inclusive, of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality report, focused on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  I would like to start by saying that we welcome the recommendations provided by the assembly.  We have a submission on this that I hope has been circulated to all members of the committee.  I encourage members to read it in conjunction with our recent submission to the Department of Justice on the draft national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.<\/p> <p>  In March 2022, Men's Development Network submitted a paper to the Department on the third draft national strategy.  In a sense, these recommendations align with recommendations 37 to 41, inclusive.  We outlined some recommendations I would advise regarding making Ireland a more gender equal society and addressing the issue of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.   These include providing a clear outline of the available resources to implement the national strategy and action plans and ensuring prevention and awareness raising efforts target the public rather than specific sectors of society, in accordance with Articles 13 (1) and (2) of the Istanbul Convention and Article 35B of CEDAW general recommendation 35.  <\/p> <p>  We also wanted to ensure that awareness raising programmes address the root causes of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, in accordance with international law.  As part of that, we wished to ensure that engagements with men and boys are based on international and national best practices in the most appropriate ways from a strength-based, non-judgmental and non-adversarial approach, and that there is a positive call to action for men and boys that instills support to build capacity and safety in the prevention of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  It should be the case that men and boys can be allies for gender equality and ending gender-based violence.  <\/p> <p>  The development and funding of campaigns and similar initiatives such as the White Ribbon Ireland campaign to engage with men and boys as allies for gender equality in ending gender-based violence is vital.  This is a key piece in the Istanbul prevention pillar.  We also recommend the expansion of the proposed content of awareness raising activities and training programmes beyond the aspect of consent, but also to include themes mentioned in Article 41 of the Istanbul Convention, such as gender equality, respect, non-violent conflict resolution, interpersonal relationships, gender-based violence and integrity.  It needs to be quite holistic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022040700002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Kelly Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":694,"content":"<p>Has Mr. Kelly Ryan specific points on the recommendations?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022040700002#D00300","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649286000,"counter":695,"content":"<p>We can turn specifically to the recommendations of the citizens' assembly, and from there follow up with some questions on the submissions.  On recommendation 37 under the third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, there is a commitment from Government to create a new statutory body that will be co-ordinated by the Minister for Justice, which will have direct responsibility for implementation of the strategy.  This aligns quite well with what is proposed by the citizens' assembly in recommendation 37 in section 1 of the draft national strategy.  It was supplemented by our submission on section 2 to the Department.<\/p> <p>  Regarding recommendation 38, we believe that the recommendation needs to be extended beyond current expression.  The training should be based on the prevention of the Istanbul Convention.  It should also include the role of men and boys in engaging them in the most appropriate ways as allies for gender equality and ending gender-based violence.  At this stage in Ireland, that has yet to take place.  It would be very innovative in terms of promoting a gender equal society.  <\/p> <p>  In regard to recommendation 39 on supporting victims and survivors, Men's Development Ireland acknowledges and welcomes sub-recommendations A to E, as recommended by the citizens' assembly.  We note the overlaps with the objections of the third national strategy.  I refer to advancing justice for the victims and survivors of domestic, gender-based and sexual violence not only in their engagement with the institutions of justice but also ensuring long-term sustainable justice for victims and survivors.<\/p><p>We would also recommend the inclusion of an option for the development of restorative justice or practice processes, where appropriate.<\/p><p> Furthermore, MDN supports recommendation 40 as presented.  We would encourage that such a provision be as inclusive as possible to all genders and to their children, with due regard to the fact that the majority of victims and survivors of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence are women.  It is important to note that the Istanbul Convention recommends one shelter space to every 10,000 people in Ireland, and that Ireland currently does not have that number.  There has been much work done, but much is still to be done.<\/p><p> I take guidance on recommendation 41 from our friends from AkiDwA.  I welcome what they have stated here this morning.  I would like to note that various UNHCR publications, such as the Too Much Pain document from 2014, indicate that FGM is a ground for seeking asylum.  This is supported by a wide range of jurisprudence in case law from common law countries and countries in Europe, such as France, as cited in our submission.  I note that in the wording of the recommendation, there is some concern in relation to FGM as a ground for seeking asylum.  We know that asylum is a fundamental human right.  It is a fundamental human right to seek asylum.  I urge that we would state here that FGM is actually a ground for refugee status, rather than a ground for seeking asylum.  This is because it is fundamental human right.<\/p><p> I thank the committee and I look forward to questions from members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022040700002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Kelly Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":697,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kelly Ryan.

I am joined virtually by my good colleague, Ms Lisa Marmion, who is our national services development manager.  We thank the committee for the invitation to speak today on the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  We give our very great thanks, even more importantly, to our fellow citizens for their recognition that domestic, sexual and gender-based violence creates and maintains conditions of gender inequality in Ireland.  It must, therefore, be central to all considerations of the equality and freedom of all.<\/p> <p>  We frame our presentation today not only in the context of meeting the requirements of the Istanbul Convention, but also in the context of the publication of the report of the Citizens' Assembly, the national audit of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence infrastructures, the Tusla audit of domestic violence accommodation, the current draft of the third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and, crucially, the Taoiseach&rsquo;s very welcome decision to create a new statutory agency for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.<\/p> <p>  The overriding frame for Safe Ireland, however, retains the effects and the insights of Covid-19 on our society in relation to domestic violence, the strong reassertion of the importance and capacity of local communities and the effectiveness of co-ordinated Government and civil society engagement.  The importance of locally accessible domestic violence services cannot be overstated.  Equally, the redrawing of the relations between work and home, the private and the public and the use of IT, all of which are embodied here today, are directly pertinent to responding to domestic violence in a progressive, 21st century manner.<\/p> <p>  I do not need to rehearse here the public reaction to the murders of Urantsetseg Tserendorj and Ashling Murphy.  In particular, Ashling&rsquo;s death removed every possible victim-blaming variable that we usually use to distract ourselves from the scale of violence against women in our society.  We remember them here and we work on behalf of all women who are deprived of their lives and their freedom.  As such, we are done with endlessly describing this problem.  We welcome this moment in our history when we can actually accept that domestic, sexual and gender-based violence is a large-scale social problem.  We can name it accurately and we can act to address it.  We have encountered focused, persistent and positive engagement from all sectors over the last two years.  The question now is about how we proceed.  It is a welcome starting place for us.<\/p> <p>  On the point of naming, language and the conceptualisation of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, Safe Ireland&rsquo;s core position, which is bolstered by decades of robust feminist and queer scholarship, is that this form of violence is a large-scale social problem.  It may not be reduced to poor personal choice.  We concur with Mr. Kelly Ryan's observations on the need to broaden that issue.  It is a cornerstone social problem.  We believe that if it is addressed centrally and systematically, many ancillary and problematic personal, social, political and administrative culs-de-sac in areas like mental health, addictions, homelessness, persistent criminality, child protection, education and employment and alienation of all kinds can be worked through.  All of these factors bring significant evidenced costs to our State, our communities and our personal lives.  All of them would be seriously repositioned if domestic, sexual and gender-based violence was placed centrally in our social policy.  I might add that the Think-tank for Action on Social Change, TASC, and Safe Ireland are working on a project to that end.<\/p> <p>  Our colleagues in Women&rsquo;s Aid, the Rape Crisis Network of Ireland and Dublin Rape Crisis Centre have presented substantively on recommendations 37 to 41, inclusive, of the Citizens' Assembly, which relate to awareness, justice and FGM.  We will not input heavily into these areas today.  We are happy to engage on these matters, but we will not repeat the previous inputs.  We defer significantly to our colleague in AkiDwA on the matter of FGM, as already addressed this morning.<\/p> <p>  I will make a brief input on social protection and domestic, sexual and gender-based violence supports.  Our submission covers this aspect of the matter under the heading of &ldquo;pathways to freedom and the importance of social protection&rdquo;.  A woman's journey out of coercion and, in particular, financial control, often requires her to be supported by the State to regain her independence and her agency.  Over the last two years, Safe Ireland has worked positively with the Department of Social Protection to develop such dedicated pathways.  We commend the work of Deputies and Senators on this, particularly their cross-party support in 2020 for the domestic violence rent supplement.  This important pilot, which has now been mainstreamed, demonstrates some of the important gaps which continuously exist for women who are exiting abuse.  As a follow-on, we are now calling for a similar protocol for the exceptional needs payment to assist women who have other practical emergency outlays and are experiencing domestic violence.<\/p> <p>  In 2020 and 2021, Safe Ireland administered a charitable Covid-19 emergency fund through our member services to support women on their exit from abusive homes to purchase essential items, including nappies, bread and milk, to pay bills and to travel to and from school and work.  The outlays funded here are fully documented and they provide a solid base of evidence for mainstream support through our Government for the exceptional needs payment.  We will be pushing for this campaign in 2022.<\/p> <p>  We are aware of a structural barrier that confronts qualified adults who are seeking to access dental, optical and audiology services through the treatment benefit scheme.  Practitioners are required to solicit the consent of the perpetrator in order for an injured woman to be treated.  We will be seeking support from the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, and the data protection commissioner to remedy this anomaly.<\/p> <p>  Recommendations 37 and 40 address the appropriate political and administrative structures which plan, design, provide and resource domestic violence preventions and interventions in Ireland, including the equitable provision of refuge across the country.  It is very important for us in this forum that we decided to keep services and structures together in our considerations.  This is because they are, in our opinion, completely interdependent.  On recommendation 37, which involves domestic, sexual and gender-based violence structures, we welcome the significant progress that has been made with the integration of services and policy into a single Ministry with oversight within the Department of the Taoiseach.  This is an important element for us.  The proposed establishment of a new agency is also very welcome.  It provides great opportunity for cutting-edge responses.  However, Safe Ireland strongly cautions that we ensure this new structure does not repeat the difficulties of previous iterations.<\/p><p>There is an absolute necessity for a dedicated domestic, sexual and gender-based violence infrastructure in Ireland.  We cannot stress this enough.  Mixed models or the shoehorning of domestic violence into existing structures will, in our opinion, simply repeat the problems all these changes seek to avoid.<\/p><p> The importance of robust and fully integrated national, regional and local community co-ordinated responses to domestic violence cannot be overstated.  Regional and community level implementation of the third national strategy arising from this new agency should be driven, managed, and co-designed by the existing cross-disciplinary expertise in the front-line services sector, which already exists, alongside the significant DSGBV specialisms that exist in allied public service professions including policing, healthcare, social services and academia.<\/p><p> The task of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly was to examine gender equality through a rights-based lens.  It follows, therefore, that women and all victims must be visible at the forefront of structural response.  In this matter, we ask for an open and public process with appropriate terms of reference to guide all these processes.  We note with concern that the current proposal in the draft of the third national strategy for regional co-ordination does not support such a model.  The organisation chart on page 18 of the draft proposes to charge the existing children and young people&rsquo;s services committees, CYPSC, with responsibility for regional implementation of domestic violence for women and girls.  We strongly suggest this is inappropriate.  It is not a structure that Safe Ireland can support.  Such positioning simultaneously reinforces sexist stereotypes, repeats previous difficulties in the structural positioning of domestic violence and erases and infantilises the status of women and the violence they experience.  We deserve structures in our own right.  It is not a fit structure for the significant challenges ahead.  We call again for the development of a coherent national services development plan.<\/p><p> I will briefly move on to services.  Again, keeping the provision of services and the structures within which they operate in view, we welcome the development of 21st century refuge, quality front-line services and competent communities across the country.  Here, again, we stress that crisis accommodation through refuge is not of itself a solution to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence generally, nor is it even, indeed, to the full accommodation and support needs of women in their journey to freedom.  Whilst refuge can provide protective respite for a number of weeks, the journey to safety for a woman can take up to two years.  We must ensure the ongoing availability of refuge spaces for women in crisis but they must be fully supported pathways to transitional and permanent housing accommodation.  These must be in place.<\/p><p> As we know, national housing policy does not even recognise women in domestic violence circumstances as homeless.  This is an outrage.  Therefore, they fall substantially outside the net of current interventions and priorities.  Other jurisdictions, and my colleague, Ms Marmion, will speak to this in detail if required by the committee, have successfully addressed these issues in the round.  The whole housing approach, for example, offers such a model, which addresses the housing and safety needs of victims and survivors in the UK.  This framework consolidates all the main housing tenure types, housing options and support initiatives that are needed to help women fleeing domestic abuse to either maintain or access safe and stable housing.  The framework could be adapted and for the most part provides a tailored plug-in to existing housing policy to address the current deficit.  On the matter of women staying at home and needing safe at-home shelter, we also support this process.  We note that while the first option is that the perpetrator be removed from her home, however, there are also instances where due to the cultural pressure of family, friends or, indeed, the community as a whole, a woman must flee her home.  We will, therefore, always need these mobile flexible accommodation responses.<\/p><p> With regard to the development of refuge across the country which, of course, pertains to the publication of the Tusla accommodation review and the identified areas in our country that have no refuge provision and do not meet the requirements of the Istanbul Convention, again, we urge careful planning to maximise the opportunity to create a 21st century response to domestic violence at local level.  This is a moment in history that we do not wish to squander.<\/p><p> By way of proposing possible future-proofed models for refuge, in 2020, Safe Ireland drew up what we called then the Sovereignty Project, noting that freedom is the absolute twin of safety.  The core concept here is that future refuge would be built on three principles, the first of which is safe spaces.  All refuge spaces would be accessible and trauma-informed, with contemporary design principles that are fully integrated with wraparound services and, vitally, a community interface.  The second is that best practice would specify good quality standards for front-line services and practitioners based on local expertise and-or international best practice.  Third, an additional prong to this development, which we suggest in the Sovereignty Project, is domestic violence-centred community development and engagement.  This novel element would specify a model to lead the development of competent, safe communities that can prevent and respond to violence against women and girls, giving them confidence and clarity in how to handle this problem at a personal, familial, local and community level.  The project is under way and we will launch it in October 2022.  We will deliver at that time a safe spaces toolkit including these three elements for communities and services, which we offer as a guide and support for refuge development locally, either as a new-build or with the help of retrofit.  We must thank our donors, the Community Foundation for Ireland, for funding this important piece of work.  Its patience while we awaited the accommodation review's publication and its confidence in Safe Ireland's expertise is really appreciated.  Indeed, Tusla also recently supported our work here, which is also welcome.<\/p><p> Safe Ireland&rsquo;s recommendations to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Gender Equality on its considerations of the report of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on Gender Equality are quite simple: create a dedicated domestic, sexual and gender-based violence infrastructure at every level; develop existing expertise and domestic, sexual and gender-based violence structures; develop a coherent accommodation response in order to support a functioning refuge capacity using, for example, a whole housing approach; and create a well-planned and well-designed model of community domestic violence refuge and support services across the country, which can transform our communities' responses and enable and empower them to deal with this large-scale social problem.  We welcome the committee's questions.  If we are unable to respond we will, of course, provide members with what they wish.

It is vitally important in our work to ensure that the recommendations of the Citizen's Assembly actually deliver that real change that is so desperately needed.<\/p> <p>  I will start with AkiDwA.  I want to focus on female genital mutilation, FGM, for a moment.  The picture Dr. Mbugua painted for victims and survivors of FGM is very bleak in our cities.  In our more rural communities and outside those major urban areas, however, the challenges people face in terms of accessing support must be much more profound, particularly around that psychological and wraparound support of which Dr. Mbugua spoke.  In Dr. Mbugua's opinion, what does this look like?<\/p><p>What does the model that meets the need look like?  She is correct to speak of those pathways to protections and supports in relation to our immigration system.  I fail to see the logic in telling somebody they can have an independent stamp 3 visa while at the same time refusing them access to employment in order to support themselves and build a life outside of the abusive relationship they are in.  This is something we see repeated across various Departments.  Steps are taken but they are not completed.  That lack of completion means that women are forced to return to an abusive environment because they cannot develop their own independent life outside of it.<\/p><p> I have a very specific question.  Tusla has highlighted the urgent and established need for 60 additional safe units.  The witnesses spoke the need for culturally appropriate supports.  What does that look like to them?  What are they looking for with these additional units, which need to be delivered rather quickly? <\/p><p> What engagement has AkiDwa had with the Department of Justice on the development of national action plan on female genital mutilation?

That is a very good question.  First and foremost is the national action plan, which AkiDwa is agitating for and which we want to be Government-led.  The national action plan will ensure FGM services in Ireland are streamlined.  Streamlining means a woman can walk into any hospital in Ireland.  Let us say this woman is living in Clonakilty in Cork.  She can go to Cork University Hospital and be triaged, taken to the relevant department and seen by a doctor.  She does not have to go to Dublin for this or that.  If that could be streamlined, that would be very good.  It would also reduce the stigma, which we know is an issue.  When women have to go to Dublin, it is very stigmatising.  Most of these women are very poor.  They do not have a lot of resources at their disposal, especially those who are living in direct provision centres.  They have children to look after.  Again I will use the example of someone living in Clonakilty.  Those barriers could be halved.  There is also the cost of childcare.  This woman could just go into a hospital and be seen and have everything tackled there without stigma.  This will require training for our doctors to take care of FGM-related needs, both physical and psychological, as well as cultural appropriateness.  That will also come as part of the wraparound nature of the supports.  As Dr. Mbugua said, AkiDwa is leading in training professionals in the sector on healthcare, cultural appropriateness and cultural competence.  The national action plan will streamline services for women, both psychological and physical, because women who have gone through FGM face very serious and severe mental health consequences.  That can only be tackled through that streamlining of services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022040700002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Caroline Munyi"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649286000,"counter":705,"content":"<p>I would add to some of that, in particular on the development of the national action plan.

In my previous role working with Irish Aid, I was very fortunate to meet a wonderful lady, Ifrah Ahmed, who has done a lot of great work in this area.  We were lucky to be able to assist her in developing some really helpful programmes in her home country of Somalia.  Until I met her and had some lengthy conversations with her, I was not aware of the significant risk posed to young women and girls here in Ireland.  I thank AkiDwa for the work it is doing in highlighting that.  We have had legislation in place for almost ten years now.  It is a decade on.  It is most unfortunate that we do not have the national action plan in place to match that.

On the first issue, Dr. Munyi outlined very eloquently the pathway for somebody living somewhere like Clonakilty or Galway, where I come from, if they are a victim of FGM.  Both she and Dr. Mbugua also spoke about things being culturally appropriate.  How important is it right now to have a programme of education within our school system, at primary level and perhaps more important, at post-primary level, that could somehow effect a cultural change so the practice of FGM would no longer be tolerated anywhere within Irish society?  The green schools programme from An Taisce, which is very powerful, has successfully effected a major cultural shift within Irish young people around sustainability and environmental protection.

As members can imagine, FGM is a very hidden problem because of the part of the anatomy that it affects.  We are in the process of producing the handbook.  We hope to engage with teachers or those high up in the educational sector with a view to undertaking a survey and getting the views of teachers on the issue and how they want to engage.  With the help of teachers and through consultation with them, we hope that from there we will make some progress so that we can make inroads into the educational sector and see how far we can get.

We think that even from the early learning years, for example, when students are in cr&egrave;che, there should be some way of introducing these kind of situations.  There was a tragic case involving a 16-year-old girl who kept saying that she was engaged to her fianc&eacute;.  She told her friends in school, but they could not understand how a 16-year-old girl would have a fianc&eacute;.  Two years later, she left and was married somewhere in Dubai.  Her friends later came to understand that she had been forced into an arranged marriage.  She was living in Cork.  The children did not know.  It is important that children understand these issues so that they can talk to the teachers.  In the case to which I referred, it was a kind of a secret that the girls could not tell.  We have also tried to approach schools to see if there is a way we can include FGM as part of sex education.  It has to be done in a very sensitive way, because we do not want to traumatise the students.  FGM is very traumatising.  We have tried to engage on this issue at the educational level.  To be honest, it is a very foreign issue and we welcome the fact that Ireland is open to even discuss it.  Engaging with schools has been very challenging.

Apologies, but I was coming from another meeting that ran on.  I ask Dr. Mbugua to expand on her comments on the challenges in getting into schools and the education system.  I ask her to give us some idea of what the actual challenges are.  Are obstacles being put in the organisation's way?  If so, where are they?  How can those obstacles be overcome in a practical sense?  Perhaps we can come from the top down if necessary to get into and infiltrate our school systems.<\/p> <p>  I am very interested in the idea of refuges.  I come from a constituency, which as Ms McDermott is aware, that is very bleak in terms of the supports, practical supports and wraparound services that are provided for women and men.  Mr. Ryan referred to the Istanbul Convention and the ideas contained within it.  He stated that the convention recommends one shelter space for every 10,000 people in Ireland.  How many refuges do we have for men around the country?  Where are the gaps?<\/p> <p>  I have had a lot of dealings with Ms McDermott over the last few months.  In her opening statement, she referred to \"Mixed models or the 'shoe-horning' of DSGBV into existing structures\" as something that Safe Ireland does not want to see repeated.  I ask Ms McDermott to be more explicit on the types of models that she was referring to there.  I know what Safe Ireland wants.  It wants a holistic approach to be taken.  It wants to see wraparound services and appropriate accommodation provided.  I ask Ms McDermott to outline explicitly what Safe Ireland does not want to see, so that we do not make mistakes when we are at the infancy stage of trying to create the right system.  I do not want to see those mistakes happen in Cavan-Monaghan anyway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022040700002#H00800","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649286000,"counter":721,"content":"<p>We have had a few discussions on services in Monaghan and Cavan.  The first thing that Safe Ireland is saying is that this is a historical opportunity.  We do not want to squander resources.  Second, it is a very simple, old-school and deeply-imbedded insight within domestic violence work generally that refuge is not the answer to domestic violence.  That is the simple starting point.  However, making that point is like saying that field hospitals are not needed in a war.  We need refuges and we will probably always need them.  Noeline Blackwell observed last week that if there are better and stronger responses to domestic and sexual violence in the country, we will see a rise and then a fall in numbers.<\/p> <p> To answer the Deputy's question on mixed models, what we want to see and what we do not want to see, from our perspective, we want to see a skills-led community response.  We want to see refuges and spaces as places that not only provide refuge and high-end skills that are there all around in our own network of 38 organisations.  We have talked about, and Dr. Munyi mentioned, the capacity for front-line triage, including risk and safety assessment.  The disciplines that almost automatically have to kick in when a woman presents at a refuge include: legal supports; accompaniment; advice; housing and accommodation outside the immediate needs of refuge; social welfare; education, training and employment; and crucially, the full therapeutic supports that are needed.  We also welcome the news that for the first time, one of our members in County Donegal that solely provides therapeutically based services has received funding.  That is fantastic.<\/p> <p>  In our presentation, we were really trying to say that the structures that we are going to put in place will seriously impact how the services are rolled out and provided across the country.  As the Deputy is aware, previously, responsibility for domestic violence has been based in various locations within Government.  It was previously the responsibility of the HSE.  There have been various iterations.  This is not an attack; it is just a description.  As members are aware, responsibility has been moved from within the Child and Family Agency.  I cannot stress enough the fact that the Child and Family Agency had responsibility for the area, without a mention of the word \"woman\".  The role of the woman has been almost reinscribed in a knee-jerk fashion as one of carer, as subservient to the needs of those who are dependent around her.  Her own rights, needs and violations, in themselves, do not have priority.  Safe Ireland will never stand on that ground.  We see this as an opportunity to move away from that inadvertent reinscription of the problem.  I must say that we have really good relationships with Tusla, by the way.  This is not an attack on anyone; it is just about how best to create the right system in this country.  Keeping domestic violence under the remit of children and young people, as is proposed in the draft strategy, will just simply serve to reinscribe the very thing we have been working to stop.  We wanted and asked for policy and services together.<\/p><p>We want an articulated structure from the top down, with oversight by the Taoiseach's office, a Cabinet-level responsibility and an interdepartmental and a whole-of-government response.  I know that everybody in this House has been listening to the term \"whole-of-government\" for probably about 20 years, as everybody needs such a response to everything, but we need a whole-of-government response to be put in place for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  When it comes down to the regional structures, importantly and crucially, it will fall or stand on this point.  There are several models such as the Garda regional divisions, community healthcare organisation, CHO, divisions, and those of the courts.  There are many models of regionalisation and we are not proposing any one in particular but they need consideration.  From there, one works directly with the already-in-place, however fragile, unsupported and 19th century, Dickensian and badly resourced services, but there are, nonetheless, enormous levels of expertise all around the country.  That expertise must not be lost and dedicated DSGBV structures at local level must be created to access the resources that are already there.  Does that answer Deputy Niamh Smyth&rsquo;s question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022040700002#H00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary McDermott","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":723,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022040700002#J00200","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":724,"content":"<p>I have a minute where I will return to Mr. Cooke and Mr. Kelly Ryan on Deputy Smyth&rsquo;s question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022040700002#J00300","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649286000,"counter":725,"content":"<p>I want to come in behind what Ms McDermott is saying on the regional provision and structures.  On the development of those regional structures, a previous regional plan used to be in place and it does not exist any more.  It is a very strong mechanism to roll out, certainly around the perpetrator programmes that have been happening in Ireland.  We are part of the Choices programme called MEND.  Along with our colleagues in MOVE Ireland, Men Overcoming Violence, and in the north east domestic violence intervention programme, we roll out the national Choices programme, which is a 32-week programme of engaging men around this particular issue of their own behaviour and of changed behaviour.  We come to this and our strength is based on a positive perspective in that regard.  A review is happening in respect of the roll-out of that particular programme.  In some ways, many of these reviews are interwoven with the national strategy, with other particular programmes and with the accommodation review.  This review is still ongoing in respect of effectiveness, delivery, project management and the delivery of that particular programme.  This would clearly suggest that regional structures are probably the most appropriate way in which to start to look around the issue of delivery and engagement in order to address the issue of domestic violence.<\/p> <p>  It would also be remiss of me today as a representative of a men&rsquo;s development organisation, although it is not because of that that I say this, not to state there is also a recognition that we are talking about domestic violence being an inclusive issue that addresses a whole range of people, genders and sexes, which we need to acknowledge.  We certainly feel the need for a gender-sensitive approach in how we go about this work.  Ms McDermott and I have worked on various issues and have been in discussions over many years, in the brief moments when we get to take our heads out of the sand to do so, when we talk about the most appropriate ways and the language that we need to use when we talk and address the issues of domestic violence, regardless of the gender or sex of the person who is the victim.  <\/p> <p>  As I said earlier we work very much with both perpetrators and victims, which is somewhat unusual in that sense but whatever way we come to this work, this is done from a collaborative and partnership perspective, working in a non-adversarial way, on the basis and with the optimism that people can change, and that we can engage with their behaviours and change them in that regard.  <\/p> <p>  The other piece I will speak quickly on is the question of accommodation.  As it stands at the moment in Ireland, there is not any provision of refuge for men.  In saying that, there is capacity in which we can and have used the various different systems and hotel rooms in gaining access to crisis accommodation for men at various different times.  The Men&rsquo;s Development Network will be doing a review of its own work with the Male Advice Line, which we run.  This is a national freefone service.  We have identified from what we see happening and in how men present themselves that refuge is not necessarily the cornerstone, and as Ms McDermott was saying, is not the endgame in addressing the issue of domestic violence.  It is not necessarily what is required at this point in time.  <\/p> <p>  We have made a proposal to Tusla and are rolling out a pilot programme at present, which is a wrap-around remote service being offered to men.  This is so that when they engage with our services, we can then refer them to our client support worker.  We are finding that men are not looking to get out because the original question that is usually asked when they contact our services is whether they being abused as they are unsure what the situation is.  When we talk to them then it is more about developing a plan and what is the most coherent one for them as to whether they are going to exit the relationship or the home.  This is done in a way, however, that does not undermine them culturally, socially or even economically.  That is the sort of network there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022040700002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Cooke"},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":726,"content":"<p>I will move on now to Deputy Carroll MacNeill, who is next.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022040700002#J00500","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":727,"content":"<p>I thank all of our guests for coming in today.

What she has said is very important in not reinforcing sexist stereotypes.  Her languages was &quot;erases and infantilises the status of women and the violence they experience&quot;.  It brings to mind the excellent document Safe Ireland produced in March 2021, No Going Back, which I thought was a moment of reflection, both intellectually and philosophically about women and their status, and is deeply relevant to the work of this committee.  In that document, in particular, it states on root causes that:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIt is our continued understanding that DSGBV is a root cause, not an effect or side-issue, of many households and family&rsquo;s sufferings, regardless of what formation that home takes.

We really believe we are at a historic moment.  Parties, businesses and individuals have approached us.  Everybody wants to do something about this.  You can see it.  Everybody knows it exists.  No Going Back was written under the pressure of Covid.  We said we have to reframe this.  The Deputy will see from my notes on my submission that there are secondary notes under the other recommendations I did not speak to because last week, my colleagues put in substantive issues there.  What I wanted to note was that the issue of language and conceptualisation is crucial.  First, we have a very simple statement.  Nobody should have to live in an oppressive home.  That goes straight to all the tropes and fatalism upon which we rely all the time - you made your bed now lie in it.  Second, we believe we need new language to describe this.  In our opinion, the axis of DSGBV runs along sex, gender and sexualities.  There is a hierarchy under all of those categories and you can track the lines of power and control.  We believe we must extend and increase our capacity to speak about this by extending our vocabulary and conceptualisations.  Mr. Cooke and I have had quite a few head-banging sessions on this issue.  We say that we need to make room for more people and younger people whose identities and concerns are different to our own and we need to be able to conceptualise DSGBV across the standard social exclusion and poverty categories of our national social policy, a project we are working on with TASC, and to address it across the issues that arise under what we call diversity and inclusion.  If you put sex, gender and sexuality as the core axis along which this violence runs, I believe you will develop a really robust and sophisticated way of speaking about this and will, therefore, be able to develop a social policy that will meet that demand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022040700002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary McDermott"},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":734,"content":"<p>One of the things we keep talking about is a new relationships and sex education programme that is very different to the one in schools.

That is fine except nobody has yet seen it.  What really needs to happen is at primary level.  I was in Kilkenny the week before last talking to teachers and garda&iacute;.

What needs to be in the programme from primary education?  How do we talk about gender, consent, personhood and boundaries in an age-appropriate way?  How do we make parents who might feel that this is very different comfortable?  What is the right approach for the Department to take?  Clearly, it is part of what we are talking about in terms of the recommendations of the citizens' assembly, but what is the right way to do that to make sure we are hitting it correctly from a gender and diversity perspective and really get this right first time?

I fully concur with Ms McDermott's comment that Covid did not bring about domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, but it certainly increased the visibility of such violence.  One positive thing that emerged from Covid was an initiative within the Department of Justice.  When the pandemic began, the concepts of staying at home and staying safe were anathema for people who found themselves in certain circumstances.  As a result, the Department brought together a consortium of organisations that provide safety and supports to victims of domestic violence as part of a campaign to ensure people knew that support was still available and in place.  A really significant campaign, <i>stillhere.ie<\/i>, came out of that.  It was really important that the Department listened to the providers on the ground and took their advice.  The initial conversation was not about the <i>stillhere.ie<\/i>campaign, but something else.  When the campaign came about, it let people know that help was still available and that it was okay for them to travel outside the 5 km limit to seek support.  That is a positive legacy.  Certainly the Department is looking at other ways to address these issues, including coercive control.  We saw the recent media campaigns on coercive control.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022040700002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Cooke"},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":745,"content":"<p>I thank all of the witnesses for their incredible work in this area.

In the Constitution, we recognise that the family home is a private space for family life.  At the core of how we will do this are awareness-raising campaigns, messaging and the use of media and social media.  I will refer once more to Article 30(b) of general recommendation No. 35 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, CEDAW, which reads:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThese programmes should target: (a) women and men at all levels of society; (b) education, health, social services and law enforcement personnel and other professionals and agencies, including at the local level [the community level, which is close to the family home, and this is an important point to remember], involved in prevention and protection responses; (c) traditional and religious leaders; and (d) perpetrators of any form of gender-based violence, so as to prevent recidivism. <\/blockquote> <p>I am sure this matter will be raised later, but what I am talking about is that the scope of the messaging and how we have this conversation need to be human rights based, holistic and tackle the structural inequalities in our society while also engaging with men and boys through a strengths-based approach, not through a deficit-based approach that says men are broken and may be the perpetrators.

One of the issues that was strongly raised was that there appeared to be an imbalance being created between funding and the governance and compliance requirements on the service.  What is being asked of services is increasing but funding is not increasing to match it.  The impact of inflation on the delivery of these services is becoming more profound.

The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has responsibility over this area, but the provision of refuge capacity lies with Tusla.  Is that relationship something that Ms McDermott would like to see changed?  Is there a more streamlined and efficient way of providing funding so that it results in better delivery?<\/p> <p>  Other commentators have mentioned regionalisation, joint policing committees, JPCs, and the capacity to speak.  At what other forums do this issue and all issues that relate to gender-based violence need to be discussed?  An issue that I have been examining is that of JPCs.

Even when we describe that, given the work that we do, we are conscious that migrant women are not a homogeneous group.  They come from different ethnic backgrounds but also immigration status.  It has affected the way they integrate into society and the way they receive support and any other kind of services, including coming out of isolation to look for those services.  We spoke so much about if a woman comes as a dependant of her spouse, she comes under that spouse's dependency and she has to be with him so that she can get her residency or, if they are claiming for international protection if they come as a couple, refugee status.  One will find quite often that women will not report on what is happening because if they leave that abusive pattern, they will not have access to social welfare because of the habitual residency.  Sometimes they are accepted by the refuges, but refuges also have the right not to accept them because of the public funds and the way it works.  It is difficult for them.<\/p> <p>  AkiDwA and some other organisations came together and formed a coalition in 2011 and 2012 and that is how the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, guidelines, that help women who are experiencing violence to seek independent status, were sought.  We are saying that while this is there, and it is a good and welcome development, it is still within the discretion of the Minister.  It should be out there and automatic that if a woman who is a dependant of a spouse, where they have type 3 stamp duty because stamp 3 spouses are not allowed to work, she could be able to access social welfare easily and that she can get out of that violent relationship.<\/p> <p>  Under stamp 3, they were not allowed to work but we know things are changing.  We even have some people in international protection now working.  These things need to be looked into.<\/p> <p>  Also, the issue of the family reunification is important.  It is maybe not even a partner joining but the family member who can help such a woman to be able to support the family and to support her when she is going through that.  In Ireland, we still have significant issues and challenges on family reunification which need to be looked into.<\/p> <p>  I hope I have addressed that.

The starting point here - we put it in our No Going Back document - is we are dealing currently with a 19th century infrastructure trying to respond to 21st century problems.  There is no coherent national process around this.  I need not say that the services - the front-line providers - are working day and night to try and provide services under very stressed circumstances but what is really of burden to them is that every year there are annual service level agreements, SLA, and there is no long-term planning.  Multi-annual funding is it.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the backroom work that we need to do for governance, compliancy and recording.  I note that last week there was an extended discussion around issues of therapeutic notes and disclosure, recording and data protection.  All of these issues are a burden and our front-line services - every one of those independent organisations - need full resourcing to do that back work.  Everyone in this chamber will fully appreciate that over the past two years under Covid people responded from the heart with great generosity.  They want to see the front-line provision but it is difficult to get well-grounded fully sustained resourcing for the backroom work for compliance, governance, finance, data protection, and IT infrastructure and managing in order that we can communicate with each other in a systematic and meaningful way and, therefore, crucially, that we can provide a coherent national fully-functioning 21st century infrastructure for domestic violence in the country.<\/p> <p>  With regard to regional structures, in response to Deputy Clarke I would say that there are various options.  We have worked positively with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There are various ways in which we interact but, again, I would say this is part of the national strategy's work.  We should not in a rush shoehorn domestic violence into any of the previous existing structures that are inappropriate.  We should take time, sit down, draw up the terms of reference, make the process consultative and co-design, which, as we know, is welcomed at present.

The first is that at present it is through the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and one has to be a housing association to provide refuge.  There is considerable compliance attached to that in its own right, let alone the compliance of service delivery.  There is significant back-up support required in terms of fulfilling all one's obligations as a charity or as a company limited by guarantee.  There is not significant support.

On the other hand, one of the most dispiriting things I heard within a short time of this issue being raised was that you already had young men asking young women to sign a consent on the phone to say that they had agreed to sex.

I was having a very interesting conversation with a UK expert last week when she said that if we look again at the figures around violent crime and put the private sphere into that assessment and take the outliers out, for the data nerds, then the most prevalent form of violence is of men against women.  And we all know that intuitively.  The division of the private and public is problematic, as I said in my opening remarks, which has been redrawn during Covid but also within an educational context.

It noted that consent education is an important element of DSGBV education it is but one aspect, albeit an important one.  Consent as the primary framing or focus fails to capture the inherent complexities of DSGBV.  I would echo that.  This needs to be a broader human rights, and as our colleagues at AkiDwa mentioned, holistic approach to the issue.<br\/><br\/>There are broader measures required.  The Istanbul Convention speaks of legislative measures also.<br\/><br\/>I will quote from the Department of Justice report on legislating for hate speech and hate crime last year.  It states: &quot;Measures ranging from education and awareness to codes of conduct and professional standards are essential to any comprehensive approach to tackling hate speech and hate crime, including by effective prevention.&quot;  What I noted in reviewing that report is that there are some very clear nexuses in relation to the intersectionality <i>vis-&agrave;-vis <\/i>who experiences hate crime and speech in this country and who may be at heightened risk of experiencing domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.

When we do talk about gender we include men in that conversation as well.<\/p> <p>  Very quickly, I wish to refer to refuges.  I do not know if anyone can answer this question.

They are not inclusive of all women from ethnic minority groups.  <\/p> <p>  As Ms McDermott just pointed out, racism can be in school.  We need to educate our children in how to not be racist.

Unfortunately, we educate our children to hate and to be racist and we normalise it within our society, especially towards members of the Traveller community.<\/p> <p>  We need a bigger conversation around how our refuges can be inclusive and can meet the needs of women, especially from ethnic minority groups.  Our education system should be inclusive of all of our children.  They all need the same information around consent.

Our cross-community victims' group has achieved political unity among all the major political parties in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  They have all signed our document, pledging support and rejecting the amnesty proposals of the British Government.  On top of that, at a meeting in Westminster attended by every major party from the House of Commons and House of Lords, except the Conservatives, we were able again to have unity in that every party supported us and signed our document rejecting the amnesty proposals.  History was made in Belfast City Hall last August, with all the major political parties from both sides of the Border signing our document, which is the only document in the history of the island of Ireland to be signed by all the major parties.<\/p><p>Our small group of cross-community victims has been able to get all those political parties to agree on one major issue, that is, rejecting the amnesty proposals of the British Government.  We held a cross-community victims' event in Queen's University Belfast in November 2021 which was also supported by the Northern Ireland Public Service Alliance, NIPSA, which is officially supporting us, and Fr. Sean McManus of the Irish National Caucus, INC, Washington.  The president of NIPSA, Brian Smyth, spoke at the event, as did Fr. McManus, who did so by Zoom.  The Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, Senator Daly, was also a guest speaker.<\/p><p> We are totally non-sectarian and non-political.  We engage in victims' issues and promote victim-led events.  Successful meetings with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, have taken place recently.  We also ask the committee to hear our concerns on the Good Friday Agreement, which has not worked for victims.  We do not oppose the agreement and do not support calls for it to be scrapped.  However, facts show we, as victims, have been left behind.  Truth and justice for victims does not seem to be part of the agreement.  Prisoners who committed thousands of murders and other serious crimes were released to appease the paramilitaries and political parties without consideration of the victims and their families.  We were not first or second on the list of bringing peace - we were, and still are, last.  Broken promises mean broken hearts.<\/p><p> Funding and cross-community and cross-Border initiatives need to be looked at urgently.  Within the unionist community, which I am from, the idea of buying paramilitaries off was a failure from the start, as they are still here.  Money going into the communities should be made public and accountable.  It is being abused with providers turning a blind eye.  Most victims do not belong to any victims' group and yet we have certain victims groups' spokespersons claiming to represent victims and their own narrative of victims.  Integration, like power sharing, should be a priority to help destroy sectarianism and sectarian politics.<\/p><p> There has been a lack of political leadership in Northern Ireland in regard to the agreement.  Amnesty proposals were not part of the agreement, despite secret amnesties being handed out.  Power sharing is also being abused with the petition of concern.  Political parties in Northern Ireland have made the agreement about themselves instead of the victims and all political opinions.  They are like spoilt kids if they do not get their own way.  If victims' groups and individuals have the same narrative as a political party, they are supported.  If not, they are shunned or no true support is given.  The protocol and the agreement, like victims' issues, have developed into orange and green speeches and opinions instead of dialogue, equality and truth; not rants spewed at rallies to gain votes and undemocratic change with instability.  No one wants to go back to the days of the Troubles.  A suggestion would be to have a victim-led, victim-centred process on victims' issues with no links to paramilitaries or political parties.  Political parties should not dictate victims' issues.  Instead, they should take their lead from victims.<\/p><p> As we have a form of on-off power-sharing in Northern Ireland, surely both communities should also be represented in the Irish Senate.  No one except the guilty should be frightened of the truth, be it on truth and justice issues, cross community initiatives, or politics.

I reiterate the welcome the Chairman gave to Mr. Monaghan, Ms McIlvenny and Mr. McCord.  I am sorry I am not able to be there in person but it is always good to see another north Belfast face in front of the committee, so Mr. McCord is very welcome.  I wish to say at the outset I noted with interest - this is directed at Mr. McCord - the Coroner's Office in Belfast announced that as part of the five-year plan to deal with legacy inquests, Mr. McCord's son's case will be dealt with as part of the year 3 plan.  I saw that announced in or around the third week of March.  For me, it brings into very sharp focus, should the committee need to be reminded, what we are dealing with here.  We are dealing with families like those of Mr. McCord, and of Mr. Monaghan and Ms McIlvenny, who have been working tirelessly for a long period of time.  It has been too many years.  In Mr. McCord's case, the family are now very close to actually being able to go into a courtroom and access truth through the legal mechanisms.<\/p> <p>  The committee previously attended in Belfast and we heard that similar fear from families of the Springhill-Westrock massacre.  They are now very fearful about whether they will set foot in a courtroom given the proposals made by the British Government last year in the House of Commons.  I pay tribute to Mr. McCord's perseverance and, dare I say it, stubbornness.  I say that in wholly complimentary terms.  Mr. McCord has been able to bring his son's case to the forefront through the ombudsman.  Now, we hope to be able to see exactly what transpires as the evidence is challenged through an inquest.  The committee had a very good and strong record in dealing with this, even in advance of the British Government's unilateral moves last year.  The committee has recognised the importance of dealing with the past and doing so in a way that does not satisfy narrow interests but satisfies those who matter most, namely, families, relatives and those who were either injured or bereaved as a result of state, republican or loyalist actions and that it is important they have faith in a process to provide the answers they want.  The committee heard on numerous occasions that not every family wants the same things.  We have received lots of evidence as to the subtleties, and the importance of the subtleties, of what exactly it is families need.  I again pay tribute to this committee for prioritising that as an issue.<\/p> <p>  When we talk about agreement on legacy, it is always worth bringing the starting point back to when there was a political agreement between the parties and the two governments.  I refer to the Stormont House Agreement of 2014.  Without rehearsing it in too much detail, what followed was a period of lacking implementation, which meant the structures that had been painfully negotiated, although I think very well received by families once they were agreed, were not implemented.  Again, it goes back to my point that the structures were not an imposition of a one-size-fits-all approach to legacy.  It recognised different families had different needs and different priorities and it allowed access, for example, through the criminal courts to continue and also through the civil courts through inquests such as in the case of Mr. McCord's son and many others.  Also, where there were investigatory steps being taken by our ombudsman's office, it allowed those structures to continue, as well as reinforcing, strengthening and providing the ability for families to get some sense of closure, which is not a word I like using, on what they had been dealing with for what amounted to decades, in some cases.<\/p><p>If we fast-forward a little bit to the lack of implementation around Stormont House, again, even with regard to the five-year legacy plan, we saw a fairly unprecedented action by our then Lord Chief Justice Declan Morgan.  In a sense, he came out with a begging bowl asking for the money to implement a five-year plan to clear legacy inquests.  It is good to see that we are now on to year three and we want to see that continue.  I do not think I would be contradicted by anybody on this committee, irrespective of what party he or she comes from, to say this committee is united in wanting to see those inquests take place.  It wants to see the families who have been waiting for access to truth and justice get into those court rooms.<br\/><br\/>As a result of the unilateral actions by the British Government last year, however, unfortunately, like many other legal avenues, inquests are now under threat.  That statement in July last year came a couple of weeks after a joint British Government and Irish Government statement arising out of the British&ndash;Irish Intergovernmental Conference that legacy needed to be looked at.<br\/><br\/>For me, and I think it was touched on very well in the opening statement from the group, there is arguably an unprecedented reaction to such a unilateral move on legacy.  We have had many very helpful interventions by groups that represent victims and families, non-governmental human rights organisations and international bodies, whether they are based in Europe or America, which have over the years held a mirror, particularly up to the British Government, around its lack of implementation or adherence to international human rights standards.<br\/><br\/>The period of consultation and listening that the British Government said it would undertake after the announcement in July of last year was a sham.  We have certainly called it that.  I think other political parties represented on this committee have publicly called it that.  The British Government in my view and that of Sinn F&eacute;in was tone deaf.  Irrespective of how a person lost a loved one, the answer was the same - that these proposals were rejected in their entirety.  I agree with Mr. McCord entirely.  I was with him at Westminster when his group convened a meeting.  My party was represented through my north Belfast councillor colleague at the meeting in City Hall, which Mr. McCord referenced.  There is that singularity of voice whenever people are calling out whatever these proposals really are.  It is not about working to the benefit of families.  It is actually about shutting down processes whether it is cruelly taking away Mr. McCord's inquest he has waited too long for, removing any shred of possibility that families can access justice through the criminal courts and those investigatory processes or removing the power of the ombudsman to investigate.  Again, Mr. McCord's case, along with others, is a good example of how the ombudsman can work best.  My view certainly would be that a degree of a penalty was imposed upon Dame Nuala O'Loan's office.  I think she was essentially too good in her investigation around the Mount Vernon Ulster Volunteer Force, UVF.  We have, therefore, very good structures being starved of resources that essentially strips them of their ability to operate at full capacity.<br\/><br\/>We had the response from families, groups and political parties, however.  Mr. McCord cited the Traditional Unionist Voice, TUV, as maybe the outlier but really all major parties on the island of Ireland have unequivocally come out to condemn the proposals.  We also had very significant voices being made clear from groups this committee has met.  We met with Widows Against Violence Empower, WAVE, at its headquarters in north Belfast, Ballymurphy and Springhill justice groups, Amnesty International and the Committee on the Administration of Justice, which have certainly testified before the committee.  They all brought that international legal weight to the lobby, which is again very clear that these proposals cannot go ahead in their current form.  That has been reinforced by voices from Europe and America.  Most recently, a bipartisan congressional resolution, which I believe was Resolution 888, again called on the British Government to honour its commitments under the Good Friday Agreement.  Importantly for today's meeting, it also made it very clear that British Government cannot proceed with the proposals as they currently stand because of the pain and hurt that it further inflicts on families but also because it will deny people access to truth and justice.  It is, again, very welcome and timely.  I noted from<i>The Times <\/i>yesterday that the British Government is saying its proposals and legislation will be made clear within weeks.  We have heard that since before last summer.  We will wait and see whether it actually transpires this time.<br\/><br\/>Cognisant of Mr. McCord's opening statement and the context I have tried to set from our point of view, I would be interested to hear from whichever of the three witnesses, or all of them, about what exactly the impact of the proposals will be should they evolve into legislation.  What does that mean for them personally?  I do not mean whether they are for or against it but what impact will that have on their ability to access truth and justice?  What do they need to see legally to allow them to access what it is that they want with regard to their own very personal pursuit of truth and justice?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022040700002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Finucane","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649286000,"counter":852,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Finucane.  I liked the bit about north Belfast.  Legally, I would like to see the British Government held to account.  These proposals will ensure it will never be held accountable.  These proposals for me are to cover up the British Government's involvement in murders during the Troubles.  They are to cover up the British Government's agents, both loyalists and republicans, and murders by state forces, be it Ballymurphy, Blood Sunday or the Shankill Road where people were shot dead by paratroopers as well.  The only way these proposals relate to injustice is to stop justice.  For me, it has been a fight.  It is 24 or 25 years this year since young Raymond was murdered.  One sees oneself in the courts, and Michael and Cathy are the same.  We go into the courts and expect the case to go ahead.  The judge gives instructions for a timescale and we are given four weeks to produce documents or whatever it is.  The state ignores it time and again.  If some man or woman appears in court and the judge says come back in a month's time and he or she does not come back, a warrant is issued for his or her arrest.  That person is asked to produce documents to defend himself or herself in that period of time.  The judge will take a case and go ahead because there is no excuse; that person had time to do it.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to victims, however, it is completely different.  It is like black and white.  All I see is the state doing everything it can, legally and illegally, because we class it as illegal when it is stopping justice and hindering the courts.  It talks about national security.  We are in the process at the minute of looking for documentation.  How does somebody being convicted of the murder of my son, Cathy's nephew or Michael's father-in-law and brother affect the national security of the UK?  We want to hear the answer to that from the British Government.  The British Government is not going to fall down if the state agents who were proved, and accepted by that British Government, to have murdered my son are convicted.  The UK Government, whether a Labour Party or a Conservative Party Government, is not going to collapse.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Finucane made a point too about the ombudsman.  The ombudsman's report came out in 2007.  The British Government accepted it as did the chief constable and Secretary of State.  All these years later, not one policeman has been arrested.  It stated the police colluded in the murder of Raymond McCord Jnr. and in other cases in the report and yet no policeman has been arrested and charged.  We fought with the Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland with our solicitor, Mr. Paul Farrell.<\/p><p>We met it and it said there was not enough evidence.  If there was not enough evidence, why did the British Government accept there was collusion with his handlers and then charge the handlers?  I would like to see the committee sitting here today and the Irish Government become more involved in the case and be more vocal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022040700002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Raymond McCord","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":854,"content":"<p>Mr. McCord can keep going.

We class victims as victims, not unionist or nationalist.  I am from the unionist community, but I do not turn around and speak as a unionist victim.  I turn around and speak as a victim.  From the outside looking in at how the Irish Government has treated these cases, there has been no call from the Irish Government for inquiries into unionist victims.  We have to call a spade a spade when we are sitting here.  We are getting the opportunity to say how we feel.  All victims should be entitled to an inquiry when they are being treated so badly.  All victims should have an inquiry when they have not had an inquest.  What the British Government is doing now is saying that not only will there be no prosecutions, but there will be no investigations, inquests or civil actions.  When they claimed it was going to help victims to move on, we asked Boris Johnson and Brandon Lewis who told them that.  Different victims have different narratives.  If somebody has been murdered by the state or a paramilitary organisation, he or she is a victim.  It does not make any difference what his or her political belief is, if he or she has got one.  Clearly some of the people who have been involved in the Troubles over the years have murdered for the sake of murder, be it the state or the paramilitaries.  The British Government has been telling us for years, through academics and political parties, what the best way forward is for my son.  The best way to get justice for my son is not to bring in these proposals in any way whatsoever.  That is the best way forward for the British Government, but the British Government is there to serve its citizens.  We are not there to serve the British Government.<\/p> <p>  When we speak to political parties - John Finucane was with us at Westminster - they all sign up to the document pledging their support and rejecting the proposals.  We really appreciate every person who has put his or her signature to that, but with the exceptions of a couple of them, we have not heard anything back from the politicians who signed it.  The only two politicians who have come back to me so I could tell the group what was happening were the Cathaoirleach, Senator Mark Daly, and Senator Emer Currie.  The rest of the politicians think that because they have signed the document that their job is done.  They get pats on the back for doing it - we appreciate them signing it - but they have to do a lot more than sign a document.  They have to tell us what they are going to do if these proposals get brought into Westminster.<\/p> <p>  Yesterday, we met Mary Lou McDonald.  People in Belfast, such as John Finucane, will understand that there are a lot of people in Belfast who would not like people from my community to sit down with Mary Lou McDonald, but she has got a mandate the same as everybody else.  The meeting went well.  We were asked by victims to ask questions and we asked them at the meeting yesterday.  We intend to meet Mary Lou McDonald again.  We want to make it quite clear to the victims that we condemn all murders that were carried out in the Troubles.  The point I made to Mary Lou McDonald yesterday was that, as somebody from the unionist community, I condemn the murders by the British army no matter where they took place in Northern Ireland.  I condemn the murders by people who were involved in the security forces.  We saw what happened with the Ulster Defence Regiment, UDR, and the Miami Showband and other cases, and police officers were involved in my son's murder, but I also condemn the murders by the Ulster Defence Association, UDA, the Ulster Volunteer Force, UVF, and the IRA.  I do not believe Sinn F&eacute;in grasps how victims feel regarding condemnation.  I refer to the word \"condemnation\".  They are under pressure not to say the words victims want, in particular from the unionist and nationalist communities.  We asked Mary Lou McDonald to condemn the IRA murders.  I do not see a problem with somebody saying \"I condemn the murders of the IRA\", but as John Finucane knows, that is not happening.  I pointed out that if Jeffrey Donaldson was sitting in front of us, I would ask him to condemn the murders of the army and the UDR, because he is a former member of the UDR.  I emphasised to Mary Lou McDonald that I was not accusing her of being a member of the IRA because she was not, but we want to hear the words from political leaders, not for them to be frightened to name the organisations whose murders they are condemning.  We do not want a standard reply saying they condemn all murders.  We all condemn all murders, but let us turn around and say we condemn the murders of these groups.  That was the only blight on the meeting yesterday.  Mary Lou McDonald said to us afterwards yesterday, let us continue this.  We said that we are keen to do it.<\/p> <p>  I take flak from certain elements within the unionist community for meeting Sinn F&eacute;in, but unless they are victims, people do not have a right to give me flak.  Political people and people who stand on bins - pound-shop lawyers - have no right to criticise anybody who comes to Dublin and they have no right to criticise people who come from Dublin to help people in Northern Ireland to bring some type of peace.  I personally welcome the involvement of Dublin in this.  I want to see it do more.  I want to see the Dublin people turn around and accept the extent to which they have not looked upon the victims in unionism in the same way.  When I go to Washington, through Sean McManus and the Irish National Caucus, I am treated as a victim.  Sean McManus ensures that and the support he has given us is immense and appreciated.  John Finucane knows that it is unique for an Irish Catholic priest to support a Belfast Protestant unionist, but that is the way we think it should be.  I want the people in Dublin to turn around and to follow on from what Sean McManus is doing in Washington for victims.  We must bring people from both communities to Washington.  I said to Mary Lou McDonald yesterday that she should bring unionist people over to Washington with her.  She must show that she wants unionist victims of the IRA or republican organisations to get justice as much as she wants victims of the UVF, the UDA and state forces to get justice.  That needs to happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022040700002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Raymond McCord"},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":856,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCord.

As you said, a Chathaoirligh, Mr. McCord has made a powerful contribution in his opening statement and follow-up remarks.<\/p><p>I do not think any of us could quibble with what Mr. McCord said.  In his opening statement Mr. McCord referred in particular to the need for dialogue, equality and truth.  He emphasised that the process needs to be victim-led and victim-centred.  His concluding remarks referred to how victims can be denoted at times.  That is a thing we can all be more conscious of.  I know when I speak of victims I include victims regardless of what their background is or political beliefs are, or whether they belonged to any religious group.  We should make that point and I take that fact.<\/p><p> In his opening remarks Mr. McCord made a point about money.  He said that, \"Money going into the communities should be made public and accountable.  It is being abused with providers turning a blind eye.\"  If there is cause for concern, then there is an obligation on all of us, whether it is public money from the Department of Foreign Affairs or other agencies funded by our taxpayers.  If we have evidence of wrongdoing or of money being misappropriated, we have an obligation to raise that and we will do so if we have particular concerns.  I am sure that applies also to legislators in Northern Ireland or in the House of Commons.  Nobody would have a problem with questioning that.  If public funding is being put into projects that are to better everybody in society, then they should not be misappropriated by any group, organisation or individual.  We all know public funding can be scarce at times and we want to see it put to proper use.<\/p><p> Mr. McCord mentioned dialogue, equality and truth and this being victim-led and victim-centred.  They are basic tenets of fairness in any society.  What he outlined is absolutely essential but it should be part of our everyday work and everyday public administration.<\/p><p> This committee has been in place for a number of years and we have met many groups.  I do not think any group has been refused access to this committee.  We have visited the Border counties in Northern Ireland and have met different groups, always going out to listen to different groups and to hear at first hand from people like today&rsquo;s witnesses who have unfortunately continued to be victims of terrible deeds carried out by paramilitaries and by state forces.  We have had much engagement with a number of groups, including Justice for the Forgotten, Wave Trauma Centre and Truth and Reconciliation Platform.  I have met those groups and I listened and spoken to families who have been the beneficiaries of the work of those groups.  We learn a great deal when we visit the Wave Trauma Centre in Belfast or Derry.  We have met people who have been supported by those particular centre, namely, family members of victims who have been supported over the years.  If there are people not being represented or not being listened to, then that has to be a source of concern for all of us.<\/p><p> I recall - it was probably a year ago at this committee - that I asked our Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, if he or his Department was confident that within our State, for which he has responsibility, all victims were being reached.  Often people do not partake in groups or do not wish to participate in groups.  He said his Department was confident that all victims' families in our State had been represented or had been reached out to by different statutory agencies.  I sincerely hope that is accurate.  Some people may not want to be involved in the process but he was confident that victims here had been reached out to and had been listened to.  I hope that is right because that is the very least that people need.<\/p><p> On Mr. McCord&rsquo;s opening remarks in regard to the British Government&rsquo;s proposal of an amnesty, such a proposal by a democratically elected government is absolutely reprehensible.  Such a proposal might be expected from some tin-pot regime of bygone days in somewhere like South America.  A government is putting forward a proposal to put an end to investigations for people trying to seek the truth, and all of us are aware of many families who have campaigned for decades to try to get the truth about how their family member, their loved one, was lost.  In many instances, they know getting justice will be extremely difficult but the least they want is to get the truth in regard to who carried out the horrific, reprehensible and despicable crimes that caused death and injury to so many.<\/p><p> I represented and worked alongside many of those families in my constituency.  These are people who lost family members decades ago who are still searching with great dignity and grace to try to get the truth.  A government is proposing to put an end to those investigations and is saying to those people that an end is being put to their work, when they always hoped that through their work, supported by support groups, that they would hopefully get the truth and that maybe justice would be meted out to the people who committed the crimes.  <\/p><p> On a number of occasions this committee has had discussions on the British Government proposal.  On many occasions we have tabled questions in the D&aacute;il to An Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I recall that in the immediate aftermath of the anniversary of Bloody Sunday in Derry we had a specific D&aacute;il debate in early February on the amnesty proposal in regard to legacy and victims' issues.  About three weeks later we had another D&aacute;il debate on that issue where both An Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and senior party representatives of all parties made very strong contributions on their total opposition to the British Government proposal and the absolute need to make progress with so many of the issues Mr. McCord outlined so cogently and so well today.  That is not taking away from the amount of work that is needed.<\/p><p> What the British Government has come up with is opposed by every representative in our Houses of Parliament, in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  That is clear.  The work the witnesses did in getting all the political parties to sign that document has been important.<\/p><p> Mr. McCord mentioned a cover-up.  Cover-up for state forces, for paramilitaries or for agents of the state forces is not acceptable.  The truth is absolutely important.  As Mr. McCord said in his opening remarks, no one except the guilty should be frightened of the truth.  That particular statement is exceptionally powerful.  Mr. McCord sums up so much, so well.<\/p><p> He mentioned the follow up on documents.  We speak in the D&aacute;il and at times we speak here.  However, I accept the fact that many families, the vast majority, I am sure, would not be aware of the work we are doing.  Perhaps we fall down in getting the message out to show that we continue to support them.  That is our fault.  The nature of political work is that we discuss issues here but the wider community is not aware of those discussions.  People are not aware of the concerns or the representations we make to Government Ministers, Departments or statutory agencies.  Mr. McCord made a very valid point.  The only way we can hope to disseminate that message is through representative groups and advocacy groups.  The work we do is always in support of the causes Mr. McCord outlined so well.  We need to do a better job in getting that message across.<\/p><p> I mentioned the debates we had in the D&aacute;il.  Our colleagues, Senators McGreehan and Currie, along with others were instrumental in having similar debates in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  The issues are discussed here constantly, and quite rightly so.  We want to see progress on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022040700002#E00700","speaker":"1556","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":861,"content":"<p>We will be going to the North fairly soon and if the witnesses so wish, we would be happy to meet any of the groups or the people privately or publicly, or in whatever manner they would like to meet us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022040700002#F00200","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":862,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Monaghan, Mr. McCord and Ms McIlvenny.

It was a pleasure to go to the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly and to question the Minister of State on the legacy proposals, which I utterly oppose.  Our guests know how I feel.

If victims' groups, political parties and governments remain in silos and are only advocating for their own and not putting victims as a collective first as well as healing for the individual or healing collectively, will we ever see progress on reconciliation and will we ever see the full truth emerge?  If the British Government is holding us back, and we know it is, what else and who else is holding us back from getting to the truth and justice and healing society, which is what we want and why we are here?  This is about reconciliation and trying to work towards a normal society, or as normal as it can be based on the past.  The Good Friday Agreement mentioned victims seven times.  We are doing a report on the Good Friday Agreement after 25 years.  Did it do enough?  It brought us to a ceasefire, but what does it or what do we need to do in terms of reconciliation?  My colleague, Deputy Carroll MacNeill, will ask some questions on that too.<\/p> <p>  There is one sentence on funding in the group's opening statement.  It is a very important statement and we need to dig deeper into it.  I acknowledge that there are many people doing a lot of good work, but I want our guests to dig deeper on that.

It has pushed it more underground.  The kids are given the option of joining.  If they cannot pay the bills, it has been known that parents' houses and oil tanks have been set on fire.  They are living under this fear.  They still have a fear of the paramilitary organisations.  Nobody is free of that.  The Good Friday Agreement did not do that.

I have already spoken about the court cases - \"Just give us the documents and we will tell the families what they need to see\".  They will not give them to us.  They have to come from Westminster.  Westminster has the documents and it will not release them.  It is frustrating for us because we all know there was collusion.

I have grandchildren.  I kept my kids away from it.  They witnessed the murder of their grandfather, which was meant to be the murder of myself only I changed my plans that night.

Just over a week ago I was able to organise, with the help of people in Dublin, a cross-community football match with a Protestant and Catholic football team from Belfast in the interface area of Tiger's Bay, where my family is originally from.  One street separates it from the Catholic community.  The football team is Limestone United and the people in Stormont should bring the team up there and recognise what it is doing.  It would not suit certain politicians that young Protestants and Catholics are on the same team.  We based the match on the team I played for in 1969, the Star of the Sea team, where Bobby Sands and I played on the same team.  People have asked me what I thought of Bobby Sands, the hunger striker.  I say I did not know Bobby Sands as the hunger striker.<\/p><p>I knew Bobby Sands, the 16 year old footballer, as I was.   The match was played in a Protestant area on the Shore Road in north Belfast at Crusaders Football Club, which has done much good work for community relations.  The match was sponsored not by political people or funding from groups, but by a man from west Belfast and the Catholic community, and Sean Donnelly, who owns the bus company, City Tours.  He paid for the bus to bring people up from Dublin.  We did not ask politicians in Stormont or Dublin to put their hand in their pocket.  We know the people who really care and who are not afraid to put their hand in their pocket.  Sean Donnelly is one of those people.  At the end of the day, I have to give him credit for that.  If we had more like him in Belfast and Dublin, we would get the young people together.    <\/p><p> On the funding, Ms McIlvenny and I are from the unionist community.  Over the past few years, we have seen photographs, including one of several senior members of the DUP at an office on the Shankill Road which receives huge amounts of funding.  That is wrong.  The west Belfast UDA, according to the police, are heavily involved in drugs in the west and unionist areas.  These politicians support them with funding applications.  According to the police, the UVF is the biggest criminal gang in east Belfast, it is the biggest drug dealer and it is poisoning the children in the unionist community.  We have rallies in Belfast and not one person speaks at these rallies about the protocol, what is happening in the unionist community or the drugs.  They are more interested in telling lies about a document that was signed up to by the British.  I say to them \"If you have a problem with it, go to Westminster and protest.\"  Prime Minister Boris Johnson signed the document on behalf of the British people and the people of Northern Ireland, but it will not happen because of the sectarianism of it.  I contacted a newspaper, which would be deemed to be linked to the unionist community.  I submitted complaints about what is being said, why there are political people on the platform and unelected people at the rallies trying to tell the unionist people to come out?  These are unelected people, people with no votes.  Those who have votes refuse to talk about what is happening within our community.  They refuse to talk about victims' issues, to address victims' issues and these proposals or to speak at these rallies.  They refuse to condemn the UVF for selling drugs in the communities they are elected to represent.  This is what unionist people have to deal with.  They are afraid to complain about it or to speak out.  They are afraid to go to a politician because they do not know if they can trust that politician not to tell the paramilitaries who is complaining about the local paramilitaries.  Unionist politicians are helping them to do their funding applications, knowing they are paramilitaries.  According to the law, the UDA and UVF are terrorist organisations.  They are proscribed organisations and yet our politicians have no problem working with them, but they have a problem working with victims.  We question whose corner they are in.  It is not hard to guess the answer to that question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022040700002#H01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Raymond McCord","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":887,"content":"<p>I was struck by Mr. McCord's opening statement.

The Good Friday Agreement, in my view, is entirely about building mutual trust and reconciliation and understanding.  That can only be done with victims very much at the centre.

I was interviewed about that the night before.  I live in Tiger's Bay, which is a strong loyalist area.  I voted it against it for one reason: I disagreed with the prisoners being released.  I made that point in the statement.  It was agreed to let all of the prisoners and killers out and that the victims would just have to swallow it.  Again with these proposals, victims are being told to swallow it but we are not going to do that.  We had to swallow it the first time, but we will not do it again.<\/p> <p>  Over the years, there have been various initiatives and agreements, including the Stormont House Agreement, the St. Andrews Agreement and so on.  I do not need a 20, 30 or 40 page document to say that murder is wrong or that there should be an investigation into my son's murder, the murder of the family members of Ms McIlvenny, Mr. Monaghan and thousands of other people.  I do not need a Stormont House Agreement or a St. Andrews Agreement to tell me what way to bring it forward.  The law in Dublin and in countries throughout Europe and the world states that murder is a crime, the police should investigate it and, where there is sufficient evidence, should take cases to court.  It is very simple.  People make a big issue of all of these agreements.  I have never read any of them.  I have not read the Good Friday Agreement, but it has not worked for victims.  We have been left behind.  If we were not being left behind, we would not be here today putting our case about the amnesty proposals and what the Good Friday Agreement has failed to do for us.  It has failed to help us get justice.  More needs to be done.  I do not know the rules and regulations of the Good Friday Agreement.  I believe in simple processes and getting things done.  You do not need an inquiry to find out if things are bad within a unionist community or a nationalist community; you can find that out by visiting the areas and speaking to people.  You do not need to spend thousands of pounds or euro to find out what is happening; you need only ask the people, but you need to do that privately and not at a public meeting, particularly within the unionist community, because the paramilitaries are in control and people will be afraid to speak.  <\/p> <p>  I welcome this opportunity to engage with the committee and to speak about how I feel and what is really going on.

They call people in to talk to them but you have to live in the community to know what is going on.  Let us look at the appointees.  There are victims' commissioners but I have yet to see a working class person or a victim appointed as one.  The Victims and Survivors Service chief executive is an accountant.  What would an accountant know about what it is like to be a victim and to face injustice?  We need to look at the people who are appointed to these posts.<\/p> <p>  We talk about victims and one of the questions the Deputy asked was on how we break the link.  We do so by appointing people who have the interests of victims at heart, not those who want money in their pockets because that is what happening and continues to happen.  Politicians could be sitting watching this and hear what we are talking about and decide that they will meet Ms McIlvenny, Mr. Monaghan and I but nothing will be done about it.  You go up and they will pat you on the back but we do not want pats on the back; we want them to do something for us.  Most importantly, we want them to turn around and tell us they will help us to get justice and the truth for our family members.  We want them to assure us that paramilitaries who control the areas will no longer be in control of them and that they will stop the funding going to them.  Why will they not do that?  They will not do so because they need their votes.  Election time comes around and you will have loyalist paramilitaries putting the flags and posters up for certain political parties and candidates and it will not be mentioned that this man is a drug dealer or that his group is involved with drugs, extortion and beatings in our community.  It is accepted.<\/p> <p>  People like Ms McIlvenny and I can talk about the unionist community and there are people like us who are not afraid to speak out, so I invite the politicians to come and meet us.  We do not need a report because we live in the community.  We went to Westminster three times and Billy McManus, whose father was killed in the Ormeau Road bookmakers, went with me the first time.  People said we were wasting our time and that the British Government would not stop them.  It got more victims involved on a cross-community basis and it got all the parties united.  Parties could not do that but a small group of victims could.  These people tell the truth and speak from the heart, not for the money.  We paid for our fares over and for hotels; we did not ask anybody for help.  Some people struggled to get the money to go over and some borrowed it.  Some of the victims' groups have funding and those funds pay for these expenses.  When you get a group of people who are determined to stop these proposals, then money was no object or hindrance.  They turned around and said they would get the money and go.  Not one politician came to us to ask us if we had the money to fly over.  If they had have asked us, we would have told them where to go.  That is the truth because it is not about money.  For politicians and so-called community workers, it is not about helping the people or bringing them together.  It is amazing that these people from the loyalist side can sit with people from the republican side and carve up deals, with the people excluded.  The only way they can carve up deals is if they are getting funding.  Let us stop that and let it go to the right people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022040700002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Raymond McCord"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649286000,"counter":898,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Chathaoirleach and I wish all our witnesses a good afternoon.  I apologise if my voice sounds croaky as I am isolating with Covid.  Hopefully, I am on the mend.  I want to make two broad observations on the two topics that have been discussed by Mr. McCord and his colleagues, namely, legacy and the effect of paramilitarism in Northern Ireland.  Those two topics are closely related to one another.<\/p> <p>  On legacy, my party's views are clear in that we are opposed to the UK Government's proposals on the amnesty and we will do all we can to oppose it if and when it comes through Westminster.  I want to put on the radar what may be the next milestone in this process.  A speech by the British Queen is expected in the UK Parliament on 10 May and it is likely we will hear a pronouncement at that stage on the situation with the legislation, either a firm commitment to a Bill or something looser in language.  This will move up the agenda quickly in May and June, whenever we hear what will be said in that statement.<\/p> <p>  I will say a few more things about paramilitarism in Northern Ireland, which is an ongoing scourge.  I would encourage the committee to look at it in more detail.  There is a locus in the fact that the Independent Reporting Commission has an Irish Government appointee in the form of the former civil servant, Tim O'Connor.  That gives a clear locus for us to take a look at that work.  If I am permitted to cross over to what is happening in London I would also draw the attention of Mr. McCord and his colleagues to the fact that the UK's Northern Ireland Affairs Committee is undertaking an inquiry into paramilitarism.  I would encourage Mr. McCord to submit some written evidence to that and I would highlight to anyone else who is listening to do likewise.  This comes in the context where there is a commitment to an anti-paramilitarism strategy in Northern Ireland, which has been delivered in parts and has had some mixed results.<\/p> <p>  Clearly paramilitarism is still a major problem in our society and it is not just the big headline issue around what you would term \"terrorist attacks\" or even the more covert crimes.  It is the coercive control that smothers communities where voices are not allowed to come forward.  In particular, women's voices are often suppressed and I would be interested to hear the views in that regard.  In policy terms, a clear distinction has to be made between investing in the communities that have been affected by paramilitaries as opposed to investing in paramilitaries themselves.  I am sceptical of that concept of transition more than 20 years on from the Good Friday Agreement and we have had the wool pulled over our eyes in that regard.<\/p><p>What happened in north Belfast last month - the UVF's hoax bomb attack - proves the fallacy in the suggestion that faith has been placed in the transition.<\/p><p> There is a significant challenge for state institutions in walking a careful line and engaging with what are euphemistically called \"stakeholders\" or \"community workers\" in some of those communities.  Often, the easiest route for people to address their problems is to talk to the loudest or most prominent voices, but that has the effect of bolstering those unofficial control structures in communities instead of allowing different and more democratic paths to emerge.  An aspect of the paramilitary strategy that is important to focus on is the putting in place of a protocol for government agencies and their staff on how they work in those communities and avoid some of the bear traps that sometimes lead to the state inadvertently giving a sense of legitimacy to the people in question.<\/p><p> To put this in context, I remember when a new police commander came to my own community many years ago.  In his first days in office, he had his photograph taken with people who were seen as being associated with, or previously associated with, paramilitarism.  That probably sent a negative message in terms of trying to encourage alternative voices to come forward.  We must be careful not to send that type of signal or give the wrong impression.  It is important that we focus on ensuring that government policy is correct and investment is made, particularly in education, skills and housing &ndash; cross-community work is also important &ndash; to try to work around some of those structures.<\/p><p> These are just some of my thoughts.  I would be happy to hear reactions and comments from our witnesses. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022040700002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Stephen Farry","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649286000,"counter":900,"content":"<p>We all know what needs to be done in every district of Belfast, particularly its unionist areas where the paramilitaries have control.

Politicians should not be afraid to admit that they were wrong.  If they were being truthful, many candidates would not be running in the election, given the stories they have told us over the years.<\/p> <p>  The issue we are discussing at this meeting is the justice system.  It is not working in Northern Ireland despite the efforts of victims.  Victims should not need to push for this.  Rather, politicians should.  Dr. Farry, several other politicians and a number of people from the SDLP have helped us.  It is not the large parties that support us.  Rather, it is the ones further down the chain that do.  I have to say it the way it is.<\/p> <p>  Correct me if I am wrong, but since the amnesty proposals were published, I have heard nothing positive about it from the Minister of Justice, Ms Naomi Long, despite emails sent to her.  I know her well, but it seems like the Department of Justice in Northern Ireland is ignoring this issue.  We have requested meetings.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the justice system and the Good Friday Agreement, paramilitary prisoners lead lives like no other prisoners.  They can do what they want in Maghaberry prison.  They are treated differently from ordinary prisoners.  Coming down on the train, we were talking about the mothers and partners of some of those in jail who have been abused at Maghaberry prison.  I have sent emails about this to the justice system.  It does not happen to the paramilitary prisoners.  They get special treatment.  The people who continue to torture communities and still want a war footing are treated as if there is something special about them.  No one is disputing that some ordinary prisoners have committed serious crimes and deserve to be in prison, but prisoners with mental health issues are being placed in the punishment blocks for three months at a time for no reason.  When they ask why that is they are told that it is not up for debate.  Mothers are ringing me at 12.30 a.m. crying out of fear that their sons will get murdered in prison.  They are not talking about prisoners doing it either, but prison officers.  People say that these are false claims, but there has not been a proper investigation.  When prisoners try to rehabilitate, they are not allowed to do so.  We want to live in a peaceful society, but prisoners come out of prison with a chip on their shoulders and the people who will suffer are the general public again.<\/p> <p>  The justice system is not working.  I do not just mean in terms of dealing with legacy cases.  Rather, it is not working in terms of dealing with prisoners, particularly in Maghaberry prison.  I have spoken to the mothers, who are worried about their sons.  Their sons are no angels by any means and they are being punished, but questions need to be asked publicly of the Director General of the Northern Ireland Prison Service.  I have spoken about this to politicians previously.  Three years ago, Ms Rachel Woods rang and said that she would meet me about it, but she was under the impression that the director general had met me.  He had not.  When there is a director general of a prison service that is not being run the way it should be and where people should be rehabilitated so that they do not return to prison and the public are kept safe when they get out, I have no other option &ndash; I spoke to people before coming down to Dublin and they wanted me to raise this issue because it is part of the justice system &ndash; but to call for the director general to resign.<\/p><p>People need to do their job.  Funding should not be given to people who are not worthy of it and should not have it.  The same applies to people who have high-flying jobs back in Northern Ireland and are not able to do the job.  It should be given to people who care and who will do their best to ensure these people can come out of prison with some sort of training.  People go into prison without a drug problem and come out of prison with a major drug problem.  Some young people are killing themselves.  A nephew of mine who came out from prison told me it was terrible.  In the cell next to him prison officers were beating a fellow up.  Forms are available for prisoners to complain.  They are not left out; the prisoners ask for them.  Once they ask for them, they are told that if they submit the form it will get worse for them.  That is part of our justice system.  It needs to be completely overhauled.  Naomi Long needs to look at herself and speak to people not just to the prison people.  With these issues here I would have thought that the Minister of Justice would have been speaking to victims.  I remind Dr. Farry that most victims do not belong to victims' groups and their voices are not being heard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022040700002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Raymond McCord","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649286000,"counter":904,"content":"<p>I will give feedback to Naomi Long on Mr. McCord's broader comments on the criminal justice system and prisons.

I share Senator McGreehan's frustration.  These amnesty proposals that fundamentally undermine truth and justice come from the British Government in London.  As we are sitting in Dublin, what can we do?  We need to remember that the Irish Government is a party to the Good Friday Agreement and is a co-guarantor of the rights under the Good Friday Agreement.  Our role here is to hold the Irish Government to account to ensure it is doing everything it can do.<\/p> <p>  I have spoken numerous times here about the independent commission for information retrieval.  This is part of the various agreements.  There was an agreement as to how this would look.  This was being progressed until the amnesty proposals came out.  There are various agreements on how it would work and it needs legislation.  I again call the Irish Government to publish our legislation.  I accept this also needs legislation in London and needs the involvement of the British Government.  However, we should publish our legislation to show our seriousness about pushing ahead with this.  We should start our pre-legislative scrutiny on it so that if the British come to their senses, we can move quickly on it.  It also gives another forum to talk to victims and to hear victims' voices.  I will come back to that point again shortly.  It gives another forum to have conversations like this so that we can ensure we are doing the right thing.<\/p> <p>  The question for the Irish Government is what we have lurking in our archives that we should be releasing.  What bits of truth do we have but are not releasing?  There was a letter from the UVF to Charles Haughey that mentioned the Miami Showband.  The UVF wrote to Charles Haughey saying that the British Government had asked it to assassinate him but that it was not going to do that.  Among other things, it made reference to the Miami Showband.  When it came out, members of the band who had survived asked why the hell nobody had told them this letter existed.  What else is lurking in our archives that we do not know about?  It may be something small, but it may be just that piece of the jigsaw that a family needs to put together with other bits.  It may be the pebble that starts the landslide.  We need to ask ourselves what is in our archives which we should be releasing.  Just as the witnesses have criticised the British Government hiding behind its security reasons, we should not be doing this.  Now is the time for us to look at those issues.<\/p> <p>  Our Government and everyone here have condemned the British Government's proposed amnesty.  What will we do if it goes ahead with it?  We have talked about holding the British Government to account and part of that accountability is to have consequences for action.  If we had a treaty with another country and it was threatening to renege on that agreement, we would point out the consequences and try to hold it to account.  I do not hear that kind of language.  We are condemning it, but we are not saying what we will do next.  There is no clear statement of how we will hold the British Government to account for breaching this international agreement.  Those are things the Irish Government can be doing.  This committee can be asking those questions of the Irish Government.  Why is it not doing it?  What are the roadblocks?  What can we do?  It is our role as a committee to hold it to account and to ask these awkward questions.<\/p> <p>  Mr. McCord said most victims do not belong to victims' groups.  I would like to explore that further.  We have been talking about the funding going to paramilitary groups.  Obviously, we need transparency and accountability with regard to funding that comes from the Irish Government, as Deputy Brendan Smith said.  I do not know if that is the responsibility of this committee or another committee.  It would certainly be interesting to understand that.  Perhaps the Library and Research Service could provide a breakdown of the funding going to these community groups that is then being syphoned off to paramilitary organisations and the funding which is actually going to victims' groups to enable them to do the real work and the real advocacy.  Perhaps this committee could do some work on that.<\/p> <p>  Equally I would like to know why Mr. McCord is saying they do not want to be in victims' groups.  Is it because they do not identify with them or they do not see them as useful?  Are they just frustrated at the roadblocks put in place by politicians and governments and have just tried to get on with their lives instead of turning everything into a crusade?<\/p> <p>  My follow up question is about what we can do to help.  If we are making demands of the Irish Government what can we do to ensure that victims' voices are heard, listened to and amplified?  Should we be looking at a new structure not currently within these agreements?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022040700002#M00400","speaker":"1570"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649286000,"counter":907,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked what should happen if these amnesties go ahead.

There is nobody there to stand beside us and say, \"Right, she needs this court case opened or investigated\".

No family should ever have to do that or sit and read inquest papers but there is no group out there to help with that.

They do not do it unless it is within a remit, and many of the victims' groups must tick boxes.  I agree with that for funding purposes and such checks.

The Ballymurphy families have been fighting for years and they should not have had to do that.  It is a classic case and it defeats any argument the British Government would put up for truth and justice and helping to move on.  There is the idea that people want closure but I do not know what closure means.  If people were convicted today for my son's murder, I still would not have closure for my son.<\/p> <p>  There is funding for victims' groups, and some of them are large groups that may be deemed nationalist or unionist.  That should not be happening.  Some of them are deemed to be close to political parties, and that should not be happening.  I do not have a problem with any victims but there is talk about equality.  If there is taxpayer funding, or if it comes from Dublin or the European Union, the employees in an organisation should be split 50-50.  There was talk of bringing the Police Service of Northern Ireland to 50-50 but people in the unionist community would have objected; the majority of others would have said it could be done.  Why should the employees of funded victims' groups not be split 50-50?  The narrative flowing from them would then be a victim narrative rather than a unionist or republican narrative.<\/p> <p>  There are groups that are linked to Sinn F&eacute;in and the Democratic Unionist Party, and that should not be happening because political labels are put on victims.  That is what happens when these political parties associate with the groups.  We can look at the funding of the employees, of which there may be five or ten in different offices.  What is the religious breakdown of those people?  Statements have come out from the groups, and without mentioning names, I can refer to one from Belfast and see it comes from such and such a group.  That should not happen.  This should be about victims.  We speak about a victim-led or victim-centred process.  There are people in the victims' group \"sector\" - that is a terrible word - who do not want change.  They want to keep it the way it is.  When funding comes, if they stick to their narrative, certain political parties will help them get funding.  That should not be happening.<\/p> <p>  We have come down here and we have insisted all along that victims' conferences be arranged in Belfast.  I have organised something like nine of them and we had a professor from Queen's University who was a member of the Green Party.  The only thing we stipulate is that no paramilitaries are allowed to attend and there should be no political speeches that lay blame on this party or that.  There must be no sectarianism.  It is an open house otherwise, and this has worked.  We have brought in young people and given them a voice, and other people do not do this.  They have their own narrative.  We have one type of narrative, and it is a victims' narrative.<\/p> <p>  We asked questions yesterday and we ask more today.  We ask the Irish Government what will happen if British Prime Minister Boris Johnson goes ahead and brings into the British Parliament this Bill and it passes.  We would like to know what the Irish Government is going to do.  There are some who ask what we would like to say.  It is very simple.  At the end of the day, it is about money for the British Government when it makes decisions about certain issues.  This is about cover-up and money.  In truth, I would like to see the Irish Government bring victims to Washington DC to sit down with the US President and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Ms Nancy Pelosi.  I have been in Washington several times, as I said, thanks to Fr. Sean McManus and the Irish National Caucus.  I would like them to listen to us and let them see that the Irish Government supports both unionist and nationalist victims.  There should be an indication that if these proposals are to be made law, there will be no trade deal between Britain and America.  It is one of the only ways to guarantee that this process will stop, that is, if it hits the pockets in London.<\/p> <p>  It is said there are people who will otherwise resort to violence but there is violence within the unionist community now.  There are guns that were supposed to be given up.  I do not hear the politicians in our community asking why the guns are still here, and groups are still being given funding.  The Ulster Volunteer Force wants &pound;10 million to go away and that is 24 years after the Good Friday Agreement.  How much longer will money be provided to gangsters?  That is all they are.  They use the term \"loyalist\" but for me that means somebody should be loyal to a country and its rules and statutes.  These people do not do that.  They are criminals.<\/p> <p>  A former policeman said to me that people talk about loyalism but why not use the term we use when we are sitting and having a pint?  They are gangsters and criminals.  Unfortunately, people are still giving them money.  We can make suggestions to politicians in Dublin but what is done might be different.  We would like to get assurances through the Good Friday Agreement and we want the Good Friday Agreement to stay.  Other people might take issue with it but our problem with it is that it has failed victims.  Within the unionist community, it has helped to ensure that gangsters still stay in our community with guns, rackets and drugs.  I believe one of the elements of the Good Friday Agreement was to seek to stop all this and for those people to go away.  There are people involved with this committee from North and South who want that to stop.<\/p> <p>  After what happened to the Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Simon Coveney, I promised people I would say the following.  I would like to see every penny stopped that goes to the UVF-Progressive Unionist Party initiative.  There is also the Action for Community Transformation initiative that has different offices.  These are fancy titles but every penny should be stopped.  Let us stop the funding for six months and see what happens if people are going to lose their jobs.  Tell that to people who initiated a bomb hoax in north Belfast when a man was coming there.  He was not an aggressive man, like the pound shop lawyer said.  I met the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and he was a gentleman to us, the same as the Taoiseach.  We met him yesterday and he stood with us.<\/p><p>We shook hands.  Again, invitations were given to come to Belfast.  I am saying this plain and simple.  I cannot be any clearer.  Stop all funding and money going to the Ulster Volunteer Force, UVF, the Progressive Unionist Party, PUP, or any loyalist group and see how long it is before they want to go back to violence once the money and funding is stopped.  They say they are doing community work.  What community work are they doing?  Their community work is about asking how much they can make from drugs this week; how much money can they take off the shops for extortion?  These are the people who are getting funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022040700002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Raymond McCord","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":916,"content":"<p>Okay.

When the Troubles were going on, when going to work you did not know whether you would be coming home.  In 1993, 97 people were killed.  That included the security forces - Catholics and Protestants.  From January to August in 1994 before the ceasefire was declared, 69 people were killed.  That was in the two years coming to the end.  They knew it was coming to the end yet people were still getting murdered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022040700002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Monaghan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649286000,"counter":919,"content":"<p>Quickly on the murders, I do not know whether politicians in Dublin are aware of this.  Since the ceasefire in 1994 between the UVF and other parties, the UVF has murdered 32 people within the unionist community.  No inquiry was called for by unionist politicians.  One was my son, Raymond.  The prosecution in one case was a double murder because one of them walked in with a sawn-off shotgun.  What other city or country in the world would have had 32 murders by groups in a ceasefire and still give them funding?  What other country in the world would have a chief constable who could keep his job with no convictions when 32 murders were carried out by an organisation that a report showed is riddled with police informants and is run by an MI5 agent?<\/p> <p>  Several years ago when I was in Dublin, former Deputy Pat Rabbitte named the chief of staff as a special branch agent in the D&aacute;il.  He was an MI5 agent but he was a state agent.  The person who runs the UVF is controlled by the state.  Other people came to Dublin and their training was paid for by Dublin.  I think it was the Dublin Government that paid them.  His own group unit was responsible for the hoax bomb in Belfast last week.  Money is coming from Dublin to give to an individual who belongs to an organisation that was involved in the bomb scare in Belfast.  That is only the tip of the iceberg.

My son's headstone has been smashed three times by agents of the state.  This is his fourth headstone.  I had access to documents all week because I have an up-and-coming court case.  I am shouting to people to get into court.  By all means, I invite members of the committee to come up and listen to it.<\/p> <p>  A document on one occasion stated that the UVF said I was a supergrass.  It hid the documents; I had to go through the courts to get some of them.  The UVF said my house should be shot up.  A brigadier - I never met him but he was over south-east Antrim - told those men to shoot up my house.  I lived on my own with my youngest son at the time.  The police at the debriefing said they could not get the manpower to do it.  Those men were afraid to shoot up my house because had I survived, I would have went looking for them.  They murdered my son; they were not going to murder another one.  I went to the police and made a complaint that when I went to the graveyard, the headstone was smashed to bits.  I went straight to the police station and made a complaint.  An hour after I left the police station, the police arrested me in case I went to somebody's house.  When I told the policewoman who did it, she asked how I found out.  I said it was the UVF.  They asked how I knew it was the UVF.  It was incredible.  It was like going back to Chicago and Al Capone.  People said Al Capone was a gangster and the cops asked how they knew he was a gangster.  Everyone knew he was a gangster by his activities.  I turned around and said to the police that I would go to his house and confront him.  They asked what I was going to do if he admitted it.  I said I would make a citizen's arrest and put him into the car.  The told me I could not use violence.  I said I would not use violence and that I would just put him into the car, and then I left.  The young lad was 15.  I took him to a football match and came home.  I was sitting there; I did not go to anybody's house, obviously, with the stress.  The next minute, there was a knock on the door and two policemen came in.  They were pleasant.  I thought they were going to give me information about the headstone being broken, being in somebody's house and all.  They rang the station and their boss told them to arrest me.<\/p><p>I was arrested and I wanted to know what I was arrested for.  The policewoman I made the complaint to was a detective sergeant.  She was new in the area and sent to me an officer who turned out to be a special branch officer.  The policewoman made a statement that I told her I was going to bring a gun to a man&rsquo;s house and shoot him.  I sat in the interview room.  It was a secure police station with sangars.  They said that I threatened to shoot a man but she let me walk out.  It was to protect the people who had not just murdered my son but who smashed his headstone.  That still continues.  These amnesties are part of that.  They do not want the truth.  They do not want the names of the agents who carried out these murders in both communities.  They can murder 32 people during a ceasefire and our unionist politicians, who are supposed to represent the people, turn a blind eye to it too.  That is what I am saying.  They do not just turn a blind eye to what they do with the funding; they turn a blind eye to what they do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022040700002#O00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Raymond McCord","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649286000,"counter":925,"content":"<p>I want to give a big welcome to Mr. McCord, Ms McIlvenny and Mr. Monaghan.

Innocent civilians have been executed with their arms tied behind their backs.  There have been horrific accounts of rape, torture and brutalisation by the powerful of ordinary vulnerable citizens in their war-torn country.  These are crimes against the Ukrainian people and these crimes are against humanity.  Those same crimes happened in Northern Ireland but that was said by Deputy Mary Lou McDonald.  What is good enough for the Ukrainian people is certainly good enough for people living on this island.  If we are demanding accountability in Ukraine, we should demand truth, justice and honesty, but the truth is not going to be easy.  It is not going to be easy for the Irish Government either because I know from living in a Border county that there are things left unsaid, undone and allowed to go on because of who people are and their connections to paramilitaries.<\/p> <p>  What was said here should shock me.  What Ms McIlvenny said about a complaint should shock us but, unfortunately, it does not because the system is broken.  The Good Friday Agreement is not working for the victims.  Mr. McCord is 100% right that it is not working for the victims.  We are going to have to review a Good Friday Agreement and see what is not implemented in it.  There may be things in the Good Friday Agreement which are not being implemented and which may be a pathway for that proper justice.  We may have to work towards changing or amending it and making people in power in Northern Ireland accountable for their actions and their inaction.

It is very important.  I will raise two things.  One is on the granularity of what Senator Currie is suggesting.  If you look at the sources of funding, and if you are really going to do this effectively, you have to look at all the sources of funding.  You have to look at Irish Government funding, European Union funding and British Government funding.  What is the totality of funding that is going into community-type or community-based - we have to put a broad spread on the titles we use here - or victim-support programmes?  Where is that coming from?  As a committee, we should be able to get that information.<\/p><p>What is the total amount of money that has gone into those organisations since the signing of the agreement?  Where has it gone?  What are the names of the groups?  What is the purpose of those groups?  What are they doing?  Then there is a cross-referencing piece with people like our guests where we can look at the different groups and ask who is there.  The Chairman is right about an audit and the right groups but it requires a step beyond.  It requires us being able to ask more about those groups.  It is the same, by the way, on the republican side.  I have certainly said this a number of times at the committee but on our trip to Belfast, it was very clear how well-supported, in terms of logistics, people and campaign support, some victims' groups were.  When we went to the WAVE Trauma Centre, as Deputy Brendan Smith rightly acknowledged, it was not that those people were alone as they were supported by that centre but there was nothing like the campaigning structure, which costs money, placed around them.  If we are to have a real analysis of that we need to be able to identify all those sources of funding.  There is also a question about other sources of funding and what the complete amount of funding to those different groups is, what proportion of it, if it is a proportion, comes from state or government funding and how else it may be funded and what that means, because it is worth acknowledging.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022040700002#P01400","speaker":"1480","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":939,"content":"<p>Of course.

I have spoken to Crusaders and am hoping to arrange before the summer an all-Ireland seven-a-side under-16 competition with teams from the South and teams from Northern Ireland, to be played in Belfast between Crusaders' ground, which is in a unionist area, and Cliftonville, which is in a nationalist area of north Belfast.  I hope it will be a North-South final.  We are in the process too of organising an international victims' conference.  We hope that will be in September but I have to get the dates sorted.  We are to get the Americans and the Cathaoirleach, Senator Daly, is helping us with that too.

The committee is meeting to discuss the draft river basin management plan for Ireland 2022-2027.  The public consideration period on that has just finished.  It is the third river basin management plan to be produced for Ireland.  We are joined in the room by Dr. Matt Crowe, chairperson, Mr. D&oacute;nal Purcell, senior executive officer, and Dr. Triona McGrath, research lead, the Water Forum; and Professor Frank O'Mara, Mr. Noel Meehan and Mr. Eddie Burgess, Teagasc.  Online, we are joined over Teams by Dr. Elaine McGoff, natural environment officer, and Ms Phoebe Duvall, planning and environmental policy officer, An Taisce; and Mr. Mark Boyden, cathaoirleach, and Ms Sin&eacute;ad O'Brien, co-ordinator, Sustainable Water Network, SWAN.  Members have been circulated with the opening statements and briefings from our expert witnesses.<\/p> <p>  I will read a note on privilege.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of Leinster House in order to participate in public meetings.  Those attending remotely from within the Leinster House complex are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their contributions to today's meeting.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  For witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House complex, there are some limitations on parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a person physically present in the complex.  Members and witnesses are expected not to abuse the privilege they enjoy and it is my duty as Chair to ensure it is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  Members and witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  <\/p> <p>  We also invited the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, to the meeting but its representatives were unable to attend at this time.  I hoped they would be able to frame or outline the river basin management plans.  I will read my outline.  I put this together quite quickly so if there are mistakes in it, please feel free to correct me.  <\/p> <p>  The river basin management plans are a key component of how we implement the water framework directive, which was adopted by member states across the EU in 2000.  It requires that all waters, rivers, lakes, groundwaters, estuaries, coastal waters, canals and reservoirs are protected and measures put in place to ensure the quality of these waters is restored to \"good\" status by 2027 at the latest, with some exceptions.<\/p><p>The directive governs all activities that may impact this objective or the quality or quantity of water.  The directive requires an integrated approach across all sectors, including agriculture, industry, the spatial planning policy, sustainable management and protection of water resources.  It impacts on and is equally impacted by a diverse range of environmental plans and regulations.  The river basin management plan sets out the measures necessary to protect and improve the quality of our waters.  These plans are prepared in six-year cycles, during which a programme of measures must be implemented to achieve water quality objectives.  The objective is linked to and reinforces other EU environmental directives, including directives relating to the protection of diversity, the specific uses of water, such as the drinking water, bathing water and urban wastewater directives, and directives concerned with the regulation of activities to protect the environment.  The nitrates directive also forms an integral part of the water framework directive and is key for the protection of water against agricultural pressures.  The committee recently received the statutory instrument regulation relating to the nitrates directive.<\/p><p> River basin management plans work on a catchment basis.  In Ireland, the development and implementation of the river basin management plan is achieved through an integrated catchment management approach and uses the catchments, sub-catchments and water bodies as the functional areas and units of the plan.  Using catchments, sub-catchments and water bodies to examine the pressures on our water resources at an appropriate scale allows us to effectively manage our waters.  It is also used as a means to bring together all public bodies, communities and businesses that have a connection to these catchments.  The process involves gathering the best available information and data to understand the catchment, looking at all the uses of water, whether drinking, agricultural, industrial or recreational, and the ecosystems that depend on that water to survive.  It also involves engaging local communities and involving them in the management of the catchment and adopting appropriate measures to ensure activities that represent a significant threat to water resources are effectively managed.<\/p><p> Ireland prepares a river basin management plan every six years, which sets targets to address water quality issues, including the protection, improvement and sustainable management of the water environment.  This is the third plan.  Further cycles every six years will involve ongoing protection of water bodies.  The public participation process is an integral part of the river basin management planning process.  In accordance with the requirements of the directive, the Department has engaged in public consultation at three critical stages in the river basin management plan.  These include outlining the draft timetable, consultation for development of the river basin management plans, and identification of significant water management issues to be addressed in the plans.  Today, our committee is meeting to consider how we can participate and contribute to that consultation.  I thank the expert witnesses who have joined us today to assist us with our scrutiny of the draft river basin management plan.  Some of the witnesses might recognise some of that text, because it was extracted from the draft plan as produced.  I wanted to put it on the record.<\/p><p> I invite Dr. Crowe to make the opening statement on behalf of the Water Forum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022040700002#A00200","speaker":"1626","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649286000,"counter":971,"content":"<p>We are delighted to be here to talk to the committee about the draft river basin management plan.  I am the chair of the Water Forum.  I was appointed in the last couple of months.  I am here with Mr. D&oacute;nal Purcell and Dr. Triona McGrath, who are members of the secretariat that supports the forum.<\/p> <p>  The forum was established on a statutory basis in 2018 to provide stakeholder input and advice to policy development.  There are 25 members, representing a broad range of sectors and views on water issues.  The forum has statutory advisory roles relating to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Irish Water, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities and the Water Policy Advisory Committee.  I acknowledge the previous chair of the Water Forum, Tom Collins, for his many years of public service in matters relating to water, Connie Rochford for chairing the forum between Tom leaving and my recent appointment, and Barry Dean from the National Federation of Group Water Schemes for chairing the forum's water services committee.  I thank all the members, past and present, for their contributions, time and public service, and the forum's secretariat for all its support.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the hearings today, we welcome that the committee is taking such an interest in the draft river basin management plan.  The next six years will be crucial.  This is the third cycle.  The water framework directive was agreed more than 20 years ago.  Two six-year cycles have already taken place in that period.  Many problems remain to be solved.  Over the next six years, we need to step up the level of ambition and rate of progress and start to see radical improvements in water quality, management of our precious water resources, and in the area of water services.  Implementation is key.  We can have a great plan, but if it is not implemented, it means nothing in the longer term.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the main recommendations of the forum.  The document we prepared runs to nearly 60 pages, with 103 recommendations altogether.  The committee will be glad to hear that I will not go through them all today.  They represent the agreed position of members following much engagement with the Department, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Local Authority Waters Programme, and the agricultural sustainability support and advisory programme, which is here today too, and many other organisations.  They cover all the relevant areas, including governance, monitoring, evaluation, financing, public participation, and the key pressures on water.  In the next minute or two, I will refer to an outcomes-based approach, governance and finance, public participation, and pressures.  We are delighted to get into more detail during the discussion.<\/p> <p>  We recommend an outcomes-based approach with targeted measures, metrics and key performance indicators for every water body in Ireland.  There are about 4,500 in total.  Each water body either needs to be protected, if already of good status, or improved if at poor or moderate status.  Detail is provided in the submission about how this could be designed.  The forum is happy to engage with whoever it needs to about the development of such an approach.<\/p> <p>  Regarding governance and financing, we recommend a number of reforms to governance structures to help to strengthen the overall governance framework.  These include the inclusion of a full-time project management secretariat, more structured engagement between the three governance tiers, and opportunities for engagement between the forum and each tier.  We also recommend quickly establishing the proposed interdepartmental group to develop a comprehensive financial strategy to support implementation of climate, water and biodiversity objectives in an integrated and joined-up fashion.  I hope, during the course of the hearing, that we get to talk about the multiple benefits issue, with water, climate and nature being interconnected.<\/p> <p>  We recommend a new national approach to meaningful public participation to help to radically improve how the public participates in the implementation of the water framework directive, leading to a vision and action plan for meaningful public participation in each of the 46 catchment areas in Ireland.  The forum can assist in the development and implementation of such an approach.  As I have learned in the course of the two months I have been involved in the forum, it has a lot of expertise relating to public participation and engagement.  We can draw on that over the next six years.<\/p> <p>  We have sections about all the pressures in the detailed submission.  We want to make a couple of general points first.  We need much better alignment of sectoral policies and strategies with the objectives of the water framework directive across all sectors that can have either a negative or positive impact on water.  Many sectoral activities, such as new developments, flood relief works, and so on, also need robust water framework assessments to ensure they do not have a negative impact on water.  Looking at the history of this, it has taken Ireland a long time to figure out how to work through the legislation so that a directive such as the water framework directive appears regularly when looking at new planning developments and so on.<\/p><p>That is something that we need to deal with in the course of the next plan.  There is much to be done, but we are building on a lot of progress, in particular in the most recent truncated cycle, which was just for a four-year period.  I again thank the committee members for inviting us here.  We are very happy to answer any questions they may have and to provide any additional follow-up information we might be able to give to the committee from the forum while it is carrying out its deliberations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022040700002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Matthew Crowe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":973,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Crowe.

We have a solemn duty to faithfully convey these opinions and concerns from contributors, to ensure their voices are heard and are present at the table.<\/p> <p>  The value of clean, healthy waters is clear, and even more so as we enter a time of uncertain rainfall and other influences induced by climate change.  Absolutely everything depends upon our achieving high status waters - from the health of our people, to our stewardship of biodiversity, and extending to the value of our agricultural produce.  That is by way of introduction.

The committee will have received the full submission in separate correspondence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022040700002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Boyden"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649286000,"counter":975,"content":"<p>First, I wish to make a few introductory remarks about the current state of our water and I will then present a synopsis of the six key issues SWAN has identified.  A little like the Water Forum, we have a lot of issues, but we have just selected our top issues to present to the committee today.<\/p> <p>  Despite the impression of Ireland as clean and green globally, more than half of our rivers, lakes and estuaries are currently unhealthy.  That means they are failing water framework directive status.  Nitrate and phosphate pollution is at an unsatisfactory level and it has increased significantly since 2013, and we have lost a shocking 96% of our most pristine rivers in the past 30 years.  In addition, more recently, an interim assessment of the previous river basin management plan reveals that only two out of ten expected outcomes of the plan have been achieved.<\/p> <p>  While SWAN very much commends the work of officials in the Department's water advisory unit, staff in the local authority waters programme and in the excellent EPA catchments unit, we believe all of this good work has been negated by conflicting policy in other areas, in particular a lack of investment and unsustainable land use, which is driving nutrients to levels that are unsustainable for the environment and to the detriment of Ireland and ultimately its people.<\/p> <p>  I will give committee members a quick flavour of our key issues, some of which are shared with the Water Forum.  The first one is the lack of ambition and specific actions in the plan.  Our overarching message to the committee today is that there is a lack of ambition in the plan and it falls far short of what is required.  It lacks targeted actions to bring all of our water bodies up to good status, which is required by the water framework directive, and is not a coherent response to the directive.  Neither is it in line with the programme for Government commitment on the directive.  The continuing decline in water quality demonstrates that the current policy is not working.  That leads to our first recommendation which is that the ambition of the plan must be in line with the directive and it must include a full set of targeted, specific measures necessary to bring every water body up to good status by 2027, as required by the directive.  We must do that if we are to avoid the opprobrium of the EU and our own citizens.<\/p> <p>  The second issue to which we want to draw the committee's attention is water governance.  Despite some new administrative structures that we might discuss later, water management remains fragmented and opaque and there is no central body or agency responsible for implementation of the previous or current plans.  This was also highlighted by the Institute of Public Administration in a review last year.  Our recommendation in this regard is that we need to establish an appropriately resourced river basin management plan project and management secretariat that is responsible for oversight, co-ordination and monitoring of the plan.<\/p> <p>  Our third recommendation on public participation is closely related to this.  While we welcome the establishment of the national Water Forum, of which I am very happy to be a member, and the work of community water officers, in addition to the commitment to develop 46 catchment plans, the river basin management plan does not have a commitment that the public will be involved in their development.  Volunteer-run catchment groups such as the Rivers Trust are not resourced in the way they need to be if they are to play the vital role envisaged for them by the State.  We recommend that the public must be involved in the development of plans for the 46 catchments around the country and that they need to be resourced adequately to do that in order to secure effective public engagement.  This needs to be facilitated by a team of 46 catchment water officers, as opposed to the 13 we have now.<\/p> <p>  As we all know, agriculture has the most significant impact on our waters, but since colleagues from An Taisce will be dealing specifically with that, I will not speak any more about it and I will move on to urban waste water.  The draft plan is far too weak on the significant impact of urban waste discharges on the environment.  This is the main source of pollution in 208 water bodies, yet the proposed plan does not set out measures to fix these by the deadline.  We recommend that Irish Water's capital investment plan must include specific work and actions to address pollution in those 208 water bodies that are polluted by sewage.  It must also set out transparently where this waste water pollution is happening; the waste water plant or system causing it; and where there is and, critically, where there is not - a plan of action to address this, with a timeline.<\/p> <p>  The second last issue to which I draw the attention of the committee is forestry.  Again, there are no new measures in the plan, targeted or otherwise, to address the impact of forestry, despite the fact that it is causing pollution in 233 water bodies, including in many of the pristine water bodies we spoke of earlier.  Instead, the plan relies on the roll-out and uptake of current initiatives such as the licensing system, with no link made to how that will restore degraded waters.  The additional risk posed by increased national climate change targets for forestry is not addressed in the plan.  We recommend that all forestry operations must be subject to a water framework directive-specific assessment, and they must contain site-specific stipulations for water protection, taking into account the cumulative impacts of multiple plantations in a catchment.  We also need sensitivity mapping to identify the most vulnerable catchments, so that as forestry is rolled out in the coming years we ensure that only the right tree is planted in the right place.<\/p> <p>  The final point relates to physical modifications to our waters.  This poses the second biggest pressure to inland waterways, with channelisation having the most impact due to the significant disturbance and damage to the ecology caused by in-stream dredging and clearance activities, including siltation, disturbance of spawning beds, changes in water quality and disconnecting rivers from their floodplains and wetlands.  This is in clear contravention of the water framework directive, which mandated that we should have had regulations in place since 2012 for these activities.  Therefore, we welcome the proposal in the plan that there will be new legislation and new water and planning guidelines.<\/p><p>With all due regard to community safety, this new legislation must include a WFD-specific assessment in advance of interventions such as dredging, drainage and flood protection.  Projects must achieve WFD compliance and there must be an urgent assessment of catchment-scale soft options which maximise upstream attenuation, as part of sustainable flood management.  We are also calling for a prohibition on wetland drainage and commitment to a national river and wetland restoration programme.  I thank the members for their attention.  We hope the committee may wish to play a role in securing a stronger and more ambitious plan that reverses pollution and ensures the security of clean and safe water for people, nature and the economy in these deeply uncertain times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022040700002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Sin&eacute;ad O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":977,"content":"<p>I invite one of the representatives of Teagasc to make its opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022040700002#D00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649286000,"counter":978,"content":"<p>I would like to thank the Chairman and the members of the committee for the invitation to attend the meeting today.  I will introduce our team.  I am the director of Teagasc, and with me are Mr. Eddie Burgess, specialist advisor to the agricultural catchments programme and Mr. Noel Meehan, manager of the agricultural sustainability support and advisory programme.  Water quality and, in particular, minimising the impact of agriculture has been a priority area for Teagasc for many years.  We have a large body of water quality research that is largely centred around the agricultural catchments programme, ACP, which started in 2008 and is funded by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  In addition to our core advisory activities which provide general advice on water quality, we have a dedicated agricultural sustainability support and advisory programme, ASSAP, which works with farmers in a free and confidential advisory service to help improve water quality.<\/p> <p>  The ACP operates in six small agriculturally-dominated catchment areas selected to represent different farming systems and soil types.  The support and co-operation of 300 farmers in these catchment areas allows Teagasc to monitor soils, weather, farming practice, ground water and surface water.  The programme also evaluates economic performance and agricultural productivity on these farms.  By building up this information over the years, we learn how farming influences water quality and how the regulations, namely, the nitrates directive and its derogation, impact on farming.  The high resolution monitoring of the ACP, which has been done every ten minutes, continuously since 2008, has given an in-depth understanding of the processes that influence water quality from when it falls as rain on farmland to when it leaves a catchment area in our streams.  Teagasc's ACP research contributes significantly to Ireland's annual EU reporting on the nitrates derogation and provides a scientific basis to Teagasc's submission for any review of Ireland's nitrates directive national action programme.<\/p> <p>  The ASSAP was established as part of the River Basin Management Plan 2018-2021.  It is a collaborative programme and is funded by the Department of Housing Local Government and Heritage, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and Dairy industry Ireland, DII.  The ASSAP provides a free and confidential advisory service for farmers in the 190 priority areas for action located throughout the country.  The aim of the ASSAP is to provide farmers with advice focused on the prevention of contaminant losses to waters with a view to attaining water framework directive water quality targets.  The advisory service is provided by Teagasc and the dairy processing co-ops.  Currently, Teagasc provides 20 advisers and the dairy processing co-ops provide 13 advisers.  The dairy processing co-ops have committed to providing an additional five advisers to the programme in 2022.  The ASSAP is designed to work closely with farmers in each priority area for action, PAA.  The local authority waters programme, LAWPRO, provides the science that identifies what is impacting water quality - nutrients, sediment, pesticides, pathogens and toxic substances - and where this occurs in each PAA.  The ASSAP advisers then contact the relevant farmers and offer to visit and assess the farm for any issues that may be impacting water quality. Advisers assess the farm across three areas: farmyard management and practices; land management, including critical source areas, CSAs; and nutrient management practices.  At the end of the visit the adviser and farmer will agree on where the farmer should focus improvements or actions, and identify the right measure in the right place to help prevent contaminants from entering water.  To date, the ASSAP programme advisers have visited a total of 2,829 farms, and 553 follow-up farm visits have been also completed.  Farmer engagement is very strong, with 95% of farmers contacted availing of the ASSAP service, and agreement to implement recommended measures at 93%.  More than 14,500 issues have been identified by advisers on farms, an average of five per farm, and 44% have been deemed to be high-risk issues.<\/p> <p>  For water quality improvements to be realised through ASSAP interventions, there needs to be a high level of implementation of the mitigation actions recommended by advisers, and the actions must continually be implemented into the future.  Currently, there is variation in the level of implementation of mitigation actions by farmers across the issues identified.  Data from the ASSAP interim report for 2020 showed that the level of implementation of measures is positive.  On average, 51% of the mitigation actions recommended are commenced, completed or being implemented on an ongoing basis. The non-implementation of actions, where farmers have not started or are not proceeding, is averaged at 37%, with the remaining 12% made up of actions not assigned any implementation status.  Although farmers' willingness to take on mitigation actions and the implementation of measures is positive, there is a need for a greater level of implementation of actions across all issues for water quality improvements to occur.  Further support for the farmers from the ASSAP advisers is required to help ensure the right measure is used in the right place on farms.  We are happy to expand on any aspect of our work, including the ASSAP and the ACP, during the meeting.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022040700002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Frank O'Mara"},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":979,"content":"<p>I invite Dr. McGoff to make the opening statement on behalf of An Taisce.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022040700002#D00400","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649286000,"counter":980,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to present here today.  I am Dr. Elaine McGoff.  I am the natural environment officer with An Taisce.  I have a PhD in freshwater ecology.  I am joined by my colleague, Ms Phoebe Duvall.  I wish to state at the outset that An Taisce supports all of the points and recommendations that were raised by SWAN, but I will focus on agriculture, given that it is the most significant pressure on water quality.  I want to address the agricultural measures in the draft river basin management plan, RBMP, and to highlight the critical role that the nitrates action programme, NAP, and good agricultural practice, GAP, regulations play in that.  This is the third river basin management plan, and it comes in the midst of an ever-worsening water quality crisis - a crisis that is leading to loss of nature, swimming bans and drinking water contamination.  There are a number of catchments in the south and south-east, such as the Barrow, the Slaney and the Lee, which are of particular concern in regard to nitrate pollution from agriculture.  More than one third of all river site have increasing levels of nitrate pollution.  Clearly, radical changes are necessary in the management of nitrogen inputs to agricultural land to comply with the water framework directive.<\/p> <p>  On the agricultural measures proposed in the river basin management plan, the RBMP relies heavily on the measures proposed in the nitrates action programme and the good agricultural practice regulations.  Beyond that, the other measures proposed are voluntary, somewhat vague, not time-tabled or targeted.  This is why the reliance on the measures in the NAP is absolutely critical.  If they fail, then the largest pressure on water quality will not be adequately addressed.  In reality, if they fail, things will get significantly worse.  With that in mind, it should be of grave concern that the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage itself has acknowledged that the previous NAP failed because of agricultural industry expansion and poor compliance.  To put numbers on that, the dairy herd has increased by approximately 50% since 2010, and artificial fertiliser import has increased by almost 40% in a similar timeframe.  This pressure was clearly recognised in the documentation which accompanied the NAP, with the strategic environmental assessment stating: \"...reduced stocking rates...offers greater levels of protection to the natural environment and is recommended...\"  It went on to state that \"In a number of cases there is a clear driver from the natural environment for change...but this change has not been adopted within the draft NAP for economic reasons.\"  It is important to note that economics does not come into the nitrates directive, and cannot lawfully be used as an excuse to undermine environmental protection.<\/p><p> We acknowledge some additional measures have been added to the nitrates action programme that will partially address nitrate pollution but, in our view, they are inadequate to tackle it properly.  I will give three examples, the first of which relates to the direct nitrate load onto grazing land.  Teagasc was asked to conduct some modelling of various scenarios to inform policy decisions to reduce nitrate runoff from agriculture.  One of the main drivers that was identified was that cattle urine deposited directly onto fields leads to more than 62% of nitrate loss.  It is the main driver of nitrate loss, far above artificial fertiliser and slurry, yet no mitigation for this is provided for in the NAP or GAP regulations.  Why is this?<\/p><p> The second measure relates to fertiliser reductions.  The nitrates action programme proposes reducing artificial fertiliser loads by up to 15%.  While that is welcome, EPA data indicate that in some catchments in the south and the south east, a 50%-plus reduction in nitrogen load will be necessary to meet water quality standards.  This raises the question as to what percentage reduction in fertiliser is required to protect water quality in these catchments, and why Teagasc did not model this when it clearly has the capacity.<\/p><p> The third issue to be aware of is compliance.  Compliance with the good agricultural practice regulations is recognised by all parties as being low and it has been acknowledged by the Department that fixing it is a key part of addressing water quality declines.  However, the NAP does not provide any new enforcement measures for the relevant authorities and proposes open-ended measures such as reviews of local authority capacity and \"potentially&rsquo;\" targeting high-risk areas.  How can compliance be adequately addressed without tangible, time-tabled measures?<\/p><p> Having laid out the problems, I will propose some recommendations for how agricultural water pollution could be addressed via the river basin management plan.  The NAP has been finalised, so we now need to look to the river basin management plan to provide some additional safeguards.  The first recommendation is for a catchment or waterbody-based approach.  Each waterbody will have only a certain carrying capacity for nutrients, and it is time we took that kind of an approach and figured out what are those thresholds.  The second recommendation relates to introducing environmental risk assessments for all intensive farms, including derogation farms, through a permitting or licensing system similar to that by which pig and poultry farms need to abide.  Intensification should be permitted only if it can be demonstrated it will not impact on water quality.  Third, for existing farms deemed to be a risk, regulatory, voluntary and combined measures should be implemented, including through herd reductions, with compensatory measures put in place to support this where necessary.  Most important, we need a solid evidence base to show the measures farmers are putting in place are going to work.  We know from the EPA what reductions need to happen and where, while Teagasc can model how we should achieve those reductions.  Why has that link not been made?  Why are we not joining the dots?<\/p><p> A CSO study last year found 79% of people surveyed put water pollution as their top environmental concern, above all else.  The public are not being louder about this because water pollution is often invisible.  It is only a matter of time, however, before the public become aware of the scale of the problem we are facing with our water quality, and then they will be looking for answers as to why this was allowed to happen.  This is a key opportunity for us to turn things around.  The science could not be clearer: we need an ambitious and far-reaching river basin management plan to address this.  As I demonstrated, it is not enough to rely on the inadequate nitrates action programme.  The river basin management plan we have seen is sorely lacking in ambition and we would very much like it to be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022040700002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Elaine McGoff","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":982,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McGoff.

Through the work of LAWPRO, the local authorities' water programme, local catchment groups and rivers trusts have been established and have done good work in raising awareness, but the next step is to get those groups actively involved in making decisions regarding the management of their waters.  Some areas have very active groups, such as Cork Environmental Forum, which is very active in regard to water.  There is a question as to who will develop these 46 catchment plans, and I hope we will get to have a discussion about the confusing governance as well.<\/p> <p>  When those catchment plans are being developed, local communities have to be actively involved in their development.  To do that, there needs to be at least one community water officer for each of those areas and they need to work closely with the communities, garnering their views and knitting them in to the development of the plan.  Parallel to that, those local groups have to be well resourced.  We have seen in the river basin management plan that the Government and the Department see an intrinsic role for them, but there is very little resourcing.  Most of these community groups are voluntary, with perhaps one or two of them employing someone part time, yet they are expected to carry out river surveys and citizen surveys, river clean-ups and so on.  We recommend, therefore, that all those catchment groups and rivers trusts should be funded with at least one staff member who can co-ordinate their input into the development of those plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022040700002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Sin&eacute;ad O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":987,"content":"<p>Much of the focus earlier was on rural rivers and wetlands but it is important also to examine urban areas.

There needs to be somebody, such as a catchment manager, who will monitor the multiple impacts on the river and come up with a plan, as well as involve the local community.  That is why we recommend there needs to be 46 community water officers.  If somebody is going for a walk near the Glen and sees green slime or smells foul odours, he or she will be able to get in touch with the community water officer, who, in the model we envisage, will be in charge of working out whom to get in touch with, whether that is the environment section in Cork City Council or, if somebody is using a digger where he or she should not be, the community water officer might decide the person should get in touch with the EPA.<\/p><p>They form that key liaison point, which we do not have at the moment.

I mentioned in my opening statement that there are about 4,500 water bodies in Ireland.  If you break up the whole country there are 46 catchments and the River Lee would be an example of one of the large catchment areas.  They are subdivided into sub-catchments and there are about 600 of them in the country altogether.  You are getting more and more down into the local as you go from national down through the catchments.  The point about the catchment approach is you are trying to develop this three-dimensional picture of what is going on in an area and the example of the park the Deputy mentioned is replicated everywhere.  I lived in Wexford and I could think of places there where there are similar issues.  The problem is these issues are never easy to solve because there could be missed connections going in and there could be sewage or overflows.<\/p> <p>  We need to have these ways of bringing everybody together.  When I say \"everybody\" I mean the forces of the State, including: the local authorities; LAWPRO, which is an entity of the local authorities that has become specialist in the area of water quality and management; and the local communities.  This public participation is a huge challenge and there are no easy answers to it.  That is why the forum has raised it as such a big issue.  It is one of the three big issues we have mentioned.  Over the next six years, in the third river basin management plan there is a chance to focus in on that public participation and to work out how to do it better.  I do not know what the answers to it are.  I have been a members of the Tidy Towns committee in Wexford and stuff like that and it is usually the same people who gather to do things in local areas.  It is not easy but it is worth trying to fix.<\/p> <p>  If you take, for example, the area the Deputy mentioned in Cork, the chances are that there are things that can be done that will improve water quality, nature and biodiversity in the area.  Those actions might have benefits for climate change and there could be something to do with flood management going on there as well.  There is all that connectivity which you can only get if a lot of local people are involved because they tend to know the place better.  It is the same with farming as well because farmers know their farms better than anybody.  If you do not talk to the farmer you will not really understand what is going on there either.  That is another form of local engagement and participation that we can evolve and develop to a much higher level over the next six years than we have up to now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022040700002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Matthew Crowe"},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":991,"content":"<p>I ask the Chairman to give me a small bit of leeway because I will have to leave later.  There was one other issue, namely, dumping into our lakes, streams and waterways.  It is mentioned in the report but there are no specific actions mentioned.

There are ESB cables on these big wheels and one of them came down the River Bride and got stuck under the bridge in Blackpool.  It was there for a while and then there were severe rains.  Everything was brushed down and got caught and then the whole place flooded.  As a consequence none of the businesses there can get insurance because there is a flood risk.  When I was a councillor on Cork City Council at the time it was a question of who manages the streams and waterways and who is responsible.  There are some good community groups out there that do fabulous voluntary work and it is brilliant that people get involved in their communities.  It ties up communities, especially when a lot of communities would have had home ownership or people in social housing one time whereas nowadays a lot of people are renting and moving into communities.  Being involved in community clean-ups and managing waterways is good but who has the responsibility from a Government point of view to ensure they are managed and maintained and that work is done with the community?

I thank the witnesses.  I want to declare that I am on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine as well.  The Water Forum, SWAN and An Taisce came with firm recommendations and I want to acknowledge that.  It is always great when groups have concerns but also come up with recommendations.  That is always positive and helpful.<\/p> <p>  I will start with Teagasc and I would have some concerns about its opening statement.  There was a key line in the statement from the Water Forum and which stated: \"Emphasis will also need to be placed on building relationships with landowners (farmers, peatlands, forestry), facilitating training and knowledge exchange.\"  That was apt and the issue everyone has talked about is partnership, consultation, understanding, public engagement and trust and all of that is important.  I see a role for Teagasc in all of that and the witnesses will see that themselves.  I understand where Teagasc is coming from, I am a great supporter of it and I studied Teagasc courses as Teagasc has an educational role.  There is an issue that many farmers are not necessarily conscious of, namely, their contribution to pollution.  Our guests from Teagasc talked about percentages but we did not hear numbers.  There are 20 Teagasc asset advisers and there are some from the dairy private sector.  Why would there not be?  They have a vested interest in that, which is not to be critical of them but Teagasc is a State agency and it talks about the farmers engaging.  I would like to drill down into numbers more.  I am not saying the witnesses will have that detail today but they might be in a position to come back to the committee in a further written supplementary submission.  We need to know more about this.<\/p> <p>  Why are people not engaging?  It ties in with An Taisce, which also made a good submission and it has made recommendations.  An Taisce's opening statement states: \"Most importantly, we need a solid evidence base that the measures farmers are putting in place are going to work.\"  With all due respect, I was a bit disappointed in Teagasc's presentation.  I am not saying it is conflicted but it works closely with farmers and promotes them and maybe it felt constrained in all of that.  We have pathogens, fertilisers, herbicides and nutrient management plans and we have a lot of challenges in agriculture.  It is not done deliberately but there has to be knowledge transfer, education, training, supports and encouragement.  I am not too sure whether Teagasc needs more advisers out there engaging.  On the whole farmers want to do the business but there is always a cost factor and it is always about production and the bottom line.  That is not to be critical of anyone.  I genuinely believe the farming community wants to engage and there are different levels and degrees of knowledge, etc.  I would like to hear more from Teagasc at a future date.  That is to be helpful, not negative.<\/p> <p>  Our guests from SWAN talked about the issues of engagement.<\/p><p>One of its recommendations is that the public must be involved in the development of the plans for local water, so it might talk about that.<\/p><p> I am very taken with An Taisce&rsquo;s submission.  Dr. McGoff might just dwell on the issue of what she thinks is the best way to measure this.  We must remember the farming community feels under pressure and feels it is being knocked in everything.  We have to work in a strategic, communicative and participative way.  Dr. McGoff might just comment individually on those points.<\/p><p> As I said, my real ask today is that Teagasc would come up with much more detail on its engagement and how it can address this.

They are jumping through the hoops that they are being asked jump through.  However, the problem is that they are not the right hoops and will not get us where we need to get to.  The problem is that agricultural policy to date has been focused on maintaining business as usual in the model that we already have in place.  We need to step back and consider whether it is the right model.  Looking at what is happening with the Ukraine situation now, where we have serious problems getting enough fertiliser and importing fodder, it exposes how vulnerable our agricultural model is to shocks in international trade routes.  This leaves our farmers very vulnerable and in a very insecure situation.  We would like to see a change in approach to a much more diverse agricultural model, where farmers are supported to farm in all sorts of different ways and grow different types of crops and grow food for human consumption.  That very much will need the farmers at the table.  It will need numerous parties at the table to figure out how we get to where we need to get to.  It cannot just be a top-down or bottom-up approach as we need Government supports.  We would like to see everybody sit down at the table to honestly assess the situation - we are lacking a lot of honesty at the moment &ndash; and say this is where we need to go, identify the roadblocks and figure out how to get past them.

I have spoken to a number of farmers who have engaged with the programme and have found it hugely helpful.  This is very much the route that we need to go down.

The way the ASSAP was originally structured is the way that is going at the minute.

The Deputy is asking if there is a protect function, which is the phrase that would be used by the EPA and perhaps it is part of the river basin management plan as well.  With the protect function the idea is that one would have a discussion with farmers before issues manifest themselves in the river or stream and get things fixed prior to the impact that might be there.  That is the question the Deputy is asking.  Currently, our role in ASSAP is not that role.  We have 20 Teagasc and 13 co-operative advisers, which will be increasing to 18.  We have 33 advisers at present, but that will increase to 38.  Our role is based on the restore function.  LAWPRO identifies where the problems are and we try to work with the farmers in collaboration to try to improve the water quality.  That is our role at present.<\/p><p> As an aside, we had an assessment of the ASSAP carried out by an expert panel last September.  The current chair of the Water Forum was part of that expert group.  One of the recommendations from the expert group was to set down and project forward what the role of ASSAP will be into the future.  That is a job for the joint funding Departments, to have a discussion on that in consultation with stakeholders.

The second cycle was truncated.  It was really a four-year cycle because it took Ireland longer to get the plan together than other countries in Europe for a variety of reasons.  The focus for the second cycle was very much on restore.  The plan was constructed in a way that what are called the basic measures would deal with the protect bit and then the additional measures, such as the creation of LAWPRO, ASSAP and new things, would deal with the restore bit.  What has happened is that while there is evidence from the most recent EPA reports that there are improvements happening in the areas for action, where a focus from LAWPRO and ASSAP is taking place and a number of water bodies are improving, unfortunately, there are also a number of water bodies in other places that are deteriorating.  That is why the protect piece is so important for the third cycle.  Essentially, the protect needs to be considered on an equal footing to restore.  If it is not, the risk is that we will put lots of resources into the restore bit and probably be very successful in doing that, but, meanwhile, in other catchments water quality will deteriorate and, essentially, we end up in the same place overall.<\/p> <p>  All that can be catered for by proper integrated catchment management, which the country is learning how to do far better than it would have been able to do six years ago or so.  There is a lot of hope that this can be resolved.  When I mentioned the outcome-based approach at the start, which the Water Forum has done a great deal of thinking about over the last few months, the point is that every water body needs an objective for the next six years.  That objective is either to keep it good quality if it is already at good quality, which is the protect bit, or to restore it if it is at bad, moderate or poor status currently.  That is a big job, but that part of it is fairly simple in terms of just having a concept in one's head about what the scale of the challenge is.  If we do not do that, I guarantee that six years hence there will be continued deterioration of the waters that are currently at good quality.  Some of them will continue to deteriorate.  It is something that is particularly important for the design of this plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022040700002#H01200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Matthew Crowe"},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":1015,"content":"<p>Mr. Meehan wants to come in on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022040700002#H01300","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649286000,"counter":1016,"content":"<p>I will add to Dr. Crowe's comments.

Dr. Crowe spoke about there being 4,500 waterbodies.  It is such an enormous task when it is put like that, bearing in mind the large number of stakeholders for each of those bodies and the fact that each body will require objectives, whether that is to protect or restore.  There needs to be some level of an action plan for every waterbody, which is a mammoth task.  It is because of the strength of our stakeholders and of organisations such as our guests' that this is not as daunting a task as it would otherwise be.<\/p><p> I commend the Water Forum on its very comprehensive and well thought-out submission.  I liked the way its representatives talked about an outcome-based approach and went through some practical measures that could be implemented.  There was a reference to governance and they spoke about the pressure in regard to training and engagement with landowners.  Dr. O'Mara of Teagasc gave a rundown of the agricultural sustainability support advisory  project.  I have to admit, I did not know much about this but it was so encouraging to hear about the level of outreach to farmers that is happening, with free and confidential advice to help them improve water quality and minimise the impact on our waterbodies.  Nevertheless, I am concerned about that one third of farmers who are non-compliant, which he mentioned.  I appreciate he dealt with this in response to what Deputy Flaherty asked, and that it is not Teagasc's jurisdiction to enforce this, but how can Teagasc, the Government or whatever stakeholder he considers most appropriate not only incentivise compliance on those matters but also deliver it?  We need compliance across the board.<\/p><p> One of the interesting points in the SWAN submission related to forestry, which, of course, is relevant to and intertwined with the issues of water basins and waterbodies.

The Deputy hit the nail on the head with her question about how we can ensure implementation.  I too was struck by the figure of 37% of farmers who are not implementing the measures.  This comes back to the recommendation both SWAN and the Water Forum are making, namely, that we need a centralised unit to oversee implementation.  At the moment, there are some measures under forestry and measures ASSAP is implementing, but nobody is overseeing them and matching up the measures to results and targets.<\/p> <p>  We recommend a catchment-based approach, whereby a manager in each of the 46 catchment areas would oversee the implementation.  Second, as was recommended last year by the Institute of Public Administration, there should be a river basin management plan secretariat within the Department that would examine the targets in the river basin management plan, plans that SWAN hopes will be more ambitious than they are currently are, and track and assess implementation as we go.  In that way, we can resolve questions such as the Deputy's about why only two thirds of farmers are implementing measures, what the barriers are to that and how we can address them, and whether they can be supported.  For example, perhaps some farmers are just not compliant and it is an enforcement issue.  A central unit could address all those issues.<\/p> <p>  I will not take up much more time but might give a flavour for how complex this is.  At the moment, operational groups in each region look at these various issues, such as forestry and agriculture in all the catchments in a region.  Under them, there are regional operational groups, and there is also the water policy advisory committee at the highest, assistant secretary level.  Under that, there is the national catchment management group, and under that again, the national implementation group.  All the groups are doing good work, although some of them do not talk to one another.  They are supposed to engage with the national Water Forum but they are not adequately engaging with us.  It is very fragmented and also quite opaque.   Our clear recommendation is that we need that central unit, within the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, to oversee the implementation and track its progress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022040700002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Sin&eacute;ad O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":1021,"content":"<p>What budgetary estimates are there for that kind of framework Ms O'Brien describes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022040700002#J00300","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649286000,"counter":1022,"content":"<p>We have not put a budget on it.

We have gone from having 500 high-status waterbodies 30 years ago to having 20.  Things are really bad and forestry is one of the main pressures on that.<\/p> <p>  One of the main issues relates to something called legacy forestry.  On many of these sites, trees were planted where they should never have been planted and they have been there for decades.  It is problematic to figure out what to do with them, but the approach so far has been, to a certain extent, to ignore them or to say it is problematic and that, therefore, we will not address them.  An Taisce is a prescribed body for forestry, which means that people who apply for a forestry licence are referred to us and we have a look at the application.  We look at a couple of hundred forestry applications a year.  The water protection measures, as part of the licensing system, are incredibly weak.  They rely on standard protocols to protect water but we can see, given forestry constitutes the third most prevalent pressure, that they are not working.  The river basin management plan refers to existing policies and measures but it is somewhat pointless to point to them given, clearly, they are not working.<\/p> <p>  What we would like to see - An Taisce and SWAN are in agreement on this - is sensitivity mapping.  Similar to the catchment approach, it would involve examining a given waterbody to see whether it could take a certain level of afforestation, where it would be too sensitive for trees to be planted, and where they should and should not be planted.  We would also like to see a specific water framework directive assessment for any afforestation licences where they will not have to rely on these standard measures and can say for definite that there will not be an impact on water quality.  Moreover, we need a plan for legacy forestry.  We cannot keep ignoring it because it is an ongoing pressure on our most pristine waterbodies and the animals that live in them, such as the freshwater pearl mussel.  This is especially important in light of climate change mitigation, whereby there is quite a strong push to plant more trees.  That is great if the trees are being planted in the right place but we need to ensure they will be, and the sensitivity mapping is the key to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022040700002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Elaine McGoff"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649286000,"counter":1025,"content":"<p>The Deputy highlighted an important issue and then made an important clarification such that, when we talk about one third of farmers, it is not the case that one third of farmers are not compliant.

A farmer, therefore, may have implemented three of them and may have yet to start the other two, which does not mean he or she is not compliant.

It indicates if a measure has not started or is not proceeding, for example, and this might be where a farmer may have agreed to a measure initially but when we returned has decided not to do it for various reasons.  I will explain that in a moment.  A third point is where a measure has commenced, such as if a water course has been fenced off.  The fourth point is where a water course's fencing is completed and the other option is where the process is ongoing.  For the \"ongoing\" option, it is where we speak of practice change.  It is where a farmer may have been putting slurry on a field on 15 January but we have indicated it brings too high a risk and we would like the farmer to put it out later in the season, when it would be less risky.  Such practice change would be always ongoing, forever and a day, if the farmer wants that.  That is the way we have done that.<\/p><p> The 37% figure refers to where farmers have not started, where farmers have just not gotten to start the measure.  It could be because of planning permission issues or because they are waiting for funding from some source.  Part of the reason both Departments have committed funding to support measures is that when we ask farmers to do measures and they tell us they cannot for reasons X, Y and Z, we feed that back to the Departments dealing with agriculture and housing and local government.  Barriers to implementation have been mentioned and we have reported feedback from farmers about such barriers.  The barrier that is repeatedly the most reported is around the fencing of water courses from livestock access.  There are complex reasons for farmers not doing this, relating to cost, alternative drinking water supplies, the ground being rented or a farmer's age and a lack of successor, for example.  It is a very complex matter but we report it to the funding Departments.  It is one of the reasons the fund I spoke of a while ago has been made available.  It is about trying to get through those barriers and improving the level of implementation.  I absolutely agree that this is a key action and we are working very hard with farmers to get that level of implementation as high as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022040700002#J00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Meehan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":1028,"content":"<p>The next slot is for the Green Party and I will take it.

In the project I work on there are more than 300 farmers and we are monitoring the nitrates action programme.  We had to encourage them to engage and work with us, and that was not easy.  Over time they have, by and large, built an interest in water quality.  Some are happy for us to be there but have not really engaged with us.  It is difficult and farmers are not rewarded financially for water quality.  It is seen as a regulation that restricts their productivity and income.  It is seen as a compliance issue for which they could be penalised.  It is very easy, if we do not bring people with us, for people to become isolated, resent the process and not want to engage.  It is very important to bring people with us.<\/p> <p>  What has worked well with our process are the small farmer discussion groups.  These are groups of between eight and 18 and we explain aspects of water quality, doing a visual demonstration of small stream characterisation.  We do a kick sample and show them the life in the riverbed.  Most farmers would not be aware of that, although for every ten farmers, nine would have a stream on their land with that life in it.  It is very beneficial for them to see that.<\/p> <p>  On the different agricultural sectors, the dairy industry, by and large, has been the most engaged and the processing co-ops are the most engaged with water quality because the expansion of that industry is largely dependent on that derogation from the nitrates directive, which has been mentioned.<\/p><p>In the rules that have been brought in to maintain good water quality, dairy is in focus because of the expansion that has taken place since the removal of quotas.  I think other sectors of agriculture in general need to have the same level of engagement with water quality that the dairy industry has shown, and they are not doing so.

It is very easy for some approaches to be over-simplified.  For example, there is a lot more that leads to nitrate loss than nitrate application rate.  The soil type, the weather, the actual farming system and the timing of application all have huge impacts on nitrate loss.  It is ironic.  Sometimes we see places where there is a very small nitrogen application or stocking rate and there is a much larger nitrate loss.  In order to bring farmers with us, the regulations need to be effective.  If they are misplaced, people will resent them, will be alienated and will not engage with us.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022040700002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Burgess","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":1035,"content":"<p>I will go to Dr. McGoff and then to Ms O'Brien to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022040700002#L00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649286000,"counter":1036,"content":"<p>It is a really good question.  It is one that we ask ourselves.  We have campaigned on this area and we want to get as much traction as possible mong the public.  One way to gain attention is to follow the lead of New Zealand, where they massively ramped up their dairy intensification.  Then there were swimming bans across the country and absolute outrage.  Obviously, it would be nice not have to get to that stage.  I think one of the key things is political leadership.  I would hope that politicians will not wait for people to come knocking on their doors to take action.  The fact that the committee has invited us here today indicates that that is very much not the case, and I commend the members for that.  In An Taisce, we get a lot of people contacting us about various issues.  Many of those issues are to do with water quality, but, harking back to Ms O'Brien's point, the problem is that nobody has ultimate responsibility for this.  People contact us and ask who to contact.  We tell them who to contact and they are essentially given the run around.  They have recognised a problem, they have identified it and they know what the issue is, but they find it very difficult to get anybody to take action.  That is where Ms O'Brien's suggestion of having 46 catchment officers could be hugely valuable in terms of engaging the public in water quality.  The officers could raise awareness and could help fix issues.  At the moment, the members of the public with whom we are dealing are becoming completely disillusioned and they are giving up.  Perhaps they are not going to their politicians because it seems that nobody cares about water quality.  I would very much like to see political leadership get to the point where we have people that are responsible for water quality and people to whom the public can turn, so that we can shine some light on this and gain traction with the public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022040700002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Elaine McGoff"},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":1037,"content":"<p>I ask Ms O'Brien to be brief.

I would like to reiterate what Dr. Crowe said about looking at the catchments where there are river trusts already working.  I think that is a good place to start because they have people who are motivated and interested on the ground already.  I am going to come back to the point we made about resourcing and funding them properly.  We cannot expect local groups to run a public awareness campaign on their local river, all done on a voluntary basis.  They need staff.  That is one recommendation.  The other recommendation I would make is that this consultation and work on the river basin management plan is an opportunity for us to be a lot more honest about the quality of our water.  I have found that people have been contacting SWAN a lot more in the past couple of years now that there is much more recreational use of water.  However, those people are still very confused about the quality of the water.  For example, last year and the year before, when there were swimming bans on beaches in County Clare, it was very unclear as to what the cause was.  There was a lack of information for people.  As was mentioned, often one cannot tell from the water that it is polluted.  In fact, we know that in a lot of cases, the rivers are not swimmable, to use Dr. McGoff's words.  I think the State needs to start being honest about the waters that are not healthy for use.  In that case, people would become a lot more aware of it.  I had an engagement with a recreational stakeholder group recently, where I raised the issue of unhealthy water quality in an area of a blue way that was being promoted locally.  They said they did not want to know because people might not want to use the blue way then.  To pick up on Dr. McGoff's point, political leadership is needed, even from a public health point of view, if we want to continue expanding our water-based tourism and recreation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022040700002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Sin&eacute;ad O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":1039,"content":"<p>Apologies for that slot running over.

I thank the witnesses for attending and for their contributions.  I am taking three key points from this.  First, we have a huge challenge on our hands and we are very far off where we need to be, while there is some good work going on.  Secondly, there is a need for some sort of a structure, a centralised unit or some way of having strategic oversight and holding public bodies to account.  The third point I am taking from this is that public participation is key.  It is very important both in terms of people being actively involved in solutions and, critically, in terms of holding public bodies to account.  We can see that in any other area where there is good public participation, it can really drive accountability and change.  For that to work, from what I have seen in other areas, the key is that public participation is meaningful.  Otherwise, people get disillusioned and disempowered over time.  Key to it being meaningful is that it is backed up with strong accountability and enforcement mechanisms.  Otherwise, people are raising issues and trying to participate, and eventually tail off if they feel there is not a meaningful way, when they spot things, of getting them addressed.  I want to give one example of a local area and what it means.  It is not an area in my constituency.  The Ward River Valley Regional Park is a linear park south of Swords, and is a river basin area.  Local activists in that area have been doing a huge amount of work voluntarily trying to clean it up and consistently raising issues on what they see as the failings and shortcomings of their local authority.  They state, for example, that when the local authority brings outside agencies into river basin areas to carry out work, it fails to properly oversee that, which results in environmental damage and damage to the water courses.  The local authority fails to enforce against regular users.  For example, if sports clubs leave plastic litter on pitches, it gets mangled by the council when it comes along and cuts the grass, and that goes into the water courses.  On biodiversity, the local activists say the local authority carried out works that are not in any way helpful, including using concrete-filled towers for flood defences, cutting away wild scrub, and putting down rat poison rather than cleaning out old dumped food waste, for example.  There have been issues with old oil drums and car tyres sitting in the river basin for more than ten years.  There are all these issues they have been raising for years and they feel they are not getting anywhere on this.  I have a question for the representatives of the Water Forum.  Is there any mechanism for local communities to hold to account public bodies, such as local authorities or others, that they feel are failing to implement their responsibilities under the river basin management plan?  Is there recourse for them?  If not, what is the Water Forum's view on changes that need to be made in terms of structures to be put in place to hold bodies to account?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022040700002#L00700","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649286000,"counter":1041,"content":"<p>I am looking at some of our more detailed recommendations.

One of the problems is that the local authorities probably have been under-resourced for water protection for a long time.<\/p><p>Nearly 20 years ago local authorities implemented a set of regulations called the phosphorous regulations which even preceded the water framework directive.  Some local authorities took advantage of that at the time.  Some local authorities are better resourced than others.  LAWPRO was established as part of the second river basin management plan as a shared service for local government to deal with water quality in a much more targeted way.  It focuses all its efforts on the areas for action which were identified in the plan and working with ASSAP and various others to do that.  The gap that is left is the rest.  Another part of the jigsaw that needs to be put together for the third river basin management plan is to address the gap in local authority resourcing for the water framework directive.

Of course, they can raise it through their local elected members and so forth.  However, I think there needs to be another mechanism.  I am not singling out local authorities on this; it applies to any public bodies with responsibility.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for Teagasc.  The nitrates action programme proposes reducing artificial fertiliser loads by up to 15% whereas the EPA data indicate that in some catchments in the south and south east a reduction of more than 50% in nitrogen load would be necessary to meet the water quality standards.  Can modelling be done on this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022040700002#M00400","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649286000,"counter":1046,"content":"<p>Modelling is being done on this.  Nitrate loss is a complex issue.  The load applied increases the risk for nitrate loss.  It does not necessarily increase the nitrate loss.  The very oversimplified opinion is that cutting the amount of nitrogen applied will automatically result in a cut in nitrate loss.  That is not necessarily the case.  Different types of farming systems are riskier.  Different soil types are riskier.  Different seasons are riskier.  Different years, depending on the climate in that year, may be more or less risky.  All of these need to come into consideration to try to mitigate nitrate loss.  That was the point I was trying to make earlier about measures being introduced.  For example, Denmark introduced buffer zones 15 m back from water courses to improve water quality.  Nitrate levels did not change a bit but it penalised farmers significantly.  That method needed to be removed.  When measures are introduced it is important to know they are effective.  That is what we are evaluating in the agricultural catchments programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022040700002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Burgess"},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":1047,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Burgess for that very useful response.

The problem is that the nitrates action programme does not take a tailored approach; it is a one-size-fits-all approach.  It does not look at different soil types, different weather or any of these factors.  All the data coming from Teagasc and the EPA indicate that we need tailored site-specific approaches and solutions, but that is not what we are being given.

I stress that there is a convergence of issues relating to nitrogen.  Nitrogen is a really important part of our advice to farmers on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  They need to use nitrogen correctly, use the right type and use as little as possible.  Obviously, the exact same messages are pertinent to water quality.  That has been part of our advisory messages in recent years.  This year it has been reinforced by the impact on fertiliser prices of the war in Ukraine.  Farmers are using nitrogen very judiciously this year because it is so expensive.  The challenge for them this year is being able to afford to buy enough to allow them to grow their crops properly.<\/p> <p>  It is not just a grassland issue.  Earlier someone spoke about us not having enough nitrogen to grow grass to feed our animals.  We need nitrogen to grow our crops.  We need nitrogen for all our farming activity.  There is a convergence of issues.  In a way it is good that we have this very strong focus on nitrogen.  We do not deny that the load of nitrogen is an important factor.  However, as Mr. Burgess said, it is much more nuanced.<\/p> <p>  That brings me to the point I wanted to make in response to the question the Chairman relayed on the complementary roles of regulation and advice.  Regulation can set a framework for how things are to be done.  Advice is about how things should happen on a given day, week or month.  For instance, we tailor our advice about when fertiliser should be applied depending on weather conditions and soil type.  That is layered on top of the regulations.  That shows the complementarity between an advisory organisation like ours and the regulation that Government and policymakers set.  I believe we need both.  We cannot rely totally on regulation to solve these issues and we cannot rely totally on advice to solve these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022040700002#M01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Frank O'Mara"},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":1053,"content":"<p>I note Dr. O'Mara's comments about speaking rotation.

I apologise for not being able to attend the full session.  Unfortunately, I had a number of conflicting meetings.  Do not worry, though, as we will ensure we catch up with all of it afterwards.<\/p> <p>  I am sure the Chair outlined the purpose of this meeting at the start, but I wish to emphasise that we are keen as a committee to have some kind of correspondence as part of the public consultation, not necessarily to make detailed observations that the witnesses' organisations make, given that they are far more expert in this area than we are, but to set out high-level priorities that we could make as politicians with some responsibility to track these issues.  I raise this point because some of my questions will relate directly to the work the committee will do after the witnesses have left and we consider what kind of submission we would like to make.  Notwithstanding how technical all of this is and the large volume of documents the witnesses have to go through, we believe this committee has an important role in contributing to the debate.  The witnesses' contributions are part of helping to inform us and bring us up to speed.<\/p> <p>  When reading the submissions beforehand, particularly SWAN's opening statement, two points jumped out at me.  This is our third river basin management plan.  A large amount of work has been done and there is far greater organisation and co-ordination, more targets, regulations and staff, etc.  In many respects, though, some of the key indicators are not moving in the right direction.  This is a concern.  If we want to ensure the third plan is better than the second and first, we have to understand with the benefit of hindsight what went wrong, what could have been done better and what improvements the final plan could make.<\/p> <p>  Ms O'Brien outlined the figures.  Some of them make for stark reading.  Unlike the Chair's area, there are active groups in my constituency that are concerned about the wellbeing of the River Camac.  The Friends of the Camac are key in that respect.  Regardless of whether we are getting representations, though, it is incumbent on us to respond if we are given this kind of information.<\/p> <p>  My first question is for Ms O'Brien.  There is a clear implication in her submission that SWAN does not believe the draft plan is fully compliant with the water framework directive.  That is alarming.  It is not the first time we have heard such concerns from organisations when dealing with other Government plans.  I invite Ms O'Brien to provide us with more detail on where she believes the plan is not compliant so that we can give that our attention in private session.<\/p> <p>  I was aware, albeit in a limited fashion, that there were new structures and additional staff in the EPA and in the local authority sector to try to deal with some of the water quality issues.  In key areas, though, water quality has declined.  I will ask an open question of everyone.  With an eye to the kinds of recommendation we could make to the public consultation, why have key aspects of water quality declined despite the additional resources and additional staff and what can we do to counteract it?<\/p> <p>  I get the sense from what I have heard so far that policy cohesion is a challenge.  There are many agencies and organisations involved as well as complex issues in terms of European law and Irish law and policy.  Do we have a sufficient level of policy coherence?  What could we do to try to make policy more coherent across the various actors?<\/p> <p>  I will next ask something that is a bit of a cheat question we ask whenever witnesses appear before us.  If they were writing our submission or advising us on it and they could only suggest one priority they wanted us to name, what would it be?<\/p> <p>  I am interested in the nitrates matter.  I accept the complexities of it.  Mr. Burgess and Dr. O'Mara made a strong case for those and no one present would disagree, but we have been increasing our overall nitrates usage in recent years as part of the increase in the size of the herd.  Even with a more nuanced approached, good, strong and targeted regulation and good advice, for how long would that be compatible?  If the herd keeps increasing or is maintained at its current level, and given the level of nitrates, be that spill-off from the nitrates themselves or, as the witnesses pointed out in their submission, direct discharge from urine into the soil, will we be able to meet the targets and what will we have to do to achieve them?<\/p> <p>  Perhaps Ms O'Brien will reply first to my question on compliance with the water framework directive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022040700002#N00100","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649286000,"counter":1055,"content":"<p>It is a fundamental issue.  We are of the view that the plan is not compliant with the directive.  According to the directive, all of our water bodies had to reach good status by 2015 &ndash; does everyone remember 2015? &ndash; and then by 2021 and that there should be no further deterioration.  It provided for three cycles, with the final deadline in 2027.  The directive requires that we identify the pressures and impacts on all water bodies and implement measures to address those and bring the water bodies up to good status.  The directive provides for two types of measures.  The first are basic measures, which are the ones with which committee members, as legislators, will be familiar: all of our basic legislation; the urban waste water treatment directive; and the European Union (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations, or GAP regulations.  If these measures do not work, we have to introduce targeted additional measures.  That is the requirement, but what we see in the plan are broad brushstroke generic measures that, in many cases such as agriculture and forestry, repackage what is already in place, for example, a review, an enhancement of uptake of forestry grant schemes, etc., with no assessment of how many water bodies they will bring up to good status.  This is why we say it is not compliant.  It does not set out targeted measures, as we and the Water Forum are recommending for each water body.<\/p> <p>  A second way in which it is not compliant is more legally specific.  There is now European case law under the Weser judgment, according to which a development should not go ahead under the water framework directive unless the relevant authority can demonstrate that the development will not compromise the affected water body in meeting its targets.  To us, this suggests strongly that assessments of such developments need to take place, but that is not happening in the case of forestry or agriculture.  It is not happening with physical developments either, although the plan sets out a proposal for new legislation to bring those into compliance.<\/p> <p>  I will allow my colleagues to answer the Deputy's other questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022040700002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Sin&eacute;ad O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649286000,"counter":1056,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Broin asked difficult questions about why water quality was still declining and what our one request would be.

We need to determine what can happen in a specific catchment, how much it can take, how much forestry there should be and the sensitive areas where there should be no development.  There is no way of doing that other than by taking a catchment approach.  The river is an expression of what is happening across a much larger land area and the two cannot be disentangled.

That is the result of good nutrient management and practice.  Water quality is not necessarily related to intensity.  The phosphorous issue is tied in with overland flow and wetter land sites.  The water quality maps show it tends to be more widespread across the country and not necessarily focused on the areas where dairy expansion has taken place.  It is very important, as has been said here time and again, that the actions to improve water quality are targeted on the soil type, which is smaller than catchment level, to be applicable for that.  <\/p><p> It is important also to emphasise that it is not all bad news.  There have been improvements in water quality.  As reported by Dr. McGoff in regard to the priority areas for action in the latest indicators report from the EPA, water qualify has moved in the right direction.  If we want to bring communities and different sectors of society with us, we have to emphasise the positives as well as the problems.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022040700002#N00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Burgess","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649286000,"counter":1062,"content":"<p>I would like to add briefly to what has been said with regard to the nitrogen issue.  There is a realisation and a desire within agriculture in Ireland to move to a system that uses less nitrogen, whether for greenhouse gas emissions, water quality or, now, for cost and availability.  All of the strategies around how the sector is going to respond, whether EU driven, farm to fork or our own climate or food vision, envisage us transitioning to a lower nitrogen usage and replacing that with nitrogen that plants abstract from the air.  The atmosphere is 70% nitrogen.  The target of our advice is around how we can transition farmers, in particular our more intensive farmers, to a system of production where they are relying more on clover and multi-species swards to supply a lot of the nitrogen that they need for the system rather than on buying it and paying a &euro;1,000 per tonne for it.  That is the direction of travel.  There are many drivers pushing and pulling the system in that regard.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked what would be the ask of Teagasc.  We are a part of Government.

There are 139,000 individuals in farming.  The impact they have on water quality is the sum of that 139,000.  We have to bring that cohort with us.  The work that my colleagues are doing in their respective programmes, the ASSAP and the agricultural catchments programme, ACP, shows that when we do engage with farmers, in particular on a field-by-field level and in regard to, say, the slope in a particular field which they need to keep away from with the slurry and so on, and the impact of what they might do, they are willing to take on board the measures.  Our ask would be that we would have an approach of working with people in the river basin plans and that that endeavour is resourced properly as well.  A lot of progress has been made through the ASSAP programme, which is co-funded by the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the industry.  That is a great, joined up type approach.

It probably would be the outcomes-based approach recommendation that we have made.  We have made three or four key recommendations, which are mentioned in the opening statement, but there are many other recommendations.  We need an outcomes-based approach, particularly because this is the third cycle.  There will be further cycles.  This is the final cycle of the water framework directive, but catchment management will be around long after we are all gone.  This thing will continue for a long time.  The outcomes-based approach must give equal weighting to protecting the waters that are still in good status and to improving the waters that are at bad, poor or moderate status.  Getting that balance right is critical.  The catchment approach referenced by Dr. McGoff is the way to do that.  The catchment approach requires us to look at both because in these situations we are dealing with complicated land management issues.  There is a lot of detail in our submission on the outcome based approach, which the Deputy might want to have a look at.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of water quality worsening, the committee needs to engage with the EPA to get an up-to-date picture on water quality and exactly what is happening with the trends.  There is a need to look under the bonnet.  In the second river basin management plan, the priority areas for action were set up.  The data published by the EPA show that there are net improvements happening in those areas.  Whether that can be ascribed exactly to the work that LAWPRO and ASSAP are doing there is probably too early to tell.  It will take a bit longer to be able to unravel all of that.  Those improvements are being offset by deterioration in other water bodies in other parts of the country that are outside of the areas for action.  The most recent EPA indicator report - the EPA being able to speak with authority on this - shows there is a glimmer of hope.  The overall picture is beginning to turn a little.  It will take at least one more monitoring cycle, possibly two, to see whether that is a blip or a trend.  There is definitely evidence of improvement in certain areas.  That indicates that where targeted actions are taken, there is a greater chance of water quality improvements.  <\/p> <p>  The policy cohesion issue is huge.  There are different policy issues.  In the environmental area alone, there are climate, nature, air quality and water quality issues, but they are all interconnected.  The more integrated they are, the better the chance of getting good outcomes for them all.  For example, in regard to agriculture, quite often if the farmer is being asked to do a particular thing on a farm, if it is done in a particular way, it will deliver for climate, nature and water and it might also deliver economically for the farmer as well, which amounts to multiple wins.  It is very difficult to design systems that are fully integrated because people are more comfortable in their silos.  That is a really big challenge.  The land use review that is currently going on is really important for all of this because most of these issues are about how we use our land.  <\/p> <p>  In regard to the forestry issue, the forum has made a number of recommendations in regard to forestry as well.  Under the climate action plan, there is a target to grow a lot more trees to deal with the carbon neutrality issue.  That is a good thing to do but it needs to be done in a way that will improve water quality.  The legacy issues of forestry need to be dealt with at the same time as making sure that whatever additional forestry is planted will be good rather than bad for water quality.  That too relates to land use and how we work out all of those inter-related things that happen in regard to land.  The policy is a little complicated.  We have brought attention to this in our submission, where we refer to the need for national policies in different areas to be proofed against the water framework directive.  It is important to compare one against the other to make sure other policies, be that CAP, the NAP and so on, will have a positive contribution to water quality over the period of time.<\/p><p> The other point was on urban wastewater.  It is the same Department, so at least with urban wastewater and water quality one is dealing with the same Department.  Those two should be just hand in glove.  Again, we have a number of recommendations in the forum's submission on urban wastewater.  The main one is the water bodies that have been identified as being at risk from urban wastewater.  It needs to be clearly set out in the plan what is going to happen with them.  The second river basin management plan had an appendix in it listing the water services investments that were going to happen over that particular plan period, so it is important something similar is in the third plan.  There is probably much better information now than four or five years ago on Irish Water investment.  There is far better information on the pressures and identifying where the real pressures are.  We can be way more targeted now about all this stuff in the next six years.  That comes back to the outcome-based approach again because it must be targeted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022040700002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Matthew Crowe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":1067,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Crowe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022040700002#P00200","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":1068,"content":"<p>That was a very helpful round of questions from Deputy &Oacute; Broin because it has focused us.

Building on what she said, it is very easy to fall into discussions about how it is not feasible at this stage and there are only so many years left.  However, the water framework directive has a very clear and precise procedure as to how you go about deciding what is feasible to get done between now and 2027.  You set out the measures that are needed and then you can do an assessment to work out whether it is technically unfeasible or disproportionately costly.  If you can demonstrate that then you can set out either an alternative objective or a time exemption to reaching the objective.  That is what is required for every water body.  Building on what Dr. McGoff said, that is what we need to see for all water bodies according to the Article 4 assessment required in the directive so we can see how far and how long, as Dr. McGoff said, it is going to take.  The plan as is does not even tell us how many water bodies it is planning to get up to good status so we cannot even tell that.  There is another report on the LAWPRO website that looks at the areas that are being targeted for action, these priority areas, which are the only ones - the lucky ones, that are getting this targeted approach.  In that report it looks as if about three quarters of our waters will get these targeted extra actions from ASSAP and LAWPRO but then there is no assessment as to whether those will work either, so I fully support Dr. McGoff's request that we get full transparency on this.

One of the problems with the legacy of forestry is that there is a replanting obligation in the forestry legislation which essentially states that once land is afforested and once you fell it, you are obliged to reforest it.  There are opportunities to derogate from that but they happen rarely.  We need to see that obligation amended.  A lot of that forestry might be in very sensitive freshwater pearl mussel catchments.  Freshwater pearl mussel require open peatland habitat because they require constant hydrology and any trees in that area, regardless of what kind, will decimate freshwater pearl mussels.  In those sort of areas we need a return to open peatland habitat.  One of the issues is that removing the trees can sometimes increase siltation so it has to be done carefully and I have heard mention of the requirement to fell them using helicopters.  Although it sounds preposterous apparently it is commonly used on the Continent.  I acknowledge that it is a difficult thing to grapple with but that does not mean we should not grapple with it.  We have to address it and it has climate impacts too because that peatland is drained and is giving off carbon.

It is difficult to give a short answer.  It is not going the right way yet.  Work is in progress and I will reserve judgment until I see how Project Woodland progresses.  To date, forestry has had a significant impact on our water quality and biodiversity and it has often been planted on peat soil, which has been drained, leading to rising climate emissions.  It is not a good news story and it remains to be seen if it can be turned into one.

It is the highest status waters that have been particularly impacted by forestry.  In the second river basin management plan the single greatest pressure was on the high status waters and they might be second in the updated characterisation work done by the EPA.  The number of water bodies is not huge.  The Water Forum recommends that for the 233 water bodies where forestry has been identified as a significant pressure, targeted measures would restore, protect or include it to indicate how the plan will reduce the forestry pressure from these water bodies.<\/p> <p>  I will come back to the point I was making earlier about the connectivity of different policies.  If the climate policy will require an expansion of forestry while the water policy needs to address the fact that high status waters have been negatively impacted by legacy forestry and by forestry which is still there in some cases then those two policies have to meet and align with each other.  You are back to this policy alignment issue.  In 2027 we do not want to be in situation where forestry has expanded nationally to deal with the climate crisis and where the high status water issue has got worse.  Those two things need to be taken together in tandem but you have two separate national plans.  These include: the climate action plan which is dealing with the climate issues; the river basin management plan that is dealing with the water issues; and the new forestry strategy and Project Woodland that Dr. McGoff mentioned, which is looking at what the future of forestry will look like overall.  For the credibility of all, forestry included, that legacy issue needs to be put to bed, which means there is a six-year window of opportunity to deal with that.

I remember a scientist from the EPA telling us several years ago that even sheep that had been dipped crossing a stream could affect the status of one of those waters and bring it tumbling down from pristine into a deteriorated state.  Septic tanks can also have an impact.  It is not straightforward and that is why we are saying that each of those water bodies needs an urgent threat response and emergency response type catchment-specific plan.  We should look at what is happening in those catchments field-by-field and house-by-house so that they can be restored or protected.  I am sorry I cannot provide a more straightforward answer.

The thinking behind what was presented from that submission is correct.  I cannot vouch that it is 62% but urine changes to urea, which is a major source of nitrogen.  With a urine patch, it is all being deposited at a single location and it is wet.  Nitrate is carried by water through the ground so it is a problem.  However, mitigation actions at the end of the year when soils get wetter are that stocking rates are over a larger area.  Land that has been cut for silage is no longer closed up and the grazing intensity is over the whole farm, which helps alleviate it but not completely.

It is Irish Water but I am going to put it back on the Department.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is the competent authority, ultimately, for wastewater.  It is answerable to the European Commission in terms of compliance with the urban wastewater treatment directive.  In fact, we have an infringement case open against us and it is to the Department that the infringement unit will be calling.  In fact, it is not Irish Water so much as the Department that is the drafter of the river basin management plan.<\/p> <p>  We are asking that for the 208 water bodies that are polluted by sewage, where sewage is the main source of pollution and not an agricultural source, for example, measures need to be put in place to address that.  So, what does that mean?  That means for wastewater treatment plants or systems, whether the sewer overflow or plant discharge is causing that pollution, there needs to be work to fix that in Irish Water's capital investment programme.  The capital investment programme is going to run to 2029 and the deadline is 2027.  Therefore, we can see already there is a mismatch there.<\/p> <p>  When we start to actually look at the figures, however, that is the least of our problems.  Of those 208 water bodies for which we are saying urgent measures to remediate are needed, if we look at the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, urban wastewater treatment report, it does something SWAN does not agree with.  The EPA said it will take a long time so it will prioritise the most significant ones.  It has identified the 42 top areas that are polluted by sewage.  Then, it looked to see what Irish Water's performance has been.  Members will see in its report that of those 42 areas, only 15 of those - it maybe 13; I will have to check my figures - have measures in place.  Irish Water has measures in place not even to fix them by 2024 but to have development or infrastructure beginning by 2024.  We have, therefore, gone from 208 water bodies to 42 priority areas identified by the EPA to 15 areas for which Irish Water has a plan to remediate.<\/p> <p>  As Dr. Crowe and the Chairman himself said earlier, this should be a straightforward enough issue to address.  It falls within the remit of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage so there are no conflicting sectors.  I am not saying this is straightforward.  There are numerous reasons this is not happening, first and foremost of which is obviously investment.  I am sure Irish Water would also have other reasons.  We are saying that in the interests of transparency, what the river basin management plan should do, which it does not, is identify all the water bodies of those 208 that are polluted by sewage, then name the systems and plants that are causing that pollution.  It should then identify the ones for which there is a plan to fix and by what time and the ones for which there is no plan to fix and give a clear explanation as to why there is not one.  That could be down to investment, planning or something to do with markets and consultants not being available or whatever it is.  It should then conduct a gap analysis.  Members of the committee and the public can then have a look at that to see what the State's plan is and whether we find that satisfactory.  That for us is the first step.  Ultimately, however, we are calling for measures to address all those issues, at least by the end the capital investment programme if not by the water framework objective of 2027.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022040700002#R00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Sin&eacute;ad O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":1116,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Brien.  My final question kind of goes back to bringing the public along with us.  We have to bring everyone along in everything we do, whether it is agriculture, industry or individual users or residents.  I read the latest EPA publication, that is, its indicators report from 2020.  I find some of the graphs and charts confusing as well.  I try to work out if where we see a drop in quality level down to another means that area got better and was moved.  It is kind of difficult sometimes to work it out.<\/p> <p>  Every river a person crosses in this country has a bridge at some point on which the name of the river is written.  I would like to see an indicator sign to say this is a green, orange or red river to really clarify in people's minds that our water quality in our rivers is at risk.  Those kinds of clear indicators are important.<\/p> <p>  We might look at regional maps.  I know there are good online facilities where one can zoom right in and see that certain segments of a river are of poor quality and are probably better further upstream or kind of lose that toxicity or negative aspect as they go further downstream.  That goes for maps for children's classrooms as well.  We all know the local rivers in our regions.  We all had to learn them off by heart in school years ago.  If classrooms had a map on the wall every year to say their closest river was in poor quality and that was caused by the wastewater treatment plant downstream, it could show the impacts on people's health or that the biodiversity in their area is impacted.  We need to be really clear like that.<\/p> <p>  The EPA does fantastic work.  It pulls together and provides all those data sets but I do not think the general public reads that document in depth the way we are.  That is something we need to address and is probably the way in which Dr. Crowe talked about bringing younger people into it as well.  It is a suggestion.<\/p> <p>  We are almost out of time now.  I can offer the witnesses some time if they wish to make a final point.  I have been writing down the points and suggestions they have made, which the committee will have a look at.

I will pick up on the themes regarding outreach and public engagement.  Dr. Crowe referred to it.  Mr. Eddie Burgess referred to the citizens' science-related engagements with farmers, which is really important.  Going back to these questions of getting people involved, getting them to care, and moving the water question higher on the political agenda, awareness is key.  The local authority waters programme, LAWPRO, has a huge role to play, as does the Rivers Trust and local initiatives such as the one at the River Camac that Deputy &Oacute; Broin referred to. These are significant and need to be endowed properly.  My day job is production of the StreamScapes programme.  Over the last 33 years, since 1989, we have worked in 24 counties, both North and South.  We work with local communities to produce awareness-raising activities.  Awareness leads to pride, concern and then to action.  We have to look at this.  I know Tom Collins, as previous chair of the Water Forum, was looking at how these issues could be incorporated into the national curriculum at primary school and perhaps also secondary school level.<\/p> <p>  We want to reinforce and second all those mentions of citizen science and engagement, as well awareness of best practice.

An interesting aspect of the forum is that it has 25 members representing 13 different sectors.  The forum has had six months of work, discussions, debates and presentations from a range of different organisations.  These 25 individuals, representing 13 different sectors, came to an agreement about recommendations regarding water quality for the next six years.  That is no mean feat.  Each of those groups and individuals have their own individual views.  They have managed to bring it together to present this submission, which is the common ground that has been described.  That is the strength of the forum.  When there is common ground, there is a greater chance of implementation.  I urge the committee to think about the forum's submission in that way.  It would, of course, be complemented by sector-specific submissions from individuals.

There have been good questions that have drawn out many important issues.  The closing reflections I would like to make think back to when we started on implementation of the water framework directive.  It is 12 years since the catchments programme was set up.  We have learned a lot.  We are in a very different position with regard to our knowledge of water quality, the impact that agriculture can have on it and how we can address that impact.  We have learned much in that time.  The country is in a much better position with regard to its ability to monitor water quality and to report on it.  We have time series data about water now.  That is all great.<\/p> <p>  We have much better modelling capability relating to this issue.  We have new programmes in place, such as the asset programme, which has only been in place for three or four years.  It will not deliver a transformation overnight but it has shown ability to engage at the right level with farmers.  The catchment programme is continuing.  We have a new programme that we started, the Signpost programme, which mainly relates to climate change, but also tries to take an integrated view of environmental and economic sustainability.  It looks at how farmers can transform their business and address all important environmental aspects.  Our advisers have tools that they did not have ten or 12 years ago.  Their knowledge in the area is chalk and cheese.  Great strides have been made in building capacity and putting in place the needed resources and infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  We do not have any farmers here today.  We are a research and advisory body, not practising farmers, or, at least, that is not our function here today.  Trying to represent their voice, they are engaged with this issue.  As Mr. Burgess said, dairy farmers, who probably farm at the highest level of intensity, recognise that they have to address this issue.<\/p><p>We see that with intensive farmers and with the huge growth in things such as the European innovation programme and farmers wanting to address issues such as this.  All those things are in place now.  That is not to minimise the challenge or look at it through rose-tinted glasses.  We are in a much stronger position now.  Hopefully, we are seeing some of the green shoots of progress that were mentioned in the priority areas of action.  By nature, I am an optimist.  I want to finish on that note.

Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that may be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such request.  For witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.<\/p><p> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts of Leinster House will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any member participating via MS Teams to confirm, prior to making his or her contribution, that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.

I am a principal officer in the civil justice legislation function of the Department of Justice.  I am joined by Mr. Andrew Munro, assistant secretary, who has responsibility for civil justice policy and legislation.<\/p> <p>  International surrogacy arrangements raise complex and important questions of rights and ethics concerning areas of law that intersect across the remits of several Government Departments.  There has been substantial work and engagement on issues relating to international surrogacy between the relevant Ministers and Departments.  The issues paper on international surrogacy which has been provided for the assistance of the committee sets out the current legal position on international surrogacy, the issues and key challenges that arise in this area and possible options for dealing with the issues arising.  The issues paper was drafted jointly by the Departments of Justice, Health, and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. <\/p> <p>  The issues paper outlines the current position in Irish law relating to the legal parentage and guardianship of children born as a result of surrogacy arrangements.  In Irish law, legal motherhood is based on birth rather than genetics.  The birth mother of a child has automatic rights of parenthood and guardianship over the child.  Under Irish law, the genetic father of a child born through surrogacy may apply for a declaration of parentage in respect of the child under the Status of Children Act 1987.  If the declaration of parentage is granted, the father may apply for guardianship under section 6A of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964. <\/p> <p>  An intending mother of a child born through surrogacy, while not the legal mother of the child under Irish law, may apply to a court to be appointed a guardian of the child under section 6C of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964.  The legal position is the same for a male intending parent who is not the genetic father of the child.<\/p> <p>  Article 42A of the Constitution is relevant to the rights of children born as a result of surrogacy arrangements.  The European Court of Human Rights has considered cases relating to international surrogacy arrangements in the context of a child&rsquo;s right to respect for his or her private life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.<\/p> <p>  As regards international initiatives, an expert group set up by the Hague Conference on Private International Law, which is examining private international law issues relating to the legal parentage of children and international surrogacy arrangements, is expected to submit its final report in 2023.  It is expected that the European Commission will propose a legislative initiative later this year on recognition of parenthood within the European Union.<\/p> <p>  In February 2021, a group of experts in international law and human rights adopted the Verona principles for the protection of the rights of the child born through surrogacy.  These principles were drafted to assist states and other stakeholders and to provide guidance on legislative, policy and practical reforms on the upholding of the rights of children born through surrogacy.<\/p> <p>  To return to the Irish context, the report of the special rapporteur on child protection, A Review of Children&rsquo;s Rights and Best Interests in the Context of Donor Assisted Human Reproduction and Surrogacy in Irish Law, was published in early 2021.  The special rapporteur made a number of recommendations relating to international surrogacy and the position of intending parents of children who have already been born through surrogacy arrangements.  These recommendations, which have been considered and discussed by the relevant Ministers and Departments, present some challenges and difficulties, which are described in the issues paper.  The issues paper sets out some options that the committee may wish to consider to address issues relating to international surrogacy.  The list of options is not exhaustive and is not intended to limit the committee's consideration of the issues.<\/p> <p>  The issues paper describes the key issues and challenges relating to international surrogacy.  In addressing those issues, care must be taken to ensure that consideration is given to the rights, interests and welfare of all persons involved in international surrogacy arrangements - children born through surrogacy, surrogate mothers and intending parents.  These include, in particular, the need to ensure protection of the genetic identity rights of children born through international surrogacy and the need to ensure proper safeguards for surrogate mothers.  I am happy to answer any questions that committee members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022040700002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Tracy O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649286000,"counter":1140,"content":"<p>The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is grateful for the opportunity to attend this special committee session on international surrogacy and to speak to its relevant policy areas in this regard.  The Department also welcomes the wider debate and discussion on international and commercial surrogacy.  I am a principal officer in the Department.  I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Cormac Grundy, assistant principal, and remotely by assistant secretary, Ms Laura McGarrigle.<\/p> <p>  The area of surrogacy continues to be a complex legal and policy area, both in Ireland and internationally.  Surrogacy and assisted human reproduction transects a number of policy remits across Departments and State agencies, as is evident by the attendance of three Departments at this meeting.  I believe all parties would agree that surrogacy gives rise to important ethical questions and that these questions are heightened when we specifically consider the nature of international commercial surrogacy.  I would also suggest that Ireland is not alone in this and that many other countries are considering how or if to legislate in the area of international surrogacy.<\/p> <p>  The focus of this Department, and our role here today, is on ensuring the rights of the child are central to any discussions.  We are keen to ensure that as the potential for policy and legislative development is discussed, the rights of the child and the child&rsquo;s best interests are paramount.  Much of this consideration of the child&rsquo;s rights and best interests is informed by looking at Ireland&rsquo;s history and how, in the past, the rights of the child were often not to the fore or were absent from legislation and policy development.  Members will be all too familiar with the reports which highlight failures to vindicate the rights of the child in Irish history.  As a Department that is at the forefront of legislating to address the State&rsquo;s failing in the past, it is incumbent on us that we use the learnings from the past to inform our thinking on future policy development.<\/p> <p>  We recognise that Ireland today is a society where non-traditional family formations, including through surrogacy, exist and that the image of the family unit is one that is evolving.  The embracing of diversity has made our country better and a more inclusive place in which to live and grow.<\/p> <p>  The Department has engaged on the matter of surrogacy with members of Equality for Children and Irish Families through Surrogacy.  We could not but be moved by their accounts of becoming parents through surrogacy.  We imagine the committee will also have an opportunity to hear from such groups.  Nonetheless, international commercial surrogacy does raise concerns about the commodification of children, exploitation of women in poorer countries, the risk of child trafficking and the child&rsquo;s right to know his or her identity.  In this sense, we would encourage all parties to consider not only their rights and best interests as children today, but also how they will feel when they grow up and, as adults, consider the circumstances of their birth.<\/p><p>The Department&rsquo;s work on developing and progressing the Birth Information and Tracing Bill means that the right of a child to know his or her identity and understand the origin of his or her birth is keenly appreciated.<\/p><p> In considering any measures in the area of international commercial surrogacy, the Department highlights the following points as especially important.  Measures should respect the child&rsquo;s rights to know his or her origins, including about his or her surrogate mother and any egg or sperm donor.  In this regard, all material relating to a child&rsquo;s birth should be preserved for the child.  Measures should also ensure a genetic link between the child and at least one intending parent.  Allowing for recognition of parentage where there is no genetic link between the child and either parent would raise serious concerns about child trafficking and undermine the protections for children built into the adoption process.  Measures should ensure that the rights and welfare of the surrogate mother are protected and respected.  This is essential, not only in the context of her rights but also when the child grows up and looks back on his or her birth, he or she must be satisfied that their birth mother was protected from exploitation.<\/p><p> The Department welcomes the debate around international commercial surrogacy and the opportunity to discuss the complexities involved.  We are happy to discuss these further, with a focus on the policy areas relevant to our Department.

As the Cathaoirleach has said, I am joined by Mr. Niall Redmond, principal officer, as well as remotely by Mr. Colm McGennis, assistant principal, from the bioethics unit at the Department of Health.  I will provide a brief overview of the Government&rsquo;s proposals to regulate surrogacy as undertaken in this country.<\/p> <p>  As the committee will be aware, the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022, commonly referred to as the AHR Bill, passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il on 23 March and has been referred to the Select Oireachtas Committee on Health.  This comprehensive and long-awaited legislation will for the first time encompass the regulation of a wide range of practices undertaken in this jurisdiction within this complex and fast-moving area of healthcare.<\/p> <p>  Part 7 of the Bill details the specific conditions under which surrogacy in Ireland, that is, domestic surrogacy, will be permitted.  The relevant provisions were drafted with the aim of providing a robust framework with all required safeguards in place for dealing with domestic surrogacy applications.  In considerations regarding the possibility of legislating for international surrogacy, the Department of Health is primarily concerned to ensure that any proposals that may emerge do not undermine the principles of the policy in respect of domestic surrogacy, as reflected in the Bill, or create a conflicting policy landscape.<\/p> <p>  The briefing document provided to the committee sets out the circumstances under which a domestic surrogacy agreement may be approved.  The issue of payments for surrogacy, other than the reasonable expenses of a surrogate mother, is of particular relevance and significance in the context of international surrogacy.  It is generally understood that most foreign surrogacies involve commercial payments beyond reasonable costs.  The domestic prohibition on commercial surrogacy is predominately based on concerns and ethical considerations relating to the welfare and commodification of the children involved, as well as the potential risks of coercion and exploitation of financially vulnerable women to act as surrogates.<\/p> <p>  Government policy to prohibit commercial surrogacy is consistent with similar policies internationally.  Most jurisdictions that have legislated for surrogacy have prohibited commercial surrogacy, except a very small number such as Ukraine, a number of American states, including California, Illinois and Idaho, and Russia.  This is a significant factor in deliberations regarding any proposals for policy and legislative intervention in respect of international surrogacy.<\/p> <p>  It is important that the overarching policy and legislative framework is coherent and avoids confusion.  There are deep considerations that need to be explored in respect of the public policy position and seeking alignment across domestic and international surrogacy.  The focus of AHR Bill is on the regulation of a wide range of practices undertaken in this jurisdiction exclusively and especially those carried out by private fertility clinics operating here.  The issues which arise from Irish people engaging in cross-border surrogacy primarily relate to parentage, citizenship and, potentially, adoption.<\/p> <p>  Overall, the Department of Health is anxious to ensure that the AHR Bill progresses as quickly as possible and without undue delay.  The Bill provides a regulatory framework for assisted human reproduction in Ireland across various treatment types, including IVF, and provides an ethical framework for research on new reproductive technologies.  It is estimated that in excess of 10,000 IVF cycles and other advanced assisted human reproduction treatments are undertaken in this country every year.  In comparison, it is understood that the number of international surrogacy arrangements involving Irish residents annually is, in relative terms, limited.  This is not to diminish the importance placed on surrogacy arrangements by intending parents, who are dealing with a range of difficult issues and emotions that arise in the context of infertility problems.<\/p> <p>  Delay in progressing the AHR Bill will directly impact on the patients and the prospective parents involved in the tens of thousands of time-sensitive procedures carried out within this jurisdiction yearly.  It would also impact on service providers who must plan for and be ready for the new regulatory regime.  This legislation will increase protections for service users, standardise services and ensure public confidence in those services.<\/p> <p>  It is also important to reflect that further delay in progressing the AHR Bill could have adverse knock-on effects on the timelines for the establishment of the assisted human reproduction regulatory authority, the development of the necessary secondary legislation and the Department&rsquo;s plan to introduce the provision of advanced AHR treatment through the public health system, in conjunction with the HSE.  Progress on these critical items, to give full effect to the regulatory framework can only be made once the Bill is passed.<\/p> <p>  The absence of a regulatory framework for this innovative and sometimes controversial sphere of healthcare in this country clearly makes Ireland an outlier internationally.  However, the Department of Health is not in agreement with much of the commentary on the topic that our country should similarly be considered a laggard on the issue of international surrogacy.  For instance, the Department is not aware of any EU member state which has legislated specifically for its own citizens engaging in surrogacy in another jurisdiction.  Rather, the norm appears to be that existing family law is utilised and adapted to deal with specific cases, similar to what this State has done to date in this area.<\/p> <p>  Notwithstanding that, the matters which arise in the context of international surrogacy are largely not within the direct policy scope of the Department of Health, the Minister and the Department are eager to support the consideration of these complex issues where possible.  We are interested in hearing the views of the committee and answering any questions that arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022040700002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Muiris O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":1143,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Keeffe, Mr. Duff and Professor O'Mahony.  I find this a very emotive subject, to be quite honest.  I have done a little bit of investigating into this and significant research over the past couple of months.  Surrogacy is prohibited in many of our European countries.  It is legal in the United Kingdom and Greece, as long as it is done on a non-commercial basis.  Ukraine, along with Russia, is one of the few countries where commercial surrogacy is legal.<\/p> <p>  The destination seems to be Ukraine.  This is, obviously, causing me some trouble, especially with the war ongoing.  The estimated global market in Ukraine is &euro;5 billion.  Over the past five years, more than 4,000 children were born via surrogacy in Ukraine, and 19% of them have foreign parents.  How can we possibly ban it here and give it the green light in Ukraine?  This sets a complete double standard.  It is okay to exploit Ukrainian women, but not Irish women.<\/p> <p>  From Professor O'Mahony's statement, I get that it is happening anyway and that we need to ensure that parents and children, produced by surrogacy, have a proper legal framework.

It is really progressive that we have established this committee, and I am delighted to take on the mantle of Vice Chairman.  There are so many families throughout the country, including in my constituency, that have become families through surrogacy.  I do not agree with some of the phrases used by the previous speaker.  I do not believe that these families are exploitative and I do not believe that their children are victims.  I believe that we need to get to a point where all parties involved in the surrogacy process are treated equally and fairly, and that there are legal rights and recognition for the children and, in particular, their mothers.  I say \"their mothers\" because as the issues paper that we were given ahead of today's meeting clearly states, \"The intending mother of a child born through surrogacy, not being the birth mother of that child, is not entitled to apply for a declaration of parentage\" under the Status of Children Act 1987.  That holds, even if it is the intending mother's egg that is fertilised during the process.  As so many mothers know, guardianship cannot be applied for for two years.  That creates all sorts of issues in custody disputes, inheritance complications and situations where mothers who are caring for their children are not even allowed to sign permission slips for them.  That is why we are here.  That is what we need to resolve.<\/p> <p>  It was really interesting to hear from our three speakers today.  Ms O'Keeffe clearly outlined the current situation and the legal parameters.  Mr. Duff explained how we all  have the children's rights at heart.  I think every one of us does.  From Mr. O'Connor's perspective, and I would like to put my question to him, he stated that no EU member state has legislated for international surrogacy and that instead, some have adapted existing family law to deal with the issue.  We are all here today because we have not been able to adapt existing family law to deal with it.  Does Mr. O'Connor think this is something we can do?  Does he think we need stand-alone legislation on it or can the issues be ironed out as part of the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022040700002#D01600","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649286000,"counter":1162,"content":"<p>I will refer to my colleague, Mr. Redmond, who can respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022040700002#D01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Muiris O'Connor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649286000,"counter":1163,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her question, which probably reflects the complexities involved.  There may be a number of different vehicles, if we are looking for policy solutions, legislative solutions or both, in this area.  I know that some of the potential options were described towards the end of the issues paper.  There are a number of ways of looking at it, and a number of ways of trying to find the right balance in terms of the various rights involved.  None of them represent a very simple or easy solution, as we know.  The main thing to be doing in this space is to be looking at those options, to consider them in more detail and to consider the views from the range of stakeholders involved that have an interest in this area.  In terms of the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill, as outlined already, we have set proposals on legislative provisions around the treatment of domestic surrogacy and a whole range of criteria, conditions and processes around that.  Obviously, key in some of those, as set out in our opening statement, are issues around the prohibition of commercial surrogacy for the reasons outlined.  One of the things we are particularly concerned about in the Department is that whatever the intervention may be in terms of how we treat international surrogacy and find solutions in that space, they are not in conflict with our domestic regime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022040700002#D01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Redmond"},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":1164,"content":"<p>The Deputy has one minute remaining for follow-up questions, if she has any.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022040700002#D01900","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":1165,"content":"<p>I agree with Mr. Redmond.

Over the next number of months when we have all of our public meetings, it will be very helpful for everybody to listen in to all the various groups.  Hopefully, we will dispel some of the myths that are out there in relation to surrogacy.  As Deputy Higgins has said, there are many very genuine families going through the process.  We are short on time and I know what it is like to be Chair, so I will be brief.<\/p> <p>  I want to ask the representatives of the Department of Justice about the difficulties it has claimed are presented by Professor O'Mahony's recommendations.  I am aware that Ms O'Keeffe stated that the difficulties are described in the issues paper, but are there two or three specific difficulties that the Department sees with his recommendations?  As Professor O'Mahony will be attending the second session, it would be helpful to know that.  I have a question for the representatives of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth on children who have already been born and are living here.  Do the witnesses have any thoughts or opinions on whether there should be separate legislation or an instrument to deal with children who have already been born?  I am very conscious of families that face potential difficulties in terms of a parent being sick or very real problems in the here and now and that perhaps cannot wait.  I ask for the witnesses' thoughts in relation to that.  I also want to ask, more generally, if any of the Departments have looked at other models or similar practices.  There may not be time to get to that.

We saw that as creating quite a few practical and logistical difficulties in respect of the arranging of remote hearings.  The situation in Ukraine highlights the difficulties that could be involved in trying to arrange a remote court hearing in a foreign jurisdiction.  There would also be issues with the timing of such a hearing because the family's visa for whatever country they are in could be running out.  They would be running up accommodation and medical care costs while abroad, so prolonging their stay in the country may present practical difficulties.  There would be the issues with remote hearings and making sure that whatever reports and so on are needed are before the courts.  Trying to procure those at a distance could create practical difficulties.<\/p> <p>  The other main issue we saw related to the proposal for the process, which would involve a court application only after the birth of the child.  That was seen as being inconsistent with what is proposed in the AHR Bill in respect of domestic surrogacy, whereby there would be two stages to the process: an approval process at the outset involving the AHR regulatory authority and then, at the other end, when the child is born, the parental order process that goes to the court.  We thought there would be an inconsistency there in that a two-stage process would be required for domestic surrogacy but only one stage would be required for international surrogacy.<\/p> <p>  Those were two of the main practical issues we saw.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022040700002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Tracy O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":1172,"content":"<p>Could the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth come in briefly on existing children in families formed through surrogacy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022040700002#E00500","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649286000,"counter":1173,"content":"<p>The Deputy makes an important point about existing children in family formation through surrogacy.

We have seen some very difficult examples in the past whereby, to be fair, intending parents were trying to do the right thing.  Many people got exploited by bad actors.  For example, the egg that was supplied by the purported donor was not that egg; the child given to the intending parents was not conceived from the sperm of the intending father; the surrogate mother was spirited away over a border immediately after the birth; or the local authority provided a birth certificate that named the intending father as the father despite the child having none of his genetic material.  That is no reflection on the intending parents, but there were many bad actors and it can be seen how the surrogate mother, the child and the intending parents were exploited because of weak public administration in a country.

One would have to go out and carry out inspections and have an equivalence regime.  There is not really a commercial surrogacy regime anywhere in Europe that provides this type of regulation.  I suppose that informs the Government's policy choice in respect of commercial surrogacy domestically.  I am not saying it cannot be done; I am just saying there are challenges there.  I think the issues paper raises them in order that the committee can explore them and identify the risks and then try to identify how to get assurance that the standards we would like to see applied in country X are actually being applied and how we can ensure that the intending parents, the child and the surrogate mother are not being exploited, building systems around that.

As the witnesses from the Department of Health rightly said, we can only legislate on a national level and we can only put in safeguards at a national level and ensure they are properly implemented.  We should be looking at the issue in a European context.  The European Commission has proposed to draw up a legislative initiative later this year.  Has the Department of Justice had an input into the European Commission?  What soundings has the Department taken on the workings at a European level?  We all want to make sure every single actor, for the want of a better word, within these incredible relationships is protected.  When we think about what is happening here, someone is giving the opportunity of parenting their child.  It is a miracle in so many ways and we want to make sure we look after every single person along the way and that they are fulfilled, including the respective parents, the surrogate mother and the child that is lovingly created at the end of it.  What do the witnesses hear from a European angle in that regard?  It is a positive way to make sure we have regulation and safeguards at an international level.

I thank the witnesses for their statements and for the options paper, although there are elements of it that are disputed by various representative bodies of stakeholders in this area.<\/p> <p>  First, all three of the papers refer to commercial surrogacy.  It is important to note it is almost like a foregone conclusion that there is a determination that we as a nation will legislate for commercial surrogacy.  Yet, I do not think any of the advocacy groups have stepped forward and asked for that.  What all of the advocacy groups have asked for is that there be a pathway to parenthood for both parents where is a child is born via international surrogacy and that within that, there are safeguards for the identity and rights of the child first and foremost, they understand their gestational and genetic origins and they have full rights to that information.<\/p> <p>  Second, there are the safeguards to ensure the surrogate mother has adequate legal consent, advice and support.<\/p> <p>  Third, the intended parents are also vulnerable parties in this.  My charge would be that the failure to put in place a provision, a mechanism and a framework has left intended parents in a vulnerable situation where they too have been exploited.  Though they are true actors, they are left open to being exploited by bad actors.  If we had a framework in place, if we had an advisory body and if we had the authority that is sought to be established under the assisted human reproduction, AHR, legislation, then we could fund the body underneath that.  It could advise anyone who was planning to travel for international surrogacy as to what countries not to engage in, as well as as to what clinics not to engage in.  We could have a collective place where all of the information of the past would be made available to those who are intending parents.  Therefore, there is an erroneous notion and assumption across all three of the opening statements that there is a drive on the part of parents who need to avail of surrogacy to have commercial surrogacy legislated for.  Nobody has asked for that.  What we have asked for is a pathway to parentage.<\/p> <p>  On that point, can I ask the representatives of the Department of Health what is their understanding as to why this committee is a creature of three Departments?  The issues paper was created by three Departments.  What is the purpose of this committee being time-limited to 12 weeks?  What will happen to our report?  Why are we in a 12-week process?

However, the initial intent of the AHR Bill was not to address the international surrogacy piece.  Therefore, in the context of the special rapporteur&rsquo;s report, as well as in the context of some of the other recommendations that were specific to domestic surrogacy and other aspects of AHR, all of those have been considered.

It also is important to reflect that the enactment or the passing of that Bill does not automatically introduce that regulatory regime from day one.  A huge number of requirements are to be put in place post the enactment of the Bill, including the establishment of a new regulatory authority, a substantial amount of secondary legislation and a number of aspects relating to the operation and function of that authority.

Our assumption was that we would have been in committee in April, this month, but the concern is that the summer recess would move us into the autumn.  There is an urgency notwithstanding the long time it has taken to progress the AHR Bill.  Also, it is hard to envisage providing for international surrogacy in a Bill providing assurance, safeguards and regulation of domestic surrogacy.  It is not clear to us that it will be concluded that the AHR Bill is the appropriate legal instrument.  There may be other legal instruments advised by this committee at the end.  It may be outside of legislation that these matters and objectives set out by all contributing today are reconciled in practice rather than in law.  I suspect that may be the case as we do not have jurisdiction where the surrogacy is taking place in the context of international commercial surrogacy so it is just very difficult.<\/p> <p>  The worst of all outcomes would be that we would be considerably delayed and the conclusions would not actually have relevance for the AHR Bill.

By now, members will be well aware the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022 offers Ireland an opportunity to address a very long-standing gap in our laws which has long been a cause of concern to international human rights bodies and our Supreme Court, among others, for some time.  The absence of any legal framework on surrogacy has led to a considerable number of Irish families living in a legal twilight zone whereby a child is a legal stranger to one or both parents and the right to family life and right to identity of the children is not recognised.  This is contrary to the best interests of children and fails to observe the principle of non-discrimination.<\/p> <p>  In 2020, the Government requested that I examine the issue of donor-assisted human reproduction, DAHR, and surrogacy, specifically through the lens of the rights and best interest of children.  In response to this request, I produced a report in December 2020 that made 27 recommendations for legislative reform, drawing on international human rights law, an analysis of best practice in other jurisdictions and a detailed survey of recent academic literature on children&rsquo;s rights in surrogacy.<\/p> <p>  In its current form, the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022 would implement just two of those 27 recommendations, namely, that domestic surrogacy be limited to altruistic surrogacy and that legal advice would be available to potential intending parents.  The remaining 25 recommendations are not reflected in the Bill as it currently stands.  If the Bill is enacted without considerable amendment, it will be contrary to children&rsquo;s rights and best interests in a range of ways.  <\/p> <p>  I will give a quick summary now because I provided a briefing paper that goes through this in more detail.  First, and of most interest to this committee, the Bill only addresses domestic surrogacy arrangements.  It makes no provision, as members are aware, for any legal framework addressing international surrogacy arrangements.  There is a reality here that even if domestic surrogacy is regulated, there will be a continuing number of Irish families who will engage in international surrogacy, whether due to a lack of availability of surrogate mothers in Ireland or for other reasons.  The proposed approach in the Bill of leaving the current void in relation to international surrogacy in place amounts to keeping our head in the sand.  It is contrary to children&rsquo;s rights principles on a number of counts.  Most obviously, it creates a discriminatory position whereby children born through domestic surrogacy arrangements receive a very different level of legal protection compared to children born following international surrogacy arrangements.  It fails to vindicate the right to family life of children born following international surrogacy.  It provides no framework for providing their right to identity.  It will heighten the risk that some of those children will experience statelessness.  In addition, it fails to account for a number of recent judgments of the European Court of Human Rights requiring states' parties to provide a pathway to parentage for children born following international surrogacy.  <\/p> <p>  Second, the Bill makes no provision for retrospective recognition of family relationships arising from domestic surrogacy arrangements which occurred prior to our international surrogacy arrangements, which took place prior to the enactment of the Bill.   Once again, this violates the principle of non-discrimination by treating children differently based on the circumstances of their birth.  It again fails to respect their right to family life.<\/p> <p>  The Bill only currently proposes that children born following surrogacy arrangements would be allowed to access identifying information relating to surrogates or gamete donors from the age of 16.  This is contrary to the legal position which states that the right to identity is a right of all children, and not only a right of children above a certain age.  Equally, it fails to account of extensive research that shows that children who are made aware of the truth of their identity at an early age have better well-being outcomes than children or adults who only learn the truth at an older age.  From that perspective, my report recommended that identifying information should be available from birth, initially to the child's parents, who would exercise the right to identity on behalf of the child and then, subsequently, to the child above a certain level of age and maturity.  Unfortunately, that is not reflected in the Bill in its current form.<\/p> <p>  Fourth, the Bill makes no proposals to address a number of important anomalies which arise in the law governing donor-assisted human reproduction, even though we enacted legislation in 2015 governing donor-assisted human reproduction.  That legislation results in some children falling outside the scope of the protection of that legislation and not having their family relationships recognised.  My report made a number of proposals for filling those gaps and ensuring that all children would be treated equally.  However, again, there are no proposals in the Bill in respect of that.<\/p> <p>  Finally, in respect of the transfer of parentage in domestic surrogacy, the Bill proposes a post-birth transfer of parentage.  My report recommended a pre-birth transfer of parentage to avoid a gap arising in time between the birth of the child and the transfer of parentage, during which time the intending parents would have no right to make decisions in respect of medical treatment of a newborn baby who perhaps might be unwell, premature, or so on.  That will appear to be contrary to the best interest of the child.  However, the Bill, as I said, has settled on the post-birth transfer of parentage, which allows that gap to arise.<\/p> <p>  There are other points, but those are the main ones that I wish to highlight.  My report goes through all of this in more detail.  The briefing paper which I provided for members today itemises the recommendations in the report and benchmarks them against the Bill so they can see clearly where the disconnects arise.  I look forward to discussing all of this with members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022040700002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Conor O'Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":1280,"content":"<p>I now invite questions from the members, in accordance with the speaking rota.

It was discussed in the first session this morning that in contrast to the Hague Convention on international adoption there is not any realistic prospect in the short-to-medium term of a similar international agreement in relation to surrogacy due to the fact that there is no international consensus on the issue of surrogacy.  There is a wide range of approaches taken in various states around the world.  In order to put in place an international legal framework, one needs to secure a consensus of a significant number of states to make that a viable proposition.  That is not where that discussion is at present.  It is not likely to be there any time soon, as far as I understand it, which means in the meantime we need to think about what we do in our domestic law.  Rather than leaving the gaps and voids which we currently have in our law and all of the problems which have been identified that flow from failing to have any laws in place, we need to fill those gaps and decide for ourselves what is the optimum model for Ireland.  In the event that an international consensus emerges down the line, of course, that is a process we can engage in and, potentially, re-look at our domestic law as part of that but leaving a void during a period in which it does not seem realistic that there will be an international convention that will bring international consistency to this area is not a viable approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022040700002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Conor O'Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":1298,"content":"<p>Does Professor O'Mahony agree-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022040700002#N00300","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":1299,"content":"<p>Sorry, Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022040700002#N00400","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":1300,"content":"<p>-----that there are already international agreements in place?

In my report, the safeguards which would be in place consist essentially of court supervision of surrogacy arrangements.  In order to have a surrogacy agreement recognised and to have parentage transferred from a surrogate mother to intending parents, a judge would be assigned.  As part of the ongoing process around the establishment of specialist family courts, we would have specially trained judges with expertise in child and family law who would be in a position to supervise the arrangement and test whether the range of criteria and safeguards which one would insert in the legislation have been met.  My report makes recommendations for what that legislation might look like.  Of course, one could add additional safeguards.  A judge would have to be satisfied that those safeguards have been complied with before an order could be made transferring parentage from the surrogate mother to the intending parents.<\/p> <p>  My report recommends that that process could arise both in the context of domestic surrogacy and international surrogacy.  As we have mentioned, the Bill only makes proposals in that respect in relation to domestic surrogacy.  It does not include any proposals around international surrogacy.  The discussion this morning, which I was listening to, was the first opportunity I have had to hear the rationale from the Department.  I believe there is an issues paper being prepared.  I have not had any engagement with the Department since I submitted my report and I was not aware of the reasoning around why the recommendations have not been implemented.  I can elaborate on this as the session continues but in my view, it would be possible to put in place a court supervision process that could address the question of whether safeguards have been complied with in an international context as well as in a domestic process.  That process, however, given the more complex reality of international surrogacy, would have to be a more involved and more detailed process than it would be for domestic surrogacy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022040700002#N01100","nonspeaker":"Professor Conor O'Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":1307,"content":"<p>I thank Professor O'Mahony.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022040700002#N01200","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":1308,"content":"<p>Deputy Higgins has a bit more time, if she wants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022040700002#N01300","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":1309,"content":"<p>No, that is fine.

Like many people, I am wondering too why some of this stuff has not been implemented.<\/p> <p>  The question I want to ask comes out of the earlier session around this discussion about whether we are potentially looking at new legislation or we are looking at amending the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022.  I would like to know Professor O'Mahony's opinion.  Which is potentially a better option?  Once we have the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022 here, why do we not use that as the framework?  If that is not to be amended, I note in his statement Professor O'Mahony says that it \"will be contrary to children's rights\".  Where does that leave us if we do not change that Bill?<\/p> <p>  My final question, if there is time, is in relation to when Professor O'Mahony states his report recommends \"for international surrogacy [that] parents ... apply to the High Court for parentage ... subject to satisfying a range of prescribed criteria\".  Merely for information, does the professor have examples of what he might think would be prescribed criteria?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022040700002#N01500","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649286000,"counter":1311,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Funchion.  I must confess to being rather taken aback by the suggestion earlier that international surrogacy does not belong in this legislation.  The question I would ask is, if it does not belong here then where does it belong?  My big concern, knowing how legislative programmes work, is that if this does not make it into this Bill we could be looking at a long wait before any separate Bill dealing with international surrogacy makes it back to a process such as this and that intervening period would continue the problems which we have identified around children coming to this jurisdiction where they are legal strangers to one or both parents, where citizenship is an issue and where identity is an issue.  From that perspective, I am clear in my mind that a comprehensive single item of legislation that addresses everything to do with surrogacy but also donor-assisted human reproduction is the appropriate way forward to avoid the situation where it drops off the political priority list on the basis that we have just passed legislation on that and we do not need another Bill or we do not need it soon.  That would be my concern.<\/p> <p>  As to how one goes about dealing with that, of course, there could be different models.  Earlier today, there were comments made about how no other country has yet put in place specific tailored legislation around international surrogacy and how other countries have adapted their family laws to deal with it instead.  As for taking that approach of adapting family laws rather than dealing with it in a specific legislation, first of all there are no proposals in Ireland about what that might look like.  Second, that gives rise to its own difficulties.  For example, adoption might be what they use in France as a means of plugging this gap but it is a very different adoption process, which, I believe, can be completed within three months.<\/p><p>It is very different to here, where it takes much longer.<\/p><p> Adoption is also unsuitable for some people due to health reasons.  For example, a cancer patient who is unable to conceive due to cancer may find themselves also unable to adopt for the same reason.  Equally, the proposals in my report on a specific piece of legislation also take the view that it is better to target surrogacy rather than to adapt general family law because surrogacy gives rise to issues which do not arise in a general family law situation, in particular around the right to identity.<\/p><p> One of the criteria in my report was about ensuring that a child's right to identity could be protected, that we have a donor who is not anonymous and that there is a record keeping situation whereby you can file details of a donor's identity and so on, and that it would be part of the process.  Whereas, if we rely on general guardianship laws, for example, that would not be protected in the same way.  There would be a gap in general family law that would not give that protection to the child's right to identity.<\/p><p> Some of the other criteria related to ensuring that the surrogate has genuinely consented - given free informed consent to the process - which can be done in a number of ways to ensure that laws governing the sale and trafficking of children are complied with.  Again, those are prescribed criteria which I suggest in my report, but which would be absent from the picture if we relied on general guardianship law as the vehicle for recognising family relationships.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022040700002#N01600","nonspeaker":"Professor Conor O'Mahony","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":1313,"content":"<p>I thank Professor O'Mahony.

In other words, in the event that somebody was recognised as a parent in law of one EU member state, they would automatically qualify for recognition as a parent in another EU member state.  That is a proposal which is not specific to the issue of surrogacy, so it would not potentially address quite a number of the concerns around international surrogacy that we have just mentioned.  Equally, it would only be limited to EU member states.  When we talk about international surrogacy, we really cannot afford to zone in on just on EU member states, because it is a much bigger picture than that.  The reality, as we know from experience, is that most Irish couples who travel abroad to engage in international surrogacy travel to non-EU member states.  As a result, EU law is not an appropriate vehicle for dealing with arrangements that arise in Ukraine, California, Canada, or any other country where Irish couples most frequently go.  It is possible that it may smooth over certain issues in certain situations, but it is a much too narrow project to address the wider issue of international surrogacy that we are speaking about today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022040700002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Conor O'Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":1316,"content":"<p>All I really needed to know is whether that piece was going to impact on this piece.

Whereas a domestic surrogacy arrangement could potentially be improved at District Court or Circuit Court level, the higher level of supervision of a High Court proceeding would be appropriate in the case of international surrogacy, to reflect the heightened level of supervision due to the additional risks involved in an international agreement.  As to who would be making the application, that could be Irish lawyers making an application to the Irish High Court.  It could also be that there would be lawyers from another jurisdiction making an application to the Irish High Court.  There is no reason in principle why it would have to be one or the other; in many cases it could be a collaborative effort whereby a couple may have lawyers in each jurisdiction.<\/p> <p>  One of the points that came up earlier was a question on the timing of the application.  There was another issue relating to the two-stage process.  I will deal first with the two-stage process.  Why is it that the report recommended that it would be a two-stage court process for domestic whereas only a single stage for international?  That is simply because on the authorisation question; an Irish court does not have jurisdiction to authorise an arrangement in another country.  That is why there was no recommendation on advance authorisation by an Irish court for an arrangement in another jurisdiction, because it would simply be outside the jurisdiction of the Irish court.<\/p> <p>  The other question was whether that hearing would be held before or after the child arrives in the jurisdiction.  This is a point of detail rather than a point of principle.  It could be either, in principle.  There are advantages and disadvantages to each approach.  I settled on recommending that it would be before the child is brought to the jurisdiction, which I took from the Belgian approach.  The idea there is that if in the event that the Irish court were to look at the arrangement and decide in the course of supervising it that the law of the country where the surrogacy arrangement had taken place was not compiled with, then it would be better to find that out before the child leaves that jurisdiction and arrives here rather than to find it out after the child arrives here in the jurisdiction.  The courts in England and Wales have commented on a number of occasions that by the time a child arrives in the jurisdiction, it creates a situation where it can be quite difficult for the courts to refuse to recognise an arrangement because it is almost too late at that point.  That was my thinking in recommending that the court application would occur before the child arrives in the jurisdiction.  It could take place after the child arrives in the jurisdiction, but it carries that disadvantage of going down that route.<\/p> <p>  The issue was raised earlier as to how that would work with remote hearings in terms of the timing and so on.  My report had recommended that, first, remote hearings are now a feature of Irish courts.  Since Covid, they are very much part and parcel of how Irish courts work.  Equally, however, it is the kind of hearing that could potentially be handled by the intending parents' lawyers and the parents would not necessarily have to be present.<\/p> <p>  On the question of timing and whether this might run into difficulty with visas expiring, my report recommended that this could be scheduled.  There would be a reasonable degree of certainty about the window within which the baby would be born, so we could potentially schedule this in advance on a fast-track situation to avoid lengthy delays between the birth of the child and the holding of the hearing.  That was the model I recommended.  Having said that, there is no reason in principle why it could not equally happen after the child arrives in the jurisdiction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022040700002#O00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Conor O'Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":1319,"content":"<p>I will ask a follow-up question.

It is not an ideal scenario.<\/p><p>That is why a big part of the report was that to seek to avoid some of these issues arising, we would prefer to incentivise people to engage in domestic surrogacy as far as possible.  We can regulate what happens in domestic surrogacy arrangements more effectively and have the advance approval I mentioned, which is difficult to have in the context of international surrogacy because we cannot grant or withhold approval of what happens in another jurisdiction.  If we arrange our laws in such a way that domestic surrogacy is a more streamlined and preferable process for intending parents in order that as many of them as possible stay in the jurisdiction and avoid international surrogacy, then we can try to catch some of these issues before they happen.<\/p><p> How do we do that?  We do it by making the process more attractive to intending parents in this jurisdiction.  The pre-birth transfer of parentage was the mechanism that my report recommended for that purpose.  That would be a more attractive model to intending parents than the post-birth transfer and would incentivise more Irish intending parents to stay here under a higher level of domestic supervision, rather than travelling abroad where there are more variables and things we cannot control.  That was how the report proposed to mitigate those risks as far as possible but we can only mitigate these risks, not fully eliminate them.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022040700002#O00900","nonspeaker":"Professor Conor O'Mahony","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":1322,"content":"<p>I thank Professor O'Mahony for his opening statement and his report, which has been well read and well thumbed by me at this stage.  I too had difficulties with the idea this morning that this is not placed within the AHR and does not have a place in it.  At the core of surrogacy is infertility, which may be medical or social.  Concerning the medical reasons for infertility, we have a practice in Ireland whereby if you have cancer of a particular type, they will freeze your eggs but you may go on to have a hysterectomy.  What was the point of freezing the eggs if you have no womb to carry a baby in?  There is a requirement, at the very least, in the AHR Bill to provide that pathway and deal with that.  I was uncomfortable with certain states within the United States being mentioned this morning and New York, for instance, being left out, which has a very good regime for surrogacy.<\/p> <p>  Professor O'Mahony has alluded to today and mentioned in his report that there are deficits in the Children and Family Relationships Act, one of which relates to reciprocal IVF in same-sex couples.  This relates to social infertility, which affects same-sex couples by their very nature.  It has been said that Ireland does not want to be an outlier or be the first to legislate.   We were the first to legislate in that manner for marriage equality, and nobody had a problem with that.  Particular prejudices are coming out here, rather than genuine concerns.  The shortcomings in the Children and Family Relationships Act discriminate particularly against same-sex female couples.  Will Professor O'Mahony address and explain that?  It is a real issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022040700002#P00200","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649286000,"counter":1323,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  There are two main gaps in the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 with respect to donor-assisted human reproduction.  One is in respect of what are known as at-home procedures, which are where the couple engages in artificial insemination at home rather than through a fertility clinic.  The Bill does not cover that scenario and there is no qualification for the provisions of that Bill to allow for the social parent in that couple to be recognised as the child's parent from birth.  They fall back on the other provisions mentioned earlier around having to wait for at least two years before making a guardianship application.  The rationale for that is that if you go through a clinic, the child will have his or her right to identity better protected because the clinic has record-keeping obligations and the identity provisions of the Bill become operable.  However, my assessment was that creates a situation where the child whose identity is not protected also does not have their family relationship protected and ends up with neither.  It is a disproportionate way of seeking to protect identity.<br\/><br\/>That is why my report recommended an intermediate measure, which was to say that in relation to an at-home procedure where identity is not protected, you could qualify for immediate guardianship upon birth so there would be recognition of the family relationship.  As an incentive to try to ensure identity was protected, where the couple had used an identifiable donor and filed the relevant details with whatever registry was set up to handle this, you would qualify for full parentage and not just guardianship.  That would nudge couples and channel them towards a situation where children born through at-home procedures could have their both their identity and their family relationships recognised and achieve the best of all worlds.  There are no proposals in the 2022 Bill in respect of that point as things stand.<br\/><br\/>The other gap in the 2015 Act was around retrospective recognition of donor-assisted human reproduction procedures which occurred before the legislation came into effect.  The situation there is that, where the couple used a donor known to the couple, they would not qualify for the machinery of the 2015 Act and would have to fall back again on the two-year guardianship wait.  That appears to be based on a rationale of seeking to avoid conflict arising between a known donor and the parties.  However, we saw in a Supreme Court decision called McD. <i>v<\/i>. L, which arose some years ago in circumstances where there was not access to parentage provisions, that if that conflict is going to arise, it will arise anyway.  This provision of the 2015 Act simply does not seem to achieve the goal it sets out to achieve.  For that reason, my report concluded that was not a justifiable discrimination between children born using a known donor versus children born using an unknown donor.  Therefore, that provision should be removed and the couple engaging in the retrospective recognition process should be entitled to make the application, whether the donor was known or not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022040700002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Conor O'Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":1324,"content":"<p>I welcome Professor O'Mahony and thank him for his attendance.  It is good that we are at this point.  Coming from the session we had earlier, I was confused - maybe that is the wrong word - or disheartened that many responses were to the effect that it was very difficult and there is hesitancy because people have struggled to legislate for this so far.  However, the fact, as has often been highlighted by Professor O'Mahony, is that there are children in this country whose rights are not being addressed.  Families are in a lacuna of the law and the last session did not furnish me with hope that the Department was looking towards the remit of this committee, part of which is to legislate and look after the rights and interests of all parents and the children alive and living in loving families in this country.<\/p> <p>  The following might be a naive question and I am trying to get my head around all the legalities of this, so I offer my apologies.  In Part 7 of the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill, the requirements for surrogate mothers and domestic surrogacy are outlined.  Is there a mechanism available to move those requirements in a parallel way so as to register and allow children born in international surrogacy to be accommodated under the same requirements as domestic surrogacy, such as that the mother must be at least 25 and have previously given birth to a child, so that all these things are mirrored and there is a way to check those requirements on international surrogacy?<\/p> <p>  In their statement, the Department of Health representatives stated it is generally understood that most foreign surrogacies involve commercial payments beyond reasonable costs.  As a complete newcomer to this, I note the Department of Health states it understands this to be normal practice.<\/p><p>The surrogacy bodies and the people who are involved in it do not mention commercial payments.  It is more compensation and reasonable costs.  Yet, the Department generally understands this to be the way.<\/p><p> Our issues paper states there are no official data and there is no reliable source.  In Professor O&rsquo;Mahony&rsquo;s understanding, where is the Department getting this general assumption, considering we do not have any official data or reliable source recording any of this?  We do not have reliable sources because the Department is failing.  It is keeping its head in the sand about the reality of modern life and our global world that our citizens are partaking in international surrogacy.  We have to look after the citizens.  Regardless of whether people agree with this, there are children born who deserve rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022040700002#P00400","speaker":"1671","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649286000,"counter":1326,"content":"<p>On the first issue about the discussion this morning around a lot of things being described as very difficult, that was my sense as well, that the reason given for certain things not being done was because they were difficult.  To me, that does not seem to be a legitimate reason.  When I was writing my report, it would have been much easier for me to say I will not say anything about international surrogacy because no other country has as of yet designed a framework specifically for this and therefore I am not going to try.  That would have been a much easier path and it would have taken me much less time, but that was not the route I decided to go down.  Just because we are the first to do something does not have to mean we will never do it or that we will only follow and never lead.<\/p> <p>  The mandate I got for that report was to come up with proposals based on international children's rights law and drawing on the best material available, from the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, the UN special rapporteur on the sale and sexual exploitation of children and the European Court of Human Rights, ECHR.  I attempted to explain what this law would look like.  Of course, there may be points of detail that could be tweaked and so on, but to my mind, just because it is difficult, challenging and complicated is not a reason to avoid doing it.  There is a principled way to design that law from scratch and to be a country that takes the lead and shows how we might do this.<\/p> <p>  This is also a reflection of what I said earlier in response to Deputy Funchion&rsquo;s question, that workarounds that perhaps are available and that work in other countries might not work so well here.  Therefore, we have to adapt to that reality and to what we need here.  Could we mirror domestic requirements in respect of what we will or will not recognise internationally?  &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, is the simple answer.  We could say that and make it clear around, for example, the minimum age or the requirement that someone has had another child with someone.  Yes, we could.<\/p> <p>  The commercial question is where things become a bit complicated.  By its nature, the reality is that in most cases where people engage in international surrogacy, it will have had a commercial dimension.  How else will one identify a surrogate internationally?  That is the reality.  Identifying somebody who will act as an altruistic surrogate for somebody in another jurisdiction is likely to be very challenging.  It is fair to say the majority, if not all, of international surrogacy will have a commercial dimension.  That then gives us the challenge that if that is going to continue to be available in other jurisdictions, which it will, and there continue to be Irish couples bringing children back to Ireland who engaged in commercial surrogacy that complied with local laws in other jurisdictions, we have to respond to that reality.  Right now, we are not responding to it.  Right now, we are pretending it does not exist.  We must have some form of framework for dealing with that.  The detail can be worked out, but we know right now that having no framework for it is problematic and violates the rights of children and the rights of the families.  We have a choice.  Do we continue to allow that situation to persist or do we grasp the nettle?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022040700002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Conor O'Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":1327,"content":"<p>I thank Professor O&rsquo;Mahony for his statement because, as my colleagues have said, this morning was disheartening.

If we go back to 2014, when there was a Supreme Court decision on this point, counsel for the Attorney General went into the Supreme Court in that case and essentially said to the courts we do not want the courts intervening and making radical decisions on surrogacy because the Oireachtas is working on this and there are proposals in development.  That was 2014.  Originally, the proposal was to have that in place before the marriage referendum in 2015.  That was then carved off the 2015 Act because it was deemed to be too complicated to get it finished in the time that was then available.  We then had another Bill in 2017.  We have another one this year.  This is something has been a long time in development.  It has taken us an awfully long time to reach this point.  My fear is that anything that does not make it in now may take just as long to come back around for another pass at it, if not longer.  It could be potentially even longer because we would be looking not at a complete gap but at a partial gap.

Ireland is the third highest country <i>per capita<\/i>to avail of international surrogacy.  We have to legislate, but our framework, as Professor O&rsquo;Mahony said, is non-existent.

I would give my full support to this, because I believe it has to happen urgently.  We cannot be going on and on and on.  As Professor O&rsquo;Mahony said, we need to make sure the framework is correct because it has to be, but we also need to make sure we have a solution here.  We have to look at whatever areas we need to look at.  What would Professor O&rsquo;Mahony like to see us achieve?  What would be his main issue for us so that we can as a committee say, &ldquo;This is what Professor O&rsquo;Mahony is saying to us and this is what we need to deliver&rdquo;?

Of course, this is time sensitive for individual families, but at the same time this is once-in-a-generation legislation that will regulate this area for a long time to come.  From that point of view, rather than rushing something before the summer recess, my preference would be for it to get more time if it needs it to get it right rather than rushing something through that will have gaps or which will be problematic at a later point.  Loath as I am to suggest something should take longer when it has already taken this long to get here, there is a time for haste and there is a time for a more considered approach.  In this context, we have legislation that has taken an overly narrow focus, that is only looking at future domestic surrogacy, and is doing nothing at all about international surrogacy or retrospective cases that arose before the Bill came into place.

Going back to the point I made earlier about the delays we have seen in reaching this point and the risk of opportunities being lost, even though from a technical legal point of view the Government could deal with donor-assisted human reproduction in one Bill and surrogacy in another, I would be of the view that it would be better in this legislation to take as comprehensive an approach as possible to dealing with issues arising in respect of both donor-assisted human reproduction and surrogacy, first of all to ensure we do not miss those opportunities and, second, to try to establish a degree of consistency to avoid discriminatory approaches.  For example, the Bill as it currently stands would create a discriminatory approach on the right to identity whereby children born following surrogacy arrangements would be able to access identifying information at the age of 16 whereas children born following donor-assisted reproduction would have to wait until the age of 18.  It is about trying to avoid some of those anomalies.  Dealing with them both in a single piece of legislation lends itself more effectively to a comprehensive and consistent approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022040700002#R01100","nonspeaker":"Professor Conor O'Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":1342,"content":"<p>Is Professor O'Mahony concerned that if we had a stand-alone Bill to deal with surrogacy the momentum might be lost?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022040700002#R01200","speaker":"1643"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649286000,"counter":1343,"content":"<p>I am, in short.

I ask that we would discuss publishing the paper because it is important.  It has been in the public domain in certain limited places with certain groups I know of.  One of these groups wrote a public letter that addresses where the issues paper points out problems with Professor O'Mahony's report.  It is only reasonable, therefore, that once he has sight of the paper, we hear from him again.  I propose that before the end of this, he has the opportunity to come back and address us because it seems unfair that there is an issues paper that points out difficulties with the report that are disputed very strongly by advocates in this area and Professor O'Mahony does not get an opportunity to address that.  I think that is quite shocking.<\/p> <p>  One of the things that came up when Professor O'Mahony appeared before the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth was the idea that we need to have retrospective provision.  At that meeting, I said that we are hoping here for a very ethical gold standard when it comes to international surrogacy.  Naturally, the retrospective cases will not achieve that standard.  Does Professor O'Mahony support them being ring-fenced and dealt with specially?  They did not do anything unlawful and pursued IVF in as ethical a manner as they could and some had the benefit of laws and knowledge of what to ask for while others did not.  How does one distinguish between those two groups?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022040700002#S00500","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649286000,"counter":1351,"content":"<p>That is an important point.  The short answer is that the Senator is correct that we cannot apply the same rules to the retrospective cases simply because it would not be reasonable to expect people to have complied with very detailed standards that did not exist and which they could not possibly have known about.  In a similar way to how the Children and Family Relationships Act currently does that, where it has a separate process for retrospective recognition as distinct from future cases, my report recommends that we would have a different process around retrospective recognition of surrogacy arrangements with slightly modified criteria to reflect that.  For example, the provisions on whether or not an identifiable donor was used would be softened for retrospective cases because it makes sense to try to build in the strongest protection for the right to identity for future cases.  When people know that, they will then use an identifiable donor and comply with that provision.  It would not make sense to penalise people where family relationships already exist and there are people caring for a child who happened to use an anonymous donor because there was no law on the point at the time.  There are specific proposals in the report about the criteria that would apply for retrospective versus prospective recognition of surrogacy and the Senator will see that there are some slight alterations between those criteria to reflect the fact that we cannot expect people to have done things they could not possibly have anticipated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022040700002#S00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Conor O'Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1649286000,"counter":1352,"content":"<p>I note Professor O'Mahony's comment.  I wish to emphasise that just because something is difficult is not a reason to do it.  One of the reasons we heard this morning was that the numbers are very small, to quote from the statement that will be published at the end of the meeting.  Actually we cannot quantify the numbers because we only know the numbers based on those who applied for an emergency travel document whereas same-sex couples who go to the US or Canada do not require an emergency travel document.  Therefore, we cannot quantify those numbers.  Could Professor O'Mahony confirm that?<\/p> <p>  One of the words that was used about parents is that this is emotional.
