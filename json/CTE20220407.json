No apologies have been received.  In order to limit the risk of spreading Covid-19, I ask that all those in attendance wear face coverings if not engaging with the committee.  The service requests people to continue to wear face coverings when moving around the campus or when in close proximity to others and to be respectful of other people&rsquo;s physical space.  I ask people to adhere to any other public health advice.<\/p> <p>  Members of the committee attending remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of the Parliament.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that, in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of Leinster House.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.<\/p> <p>  This morning we will engage with officials from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, to examine its 2020 financial statements.  The meeting will be suspended for an hour at 12.30 p.m.  When we resume at 1.30 p.m., we will engage with the Policing Authority to examine the appropriation account for Vote 41 for 2020.<\/p> <p>  We are joined in the committee room this morning by the following officials from GSOC: Mr. Justice Rory MacCabe, chairperson; Mr. Hugh Hume, commissioner; Ms Emily Logan, commissioner, who has been here many times previously in a different role; and Ms Aileen Healy, director of administration.<\/p> <p>  When we begin to engage, I ask those who are attending remotely to put their microphones on mute when not contributing so that we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.<\/p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  As the witnesses are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty, as Cathaoirleach, to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Justice MacCabe is very welcome.  As detailed in the letter of invitation, he will have five minutes for his opening statement.

The commission can also investigate matters relating to Garda conduct when it is in the public interest, even if a complaint has not been received.<\/p> <p>  The Commission is structured as a non-commercial State body.  The commission prepares accruals-based annual financial statements.  These are presented together with a governance statement and statement on internal control, as required under the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  The commission operates under the aegis of the Department for Justice and its income is derived from the justice Vote.  The commission&rsquo;s income in 2020 was &euro;11.3 million, while its expenditure was slightly higher at &euro;11.4 million.  Two thirds of the expenditure relates to staff costs and the commission had 127 employees at the end of 2020.<\/p><p>The bulk of the other expenditure comprises almost &euro;1.7 million related to rent, upkeep and overheads of premises, and &euro;1.4 million in general expenses, much of which relates to information technology costs.

This is the first occasion that GSOC has had the opportunity to address this committee.  I am accompanied by Hugh Hume and Emily Logan, commissioners., and Ms Aileen Healy, GSOC&rsquo;s director of administration.  There are additional members of the staff of GSOC also in attendance as observers.  Commissioner Hume has a background in policing at a senior level in the Police Service of Norther Ireland, PSNI, and also served as deputy chief inspector in the Garda Inspectorate.  Commissioner Logan was Ireland&rsquo;s first Ombudsman for Children and also served as the first Chief Commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.<\/p> <p>  GSOC was established under the 2005 Act and commenced operations in 2007 to provide independent oversight of policing in Ireland.  It is a vital interface between the people and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Our work is challenging and results depend on the skill and dedication of our staff, each of whom carries a heavy caseload.<\/p> <p>  GSOC operates seven days a week and 24 hours a day.  We deal with complaints from the public concerning the conduct of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, whether criminal or disciplinary.  We conduct investigations into matters referred to us by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Minister for Justice and the Policing Authority, as well as into matters we judge to be in the public interest to investigate.  We make recommendations arising from the results of our investigations.  We do not conduct prosecutions, which are a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions, nor do we or impose or enforce disciplinary sanctions, which are for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, following the recommendations we make.<\/p> <p>  GSOC&rsquo;s budget allocation for 2021 was &euro;11.272 million.  This paid the salaries and covered the normal day-to-day running costs of the organisation.  We have a staff of 135 at present.  Our headquarters are in Dublin and we have offices in Cork and Longford.  In the course of the year, GSOC sought and received an additional allocation of &euro;300,000 to cover unanticipated additional costs relating to a number of particularly complex investigations that require intensive and extensive resources.<\/p> <p>  There has been a notable increase in the volume and complexity of our cases year on year.  In 2021, there was a 12 % increase in complaints received and a 40% increase in statutory referrals from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where death or serious injury occurred.  It is to the credit of the staff that last year saw a 21% increase in the number of cases that were closed, even in the face of the pandemic, the increase in complaints and referrals, and the loss of some key personnel.<\/p> <p>  By their very nature, some investigations are straightforward and others are not.  Some can be dealt with quickly and others require a commitment in terms of staff, resources and time that we know can be frustrating for all concerned.  This is understandable from the point of view of complainants, who are anxious as to the outcome, and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na whose careers can be, in effect, on the line.<\/p> <p>  GSOC is bound by the principle of due process and human rights legislation.  These apply to complainants and those we investigate so we cannot and should not prioritise speed at the expense of rigour in completing our investigations.<\/p> <p>  Some of the challenges we face arise from the mandate under which we operate.  This is likely to change by dint of the broad reforms proposed in the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill.  Another related challenge is resourcing.  When I came to this job in January, I took the opportunity to be briefed on staffing, resources and on the details of all cases so that I could be sure that cases were being given proper priority.  We have engaged with our teams in Dublin, Longford and Cork.  As a commission, we took the opportunity to visit our teams on the ground in Longford and Cork.  It was apparent that our staffing complement, particularly our complement of investigative staff, falls well short of what is required.  High caseloads and staff turnover, including loss of experienced staff due to retirement or normal civil service mobility, have made this worse.<\/p> <p>  We secured additional funding in 2022 and this will allow us to recruit some additional staff.  I sought immediate approval to recruit 22 additional staff and this was granted by the Department of Justice without hesitation.  Recruitment is, however, not a fast process, particularly with such a range of regulatory organisations fishing in the same pool as we do.  All our staff require special skills to investigate and analyse complaints of negligence or wrongdoing.  <\/p> <p>  The Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill proposes sweeping changes in the law and will change the composition and mandate of GSOC.  The commission will have additional powers and functions, which will, by definition, involve more work and more staff if that work is to be carried out properly.  It is my belief that the Department and the Minister are alert to the ongoing resource issues faced by GSOC and will support us.  We welcome this draft legislation.  It fills a clearly defined and long-signalled gap in Ireland&rsquo;s policing accountability.<\/p> <p>  My responsibility, working with my commission colleagues and staff, is to oversee the work of GSOC and the transition to whatever new organisational structure is mandated by the committee members and their Oireachtas colleagues.  I hope that when they do this, they will be mindful that nothing as complex as investigating wrongdoing in the modern world we inhabit comes cheap.  I hope the committee also recognises the service the staff give and the importance of the work they do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022040700002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Justice Rory MacCabe"},{"type":"speech","time":1649320200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Justice MacCabe.

We did not and do not see ourselves as party to that dispute.  In answer to the Deputy's question as to whether staff work on call, as a relatively new commissioner I would say the organisation is a very dynamic one.  Our investigators do not sit beside a desk or at a desk where they do their work.  They are a very active group of people.  The legislative framework to which they operate is our Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.  Regarding Commissioner Hume's comments on death, when there has been a fatality or serious harm, a group of our investigation teams go out and they are on call at any time, 24 hours a day.  In fact, some of our teams have been called out on five occasions in the space of one week.  They do everything from managing and preserving a scene and its forensic evidence to trying to support and interact with families who are distressed or traumatised.  It is not only the investigatory nature of what we do that is important but the pieces around that too.<\/p> <p>  In response to the Deputy's original question about the public perception of GSOC, we are very sensitive to the current legislation and the perceived question as to who is carrying out investigations in the organisation.  What I will say, as somebody who was an ombudsman for 12 years, is that the dynamic in GSOC is quite different.  When we get to the final phase of an investigation, the commission actively participates in the direction an investigation takes.<\/p><p>We are not sitting in some ivory tower but have very close proximity to the investigation teams.  We are regularly briefed in our supervision of what is going on.  We also have policies which recognise, both for ourselves and for our investigation staff, that there may be an occasion when any of us might have a conflict of interest.  We have policies to support our staff in making those decisions and we ourselves make decisions where it may not be appropriate, with reference to the Deputy's earlier question, for people who may have a policing background in this jurisdiction, to be involved in certain investigations.  That is given very significant consideration.  The Deputy's question about the public is something that is constantly on our minds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022040700002#C03000","nonspeaker":"Ms Emily Logan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649320200,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I thank Commissioner Logan for that.

Whatever Judge Haughton is doing in relation to his scoping inquiry, he needs to be let do that but that does not prevent GSOC from providing those reports to the family.

While he was supposed to be signing on at a Garda station on a daily basis for a period of that time, he was in custody north of the Border.  It is a litany of failures.  The real answers and the causation of all of those failures have never been revealed.  GSOC, the organisation that one would have hoped would have been part of finding those answers, instead was subjugated to a significant delay during which time every other actor in this process refused to answer questions.  The then Minister for Justice and Equality, the then Department of Justice and Equality, the Garda, the DPP and the Courts Service - everybody who was responsible for failures in this case - stated for almost eight years that they could not answer questions because GSOC was carrying out an investigation.  Now GSOC is coming in here and stating that it cannot provide information because there is a scoping inquiry taking place.

There is no member of their family or no solicitor, yet the person about whom the complaint is being made would obviously have somebody there.

We investigate and we have special procedures for interviewing children.  Only staff with a certain level of specialist skills can interview children.  Our general policy is to interview children with an advocate.  Most often in the complaints, children are either victims or are witnesses to a crime.
