The independence and the integrity of the Judiciary is of paramount importance.  The Judiciary has played a vital role in supporting the democratic and constitutional traditions of the State since its foundation and has ensured respect for the rule of law which underpins those traditions.  The Government notes the informal process, which was both transparent and comprehensive, conducted by the Judiciary to address the legitimate concerns arising from Mr. Justice Woulfe's attendance at the Oireachtas golf dinner in Clifden.  The Government fully supports the Supreme Court and recognises the importance of protecting its collegiate nature and its concern to maintain the highest standards.  The Government notes the important distinction between a resignation and the deliberately high constitutional standard of removal for stated misbehaviour.  After very careful consideration, and having listened to the Opposition leaders on this matter, the Government believes the constitutional protection of the Judiciary is best achieved in this particular case by taking no further steps in this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700003#A00300","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna \u00f3 Cheannair\u00ed - Leaders' Questions","time":1605621600,"counter":8,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700003#A00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1605621600,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Leaders' Questions will now be taken.

The councillors took a stand for public housing on public land to meet social and affordable need.  They know this is the only way to tackle this city's overwhelming housing crisis.  The proposal for Oscar Traynor Road in Coolock was a bad deal.  It would have seen a very valuable site gifted to a private developer for free.  Half of the proposed homes would have been sold at unaffordable open market prices and the 20% that were meant to be affordable were not affordable.  The full cost of these homes would have been &euro;325,000 for a one-bedroom home and up to &euro;380,000 for a three-bedroom house.  That is off the wall and it is certainly not affordable for the vast majority of working people.  Under this deal, the council would have been paying over the odds for the social homes and, worst of all, the developer would have pocketed full market value of the land, land that it got for free, meaning significant profits for the developer.<\/p>  <p>  This crazy deal represents the very worst of Fine Gael housing policy.  It is proof positive that as long as housing policy is directed by wealthy developers, we will never fix this housing crisis.  The refusal of the previous Government to fund large-scale public housing developments left councils with few options, but it does not have to be that way.  We can move on from a generation having to settle for the box room of their parents' home as a home for their own families, from couples scrimping and saving every spare euro but still not being able to get a deposit together, and from young people being ripped off by sky-high rents.  We can get a good deal for people who need affordable housing and social housing.  The Government can fund councils to deliver public housing on public land to meet social and affordable housing need.<\/p>  <p>  The Oscar Traynor Road development can proceed in the same timeframe as originally envisaged, but it will need Government support.  It needs the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to work with Dublin City Council to secure a long-term, low-interest European Investment Bank loan and a serviced sites fund grant from his Department.  In other words, it needs exactly the same deal as the one being used for St. Michael's Estate in Inchicore, Dublin 8.  That deal would ensure affordable rents, at approximately &euro;800 per month, and affordable purchases, at &euro;230,000 or less.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach support public housing on public land?  Will he work with Dublin City Council to ensure all of the homes on the Oscar Traynor Road site are genuinely affordable?  Finally, will he instruct the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to assist Dublin City Council to secure the funding that is required to develop the Oscar Traynor Road site as a matter of urgency?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700004#B00700","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1605621900,"counter":35,"content":"<p>First, by way of clarification, my earlier statement was on behalf of the Government.  That is very important.  It is a matter for the Oireachtas in its own time to decide how it wishes to proceed.  That is an important point.  My earlier statement in terms of the judicial issue was on behalf of the Government because the Government has a constitutional duty and responsibility relating to the judicial arm of government in terms of confidence in it.  I think I might have inadvertently said I had spoken on behalf of the Oireachtas.  I did not.  I spoke on behalf of the Government in my contribution earlier.  It is a matter for the Oireachtas independently to take its own initiative if it so wishes.<\/p> <p> On the question of Oscar Traynor Road, we hear a great deal of rhetoric and there are many fixed ideological positions from different political parties on housing.  As a general plea, sometimes we will have to leave ideology outside the room and start building houses in some shape or form.  I attended a Cabinet committee on housing yesterday.  This talk about developers is nonsense.  We do not have a superfluity of developers any more.  We will not build 20,000 houses this year because of Covid-19.  The ESRI says we should build 33,000 housing units per annum to try to keep up with population growth.  We will not meet that target this year because of Covid, and we will not meet it next year.  We will try to get to 25,000.  Of that 25,000, 12,500 will be State builds or approved housing body builds.  It will be social housing.  That leaves 10,000 to 12,000 private sector houses being built.  We all need to concentrate on the reality.  It is grand to say we just want it all one way.  Some people want cost rental, which is valid.  I have great respect for the cost rental model, but there will have to be a mix in different sites.<\/p> <p> This Government has no responsibility for the evolution of the Oscar Traynor Road site, and it is not appropriate that an attempt is being made by the Deputy, and indeed in Dublin City Council in its motion, to enjoin the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, as if it is now his problem and he must resolve it.  This has been ongoing in its most recent phase since 2016.  Dublin City Council's executive had progressed the plan to develop 853 homes on the site, on the basis of 30% social housing, 20% affordable housing and 50% private housing.  The approach was agreed by the council's housing strategic policy committee in 2016 and there was agreement by the full council in January 2017, by 58 votes to four.  The council executive has contended that the council members' voting down of its own proposal may set this site back five to eight years.  The executive said, regarding the council's contention that it would develop the site itself, that Dublin City Council is not a developer or a construction contractor, and the expertise for large-scale construction work of this nature is specific and complex.  The council executive is saying that it would take on substantial legal planning and, above all, funding and financial risks associated with undertaking a development of this scale.  In any event, that was not the model that the councillors had agreed in January 2017.<\/p> <p> Apparently, the site has been vacant since the 1970s.  It was prioritised for development via the housing land initiative and the approach was put to the council chamber.  The council's executive advice, that is, the city management, is that an exhaustive process has been undertaken over recent years.  It considered the most effective way to develop the site in terms of mixed tenure and from the financial perspective.  There was a motion to defer the vote on the issue to have further engagement with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the developers selected by the council and Dublin City Council's consultative group.  However, the council members rejected that and agreed with the proposal that the council would develop the site itself, and that the executive should write to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage for an urgent meeting with regard to developing the site for public housing, referred to as the St. Michael's model.  The Dublin City Council St. Michael's site includes 30% social housing and is 70% the cost-rental model, the cost rental element of which is anticipated to be funded via Dublin City Council's borrowing from the European Investment Bank, EIB.<\/p> <p> The Minister has asked the chief executive of Dublin City Council for a report on the issues, with a view to engaging with Dublin City Council on what the next steps forward are.  That is the current position.  The Minister will meet with Dublin City Council, but I do not suggest that this is all going to be simple or that it will all happen next month.  The decision is significant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700004#B00800","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605622200,"counter":37,"content":"<p>This is not a matter of ideology, but of pure common sense.

Many people, myself included, feel that it is a real sign of foot dragging on the part of the Government that the dispute is still not settled after nearly the duration of a full pregnancy.  Claire's colleagues are forced to picket again today in cold weather and in a lockdown because liquidators, KPMG, refused to give any guarantee that they would not attempt to move stock during level 5.  The picket continues, despite a High Court injunction, and the threat of court summonses and even jailing.  These workers, overwhelmingly women, want to know if the Government intends to intervene to resolve this dispute in time for them and their long-suffering families to have a decent Christmas.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach told Deputy Gino Kenny last week that he has a difficulty letting some moneys owed to the State from this liquidation go to the workers, as it would \"create a precedent that would allow other employers to get off the hook from their obligations\".  Frankly, this is nonsense.  It is a matter of indifference to an employer as to how moneys are divided up from the liquidation of a business.  Not a single extra company will go into liquidation should the State intervene to ensure that Debenhams workers get their two plus two.<\/p>  <p> The fact that the Debenhams workers have been offered &euro;1 million above the statutory redundancy has already set a precedent.  The Government has pledged to bring in new legislation to strengthen workers' rights in a liquidation situation and to make sure that there is never again a case like Debenhams.  If the Government is serious about that, it need not worry about precedent because surely the Debenhams' case will be the last of its kind.  I believe the Government has options here.  It can ask the liquidator to put moneys owed to the State towards the workers.  It can instruct the liquidator to prioritise payment to the workers from sale of the stock.  The stock is valued at a greater sum than the claim being made by the workers.<\/p> <p>It can take the road being suggested by the ICTU by increasing employers' social insurance contributions, creating a new pot, and making an advance payment to these workers.  Talented civil servants are working for the Government.  The Taoiseach can ask them to find an alternative creative solution to this deadlock.  Where there is a will there is a way.  When will the Taoiseach meet these workers and their trade union representatives?  Will the Government put something on the table to resolve this dispute and give these workers the Christmas they deserve? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700006#D01700","speaker":"1522","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605623100,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I congratulate Claire on the birth of Grace O'Leary.  I was aware of the pregnancy from my conversations with organisers of the picket over recent months and their concerns for Claire during her pregnancy in what has been a very difficult situation arising from the liquidation of Debenhams and the failure, in my view, to honour the collective agreement Debenhams had entered into with the workers.  The workers are not being treated fairly.<\/p><p>I will meet representatives of Mandate to discuss the issue further and see if we can find a way to deal with this.  It is not easy, and it is not simple.  I have consistently warned that those who claim it is simple and easy are misrepresenting the situation.  The idea that in every liquidation in the future the State would offer up whatever it was owed would be a real incentive to rogue employers of the future.  Let us not pretend that in the future people could not exploit company law or exploit situations.  The Deputy is suggesting setting a completely new precedent which would have significant implications that would need to be examined.  We have committed to giving greater parity to collective agreements in future liquidation situations or equal parity to others.  That should happen and the Government is prepared to introduce legislation to facilitate that.<\/p><p>In trying to resolve this current row it is about seeing what we can do to try to support the workers over and above what they will be receiving from the State.  The State is honouring its role here and meeting its commitments on statutory redundancy.  In this case the private sector has not met its commitments.  That is the core of the issue.  Historically the <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre<\/i>of statutory redundancy has been that the State is there to give a very basic level of redundancy to those made redundant in the event of the failure of their primary employers to do so.  That is always the context around situations like this.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the real hardship and difficulties people are going through, it is not that simple to just change what has been established precedent in this matter and also to do so without a range of unintended consequences.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700007#E00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1605623100,"counter":57,"content":"<p>The demand is not for the statutory redundancy but for two plus two as the Taoiseach knows.

In recent days we have heard talk of new legislation being brought in to stop people from selling drink from pubs for consumption off site.  This has been looked at and is creating a frenzy within the family of the publicans who do not know what is happening from day to day.  The see the reaction to the scenes from last weekend as a knee-jerk one.<\/p>  <p>  If we want a safe environment for people to have a social drink in, the best way to do it is through the licensed premises that operate a safe and controlled environment.  I am not asking the Taoiseach to state today whether the pubs will open for Christmas but I am asking him to engage with the vintners' federations to make sure that they know in advance what they need to do if they are to open.  Pubs have been open, shut, open and shut again.  Publicans have a lot of money tied up in stock and in credit notes with drinks suppliers.  They do not have cash to live on.  They are saying to me and to a lot of other Deputies that they need to be treated with a bit of respect.  They are licensed, compliant and will not open their premises unless they can do so under the strict rules that will be in place.  I see that myself right across my constituency of Galway East.<\/p>  <p>  In the interests of having a safe environment for people to have a social drink, will the Taoiseach consider my suggestion?  The alternative, as we know, is to have the shebeens, which are in existence, and the house parties, which are uncontrolled with no social distancing.  Even this morning I heard on my local radio station of a taxi driver who brought people home to a house from a party in another place at about 7 o'clock this morning in Galway city and they were reeking of drink.  This is what is going on and we need to get drinking back to a social, controlled and safe environment.<\/p>  <p>  I had a call 20 minutes ago from a publican in Monivea and he said it is a simple ask.  Please engage with the industry to make sure that we can open the pubs, if they are to be opened, and to give them notice to do that.  They have difficulties with finding staff and organising things to get themselves up and running again.  They are at the end of the line.  I ask the Taoiseach to show respect to them.  I know it is difficult but they need to be engaged with now rather than being left waiting for an announcement that they will be allowed to open or not and being given very short notice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700008#F00200","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speech","time":1605623400,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  The Government took the decision to move to level 3, which had significant implications for hospitality in general and for pubs, then decided to restrict household visits, moved to level 4 in some counties, and then to level 5 across the entire country.  What was the motivation behind all of that?  The motivation was simply to reduce community transmission of the virus.  Why?  We wanted to reduce the number of people who will die from the virus, to reduce the number of people who will have illness and prolonged illness because of the virus, and to reduce the spread of the virus.  That is the only motivation for these restrictions.  There is no other motivation.  Believe me, the Government would like nothing better than to reopen society tomorrow morning or next week if that was possible.<\/p>  <p>  Level 5 has worked.  Level 3 had an impact and level 5 has had an impact to such an extent that we are the third best performing country in Europe in reducing the number of cases and the 14-day incidence.  In recent days that has gone back up again.  Some of the numbers have gone up but we are still third best in Europe.  We should acknowledge that.<\/p> <p>It is important to acknowledge that due to the hard work and sacrifices of people across the country, we have made significant progress.  That is very significant for our hospitals.  It is also very significant in terms of keeping our schools open, which has been a significant achievement since September on behalf of all those involved in our school communities.  We have kept construction open.  We have kept quite a lot of non-Covid health services open as well.  That has all been enabled by the restrictions we brought in.  It has been enabled by the sacrifices of the people.  They have sacrificed a lot, including, for example, not being able to go the funeral of a loved one.  That is very tough on people.  Restricting people from visiting another household is a very tough sacrifice for them to make.  Not being able to go out and socialise is a sacrifice that people are making.  Not being able to go beyond 5 km is a very big restriction on personal liberty and freedom.<\/p> <p> Juxtaposed against that are the scenes of last weekend and the previous weekend, where large crowds have gathered outside takeaway facilities.  It is problematic in terms of the overall messaging and maintaining and underpinning confidence in the sacrifices people have made.  We need to acknowledge that.  It is why enforcement of existing laws is important, and we will have further engagement with the Garda in that regard.  The key point is that this issue needs to be highlighted and it needs to be responded to.<\/p> <p> In terms of engagement with different sectors, we will engage with publicans.  However, I have to say that Covid thrives where crowds gather.  This has implications, and has had implications, for the hospitality sector.  When we went into level 5, we said we would try to exit on 1 December into level 3.  I will talk to Deputies on this issue later and we will engage with sectors in advance of any decision the Government takes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700008#F00300","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605624000,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.

I would also say that what we saw at the weekend, with crowds gathering, is unacceptable and is flying in the face of what the majority of people are trying to do.  My concern, and the concern of publicans, is not so much that they want to be open for business but that they want to know, if they are going to open, how they will manage it safely.  The engagement with them is very important.<\/p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach says, Covid transmission will thrive where we have people congregating.  The fear I have is that if we do not have some sort of social outlet, in a licensed and safe way, over the Christmas period, we will have unofficial, unsafe and uncontrolled gatherings like we saw last weekend.  That is a difficulty and I know it is not easy to make any decision.

It is estimated, for example, that the wage subsidy scheme, from its introduction last March to next March, will cost some &euro;5.5 billion.  There are 350,000 people on the pandemic unemployment payment at the moment and it is costing &euro;102 million a week.  The new Covid restrictions support scheme, which assists businesses that have been closed for some length of time or the turnover of which has gone way down, will cost a very significant amount as well.  The issue of supporting and underpinning industries, particularly the hospitality, travel and tourism sector, is one that is constantly within the Government's sights.

It is a constituency that has seen little real Government funding for decades.  Such funding can, and has been, a game changer in other constituencies.  Our roads, such as the N71 and the R586, have seen only pothole and storm damage repair funding down through the years.<\/p> <p>The only improvement to the N71 that gave thought to the future was the Skibbereen bypass opened in 2003.  Some 17 years later, the promised bypass in Innishannon and the southern and northern relief roads in Bandon have been abandoned by the State as budget after budget has omitted these projects from any plans, just as they have omitted passing bays on the N71 from Bandon to Skibbereen and the R586 from Bandon to Dunmanway and Bantry.  These omissions mean that the job-starved west Cork cannot encourage the creation of good jobs as a result of bad roads infrastructure that has been neglected for decades.  <\/p> <p> Speaking to those who want to develop Clonakilty, I have heard that plans to develop 600 badly needed houses are in real jeopardy due to a lack of funding being spent by Irish Water, which will result in the town facing water shortages in the not-so-distant future.  The rural regeneration fund has given out millions over recent years but the only shovel-ready project the council has put forward in years, the Schull harbour development project, which would have guaranteed dozens of jobs in a rural community, has been scandalously overlooked for funding while other projects across the country which were only aspirational received millions.  Businesses are being flooded in Bantry town on a nearly weekly basis.  They have been pleading for funding from the Office of Public Works for decades to carry out works but have been left to fend for themselves.<\/p> <p> The Taoiseach may tell me that these issues arose under previous governments and that change is coming, but his Government had its chance last week with the announcement of &euro;63.5 million in greenway funding, not one brown cent of which came to west Cork to fund great greenway projects such as those proposed to run from Cork to Kinsale, from Inishannon to Bandon and along many other parts of west Cork's old railway line.  Greenway cycling and walking routes could have easily been rolled out in these areas and would have been a huge boost to those areas if developed but again the Taoiseach's Government overlooked this opportunity.<\/p> <p> The Taoiseach will say that it is easy for me to point out what is wrong in west Cork without seeking a solution.  One solution I will put to the Taoiseach today is the establishment of a special task force for west Cork.  If set up, such a task force would have to have a clear focus on jobs and funding for our roads and important projects in west Cork, which are overlooked year after year.  <\/p> <p> With regard to Bandon, in a recent Zoom meeting I had with the Bandon Business Association I saw that its members are full of energy and have many ideas about how to pick up their town after Covid-19, but they need state aid.  They need the State to focus on the town's needs.  They spoke of the need for the northern relief road and the urgent need to finish the southern relief road if the town is to make any headway.  They spoke of a new focus from IDA Ireland on jobs for Bandon.  There are serious questions over IDA Ireland.  When did it last announce jobs for Bandon?  These are all matters on which the task force should concentrate if set up.  Bandon has also seen a major lack of investment in its educational needs as children are refused entry to the secondary school.  I ask the Taoiseach to set up such a task force for west Cork immediately to put us on a level playing pitch with the rest of the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700009#G00400","speaker":"1461","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605624600,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising a range of issues pertaining to west Cork.  He may, at any stage, raise issues with me if he wishes.  Deputies Christopher O'Sullivan and Cairns have come to me with individual projects.

The Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, in particular was alert and quick in responding to the needs of the various towns that were flooded.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy talked about high-quality jobs.  I was in Clonakilty in September and the enterprise park in that town has been a particular success, as the Deputy will know, as a result of historic investment.  I was there for the announcement of 150 additional jobs by Global Shares, which brings the total number it employs to approximately 500.  That company will grow again.  It is a very exciting and interesting company.  I was at its foundation when I was Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  It is high-tech and based in Clonakilty.  It demonstrates the capacity of Clonakilty and other towns to attract quality companies of that kind because of the good quality of life.  As the Deputy will know, there is a very enterprising culture and spirit across west Cork, particularly in the agrifood industry which has grown out of the various co-ops from Carberry to Barryroe.  These are high-quality, effective co-operatives that create employment in their localities.  Before Covid, the area had thriving food, culture, entertainment and tourism sectors.  The tourism sector has obviously taken a very big hit because of Covid and we must do everything we possibly can to help.<\/p> <p>I will take on board the road projects the Deputy has identified and I will discuss that with the county council, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and the Minister who is involved.<\/p> <p> I assure the Deputy that I will leave no stone unturned in doing everything I possibly can to encourage investment into west Cork.  In particular, I will see if we can fast-track any State projects that are in the pipeline because much capital has been allocated in this year's budget with &euro;10 billion to be spent next year.  The real issue will be the capacity of the State to deliver those capital projects across the length and breadth of the country, including in west Cork.  If greenways were shovel ready, there would have been money made available for them.  I have no doubt about that.  I am alive to the potential for the old west Cork railway line becoming an exciting and interesting greenway project.  I would be keen to advance that and Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan has been in touch with me about the Innishannon to Bandon route but again my sense is that it needs a bit more advancement to a stage whereby if funding was allocated, it would be spent on it fairly quickly.

I would be reluctant to get involved in another group, if the Taoiseach were to do the same thing on another issue, because it seems as if last Friday was a fishing exercise.  Why did the Taoiseach not call all the leaders to come together after today's Cabinet meeting, state what the Government believed and then ask us what we thought?  We may have varying views.<\/p> <p> I asked the Taoiseach a simple question last Friday, which I do not mind repeating now because I have said it in public so often.  I asked for the other correspondence.  I see no reason the Chief Justice cannot release the other correspondence, which would then give us a fuller picture of what has happened in this case.  The Taoiseach did not even come back to me regarding that issue.  I asked him to do so.  I ask him to show me where he did.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700011#J01700","speaker":"1610","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605625800,"counter":86,"content":"<p>The time is up, please, Deputy Kelly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700012#K00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1605625800,"counter":87,"content":"<p>The Deputy knows my position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700012#K00300","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1605625800,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I do not know the Taoiseach's position, because all I did was read it in the media.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700012#K00400","speaker":"1610"},{"type":"speech","time":1605625800,"counter":89,"content":"<p>Deputy Kelly knows my position on the separation of powers, because I made it clear to him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700012#K00500","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1605625800,"counter":90,"content":"<p>That is nothing to do with the separation of powers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700012#K00600","speaker":"1610"},{"type":"speech","time":1605625800,"counter":91,"content":"<p>Deputies, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700012#K00700","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1605625800,"counter":92,"content":"<p>The separation of powers is being misused by the Taoiseach's Government across a whole range of things, and he damn well knows it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700012#K00800","speaker":"1610"},{"type":"speech","time":1605625800,"counter":93,"content":"<p>No, Deputy Kelly, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700012#K00900","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1605625800,"counter":94,"content":"<p>The separation of powers works both ways.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700012#K01000","speaker":"1610"},{"type":"speech","time":1605625800,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I ask Deputy Kelly to please resume his seat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700012#K01100","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1605625800,"counter":96,"content":"<p>We must hold the Government to account for its decision-making as well.

That is so important, and it is important for us to uphold that separation.  I take on board what Deputy Kelly has said about ensuring the separation of powers is never misused.  I agree that it works both ways.s  That is why I believe it is important and imperative that the Minister for Justice should come before the House at some stage that would be deemed to be appropriate to answer questions in a comprehensive way.  At the same time, it must be taken into account that it is very important that a transparent and comprehensive process, as has already been stated, is undertaken by the Judiciary.

The Taoiseach is being disingenuous in his approach on this matter.  He has stated, correctly, that the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, forwarded one name to the Minister for this appointment but he equally knows that three serving judges had applied through the second channel, which is the channel to the Attorney General, and so the Minister, Deputy McEntee, had four names on her desk.  The Government must be accountable for the process thereafter, when the Minister arrived from four candidates to the single name that she brought to the Cabinet.  The Taoiseach has stated publicly that he was unaware of the three other applicants.  The leader of the Green Party, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has similarly said he was unaware of that.  Therefore, legitimate questions arise as to what happened, how the Minister, Deputy McEntee, arrived at her decision to bring forward the single name and who was involved in that process.  The Taoiseach may try to hide behind the division of powers but he should remember that one of the essentials of our system, which he and I wish to protect, is the accountability of the Executive to the Oireachtas.  The Taoiseach is duty-bound and the Minister for Justice is duty-bound to present herself to make a statement and to take the questions from Members of the Oireachtas on this important matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700017#P00400","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1605627900,"counter":146,"content":"<p>I do not believe the Taoiseach has any choice in moral terms but to ask the Minister, Deputy McEntee, to come in here.

This is a far more serious issue in my opinion.  It seems the Taoiseach is the first Taoiseach in the history of this State not to be consulted in any way in regard to the appointment of a Supreme Court judge.  Some taoisigh may only get to do this once but the current Taoiseach had no role, hand, act or part.  What was said to him during the programme for Government negotiations, in which there were two parties along with an acting part of a Government negotiating to get into government, was that Mr. Woulfe had come through the JAAB process and that his appointment was likely.  It is likely that Tipperary is going to win the all-Ireland this year but we also could lose next Saturday.  That is not a definitive action; it means nothing.  It is irrelevant when it comes to this process.  The Taoiseach is the only Taoiseach who has never been consulted, according to what is out there now in regard to the appointment of a Supreme Court judge.

Given what the Taoiseach has said about the process, namely, that the JAAB process was the proper route, the one person involved in that in bringing forward or considering other names is the Attorney General.  Was there a conflict of interest?  Was that something that was declared?  There are many things arising here.  As the Opposition, we have to a job to do in holding the Government to account.

Right now, throughout the State, children as young as eight and nine years old are consuming explicit, hardcore material that would have been illegal just a generation ago.<\/p><p>I might get the Taoiseach's attention on the Bill if I can.<\/p><p>Research by the school of psychology in NUI Galway has shown that almost 60% of 13-year-olds in this State have consumed hardcore pornography.  Children as young and eight and nine have free access to extremely explicit material.  No matter how good one's parenting skills are, children will always have an opportunity to get access to this type of material on an electronic device in school or in someone's house.  The reason this type of material is so damaging is because it has an enormous effect on the minds of young children.  It can skew their understanding of relationships and sexuality.  It can be addictive.  It can also lead to sexual violence and rape.  Indeed, there have even been murder cases in recent years, in particular the heartbreaking case of Ana Kri&eacute;gel, where a sexually aggravated attack by two boys led to her death.  One of those boys was found with 12,000 extremely explicit images on his phone.  We know that when we allow this material to come into the hands of very young children, it can radically skew their understanding of the world and can lead to violent outcomes.<\/p><p>It is important that as a State we come to some level of solution on the issue.  Previous governments have been asked to legislate on the matter.  They have spoken in very hushed tones about how serious this is, but nothing has been done.  All we have had are shrugs and politicians sitting on their hands.  Aont&uacute; is seeking to bring about a Bill that would make the provision of this material to children illegal in this country in future.  My personal view is that nobody has the right to access this market for any product.  If someone seeks to access it, he or she must adhere to the rules of this country.  If someone seeks to sell a bottle of vodka to a 13-year-old, the State does not say how the off-licence works out the age of the child, it says the off-licence must do it, and if it does not comply, then it cannot operate in this country anymore.<\/p><p>What we have done in the Bill is created a responsibility on the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications to make regulations with regard to this matter.  First, the Minister would engage with all of the stakeholders in society that have an interest in this particular sector.  Second, we have looked at the rules governing the responsibilities the many companies that provide pornographic material operating in Ireland have with regard to the provision of this material to children.  Pornhub, for example, operates in Dublin.  We have looked at Internet service providers and payment service providers and the roles that they play with regard to the provision of this material.  Internet service providers are the companies that provide the Internet to a person for &euro;40 every month.  The payment service providers are the companies that allow one to pay for goods and services over the Internet through credit cards and by other means.<\/p><p>There is a precedent for the Bill.  A number of years ago, large film companies saw that Internet service providers in this State were streaming copyrighted films, free of charge, into the Irish market, which obviously radically reduced their ability to make an income from their product, so they brought those Internet service providers to court and the Internet service providers were told by the judges to stop the access by these sites into the Irish market.  What happened is that those websites were blocked.<\/p><p>What the Bill seeks to do is to get ComReg to send notices to Internet service providers, who are allowing websites to provide explicit hardcore pornographic material to children, informing the companies either to work out a mechanism whereby they can tell the age of the people who are consuming that content or after a period of time their website will be blocked in the State.  We have seen the mistakes made by the British system in this regard and we have got around it by the production of regulations.  We ask wholeheartedly that this Government does not become the latest in a long list of governments to sit on its hands on this issue, shrug and say it cannot do anything.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700020#S00500","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1605629400,"counter":220,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700020#S00600","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1605629400,"counter":221,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700020#S00700","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1605629400,"counter":222,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1605629400,"counter":223,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700020#S00900","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1605629400,"counter":224,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700020#S01000","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1605629400,"counter":225,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Organisation of Working Time (Domestic Violence Leave) Bill 2020: First Stage","time":1605629400,"counter":226,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700020#S01200"},{"type":"speech","time":1605629400,"counter":227,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to provide for a period of paid leave as a consequence of domestic violence and for that purpose to amend the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, to extend as a consequence the protection against unfair dismissals conferred by the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2015 and to provide for the consequential amendment of certain other enactments, and to provide for related matters. <\/blockquote>  <p>I wish to share my time with Deputy McDonald.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700020#S01300","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1605629400,"counter":228,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

I know that behind almost everything that we do here, there are very good intentions.  However, I feel that this Bill, which we in Sinn F&eacute;in have brought forward here today, is incredibly important legislation.  Quite simply, the Bill seeks to provide for a period of paid leave for people who are the victims of domestic violence.  This legislation is an important addition to existing workplace rights.  The provision of a statutory entitlement to paid leave is an acknowledgment by legislators of the challenges workers face when trying to escape an abusive relationship.  If we are to end the epidemic of domestic abuse in this State, we need a whole-of-society response that both supports and protects women.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in's legislation provides for up to ten days' paid domestic violence leave.  Importantly, workers do not have to provide proof of their abuse or documentary evidence for the leave needed, as to do so would potentially act as a barrier to victims seeking the support they need.  As with existing leave entitlements, the legislation enables an employer to refuse or terminate the leave where she or he believes the worker is not using the leave for the specified purpose.  I want to be clear: business has nothing to fear from this leave.  This would be done in a very organised way to ensure that the benefit accrues to the worker.  It is not in any way anti-business.  In turn, the worker has recourse to the Workplace Relations Commission in such circumstances where the leave has been taken for the specified purpose but has been terminated or, indeed, refused by the employer.<\/p>  <p>  Research tells us that abusive partners do not care one little bit about the split between home and work.  These abusers deploy a variety of methods to harass, intimidate and hurt their victims.  We have seen and heard of situations where stalking, persistent telephone calls or threats occur in the workplace.  Coercive control, which is now recognised under the Domestic Violence Act, can lead to abusers focusing their efforts on a partner's workplace for the purpose of getting them sacked.<\/p> <p>Legislators and employers have a responsibility to respond to this avenue of abuse by putting in place the necessary workplace and employment rights protection for victims.  I know much-needed statements on domestic violence will be taken on Thursday.  Along with talking about it and recognising the problem of domestic violence, we need progressive action and positive solutions, which is what Sinn F&eacute;in is trying to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700020#S01500","speaker":"1467","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605630000,"counter":231,"content":"<p>Covid-19 has heightened awareness of the depth and breadth of domestic violence and abuse.  Every day during the first six months of the pandemic, 19 women and three children contacted a domestic violence service for the first time, seeking support and safety from abuse and coercive control.  Coercive control is now a crime and last month's landmark judgment sends a simple message to abusers to stop.  However, despite the significant increase in demand for services, this year domestic violence and abuse continues to be under-reported due to stigma, shame and fear.  One in five women will experience violence in their own home and 41% of Irish women know someone in their circle of family or friends who has experienced intimate partner violence.<\/p>  <p>  Domestic violence is mostly talked about as occurring in the home, but in reality the abuse often follows victims into the workplace.  Co-workers may be aware of a colleague's abuse, but in the absence of a workplace policy they are unsure of how best to support them.  Managers need guidance on how to recognise the signs of domestic abuse and how to respond to a staff member's disclosure.  Employers in the public and private sectors must introduce domestic violence awareness policies and procedures for managers and staff.  As legislators, we also have a role in protecting women in the workplace and ensuring victims' rights and entitlements as employees are enhanced and protected.<\/p>  <p>  Our legislation provides for a statutory annual entitlement of up to ten days' domestic violence paid leave.  This provision would enable victims to take the time they need to seek support, find accommodation or attend court in a structured and supported environment.

That Bill had the support of all the Opposition parties, and I expect that this Bill should enjoy the same support.  While we continually got confusing feedback from Ministers for Justice and Equality in the previous Government, the key issues that need to be resolved regarding additional Garda powers in this area are clearer than ever.  By and large and by its own admission the Garda has sufficient powers in a general sense.  However, it requires the power of seizure without interception.<\/p><p>In the majority of cases scrambler bike users are juveniles.  The idea of a Garda driver pursuing a 14 or 15-year-old across a public park at high speed is rife with dangers for the garda, for the public and for the scrambler rider himself or herself.  However, the Garda does not have the power at present to identify where the rider lives, identify the scrambler in the curtilage of the property, and subsequently to confiscate it on the basis of antisocial and dangerous use in a public space.  This is not just me saying this; this is the factual and real-time position as outlined to Deputy McAuliffe and me by senior garda&iacute;.<\/p><p>Too often I have seen the antisocial use of scramblers destroy open spaces in my constituency, including in McGee Park and Killinarden Park in Tallaght.  Too often this antisocial use has taken place while juveniles are on-site, training or playing matches, which have subsequently had to be abandoned.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the work of local garda&iacute; in Tallaght for their interventions when these activities occur.  This Bill will give them the powers they require once and for all.  Any other issues, such as additional resources, are secondary to this legislation which is required.  In most cases already when garda&iacute; have been able to identify the illegal, antisocial and dangerous use of scramblers, the bikes have actually been confiscated and, in most cases, destroyed.  I hope the House supports the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700021#T01000","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speech","time":1605630000,"counter":240,"content":"<p>It is a great pleasure to introduce my first Bill to the House with the support of my colleague, Deputy Lahart, who did so much in the last D&aacute;il on the matter and had the support of the entire Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  The programme for Government includes a commitment to legislate to address the problems caused by illegally driven scrambler bikes.  The problem is well understood by the Government, from the top, the head of Government, An Taoiseach, who has seen it at first hand in my constituency, right down to every community impacted by the issue.<\/p>  <p>  The programme for Government signalled a change in direction, a signal to those in the permanent government, the Civil Service, that is not okay to leave things as they are.  We have heard too many stories of people who have been injured, including a young boy will never have the same smile after it was smashed by a scrambler bike, an old lady who was prevented from calling an ambulance until the perpetrators cleared the scene, a young boy with special needs who suffered two broken legs, and the many people who have died.<\/p>  <p>  Illegally driven scrambler bikes make many parks and other green spaces too dangerous for people to enjoy and destroy facilities relied on by sports clubs.  Their use involves antisocial behaviour, the movement of illegal drugs and organised crime.  It presents a real challenge to order in our communities and undermines the confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill does three things.  Section 2 amends the definition of a public place in the principal road traffic legislation.  This contrasts with previous Bills which amended a certain section.  Section 5 makes it an offence to ride a scrambler bike dangerously in a public place and makes confiscation the penalty for this offence.  Section 6 directs the Minister to make regulations to provide for the seizure of scrambler bikes in the curtilage of the dwelling.  Property confiscated under the Act can also be disposed of rather than being available for collection.<\/p>  <p>  It is imperative for the Government to approach the issue with a whole-of-government response, involving different Departments.  Legislation such as this needs to be supported by a package of non-legislative measures by other Departments.  This is the first step in the Government delivering on its commitments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700021#T01100","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1605630000,"counter":241,"content":"<p>Is

The DPO continues to ensure that the Department's data protection policies, notices and procedures are in place and are regularly updated.

The first relates to the records of the interdepartmental committee to establish the facts of State involvement with the Magdalen laundries or, as it is more commonly known, the McAleese report.  In its statement on mother and baby homes last month, the Government committed to ensuring that the rights of all citizens to access personal information about themselves and their rights under GDPR are fully respected and implemented.  The Government also committed to providing the additional resources necessary to fulfil this commitment.  The Government's confusion on GDPR rights demonstrates the need for Departments to invest in data protection expertise.  This point is relevant to the Taoiseach's Department as it holds the records of the McAleese report.  The Taoiseach has confirmed that persons can access their records and I want to know what preparation and additional expertise he has put in place to ensure that this commitment can be met.<\/p>  <p>  I also want to raise with the Taoiseach the significant number of data protection breaches identified by Departments last year.  In total there were 778 breaches across 15 Departments but just three Departments accounted for 80% of these breaches.  The Department of Social Protection accounted for more than half, followed by the Departments of Justice and Foreign Affairs.  Of considerable concern are the breaches that took place within the Department of Justice, notably the loss of a USB stick relating to the Hickson commission of investigation.  The device was lost in transit along a one and a half kilometre route between two Department buildings on Hanover Street and Haddington Road in Dublin and was never recovered.  The loss was recorded in May 2019 but the first the victims learned of this data breach was in the media last month.  The Taoiseach is aware that victims of Mr. Bill Kenneally have fought a long battle for the establishment of this inquiry.  They have also raised very significant concerns that have not been adequately addressed by the Minister for Justice or the Garda Commissioner.  I hope the Minister for Justice has informed the Taoiseach of these matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700022#U00800","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1605630600,"counter":272,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy.

The survivors I talked to expressed great concern about that fact and went on to say that they have been given indications that it is the intention of the Government, as a priority, to reverse the legislation that set up the statutory education fund which was to provide support to survivors of industrial schools.  They say that the Government is prioritising this and is essentially washing its hands of its obligations to survivors of industrial schools.

I would like the Taoiseach to respond on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700022#U01600","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605631200,"counter":281,"content":"<p>In regard to Deputy Boyd Barrett's point, they were met at the time.  I was Minister for Education and Science during that period and became Minister for Health and Children in 2000.  I established the inquiries in question and was the first Minister to open up the dark chapter in our history relating to industrial schools.  We put historians into the Department of Education and Science and we put counselling in place for the people who came to access their records.  Some of them discovered they had siblings they had never known of because of the way they were separated by the cruelty man or the courts and sent off to these schools.  It was horrific what was done to many people.<\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, a redress scheme was established.  More crucially, the Department of Health and Children set up a special counselling service that was specifically targeted at survivors of the industrial schools.  It took two years to set it up because the Department and the experts said we needed really well-qualified child abuse and sex abuse counsellors who knew what they were doing to staff it.  Various support groups were established at the time, the Aislinn centre being one example.  We had various State agencies helping with access to education, supports for apartment construction and securing housing.  A whole plethora of supports were provided at the time.  I understand the Deputy referred to the Caranua fund, which has been ongoing for a number of years.  It is coming to an end but we will have a look at it.  I am talking to the Minister for Education about that.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy McDonald asked about records relating to the mother and baby homes and the Magdalen laundries.  Access to the commission's archive is governed by the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 rather than the Commission of Investigation (Mother and Baby Homes and certain related Matters) Records, and another Matter, Bill 2020.  I have spoken on the record about the fact that if we had not introduced the 2020 Act, the entire database would have been made redundant and been destroyed.  It was correct that the legislation passed through the Houses.<\/p>  <p>  The general data protection regulation, GDPR, will apply to the archive.  The Attorney General has been emphatic on that point and has clarified it for anybody who needed clarification.  Individuals will have a right to apply for access to their own personal data held by the Minister in the archive of records once it is deposited by the commission, which I understand will be in February 2021.  Files have also gone to Tusla and people will have access to them there as well.  We are currently examining the matter and hope to be in a position to make a comprehensive statement on it at the time of the publication of the mother and baby homes report.  That statement will include, for example, the question of where we archive, how we archive and how we tell the story of all these institutions, from the industrial schools to the Magdalen laundries to the mother and baby homes, in a way that does justice to the victims.  We have to consult widely in this regard.  I was talking to the groups concerned at the weekend and some of them, particularly direct survivors, have different perspectives on how that should be done.  We must try to include everyone in the process.  It is the Government's intention to create a centre that could help to provide insights to future generations on all of these areas.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the mother and baby homes, the GDPR prohibits a blanket ban on the processing of personal data.  Documents furnished to the Department, when they are deposited with the Minister in February 2021, can be considered in the context of individual requests by data subjects.  Those requests must be processed on an individual basis and in accordance with current relevant statute.  In terms of the Magdalen laundries, the McAleese committee set out that the archive of the committee's work, which is deposited and stored centrally in the Department of the Taoiseach, would contain only copies of official records identified from across all Departments, State agencies and bodies.  The originals of all such identified records have stayed in their original files and locations in order to avoid disturbance to, or destruction of, original or archived files.  Access to any personal records can be sought, under the GDPR, from the relevant public bodies, subject to the normal procedures.  The committee set out that the archive would also contain certain materials generated by or for the committee in the course of its work, such as correspondence, minutes and some statements and submissions.  We will do everything we possibly can in this matter.  Our view and disposition is to facilitate access for survivors to their records.  No right is absolute, however, and the process is part of the GDPR framework.  GDPR stems from European Union law and trumps other regulations.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the other issues raised by Deputy McDonald, I will follow up on them.  The loss of the data device to which she referred was not something that occurred in my Department.  This group of questions relates to the data protection unit in my Department.  We have gone wide on it, which I accept.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's questions, I have not investigated leaks from the previous Administration.  It would be unprecedented to do so.  I have never heard of it happening before that one would routinely go in and start making inquiries about, or having investigations into, previous Governments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700023#V00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1605631200,"counter":282,"content":"<p>I asked about the T&aacute;naiste breaking Covid restrictions last May.

The\u00a0importance of gathering for worship as a source of consolation\u00a0and hope at Christmas time was stressed.<\/p>  <p>  The archbishops emphasised the mammoth effort that has been\u00a0made by priests and volunteers at parish level to ensure that\u00a0gatherings in church are as safe as possible.  They also pointed to the consistent\u00a0messaging from the church about the protection of health and life\u00a0for all in the community, particularly the vulnerable.  I thanked the archbishops for their support and acknowledged the\u00a0major role religious leaders have in supporting people and\u00a0giving hope at this time of stress and worry by reaching out to those\u00a0who may feel isolated or marginalised.  It was acknowledged that\u00a0pastoral work continues at parish level, even as the celebration of\u00a0mass is moved online.  The challenges faced by people suffering\u00a0bereavement at this time were acknowledged, particularly as we\u00a0enter the traditional time of remembrance in the month of\u00a0November.<\/p>  <p>  I outlined the reasoning behind the Government's plan for living\u00a0with Covid-19 and the need to strike the right balance between all\u00a0forms of social and economic activity and public health.\u00a0 The archbishops emphasised the need to protect the most\u00a0vulnerable in society at this time.  They also acknowledged the\u00a0positive value of keeping our schools open, especially for those\u00a0who may otherwise be educationally disadvantaged by not having\u00a0access to technology or the daily support of their teachers.\u00a0 The need for a shared understanding of the effects of the\u00a0pandemic as it evolves, and an alignment of our responses accordingly, was\u00a0recognised.  All agreed on the importance of ongoing constructive\u00a0engagement and solidarity in facing and overcoming the\u00a0challenges of Covid-19 together.  In responding to the pandemic, governments everywhere are making decisions that are judged to be the right ones for their country, society and economy.  With the introduction of level 5 restrictions in Ireland, our objective, working together, is to reduce the spread of the virus and make it safer to reopen society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700023#V01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1605631200,"counter":293,"content":"<p>Before I begin, I note that in the Taoiseach's response to the last round of questions, a number of the questions were not answered.<\/p>  <p>  The issue raised in this group of questions is very important and I am glad that we are discussing it.  Every weekend, my daughter organises for my mother - her granny - to watch mass from Portroe on YouTube.  My mum goes to mass every single day of the year and long may that continue.  Mass is a huge part of her life.<\/p> <p>She is, obviously, very devout.  We need to look at these matters favourably as we come towards December and the Christmas period, particularly for our elderly, many of whom go to the religious services of their different faiths.  We need to look at this issue in a compassionate way.  December is a very important month.  November is the month of remembrance but December includes the build-up to Christmas and Christmas itself.  If we go down to level 3, there will be no masses unless an exemption is made.  The Taoiseach has made it quite clear that it is his ambition to move to level 3 but I urge him to consider some form of exemption for religious services and for small congregations.  Perhaps - dare I say it - masses, meetings, comings together and various different religious services could be held on multiple occasions and we could facilitate those who want to attend.  I urge the Taoiseach to consider the options to facilitate those of all ages, but particularly the elderly who really miss these services.

Ireland, however, has the second lowest incidence of Covid in Europe but the sixth most severe restrictions in the world.  People might say that those two issues are related but the fact is that restrictions come with a massive cost.  Religious practice is one of those costs.  Religious practice is a human right under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  This is no small issue we are talking about.  The practice of religion is a significant element in people's lives.  Some 100,000 people in this State do as Deputy Alan Kelly's mother does and go to mass on a daily basis.  Well over 1 million attend religious services weekly.  I got a phone call from a 93-year-old woman today who said that her physical and mental health are significantly deteriorating due to her lack of access to the social setting that is a religious service.  Faith is also a significant pool of strength for many people in very difficult times.<\/p>  <p>  I know we have to make evidence-based decisions, but Government data show very few outbreaks of Covid-19 associated with places of worship.  Religious buildings are often the biggest buildings in any given town and services were run like clockwork in most communities until we entered level 5.  Significant social distancing was operated.

Contrary to his last contribution in response to my question, the survivors I am talking about are saying their needs are not being met.  They say that the promises made by Bertie Ahern and previous Governments in which the Taoiseach was involved to deal with intergenerational poverty, the deprivation suffered by many survivors of the industrial schools, to provide for their mental health and counsellors they choose, to provide real housing support to people in really appalling housing conditions and so on, have not been met.  They say that many of the bodies set up were set up without proper consultation with survivors and over their heads and that real engagement, particularly with some of the victims worst affected who tended to come from poorer backgrounds, has not really happened.  They say the commitments and promises made have not been met.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach clarify whether he is proposing dissolution legislation?  If so, is this effectively a case of the State washing its hands of its obligations to those survivors?  We have had a campaign to repeal the seal on people's histories and records.

It is the kind of intergenerational solidarity that will get us through the pandemic.  What comes across is the importance of faith to many in our community, which Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n also mentioned.  It is good for people's mental health to get out and about and to get to church.  The support that is there is important.  The meeting really focused on level 3 restrictions because the archbishops accepted that level 5 involved severe restrictions but what was a surprise to them was that in the original iteration of level 3, mass had been excluded and they were making representations on that.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n mentioned other countries.  In France, places of worship may remain open for private prayer but no religious ceremonies may take place with the exception of funerals with a maximum of 30 in attendance and weddings with a maximum of six in attendance.  In Northern Ireland, places of worship remain open with a mandatory requirement to wear face coverings when entering or exiting.  Funerals are limited to 25 attendees.  In England, places of worship are again only open for individual prayer.<\/p>  <p>  What originally motivated a lot of this was that, in the first phase of the pandemic, religious events in other countries proved to be a vector.  These may have involved larger congregations but they proved to be significant in the transmission of the virus.  Public health advice has been extremely cautious in the context of such gatherings.  That said, we will take on board what the Deputy and others have said.  We are reflecting on this in terms of exiting level 5, which we want to do at the end of this month.  We will take on board sectoral representations, particularly the issue of worship and people's opportunity to attend mass and other services safely and within controlled environments during Advent and the lead-up to Christmas.  That is what we will seek to do.<\/p>  <p>  We want to get back to level 3 but we will look at certain aspects of it because, as I said earlier, we have done a fair bit of work over recent months to see as best we can the optimal triggers for the spread of the virus.  We have worked to understand what particular events have been triggers and what has caused spikes in case numbers.  NPHET will also advise us on all of this.  We do not want to open up and then have very high numbers again in January or February.  There will be a great focus on personal responsibility and the avoidance of large crowds both indoors and outdoors.  The virus thrives where large crowds congregate.<\/p>  <p>  On Deputy Boyd Barrett's point, what happened to those who were committed to industrial schools was an appalling abuse by the State at the time.  It is very easy for people living in the modern era to look back.  These homes all evolved from previous iterations.  A combination of forces committed people, from the cruelty man, to the courts and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  People made decisions arbitrarily that, because a woman was separated or the father in a home had alcohol problems, someone clearly said a person was going into a home as where they were was no fit place to be.  This was said to me by survivors.<\/p>  <p>  The State responded comprehensively and that should be acknowledged.  Perhaps the Deputy's point is that it needs to continue to respond but let us not decry and undermine completely and say that nothing was done.  A lot was done.  The redress scheme was simply designed to make sure that people did not have to go through the courts.<\/p> <p>When we originally made the response, we removed the Statute of Limitations requirements to facilitate industrial schools, but in essence they would have been in the courts for years.  That would have been too much anguish and it would have been too difficult for them.  That is why the redress scheme was developed in a bona fide way to try to accelerate some redress for the survivors of the industrial schools.  My view always was that it was much more in redress and that the focus and emphasis should always be on the housing, health, counselling and other supports that people required, given the impact that being in an industrial school had on their lives and the degree to which it shortened their education possibilities.  To a certain extent, survivors of the industrial schools felt stigmatised and lacked self-esteem and self-confidence.  Their presence in the industrial schools did a lot of damage.  I will engage with the Minister for Education on this and I will try to ascertain where we are in terms of the needs of those who survived the institutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700024#W00600","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605632400,"counter":301,"content":"<p>Will the Taoiseach come back to me on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700025#X00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1605632400,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I will.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700025#X00300","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cabinet Committees","time":1605632400,"counter":303,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700025#X00400"},{"type":"question","time":1605632400,"counter":304,"qnumday":9,"qnumall":"[34837\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700025#X00500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on health will next meet.

In addition to the meetings of the full Cabinet and of Cabinet committees, I meet Ministers on an individual basis to focus on different issues.  I regularly meet the Minister for Health to discuss priorities in the area of health and in particular our management and response to Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  The Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with Covid-19 sets out our approach and priorities for managing and living with Covid-19 in a range of areas including, among other matters, prevention of infection and protection of vulnerable groups; health system response and resilience; and continued resumption of public service delivery, including non-Covid health and social care.  It is important to recognise that many vital services have continued throughout the pandemic, ensuring that priority care needs were addressed and the most vulnerable protected even at the height of this crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Winter 2020-21 will be a particularly challenging one for the health service.  We recently allocated a record &euro;600 million for the 2020 winter initiative to ensure we meet the demands in the health service in the coming weeks and months.  A range of initiatives have been developed, and as these continue to be rolled out, we will see further service resumption and increased capacity across the community, including primary care; mental health; older persons; disability services, and the acute hospital system.  This includes implementing new initiatives, new ways of working and ehealth solutions to keep people safe and out of the acute hospital system, for example, epharmacy, eprescribing and virtual clinics.<\/p>  <p>  At the beginning of this month, a range of measures came into effect that will make day-to-day healthcare more affordable for more than 1 million people across the country.  Under the new measures, the over 70s medical card income limits have increased to &euro;550 per week for a single person and to &euro;1,050 for a couple, benefiting up to 56,000 people.  There has also been a 50 cent reduction in prescription charges for all medical card holders, which will benefit over 1.58 million people with medical card eligibility.

The outcome of the assessment was published late last month and it makes heartbreaking and alarming reading.  The area considered by the assessment has had a female suicide rate three times the national average since 2015.  However, it was the deaths of eight women in their 20s and 30s over a short ten-week period that prompted this assessment.  Four of the women were from Ballyfermot and the others were from Clondalkin, Tallaght and Palmerstown.<\/p>  <p>  The assessment notes that there was a palpable sense of fear and anxiety that these deaths would have a further contagion effect.  The report sets out that underlying trauma is at the root of anxiety, depression or poor mental health for women in the area.  Various examples of childhood trauma, including alcohol or drug use, mental ill health, domestic violence, childhood violence and abuse, were identified.  The housing crisis was also notable for its inclusion in the challenges faced by young women and their children who experience persistent homelessness and housing insecurity.  The report found that a fear of Tusla removing children from mothers is a reason women do not seek help.  Young mothers living in poverty and with abuse are afraid of State intervention.  That needs to change.  Almost all cases cited in the report refer to domestic violence as a key issue.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE is to be commended for commissioning this rapid assessment.  Its purpose is not to apportion blame, but to identify gaps in service provision, protections and strategy.  I am gravely concerned that there is a lack of pace in urgently delivering the resources, services and reforms that are essential to protect women and their children, despite the fact that many of the solutions are in plain sight right in front of us and have been delivered in other jurisdictions.  I want this to become a matter of priority all across the Government.  It should be an absolute priority for the Cabinet committee on health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700025#X00700","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1605632400,"counter":309,"content":"<p>This is a process issue with the Minister for Health but what happened yesterday with regulations going to the Cabinet and then being dismissed has happened before.  This is not the first time the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, has been involved.  Surely we do not need to have this crazy situation in which Ireland takes off because of some half thought-out plan for health measures that is then jettisoned by the Cabinet.<\/p>  <p>  I want to raise two issues, both of which the Taoiseach knows are close to my heart.  The first of them is the case of John Wall.  Last Tuesday, he wrote to the Minister for Health and said he would not be in a position to support what the Minister is doing.  John Wall and I support the medium-term and long-term plans of the Minister for Health and I commend the Minister for a number of them.  However, in the short term, and the Taoiseach knows well that John Wall is terminally ill, we need to sort out 24-month terminal illness medical cards.  In fairness to the Taoiseach, he told me last week he would get this done, which is the most emphatic thing he has ever said back to me.  I am begging the Taoiseach to get it done.  John Wall needs this and he has worked on this.<\/p>  <p>  The second matter I wish to raise is the CervicalCheck tribunal.  The Taoiseach knows that is in a no-go area and at a standstill.  The 221+ group, particularly Vicky Phelan, Lorraine Walsh and Stephen Teap, are not willing to support it as it is constituted on the basis of the Statute of Limitations issue, the returning cases issue and a number of other issues.  I have had long discussions with the Minister for Health on this.  This is at an impasse.  The Minister for Health has said he will go forward with this one way or the other.  That is not the right thing to do.  He should resolve the issues but this cannot go on any longer.  It cannot go on beyond this week and for those three individuals, it will not go on beyond this week without them making a statement on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700025#X00800","speaker":"1610"},{"type":"speech","time":1605632400,"counter":310,"content":"<p>I got a letter yesterday from the HSE's health business services, HBS, in response to a parliamentary question.  It is the interestingly named business division of the HSE, which seems like a contradiction in terms.  Why do we need a business section of the health service?  This was a response to a question about the contract that was awarded to CPL for recruitment in the context of Covid-19.  As the Taoiseach knows, CPL has been recruiting people from Be On Call for Ireland, nurses, contact tracers and those working in testing on rubbish temporary contracts, as I would see them.  By the way, if the Taoiseach wants to know why the numbers are not going down, he might look a little bit closer at the fact that people on CPL contracts do not get sick pay and so they are under pressure to go into work.  The people we are recruiting to the front line do not get sick pay.  It is no wonder we have cases of Covid-19.  Leaving that aside, this letter confirms that CPL went through no tendering process for the contracts to recruit for the health service during Covid-19.  Rather, it was \"using existing HSE Procurement Frameworks\" and \"a framework agreement for other recruitment services\", to mention some of the jargon it employs.<\/p> <p>This is a hugely valuable contract, although it has not been said how much it is worth.  It is worth noting that in the past week CPL has been sold to a Japanese multinational company for in excess of &euro;300 million and the two owners of CPL walk away with &euro;110 million.  To what extent has the State inflated the value of that company and the huge payout that those people are getting by giving contracts where there is not even a tendering process and where they are recruiting to the health service for rubbish contracts without even sick pay?  That is a scandal, as far as I am concerned.  Whatever excuse there might have been in the emergency in the early months of the pandemic, for that to continue to be the situation and for CPL to be the vehicle for recruiting to the front line of the health services in the current situation is an absolute scandal and unacceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700025#X00900","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605633000,"counter":312,"content":"<p>Regarding the questions from Deputy McDonald, I too commend the HSE on its analysis and study of a very worrying and deeply troubling female suicide cluster in Ballyfermot and in other areas the Deputy identified, and the multiple factors that gave rise to the issues there.  I will engage with the chief executive and board of the HSE to ensure that this issue gets priority attention.  The lessons from this will inform wider application of policy and engagement and intervention, because that is a significant cluster in a relatively short period.  I think the Deputy mentioned ten weeks.  On the lack of pace, I will put the point made to me to the HSE in that regard.  There is no shortage of resources.  There are other issues outside the remit of the HSE in respect of housing, for example.  The Deputy also referred to Tusla, and that also needs more assessment in terms of the fear the Deputy said there was in respect of removing children from families and that could cause considerable distress.  I will pursue those issues.  They are grave and they need focused action in terms of the lessons to be drawn from it, and whatever additional supports are required in that locality among a cohort of women who could be under pressure should be provided across all fronts.<\/p>  <p>  On the questions from Deputy Kelly, as I said earlier, I think it is very important that the issue regarding the gatherings on our streets arising from takeaway pints is addressed, discussed and brought to Cabinet, because I think it needed to be highlighted from a public health perspective.  The word has to go out that enforcement will intensify regarding recurrence of this phenomenon, which has been ongoing for about two weeks, mainly in the cities, and does need to be addressed and responded to.  There is existing legislation in the form of by-laws in the two cities that have been identified this weekend.  The Garda is reporting that crowds are dispersing, but it felt there was a significant change in behaviour last weekend.  That might have been some degree of complacency because the figures were better the previous week and people felt that perhaps we had turned the corner in respect of reducing the incidence rate.  We have not; the numbers are back up.  Remember, the numbers we are seeing in the past three or four days were seeded a week or ten days ago.  That is of concern to us in respect of where we will be at the end of this month with numbers.<\/p>  <p>  Numbers are critical.  If we keep community transmission rates low, we keep hospitalisations and ICU occupancy levels low for Covid-19.  That enables us to keep schools going well and keep the non-Covid related health services in particular at the levels where we want them to be.  That is the objective.  We are doing this to try to keep the pressure on the virus and stop it from spreading and damaging people, lives and livelihoods, as it has done since it started, and not just here but across the world.  If we look at what is happening in Europe, many health systems are under real pressure in respect of their acute hospital systems and their ICUs now.  Thankfully, we are not in that position.  We are the third best at the moment in the incidence of cases and the impact on hospitalisations and ICUs.  We want to keep it that way and we want to keep that performance.  That demands all our collective efforts and people have sacrificed a lot to get here.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the situation concerning 24-month, terminally ill patients, and John Wall has been a strong advocate for this for quite some time, the Minister published the clinical report, and the Deputy said that he supported his longer - I do not think they are that long - and more medium-term ideas.  The Government considered the issue last week and the Department of Health is currently examining it.<\/p>  <p>  On the CervicalCheck tribunal, as the Deputy will know, the Meenan report gave rise to the need to establish negligence.  That then moved on to legislation, which was passed by the previous Oireachtas.  The Government has decided that it will consider this issue again next week at its Cabinet meeting, and the Minister will bring a memorandum outlining where we are in respect of the outstanding issues.  It is down to recurrence.  The Deputy mentioned the Statute of Limitations.  We do not believe that will be that significant an issue.  We think we can deal with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700026#Y00400","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1605633000,"counter":313,"content":"<p>We are running out of time, Taoiseach, and I am obliged to stop.

The issue of awarding military medals for gallantry, MMG, and the distinguished service medal, DSM, to personnel who served in Jadotville in September 1961 has been considered on a number of occasions over the years.<\/p>  <p>  The siege of Jadotville was a prominent event that occurred during Ireland's peacekeeping mission in the Congo in September 1961 where A Company, 35th Infantry Battalion, came under attack.  From the 13 to 17 September the men of A Company endured almost continuous attack.  At the end of the siege, the men were taken into captivity until finally released on 25 October 1961.<\/p>  <p>  In 1962 and 1965 a properly constituted medals board considered the issue of the award of medals, including nominations, that had been submitted in respect of a number of the men of A Company.  This medals board did not award any medals whose citation that mentioned Jadotville.  This decision was subsequently reviewed by the medals board and it was indicated that the issued raised had received due consideration and that the board was not prepared to alter its findings.<\/p>  <p>  In 2004 a broader examination of the events at Jadotville was conducted by military officers.  This board recommended that the events of Jadotville and the contribution of the 35th Battalion be given recognition.  The outcome of this broader examination of the events at Jadotville has led to a number of initiatives that honour the collective actions and bravery of the men of A Company at Jadotville and recognise the very significant contribution of A Company and of the 35th Battalion, as a whole, to the UN peacekeeping mission in the Congo.  The Deputy will receive my written reply, which goes through what we have done to date.  I asked the Chief of Staff to consider this issue and he has recommended that we set up an independent expert review body to look at the issue again in the context of today's thinking around Jadotville.  We hope to have that process concluded with a recommendation by the end of March.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700027#BB00600","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1605633600,"counter":324,"content":"<p>The Minister is aware that next year marks the 60th anniversary of the siege at Jadotville.

I welcome that a review body has been established.  Hopefully, it will validate the original recommendation from the commanding officer at the time.  We are aware there was much political pressure on at the time, and there was a perception that these brave men were cowards.

Those decisions should be made by an appropriate process that ensures we protect the value of the receipt of medals.

We worked for more than three months with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to put in place a new scheme for the Naval Service, which was essentially a going to sea incentive scheme to get people to commit to going to sea for two of the next four years.  I think that scheme will be successful.  We are finalising the terms of its implementation with representative bodies at the moment.

There is currently a project ongoing under the remit of the Department of Transport to consider, develop and bring to fruition a new marine search and rescue aviation contract for future service provision.<\/p><p>The current contract for the SAR helicopter service is between the Department of Transport and a civil helicopter operator, CHC Ireland DAC.  The contract commenced on 1 July 2012 for a period of ten years, with an option to extend for a further three.  The existing contract was extended earlier this year for one year to 2023 to facilitate the lengthy procurement process and ensure compliance with the public spending code.<\/p><p>A next generation SAR aviation steering group has been set up under the auspices of the Department of Transport and is led by the Irish Coast Guard to manage the procurement of the next SAR aviation service.  Personnel from the Department of Defence and members of the Air Corps are key stakeholder members of the steering group progressing this contract and have played an active role in the group&rsquo;s discussions since its inception a number of months ago.<\/p><p>The defence organisation is supportive of the Department of Transport&rsquo;s programme to put in place the next generation SAR contract.  A strategic assessment and preliminary appraisal document in line with the public spending code was agreed by the steering group and brought to the Government for information in July.  The preliminary appraisal included an appraisal of various service delivery options, including one in which the State assumed full responsibility for the service, either through the Air Corps or through a dedicated Irish Coast Guard aviation branch.  Both were ruled out for various reasons.<\/p><p>I agree with the strategic assessment and preliminary appraisal and I do not see the Air Corps taking full responsibility for SAR services in Ireland&rsquo;s search and rescue domain.

Our Defence Forces currently participate in three EU military operations: Operation Irini, the European Union training mission in Mali and Operation Althea.\u00a0 Ireland's participation in the EPF does not impact on the Defence Forces' role in these operations.\u00a0 Under the EPF, Ireland will continue to contribute to the costs of these missions\u00a0and the other three\u00a0military CSDP operations.

I would contend that we need to increase funding in many areas and that is what we are doing under the White Paper.  The EPF is about creating a more efficient mechanism to fund EU activities in other parts of the world where we are trying to bring about peaceful resolution to conflict and build capacity through training, etc.  For example, the EU makes a significant financial contribution to African Union peacekeeping forces in Somalia, without which that country could have collapsed.  These are serious missions aimed at trying to allow states to survive, prosper, grow and stabilise.  They are complex, messy and difficult at times.  I believe we will support the EPF when it is finalised.  We are trying to ensure that various countries' different perspectives on what should be funded will be reflected in the design and function of the mechanism.  In other words, countries that are not comfortable with funding certain things should not be forced to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700030#EE01200","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna Eile - Other Questions","time":1605636000,"counter":370,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700031#FF00100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Strength","time":1605636000,"counter":371,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700031#FF00150"},{"type":"question","time":1605636000,"counter":372,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[36561\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700031#FF00200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the establishment number for the Defence Forces by Army, Naval Service and Air Corps; the actual number of personnel serving in each branch of the Defence Forces; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","time":1605636000,"counter":373,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[36623\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700031#FF00300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the number of new recruits that have enlisted in the Permanent Defence Force to date in 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","time":1605636000,"counter":374,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[36574\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700031#FF00400","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the steps in hand to address the issue of the strength of the Defence Forces with particular reference to the attainment of optimal strength; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","time":1605636000,"counter":375,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[36621\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700031#FF00500","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"when he expects the numbers in the Defence Forces to reach the approved threshold of 9,500; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1591","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1605636000,"counter":376,"content":"<p>My question is to ask the Minister the establishment number of the Defence Forces, broken down by Army, Naval Service and the Air Corps, and to compare that with the actual number serving.

The military authorities have advised that at 30 September 2020, the strength of the Permanent Defence Force was 8,529 personnel, comprising 6,878 Army personnel, 752 Air Corps personnel and 899 Naval Service personnel.  The Government remains committed to restoring the strength of the Permanent Defence Force as soon as possible.  However, this will take time.<\/p>  <p>  The Public Service Pay Commission report undertook a detailed analysis of recruitment and retention difficulties in the Defence Forces.  Implementation of the high-level plan, Strengthening Our Defence Forces - Phase One, is a key part of the response to address recruitment and retention issues.  The immediate pay increases were delivered, and further pay measures will be considered as part of the next pay negotiations.  A range of non-pay measures are also being progressed.<\/p>  <p>  I have acknowledged that there are ongoing difficulties in the Defence Force and these have been well documented.  The Naval Service is a case in point and a new seagoing service commitment scheme for Naval Service personnel and an extension of a tax credit for seagoing Naval Service personnel are examples of targeted measures I have introduced aimed at retaining experienced Naval Service personnel.  This follows the reintroduction of a successful service commitment scheme for flying officers in the Air Corps.  As I have said, other measures will be considered as part of the next pay negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  There have been 449 inductions to date this year, including 316 general service recruits, 67 cadets, 20 Air Corps apprentices, five direct entry specialists, three recommissioned officers and 38 re-enlisted personnel.  Covid 19 has impacted on the numbers inducted this year.  Other initiatives such as recommissioning of former Air Corps pilots have also assisted in boosting much needed specialists, and I understand that further specialist officers will be recommissioned soon.  The re-enlistment of former enlisted personnel is another initiative that is to be welcomed.  While the numbers being inducted are lower than initially anticipated, all will play an important role in restoring capacity.<\/p>  <p>  The programme for Government provides that a commission on the Defence Forces will be tasked with examining a range of issues.  This will provide an opportunity to chart the future direction for the Defence Forces.  There is also a commitment to establish a pay review body for the Defence Forces when the commission has completed its work.  Working closely with the Secretary General and the Chief of Staff, and a range of key stakeholders, I am confident that the current challenges facing the Defence Forces can be overcome.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v that the important starting point is to know where we are, to be honest about that and to put in place targeted initiatives to respond comprehensively to a Defence Forces that is effectively 1,000 people below where it should be in terms of strength.

A greater emphasis needs to put on retention.  We talk about recruitment and retention, but my understanding is, and I am more familiar with the Army than with the other two branches, namely, the Naval Service and the Air Corps, that after five years, many good, young people with great skills and expertise leave.  I understand that in the past there existed a pre-discharge leave of 90 days whereby a person who decided to leave after five years had the option of re-enlisting if he or she changed his or her mind within the 90 days.  At times people took that option and enlisted again so that this particular human resource was not lost to the Army.<\/p>  <p>  I understand from speaking to people in the Army that too many people are discharged for minor medical ailments, ailments for which people would not be discharged from other physically demanding jobs in the public service.  Maybe it is time we visited that particular issue as well.  Also, in the past when a person completed five years, there was an incentive offered to the person to stay another four years, be it a monetary award or some particular leave arrangement.  Those particular measures worked in the past.  They need to be revisited to ensure we get our numbers back to the promised strength of 9,500.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700031#FF00800","speaker":"1556"},{"type":"speech","time":1605636000,"counter":380,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the Minister's response and the efforts that are being made.

The truth is that a lot of people in the Defence Forces were head-hunted by the private sector.  For example, in Cork, many members of the Naval Service were effectively targeted as highly skilled and motivated engineers for the pharmaceutical sector and were offered big pay packets to leave.  When we saw rapid employment growth over the past seven or eight years, that had an impact on retention within the Defence Forces generally.<\/p>  <p>  We need to learn from that and we need to ensure that we introduce targeted incentives where appropriate to try to address it.  The Air Corps is a good example of that.  When pilots were in short supply in the private sector, a number of pilots left our Air Corps.  When the aviation sector has got into trouble, we have seen some of them return through re-enlistment programmes and so on.  We have also introduced financial incentives around retention for key skill sets.  Pilots are a good example in the Air Corps.  We are putting in place a similar type of scheme for the Naval Service.  It is clearly a problem persuading people to go to sea in terms of lifestyle choice versus other options that are available to people.  We need to incentivise people financially to go to sea, which is exactly what this new seagoing retention scheme is all about.<\/p>  <p>  I hear what people are saying.  I give some reassurance that this is not just about plans for the future.  We are spending extra money now to improve our retention numbers and to increase recruitment.  We are also setting up a commission in the next few weeks which will again look at all these things, including looking at international best practice.  When Deputies see the membership of the commission they will see that we are taking these matters very seriously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700031#FF01000","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1605636600,"counter":382,"content":"<p>One of the attractions previously of serving in the Garda or the Army was that when a person went out on pension, he or she could get a new job and have the pension.

However, if that person moves into the private sector, he or she can keep the pension and get the private sector wages but the skills are lost to the public sector.

It will be clear that certainly there is the capacity on that commission to look at all of these issues, including Border issues.<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of pensions policy, I get asked about pensions policy quite a lot in the context of some of the Defence Forces representative bodies.  The Association of Retired Commissioned Officers, ARCO, in particular raises the matter, and understandably so for their members.  It is important to state that the Minister for Defence does not control pensions policy.  That is very much the domain of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The truth is that it is the overall package that people look at, although I think that when people in their late teens or early 20s join the Defence Forces, most of them are not thinking about their pension at that point but rather are thinking about conditions of work, pay, allowances, whether they will be able to serve abroad, and the structures within the Defence Forces to allow them to move up the ladder over time and so on.  I hope many of the young people who have joined the Defence Forces in recent years will look forward to a very ambitious report coming from the commission in 12 months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700032#GG00300","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Remuneration","time":1605636600,"counter":385,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700032#GG00350"},{"type":"question","time":1605636600,"counter":386,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[36575\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700032#GG00400","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the extent to which concerns in respect of pay and conditions affecting the Defence Forces have been resolved or are in the course of being resolved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","time":1605636600,"counter":387,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[36585\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700032#GG00500","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the number of new recruits who have enlisted in the Permanent Defence Forces to date in 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1453","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","time":1605636600,"counter":388,"qnumday":445,"qnumall":"[37064\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700032#GG00600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the extent to which the issue of pay and conditions within the Defence Forces is being addressed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1605636600,"counter":389,"content":"<p>I am deputising for Deputy Durkan.

The Minister hit the nail on the head in terms of the challenges faced by the branches.  The best I can do is offer him the example of the Clonakilty branch of the Irish Red Cross.  It is an incredible branch and covers all of west Cork, a huge area.  As the Minister mentioned, it deals with events, race meetings, summer shows, concerts and festivals.  None of these has happened this year, so its income stream has been cut off completely.  That has left it in a very precarious position.  The Clonakilty branch had established a state-of-the-art facility in Clonakilty, but it has had to leave the premises.  It had two ambulances and now the ambulances have nowhere to go.  There is nowhere to conduct its training or to store the ambulances.  It is in a very severe predicament.  I am requesting a further injection of funding from the Minister's Department.  As regards the situation in Clonakilty, where the branch does not have a premises anymore, could the Minister intervene and see if it could somehow secure a premises or land on which to build a premises?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700033#HH00600","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speech","time":1605637200,"counter":400,"content":"<p>Regarding the securing of land locally, I am not familiar with the individual case, but I suggest that a conversation with Cork County Council might be helpful.<\/p>  <p>  An extra &euro;10 million was allocated in the budget for this community stability fund, if one can call it that.

The programme for Government states that the commission will be tasked with undertaking a comprehensive review, which will include the following matters:\u00a0arrangements\u00a0for the effective defence of the State at land, air and sea; structures for governance, joint command, and control structures; the\u00a0brigade structure; pay\u00a0and allowances and composition of the Defence Forces; recruitment,\u00a0retention and career progression; and the\u00a0contribution of the Reserve Defence Force, RDF, including its legislation and\u00a0Defence\u00a0Forces regulations governing it, and whether specialists from\u00a0the RDF should be able to serve overseas.<\/p>  <p>  The programme for Government also provides that the\u00a0commission is be established before the end of the year,\u00a0with a mandate to report within 12 months, and as I indicated earlier, I am working with officials in my Department in order to ensure we are well ahead of the timeline.<\/p>  <p>  My immediate priority concerns the commission's terms of reference.  In accordance with a commitment made in the\u00a0programme for Government, I have consulted\u00a0widely on the terms of reference and analysis of all of the various submissions received is still ongoing.<\/p> <p>In this regard, I expect to finalise draft terms of reference for the commission shortly and to bring proposals to Government for approval in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p> Regarding membership of the commission, the programme for Government states that the commission will contain a wide variety of expertise such as management, human resources, academia, law and public service, as well as members with external military experience from countries similar in size to Ireland and also from states which, like Ireland, are non-aligned militarily.  While consideration of these criteria is under way and various names are in discussion, no decisions have yet been made on membership of the commission.  Ultimately, this and the commission's terms of reference will both be matters for decision by Government shortly.<\/p> <p> The impact of climate change will of course be of relevance to the work of the commission.  In this regard one of the roles assigned to the Defence Forces by Government, in the White Paper on defence, is to contribute to national resilience through the provision of aid to the civil authority supports to lead agencies in response to major emergencies and in the maintenance of essential services.  The White Paper also provides that, under the framework for major emergency management, the Defence Forces have a support role to the lead agency in major national and local emergencies.  In a major emergency, such as a severe weather event, all the available resources and capabilities of the Defence Forces are made available to the national co-ordination group for the purpose of providing assistance.  Unfortunately, that is becoming a more frequent experience now.<\/p> <p> Regarding future investment, the White Paper update, which was approved by Government last December, recognises that demands on future capability will need to take account of climate change objectives.  The update notes that the effects of climate change are continuing to lead to changes in weather patterns and an increased probability that severe weather events such as flooding could become more commonplace in Ireland.<\/p> <p> Climate change and issues arising from it for the Defence Forces are already clearly signposted in existing key Government policy documents on defence.

From my previous time in the Department of Defence when the Deputy held the purse strings, I was not alone in caring about the Naval Service as he was extremely supportive at the time.  I recognise that.  Coming from a coastal county, he understands why that is so important as do I.  I am frustrated and concerned that we do not have the capacity to put ships to sea or as many as we should be putting to sea because we do not have enough personnel to crew them.  We will fix that.  The first step in that has been designing a scheme which is really about retention within the Defence Forces and the Naval Service to get a commitment over the coming years for people in the Naval Service to stay in the Naval Service and be willing to go to sea.  We are willing to pay them to do that - &euro;5,000 for each of those two years, &euro;10,000 in total for a commitment to go to sea for two of the next four years, which is how the rotation works.<\/p>  <p>  We have tried to include as many Naval Service personnel who will be on ships as possible in that scheme.  We needed to set some parameters for qualification.  Therefore, people who are in their first three years in the Naval Service, many of whom will be still in some form of training, are not eligible, but everybody else is.  If we have six ships with approximately 50 per ship, that is 300 people.  I would expect that 200 or more will be eligible for the scheme, but the make-up of the crews and how long they have been in the Naval Service will depend on the cycle.  We are working to try to get as many people into the scheme as we possibly can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700035#KK01100","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Estimates for Public Services 2020: Message from Select Committee","time":1605639000,"counter":438,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700036#LL00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1605639000,"counter":439,"content":"<p>The Select Committee on Justice has completed its consideration of the following Further Revised Estimates for Public Services for the service of the year ending 31 December 2020: Votes Nos. 20, 21, 22 and 24.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700036#LL00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"\u00c1bhair Shaincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Matters","time":1605639000,"counter":440,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700036#LL00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1605639000,"counter":441,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 37 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Steven Matthews - to discuss an Environmental Protection Agency report on water quality which highlights raw sewage outflows in 35 locations across Ireland;

This evening Sinn F&eacute;in is proposing a motion to deal with the unlawful and dangerous use of quads and scramblers which has resulted in serious injuries and deaths in our communities.  Six people have died and 60 have been injured, many in life-changing ways, over the past five years.  The scourge of scramblers and off-road motorbikes is at an all-time high across urban centres in this State.<\/p><p>The current practice whereby garda&iacute; do not follow or apprehend those using or driving quads or scramblers in an unlawful and dangerous manner must change.  Garda&iacute; do not have the required training, resources or legislative power to address effectively the unlawful use of quads and scramblers.  I know of no other area of the law that garda&iacute; will openly admit they cannot tackle or are prohibited by their management from tackling.  I understand that it is a difficult decision and safety must be paramount.  I suggest that we look to other countries, including our neighbours in England, who adopted a very robust policing strategy when this problem threatened to spiral out of control in many areas.  They have had a significant amount of success.<\/p><p>We intend to bring forward legislation to give garda&iacute; the power to seize and retain quad bikes and scramblers when they are used unlawfully or in a dangerous and reckless manner.  We will seek to extend the legal definition of a public place to include public parks, green spaces in housing estates, public recreational areas and sporting grounds in the ownership of local authorities and clubs.  This issue has plagued local authorities, sports clubs, including GAA and soccer clubs, and any other bodies that have a piece of ground in urban areas.  They have all had their property damaged by people using scramblers and quad bikes in an illegal way.<\/p><p>The hard work of our parks and operations departments is wrecked every day.  In my own area from Ongar, Hartstown and Tyrrelstown, all the way down the Navan Road and along the Royal Canal, people are absolutely plagued by quads and scramblers.  It is extremely dangerous for older people who want to go for a walk, for parents who want to let their children out to play, and for sports teams who want to play their games.  The latter are regularly called off because of the damage being done.  We are spending millions of euro throughout this State on building walls, erecting railings and manufacturing kissing gates that will not prevent people with disabilities from entering our public parks.  Why?  It is primarily because of quads and scramblers.  This is an awful waste of money, especially in view of the need for more playgrounds and skate parks for children and our desire to enhance our parks.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in proposes to extend the national vehicle database to provide for the compulsory registration of all quad bikes and scramblers.  This will enable garda&iacute; to identify swiftly those people who are acting in an irresponsible and dangerous manner.  An important element of this motion is our call for an effective public awareness campaign in the run-up to Christmas to discourage the purchase of these vehicles for children and young people.  The ultimate responsibility lies with the parents who buy these quads and scramblers.  They are putting their own children as well as other children and adults at risk.<\/p><p>We also want to encourage local authorities to work with local motor sport enthusiasts.  It is a massive sport throughout the State, but unfortunately it is very difficult to get land and insurance to set up a properly constituted motocross club.  This is not all about the stick; it should also be about the carrot.  We must determine what we can do for those who have a love of the sport and who want to do it in a safe way.  With the proper training, some enthusiasts could go on to become professionals.<\/p><p>I urge the Government to support this motion.  Let us work together on this because this issue has been raised time and again in this House.  We must work together to try to get these changes across the line.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700036#LL00600","speaker":"1476"},{"type":"speech","time":1605639000,"counter":444,"content":"<p>In 2017 Sinn F&eacute;in moved its first Bill on quads and scramblers to tackle the scourge of the illegal use of these vehicles which has plagued our communities for years.  In 2018 our Bill was debated in the D&aacute;il and was voted down by the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il.  Since then, a number of deaths and many injuries have been caused by these vehicles.  I have repeatedly raised this issue in the D&aacute;il and on safety forums and policing committees over many years.<\/p>  <p>  A working group was set up by the then Department of Justice and Equality to consider a cross-agency approach to this issue but it has scarcely met over the years.  So far, the working group has not put forward any realistic solutions, particularly with regard to the use of such vehicles in parks and on green areas in housing estates.  The Government is relying on the use of by-laws in parks to stop such activity, but by-laws are not the solution to this problem.  Proper legislation is required to prohibit this sort of activity in these public spaces.  We have looked closely at the concerns raised by the Government and others with regard to tackling this issue.  We have taken them into consideration and put forward solutions.  The legislation we will publish later this week will adequately address these concerns.  However, there is nothing to stop the Government from implementing some practical solutions now that do not require legislation.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that garda&iacute; are able to enforce existing road traffic legislation.  One of the most effective initiatives in my constituency of Dublin North-West was a pilot scheme that operated in Finglas.  A garda who had received specialised motorcycle training was able within a two-month period to pursue and seize 40 motorcycles and scramblers being used illegally.  Unfortunately, this highly successful initiative has now ceased, but such a scheme should become standard across all Garda divisions.  Garda&iacute; should be properly trained and equipped with specialised motorcycles to pursue and seize scramblers when being used illegally.<\/p> <p>The initiative to which I referred had a noticeable effect in Dublin North-West, with a welcome reduction in the antisocial activity associated with the illegal use of such vehicles.  However, since the initiative was stopped, there has been an increase in the presence of these vehicles and a corresponding increase in antisocial activity.  This is amplified by the current policy of the Garda not to pursue people driving the vehicles.  That policy needs to be reversed and reintroducing the Finglas initiative is one way of doing so.<\/p> <p> I conclude by appealing to parents not to buy quad or scrambler bikes for their children this Christmas and to consider the effects the illegal use of such vehicles has on their neighbours and their community, as well as the dangers posed to young people in riding them, as often happens, without any safety equipment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700036#LL00700","speaker":"1470","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605639600,"counter":446,"content":"<p>St. Cuthbert's Park is a medium-sized park in south-west Clondalkin, in my constituency, which is surrounded by some 2,000 houses, comprising both council housing and private homes.  The people living in Bawnogue work very hard and pay their rent or mortgage and their taxes, including the property tax.  They contribute enormously to the very vibrant local community.  For example, the Friends of St. Cuthbert's Park group organises family days and cinema evenings.  Local men and women put an enormous amount of time voluntarily into the very active local soccer club, Clondalkin Celtic FC, in which more than 200 boys and girls participate.  The local GAA team, Round Tower GAA Club, is also active in the area.  In addition, there is also a local community safety forum.  It is a really vibrant place to live, with very good people.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, St Cuthbert's Park has been plagued for years by the reckless use of quad and scrambler bikes, so much so that we had to set up a task force, led by the local authority and local garda&iacute;, and the membership of which includes local councillors, Deputies, residents and sports club representatives.  For as long as the task force has existed, senior garda&iacute; in Clondalkin have been telling it that they do not have enough power to seize the quad and scrambler bikes that are putting people's lives at risk.  It is not Opposition Deputies or members of the community who are saying that.  The people tasked by the Government to keep our community safe are asking it to change the law.  The reason I mention St. Cuthbert's Park is that the local community, local authority and community garda&iacute; are doing everything they can.  A change in the law is what is needed.<\/p>  <p>  My colleague, Deputy Ellis, referred to the numerous occasions when he and other Opposition Deputies have called for the Government to take action on this matter.  There is a widespread belief in the communities we represent that it is because this problem predominantly affects working-class communities that the Government has not taken action for years.  That is the widely held belief of many of the people we represent.  If the kinds of problems we see with quad and scrambler bikes were as prevalent in more affluent parts of our urban centres, people believe that the law would have been changed years ago.  I know the Minister has been given a statement by his officials which she will read presently.  We are urging her, when this debate is over and she goes back to her Department and to her officials, not to do what her predecessor, Deputy Flanagan, did.  We ask that she not tell us there is going to be action when no action is planned.  We are asking her to look at this issue, hear what Deputies are saying, take it seriously and come back with proposals to empower the Garda to assist people and keep our communities safe.

This motion aims to tackle that scourge.  The debate on this issue has been going on for years in communities and at joint policing committee, JPC, meetings and it has been raised many times on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  The Garda does not have the powers it needs to seize these bikes and take them out of our public spaces.  It is in the interests of public safety that garda&iacute; get the powers and training they need to tackle this problem.<\/p>  <p>  We have all heard about somebody who was injured in a bad accident involving a quad or scrambler bike.  In fact, a number of people have lost their lives in such incidents in the past few years.  A month ago, there was an accident in my constituency, where a dedicated community worker was walking home one evening and was knocked down by a person driving one of these bikes on the footpath.  She suffered serious injuries in the incident and I can only imagine how traumatic it was for her.  This motion is about tackling those people who use scrambler and quad bikes in a reckless and dangerous manner.  Previous Governments have not acted to protect communities that are plagued by these nuisance bikes.  They are destroying football pitches for which many clubs fought hard.  There are young children afraid to use their local park and people in many communities are kept awake night after night as the bikes are driven up and down the roads.  Some are being used to transport drugs around estates.  They are a nuisance and a danger.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il has previously supported the need for legislation in this area.  I hope its Members will support this motion.  It is a chance to do something positive that will prevent further accidents, injuries and deaths.  With any new power comes the need for resources.  It must be compulsory for these vehicles to be registered with the national fleet database.  The Road Safety Authority, RSA, needs to conduct a public information campaign on the dangers of these bikes and how they are not a suitable toy for children this Christmas.  I hope the motion receives broad support across all parties and none.  It will send a strong message to communities that we are serious about tackling this scourge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700037#MM00300","speaker":"1464"},{"type":"speech","time":1605639600,"counter":448,"content":"<p>The misuse of scrambler and quad bikes presents a great danger to people in many of our communities when they are used by children or adults without any level of training, supervision or respect for one's neighbours.  I accept that this problem is not occurring in every area but it is a phenomenon that is growing every year.  Many of our communities are plagued by the buzzing noise to which other Deputies referred.  I can often hear that buzz from my garden as the bikes go up and down the road all day, seven days a week.  It is particularly bad at the weekend.  I have talked to the Garda about how I have witnessed incidents where scramblers have been used on main roads and in green spaces.  There is any amount of video evidence of such activity.  Other speakers have talked about how these vehicles are being used by drug dealers.  I know that is true because I witness it every day.  Again, it is certain communities that are being impacted by this activity.  There is clear evidence that the bikes are being used to transport drugs and I would like to see the Garda being much more proactive in tackling it.<\/p>  <p>  This is not the first time we have raised this issue in the House.  I have brought it to the attention of different Governments over many years.  The response from Government has always been about what cannot be done but not what can be done.  Different parties have made all sorts of efforts to come up with legislative changes but it always comes back to the claim that there are difficulties to contend with which mean the proposals cannot be implemented.  I want to hear from the Minister this evening about what can be done to address this problem.  Some areas have been much more proactive in this regard than others.  I want to learn from them and see the same thing happening in my own area.<\/p>  <p>  I have seen at first hand the damage that has been done to our green spaces and playing pitches by quad and scrambler bikes.  It is soul-destroying for people to take their children to play a game only to find that the pitch is destroyed.  I could give the Minister numerous examples of this involving GAA and soccer clubs.  We do not want to take away anyone's fun.  These vehicles are used legitimately across the State for a variety of purposes, including on farms and in forestry.  However, they are not toys and they are not suitable for use in public places where pedestrians are present.  There are clearly problems with their use and I want to see the Garda authorities being more proactive, with additional powers given to seize and detain the vehicles.  I am told that the people driving them cannot be stopped but I see them going around without helmets and with no regard for their own safety or that of others.  Walking through a park, one may find one of these vehicles being driven right alongside one on the walkway.  Our parks should be inclusive spaces, not places where people are excluded because of the reckless activities of others.  That is the reality of what is happening in many communities.  Only a small minority of people are causing problems and it needs to stop.  I want to see an end to these vehicles being driven on our roads and in our parks and in a way that destroys pitches and green spaces.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700037#MM00400","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1605639600,"counter":449,"content":"<p>Scrambler and quad bikes have been the bane of our communities for several years.<\/p>  <p>It is not uncommon for a person driving along the Neilstown Road or in Bawnogue, parts of Lucan, Knockmitten or anywhere else in Dublin Mid-West in his or her own car to be confronted by a young person coming towards him or her on a scrambler.  As often as not, such young people do not have a helmet or any protective clothing whatsoever.  According to the Road Safety Authority, 48% of incidents related to scramblers and quads involve persons aged under 18.  <\/p> <p> As someone who has, in the past, driven motorbikes for a living, I know the danger in which these people are putting themselves.  Not only are these scramblers endangering their own lives, however, they are also endangering the lives of others.  This total disregard must be tackled.  One should be able to go about one's business in one's own community without the fear that scramblers and quads bring.  The illegal use of quads and scramblers is the scourge of my community, in which residents and the public are plagued by people doing wheelies, tearing up football pitches and generally using quads and scramblers recklessly.<\/p> <p> It has already been said that we are coming up to Christmas.  I, for one, am sick to the back teeth of being woken up on Christmas morning by the noise of scramblers and quads in my community.  I urge any parents who are considering buying a scrambler for their child to realise the very real danger in which they are putting that child and the impact it will have on their neighbours.<\/p> <p> I will also raise the very real issue of scramblers being used for the transport and dealing of drugs.  It is common knowledge in parts of my community that unscrupulous dealers are using young people to deliver and sell drugs.  Unfortunately, using children as drug couriers is not a new phenomenon.  Using kids to deliver drugs by scrambler, however, is relatively new.  Dealers adapt to their environment in order to carry out their illicit behaviours.  The problem is that the law does not adapt quickly enough to tackle this.  While this motion is not directed at the illegal drug trade, it would go a long way towards stopping the grooming of children for use as drug couriers.<\/p> <p> Last month, Sinn F&eacute;in tabled a very sensible motion on fireworks and public safety.  We saw a lot of nodding along and agreement with the rationale behind the motion from the Government benches, but the Government parties still voted against it.  The public can clearly see that the Government is playing politics with people's quality of life and how safe they feel within their own communities.  This is another motion that makes sense.  The issue of scramblers has been raised by the Government in the past.  I urge the Minister to do the right thing for the communities she says she represents and to support this motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700037#MM00500","speaker":"1469","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605640200,"counter":451,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:<br \/><br \/>&ldquo;is concerned that:  \t&mdash; the misuse of scrambler motorcycles, quad-bikes and other vehicles is a matter of public concern and has led to serious safety risks and interference with the enjoyment of amenities for communities in some areas of the country; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; regrettably, the misuse of these vehicles has resulted in death or serious injury in some cases; notes that:  \t&mdash; An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na pursue appropriate policing strategies with due regard to the need to ensure that responses to the misuse of vehicles do not lead to increased and exacerbated public safety risks;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na pursue consistent law enforcement practices by responding appropriately to incidents and local circumstances;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the existing legislation requires the safe use of vehicles as well as compliance with conditions for driver licensing, motor taxation and insurance, and the relevant legislative provisions have already been subject of close examination by Government departments and advice from the Attorney General;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; Garda&iacute; already have significant enforcement powers in relation to dangerous misuse of vehicles and non-compliance with regulations on driver licensing, taxation and insurance, including seizure of vehicles where appropriate;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government has provided extensive resources to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to support law enforcement and effective policing;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; Garda&iacute; successes in the seizure of vehicles underline the need to continue to support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to respond to local situations and provide appropriate resources and technical support; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to provide a robust policing response to the trade in illegal drugs and to adopt intelligence-led approaches to counter the activities of criminal groups, notwithstanding the current pressures on the Garda service due to the restrictions resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic; and supports:  \t&mdash; the Programme for Government &lsquo;Our Shared Future&rsquo; commitment to enhance powers available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to limit the use of scrambler motorcycles and quad-bikes by those engaged in anti-social behaviour and enact legislation to add to those powers if needed;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the recent publicity campaign by the Road Safety Authority (RSA) and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to discourage the purchase of scrambler motorcycles and quad-bikes, particularly in the run up to Christmas;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the ongoing engagement between Government departments and agencies to assess if there are any further means of strengthening legislation in this area, as well as enhancing enforcement measures, public awareness raising and community-based responses;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the ongoing development of policing responses by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the ongoing engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, local authorities and communities, to support appropriate responses to local circumstances;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the ongoing work of the RSA to raise awareness of the dangers of misuse of vehicles;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the additional resources provided by Government in Budget 2021 for youth services;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the imminent publication of a new Youth Justice Strategy which will provide a renewed framework to enhance responses to youth crime and anti-social behaviour;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the work of the forum on anti-social behaviour, which was recently convened by the Minister of State for Law Reform, in line with a commitment in the Programme for Government &lsquo;Our Shared Future&rsquo;; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the recent announcement to pilot local community safety partnerships which recognise the need for a collaborative approach between communities, local authorities and services, including policing and youth services, to effectively target issues affecting communities, such as anti-social behaviour, including through the misuse of scrambler motorcycles.&rdquo;  <\/blockquote>  <p>I thank the Deputies for raising this issue and putting forward this motion this evening.  I welcome the opportunity to update the D&aacute;il on the ongoing proactive work being undertaken to combat the unlawful use of scramblers and quad bikes in public spaces.  I know the issue is of concern to many people in this House, within both the Government and the Opposition.  More importantly, it is a great concern for many communities.  I acknowledge that Deputies are genuine in bringing forward the motion and in bringing these concerns to the floor of the House.  I am not dismissing any concerns or only paying lip service to the issue.  I want to work with Deputies, as does the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, who has responsibility for youth justice.<\/p><p>Having said that, I have proposed an amendment setting out the current and future work of the Garda and Government in respect of the issues on which this motion has been tabled.  The seriousness with which the Government takes this issue is reflected in the programme for Government commitment to &quot;Enhance powers available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to limit the use of scramblers and quads by those engaged in anti-social behaviour and enact legislation to add to those powers if needed.&quot;  This is a clear commitment which I do not mention as a means to dismiss what the Deputies are proposing this evening.  As this commitment recognises, potential legislation is just one part of the solution and my Government colleagues and I will not hesitate to choose that option if it is required.<\/p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na tackles this behaviour on a number of fronts including through targeted enforcement in areas with high activity, working with petrol stations to prohibit the sale of fuel to persons who are using these vehicles and community outreach.  Some of the Deputies have outlined what is happening in their own communities in this regard.  Engagement with communities and awareness raising are just as important in tackling the misuse of scramblers and other vehicles.  Such engagement and awareness raising includes making younger people aware of the dangers to themselves and others of using such vehicles and highlighting the dangers to parents considering buying such vehicles for their children.  I join all Deputies in urging and asking parents not to buy scramblers or quad bikes for their children this Christmas and to acknowledge and understand the dangers that come with them and the impact they have on communities.<\/p><p>The misuse of scramblers, quad bikes and similar off-road urban vehicles is a cause for concern in a number of communities.  We see this right across the country.  It is principally, although not solely, an issue in Dublin.  It also affects other urban centres.  Issues typically arise where vehicles are used in public open spaces such as housing estates, playing pitches or public parks.  Tragically, there have been cases in recent years where the misuse of these vehicles has led to death or very serious life-changing injuries.  I know that all members of the House will join me in extending my deepest sympathies to all those who have been impacted by these horrific incidents.<\/p><p>Garda&iacute; in areas such as Finglas have had success in reducing the number of issues with scramblers through targeted enforcement, as has been identified by Deputies, while youth community engagement groups in Limerick have had success in diverting young people away from using these vehicles in a dangerous manner in public places and towards properly organised motocross events.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to develop responses appropriate to the situation in each locality by working with local authorities and community partners.  I know Deputies McAuliffe and Lahart have also made proposals in this area.  These proposals, and those included in tonight's motion, will be considered as part of the work currently under way on this issue.<\/p><p>A cross-agency group to examine this issue, which has been mentioned and which principally involves my Department, the Department of Transport and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, has been in place since 2018.  The group has also engaged with other Departments, the Office of the Attorney General and local authorities.  The group most recently met on 28 September and the principal issues arising from this meeting were identified across the areas of legislation, enforcement, community engagement and public awareness.<\/p><p>As Deputies will be aware, responsibility for legislation surrounding road safety and traffic enforcement rests with the Minister for Transport.  In this context, responsibility for introducing any new legislative provisions which would seek to deliver on the commitments on scramblers and quad bikes contained in the programme for Government lies with my colleague, the Minister for Transport, although, to be very clear, my Department will also do what it can.  I can inform the House that this matter has been subject to careful scrutiny by the Department of Transport, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Justice.  I look forward to working with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on this issue.<\/p><p>Garda&iacute; already have significant enforcement powers in respect of the dangerous misuse of vehicles and non-compliance with regulations on driver licensing, taxation and insurance, including the power to seize vehicles where appropriate.  While it is not possible to quantify specifically the number of scramblers seized, as these are not categorised separately from other types of motorcycles in Garda records, I am informed that 51 quad bikes were seized by garda&iacute; in 2019 and that an additional five were seized between January and September of this year.  I anticipate this number increasing before the year is out.<\/p><p>Following further consideration of the matter by the Garda authorities, the Department of Transport is leading an additional examination to see if there are avenues for enhancing the existing overall legislative provisions.  Any proposals in this regard would need to align with other relevant legislation, including local authority by-laws.  Policing responses will still have to take account of the immediate safety issues involved in pursuing what are often very young drivers of vehicles in public areas.  Interception of persons engaged in the use of these vehicles on public roads and spaces presents dangers not only to the users of the vehicles, but also to the public and members of the Garda.  These difficulties will remain, irrespective of any legislative enhancements.  Having spoken to garda&iacute; about this, I know they are concerned that if they chase or follow young people using these scramblers, they may be partially responsible for causing an accident, making things even worse.  Garda&iacute; must make very difficult decisions in these instances and this will continue to be the case.  Effective local engagement to raise awareness of the dangers involved and to promote positive behavioural change is fundamental to tackling this issue.<\/p><p>I welcome and acknowledge the ongoing work of the Road Safety Authority, RSA, to raise awareness of the dangers of the misuse of these vehicles.  Deputies may have already heard the campaign advertisements which have been produced by the RSA and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the participation of the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton.  These advertisements highlight the dangers involved and ask parents not to buy scramblers or quad bikes as presents for their children this Christmas.<\/p><p>My Department is also considering how best to develop actions to increase awareness of the dangers of these vehicles.  The intention is that this work will be carried out in conjunction with affected communities, community groups and other stakeholders affected by the misuse of scramblers.  It will also explore how best to engage with young people who are drawn to this behaviour.<\/p><p>In the year to date, my Department has been examining options in this area, with due regard to social distancing requirements and relevant public health advice.  This has included a survey of the national network of Garda youth diversion projects, which was carried out early in 2020, to inform a more targeted approach for awareness raising measures.  While the Covid-19 pandemic has, to some degree, hampered significant further development in this area, it is something my Department will continue to explore.<\/p> <p>For example, the Department will consider if it is possible to target online awareness to the localities most affected, and will support suitable proposals for local initiatives, principally via the network of the 105 Garda youth diversion programmes.  Deputies may be interested to know that the Moyross Garda youth diversion programme in Limerick has already devised a programme of tuition in vehicle maintenance and responsible use.  This comes back to the point that when they are used safely and when people have an opportunity to do so, such an approach can be effective and reduces the risk and danger involved.<\/p> <p> While the Garda youth diversion programmes have adapted their operations in light of the Covid-19 restrictions, there are still obvious limitations in pursuing increased engagement with particular groups within the communities.  The key issue will be engaging effectively with those who use or are most likely to use scramblers or quad bikes inappropriately, and this will require locally generated strategies which respond to local circumstances.  In this regard, I would envision that issues such as the misuse of these vehicles would also be the kind of issue which could be considered by the local community safety partnerships, which it is anticipated will be established under the upcoming policing and community safety Bill, the development of which forms a key part of the recommendations emerging from the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.<\/p> <p> As Deputies will be aware, specifically on this issue, last week I announced the locations of three pilot schemes for the local community safety partnerships, which will run for two years in the areas of the Dublin north inner city electoral area, Waterford and Longford, and which will inform a national roll-out to all local authority areas.  The partnerships recognise the need for a collaborative approach between communities, local authorities and services, including policing and youth services, to target efficiently issues affecting communities such as anti-social behaviour, including the misuse of scramblers.<\/p> <p> Deputies have mentioned that a high percentage of those who are using these scramblers are under the age of 18.  Therefore, issues of youth crime and anti-social behaviour will also be addressed in the new youth justice strategy, which will be brought to Government before the end of this year by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, and will provide a renewed framework to enhance responses to youth crime and anti-social behaviour.  Likewise, the forum on anti-social behaviour, which was recently convened by the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, in line with a commitment in the programme for Government, will also address this.<\/p> <p> As Deputies will be aware, the Government has provided extensive resources to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to support law enforcement and effective policing across all forms of offending.  Garda numbers have increased, as have the financial supports and the availability of the equipment and vehicles the Garda.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's budget for 2021 is an unprecedented &euro;1.952 billion.  This level of funding is enabling sustained and ongoing recruitment of Garda members and staff.  As a result, there are now some 14,600 Garda members and more than 3,000 Garda staff.  The latter represent almost 20% of our force, which is a significant increase in a small number of years.  Budget 2021 will allow for the recruitment of up to 620 new garda&iacute; and an extra 500 Garda staff.<\/p> <p> The Government and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are committed to combatting issues of the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes and to addressing anti-social behaviour more broadly because this is part of a wider issue.  We want to work proactively with all Members within the House in doing that and I ask Members to support this amendment.  I support Deputies in their call to ask parents not to buy these for their children this Christmas, acknowledging and recognising the danger they pose as well as the impact they have on our communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700038#NN00200","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605640800,"counter":453,"content":"<p>Deputy Quinlivan is sharing time with Deputies Patricia Ryan, Munster and &Oacute; Snodaigh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700039#OO00150","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1605640800,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I thank my colleagues for bringing forward this motion.  My colleagues, Deputies Ellis and Munster, brought a similar motion forward during the previous D&aacute;il as well.<\/p>  <p>  This has been an ongoing issue in my constituency for years.  I have spoken on this issue on a number of occasions, the last of which was on a Fianna F&aacute;il Bill.  At the time, the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport had no interest in solving the issue.  I raised the concern I had that the reason he had no interest, and Deputy &Oacute; Broin made the same point, is that this is an issue that mostly affects working-class communities.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, with the Covid-19 crisis we have seen that people are at home and working from home with scramblers outside the door.  I know of people who have moved homes because the noise from scramblers is preventing them from doing their work.  People who work in sales, the Revenue Commissioners and different offices in Limerick who are working from their homes cannot work properly because of the noise scramblers cause.<\/p>  <p>  We need to have proper legislation on this because local garda&iacute; will tell us they are instructed by their senior officers not to chase young fellows on bikes.  The Minister referenced that herself and she can understand why that is the case because of the danger such action would pose to themselves and to people in those communities.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, it is an ongoing issue in my constituency.  The Minister referenced Moyross and I grew up in the estate next door.  In my local area, we were all shocked in recent times to see a Garda video where three garda&iacute; were pinned against the wall by lads who had quad bikes.  Unfortunately, the garda&iacute; did not have the power to take away the quad bike and they had to leave.  It was a situation in which the two fingers were shown to the Garda and it caused huge anger in the community.  The same day, when those scramblers were being driven around morning, noon and night in that estate, there were two funerals.  In the context of Covid-19, people could not go into the house for those funerals so they were standing outside of the gates and they had to get out of the way of those scramblers while they were flying around.  We need to have some sort of legislation in place to make sure that people are able to live in their communities safely.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the moves to look at the positives.  It is good to give lads with scramblers a different outlet.  There is one such project in Moyross that the Minister mentioned and we need to look at more of that.  I know family members who were involved in bikes and scramblers and so on and they have looked after them properly.  However, it is important that we take action against the people who have wrecked our local communities, football pitches, grass, and green areas.  We need to legislate for this and it is to be hoped the Minister will do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700039#OO00200","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1605640800,"counter":455,"content":"<p>I thank my colleagues, na Teachta&iacute; Ellis and Paul Donnelly, for bringing forward this motion.  Anyone who has experienced the terror of scramblers and quad bikes being driven recklessly at speed in their community will know that the proposed legislation is long overdue.  Every year we have warnings around this time appealing to parents not to buy scramblers and quad bikes for children for Christmas.  It is about time the Garda had adequate powers to deal with this menace on our streets.<\/p>  <p>  In the period from 2014 to 2019, the Minister will be aware that six people died as a result of incidents involving quad bikes or scramblers, three of whom were aged 18 or under, according to statistics published by the Road Safety Authority.  In the same period, 60 people were injured in collisions involving a quad bike or scrambler on public roads.  Of those killed or injured, 41% of casualties were 18 years of age or under.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt that the use of scramblers and quad bikes by children pose a serious safety hazard.  These are powerful machines which have the potential to injure someone severely or even fatally.  That is why they are not suitable for use by children or inexperienced riders.  Parents considering buying quad bikes or scramblers for their children this Christmas need to be aware that when used on public roads, they are subject to the same rules as any other mechanically propelled vehicle.  They are required to be registered, taxed and in good roadworthy condition.  The driver of the vehicle must hold an appropriate driving licence and be insured to drive the vehicle.<\/p>  <p>  Aside from being a danger due to accidents, quads and scrambler bikes represent a fire hazard.  Garda&iacute; believe youths on quad bikes and scramblers may have caused a massive fire which burned for days on bogland near Carbury in County Kildare during the summer.  It is thought that bike engines, chains or exhausts may have ignited the dry underbrush.  The fire, which was beside the Bord na M&oacute;na Drehid waste management disposal plant, took several units of Kildare Fire Service and the aid of the Air Corps helicopter to bring it under control.<\/p>  <p>  Local authorities should explore the feasibility of providing suitable spaces for the use of registered quad bikes and scramblers in a safe, controlled and responsible manner.  This approach was used with great success to tackle the issue of wandering horses and ponies in the past.  I urge all Deputies of all parties and none to support this motion so that this danger in our communities can be regulated properly and so that the Garda will have the powers it needs to deal effectively with the problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700039#OO00300","speaker":"1588"},{"type":"speech","time":1605640800,"counter":456,"content":"<p>It is unbelievable that we are back in here yet again debating legislating for scramblers and quad bikes, despite the scourge of these bikes on communities.  It appears to me that the Government has no interest in dealing with it.  I say that on the basis that my colleague, Deputy Ellis, and I brought a similar Bill and motion before the D&aacute;il about three years ago and both Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il voted against it.  In that three-year space, when there would have been ample time to deal with the scourge of scrambler and quad bikes on communities, the Government did nothing.  The Government has come in here with a reactionary amendment to the motion that we put forward instead of being proactive in recent years.<\/p>  <p>  We have all known that these vehicles are an absolute scourge on communities and cause havoc in them.  That has included the deaths of six people over the five years leading up to 2019 and one further death this year.  So many other people have been seriously injured.<\/p> <p>We also know that local green spaces and recreational areas have been destroyed by these bikes.  People in those communities and residential estates have been living in fear.  We are coming up to Christmas, and we know the problem is set to get much worse than it is.  As other Deputies said, every year we ask parents to be responsible and to not buy these quad and scrambler bikes for their children, because they are not toys and are not fit to be driven by young people in public areas.  <\/p> <p> Almost half of the incidents where people are injured or killed by these bikes involve children under the age of 18.  Garda&iacute; have said time and again that they cannot adequately deal with the problem, and that they need stronger legislation to back them up.  The Minister knows that, however, because she has been told that numerous times.  Under the current law, these bikes can only be driven, legally, on private land and can only be seized when they are used on public roads and footpaths.  That leaves a legal gap when it comes from public recreational spaces and green areas within housing estates.  <\/p> <p> Further to that point, garda&iacute; have been instructed not to give chase to these vehicles for safety reasons, and we can understand that.  If the garda&iacute; had the legislation, however, they could act.  Our proposed legislation, therefore, would give powers to garda&iacute; to seize and detain quad and scrambler bikes being driven dangerously in a public space, including recreational green spaces, and it makes it an offence to use a quad or scrambler bike in a dangerous manner in a public space.  I hope this issue will be addressed and that the Minister will support this motion.  Instead of tabling an amendment to this motion as a reactionary thing, I hope she will back it and the forthcoming legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700039#OO00400","speaker":"1497","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605641400,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I take this opportunity to thank Superintendent Tony Twomey, who was behind the seizure of some quad bikes in Cherry Orchard recently.  That was a proactive move and many locals are glad of the relative quiet on their roads since then.  Some roads, however, have been and are plagued by an element who are racing up and down, oblivious to the noise they are making and to the danger they pose to children and the elderly in parks or on paths as they hurtle past loudly.  Those getting kicks from continuously revving the quad and scrambler bikes and other off-road vehicles on small narrow roads, racing each other on the main roads or ploughing up football pitches in local parks do not care for local people, for children playing or for peaceful neighbourhoods.<\/p><p>We have, regrettably, seen the consequences of their indifference and their destruction.  Tens of thousands of euro annually must be spent fixing pitches, railings and paths in public parks.  This element also seems to be indifferent even to the deaths and injuries they cause to themselves and others when they lose control.  At this time of the year, the message needs to go out, loud and clear, that these vehicles are not toys.  They should not be bought for children or for teenagers at Christmas.  I ask that people not be part of the scourge on our communities.  <\/p><p>Garda Inspector David O'Brien said at the inquest of a teenager who died in a tragic scrambler accident in Cherry Orchard more than five years ago that:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThese bikes are made for off-road conditions such as grass, fields and wooded areas.  Their tyres are like studs on a football boot.  They should not have been anywhere near a road surface. <\/blockquote>  <p>The purpose of our motion is to get the Government to tackle this scourge once and for all.  We need our public paths, parks and canals to be safe where people can walk or play.  A co-ordinated approach between the Garda and Dublin City Council can deliver if the Government closes the loopholes and gives the garda&iacute; access to and powers in public parks.  A proper licensing and registration regime should also be introduced immediately for scrambler and quad bikes.  We also need an all-Ireland approach.  The sale of such vehicles in the North is banned, unless a person is a farmer or the like.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700040#PP00200","speaker":"1485"},{"type":"speech","time":1605641400,"counter":459,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing forward this motion, which the Labour Party will support.  I appreciate that the Minister will be sympathetic regarding the issue being raised.  There are often calls for tough Garda action regarding what happens in communities, including action against parents, young people and those who sell scramblers and quad bikes.  That has to happen and the garda&iacute; need to empowered.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to understand the rationale behind why, in certain communities, this is considered to be a good use of one's time.  What is often lost when we debate any sort of social ill is that we think we can police our way out of it.  Policing our way out of a situation is, of course, a part of the solution.  There must be a justice element involved, because a dangerous machine cannot be handed to a child, one cannot purchase something which one knows to be dangerous, and one cannot drive such a machine in a dangerous fashion.  We all know that, so there must rules, regulations and restrictions laid down.  We must also understand the mentality as to why this is so attractive and why so many young people feel that this is a good use of their time.<\/p>  <p>  That is something which can be drilled into if it is accepted, and as was advocated for in the last Oireachtas and accepted by the Minister's party, that there is a need for a different way of policing, of engaging with communities and of understanding communities and young people.  In the Dublin 5, Dublin 13 and Dublin 17 area, we have advocated for a Mulvey-style commission to engage with all the different actors in the community, so that we will not just talk to the Garda when it comes to issues such as scrambler bikes, anti-social behaviour, drug dealing or drug taking.  We need to try to get in behind the statistics in terms of why these things happen.  Why do young people feel empowered by this sort of activity?  What is it that gives them their kicks?  Why are those kicks not found somewhere else?  <\/p>  <p>  If there really is a passion for and an interest in the motor, the noise or the power, could we facilitate that in some kind of safe way?  These questions and answers can be tossed and turned over and back with those actors in the community who know best.  The Minister's Government agreed that we should have such a Mulvey-style commission for the northside of Dublin.  One was agreed for Drogheda as well.  We feel strongly that we are wasting an awful lot of time without having these kinds of discussions.  It should not take a Deputy in the Opposition to bring forward this issue again and again for the Government to act not just on this issue, but on a wide variety of issues which are underpinned by a sense of disengagement, disconnection and disfranchisement.<\/p>  <p>  It is very difficult to stand up in a community and speak about disconnection and disenfranchisement when someone is clearly engaging in violent anti-social behaviour with a motorised vehicle which is creating great noise and distress in that community.  We must, however, have that conversation on some level, and that would be the type of forum in which these issues could be teased out.  I am sure if we talk to youth workers, as we all do in our different communities, they would say that we need tighter restrictions and regulations and that we must also talk to parents about how in God's name they think it is sensible to hand a dangerous machine to a child.  We must go a little bit beyond that as well, however, and talk about what is happening in these communities as to why young people feel that the power they get from making this noise makes them feel important.  There must be a space for that conversation.  <\/p>  <p>  I take the opportunity to speak about the commitment of the Government and the assistant commissioner to establish a Garda station in the Dublin 13 and Dublin 17 area.  I still feel strongly about that issue and want to work with the Minister to ensure it can be built.  It will not solve every problem.  We cannot put a Garda station in every area of disadvantage and expect that to solve all the issues.  It would, however, give that hugely expanding area of Dublin 13 and Dublin 17 a sense that community infrastructure is being put in place, which most communities of that size would expect.  <\/p>  <p>  We support this motion and tough action against scrambler and quad bikes, but we must have a deeper discussion on what the motivation is behind young people needing to feel empowered by this type of activity.

That is not the case now and we know that many of us who live in these areas and in these constituencies will wake up on Christmas morning to the close or distant sounds of these scramblers or quad bikes causing absolute havoc and tearing around in our public parks, on our open spaces, and in our residential roads.<\/p> <p> There is no reason to have a quad bike or scrambler other than for reasons of work, or for an organised quad bike race taking place in an organised fashion on private grounds.  There is absolutely no other reason for anybody to have one unless it is in those circumstances.  We need to take them away.<\/p> <p> Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in spoke very eloquently and passionately about the desire or need behind having these bikes, and he needs to be listened to.  We need to have that conversation.  We also need to take them away right now.  The motion speaks very well to that.  We would not tolerate an individual with a gun licence going into an open park or an open space and discharging it at a flock of birds.  It is the same principle with a quad bike or a scrambler.  The bikes have the capacity to cause as much damage and it is like giving a loaded gun to somebody who is untrained.  They are then going into our public parks and open spaces to use them.  Communities are not divided on this.  It is not a contentious issue and 99.9% of people want to see these bikes totally removed from their communities.<\/p> <p> Let us be straight that this disproportionately affects working-class communities.  Again it is working-class communities that suffer from the actions of a reckless minority.  Any powers that could be given should be given to the Garda.  I know its members have huge difficulties in that they cannot go into a public park in a squad car and chase after them.  We know this.  The motion does not speak to that.  It speaks to the reality that we face with quad bikes and scramblers.  Working-class communities need to be protected from a number of things, I know because I grew up in one, and this is one of those things.  What is most frustrating is that we can see the quad bikes, we can see who is on them, and we know who owns them and the addresses where they live.  We need to go and get them.<\/p> <p> There have been great pilot schemes such as the scheme in Finglas, of which I am very proud, where 40 quad bikes were taken off the road.  This was fantastic.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh also mentioned another project in Cherry Orchard with Superintendent Tony Twomey, formerly the superintendent with Balbriggan Garda in north County Dublin, who is a fantastic superintendent doing great work.  I am delighted to hear that this project is happening but we need to see more of it.<\/p> <p> As I said earlier, people are united on this issue throughout the State, and especially in working-class communities.  We need to take the danger out of our open spaces and we need to take it out of our parks.  We need to ensure that, as much as we can, on Christmas morning we hear the sound of proper, normal gifts of bikes, skateboards and safe gifts.  Santa Claus does not want to bring scramblers and quad bikes to children, so stop asking for them, and stop facilitating them being bought.  It is absolutely intolerable and it must stop.  I commend the motion and I ask the Minister, Deputy McEntee, on behalf of the Government, to take back its reactive amendment.  I think we are actually all on the same page on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700040#PP00400","speaker":"1564","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605642000,"counter":462,"content":"<p>I commend Sinn F&eacute;in on the motion.  This motion and its sentiment have been expressed many times in this House, including in the current D&aacute;il, the previous D&aacute;il and the D&aacute;il before that.  Unfortunately, we have yet to see any kind of serious action being taken on it at Government level.<\/p>  <p>  I respect that the Minister, Deputy McEntee, is a new Minister in this portfolio.  The Minister came in and in all sincerity she delivered that speech tonight, but there is really nothing new in it at all.  I would have to refer to it as the same empty promises we have heard for years in this House.  Irrespective of who the Minister is, I believe there is a mindset behind that, which probably comes from the Department and from senior people in different State agencies who simply do not understand this problem.  Some of us have been raising this matter here until we are blue in the face.  We just cannot understand why we cannot have action from Government.<\/p>  <p>  For years it has been the case in my constituency and, I am sure, in many other constituencies, especially in urban constituencies, that the issue of quad bikes and scramblers is the single most common issue raised at residents' meetings.  It is standard practice, be it at joint policing committees, residents' associations or safety forums, that the number one issue is the same: the law is being totally disregarded by the tolerance of the use of these very dangerous vehicles.  Garda&iacute; are left there to try to defend what they are doing, but they cannot.  They know that they do not have the backing of the Department or their senior superiors in doing what they want to do.  Public representatives, Deputies, and councillors, are left sitting at these meetings impotent and powerless.  We have been listening to these complaints for years.  We understand the nature of the complaints.  We understand what has to be done.<\/p>  <p>  There is no defence of the fact that the Government will not take action in this area.  We have been here on umpteen occasions pleading with the Minister of the day to please do something.  I am not holding the Minister, Deputy McEntee, responsible at this point because she is a new Minister, but the kind of stuff that was in her speech means nothing to people.  We have been hearing this for years.  I make a very earnest plea to her to listen to what Members of this House are saying and have been saying for donkey's years.  There is a huge problem here and it is a very significant social problem.  It is symptomatic of much deeper problems, and I agree with the points that have been made in that regard.  That the establishment and official Ireland seems impotent and incapable of addressing this issue brings everybody into disrepute: the law, Government, public representatives and the Garda.  The elements who are determined to drag areas down and to create the kind of lawlessness in which anti-social behaviour and much more serious crime can flourish are delighted with the neglect of this issue by the establishment.  I plead with the Minister not to allow that neglect to continue.<\/p>  <p>  We regularly have to stand up and say to people that we know and understand the problem, that we have raised it in the D&aacute;il umpteen times, but that unfortunately nothing is being done.  There is no defence of that.  We put it to the Minister that she has a responsibility, as the Minister for Justice, to take the issue seriously and to listen to what people are saying.  Members do not come in here and make up stories about this.  We have been identifying this as a serious social problem for at least ten years.  It is infuriating that the powers that be continue to ignore it.<\/p>  <p>  The issue has posed a threat to life and limb for many years but it also causes that sense of devastation in many communities, working-class communities in the main.  Let us be clear about this.  If this problem was going on in middle-class areas, it would have been solved long ago.  It is a terrible reflection on Government that when issues affect working-class communities, they do not rate the way middle-class issues rate.  This is at the heart of the failure to address this problem.<\/p>  <p>  The point has already been made that this is not something working-class communities want to continue.  The vast majority living and working in working-class communities want this issue tackled.  They are crying out for the authorities to deal with it.  They are pleading with public representatives and with the Garda to tackle it.  If the Garda is not empowered to step in and address this very pressing social problem, then it is inevitable that somebody else will sort it out.  I put it to the Minister that she has a responsibility to take the appropriate action that is needed to address the issue.<\/p> <p>Of course, local people in working-class communities are the most impacted by this issue.  At certain times of year or in certain areas, young people and old people are afraid to leave their homes.  They are afraid to go to parks and to use them.  They are afraid to allow their children to go out and play in local housing estates because of the threat posed by the widespread use of quad bikes and scramblers.<\/p> <p> Like most problems, it started very small.  It was a tiny thing and we hardly noticed it when it began but because of the neglect of this issue, year on year, it has now gotten to a point where it is exceptionally hard to deal with.  However, it desperately needs to be dealt with.  It is all very well to talk about diverting young people into other activities and we need more funding for youth services and sports activities.  There is nothing worse and more soul-destroying for football teams than arriving for a match or training on a Saturday morning and discovering that their pitch has been churned up by this kind of activity.  There is nothing worse than parents who want to take their kids out to local parks to play being afraid to do so because of the imminent threat of someone coming along on one of these bikes and posing a danger to them.  Deaths and serious injuries have been caused by these vehicles.<\/p> <p> The Minister cannot continue to ignore this.  We spent years begging her predecessors to establish an interagency forum, which was finally set up a number of years ago.  We waited for meetings to be held and occasional quarterly meetings occurred.  We were then told that a decision had been made that the law was strong enough and that the Attorney General had recommended that we did not need a new law.  Meanwhile, we hear from garda&iacute; in our constituencies that their hands are tied and that the law does not equip them to tackle this problem.  It was only when we kept on raising that with the Garda and advised it to move it up the line to the Garda Commissioner that there was finally an admission that the law is not adequate in this area.  Now we are waiting.  Is there any possibility that we might get action on this or that the Minister will listen to what people are saying and produce the necessary legislation?  The Garda's hands are tied as regards enforcing the law in parks and other public off-road places because the traffic legislation does not apply there.  There is also a complete failure to enforce the law on tax, insurance and driver licences for people over 16 who are using these vehicles, not to mention those who are underage.  A complete blind eye is being turned to this huge problem and it can only get worse if the necessary action is not taken.  I am pleading with the Minister to take this issue seriously, unlike her predecessors, before more people are killed and more communities are alienated by the failure of the establishment to tackle this.  I urge her to take action. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700041#QQ00200","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605642600,"counter":464,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for this motion.  It is quite comprehensive and deals with all the substantial issues in this situation.  I was thinking about what to say today and the irresponsible use of these vehicles, which are very dangerous, is a huge issue in the area I come from in Clondalkin.  There are parallels between this and the epidemic of stolen cars in the mid-1990s.  I am not going to go in-depth into how that was tackled but there is a wider societal issue when it comes to why young people need to do these activities.  The law needs to change because there is ambiguity about the laws around off-road vehicles, but we could change the law tomorrow and there would still be a societal issue.  Why do people engage in these activities, particularly in working-class communities?  They are a huge danger to themselves, as these vehicles are not meant to go on tarmacked roads.  They are off-road vehicles.  If someone comes off one of those bikes, and these lads do not wear helmets, they will die or kill someone else.  There have been deaths and people have suffered serious, life-changing injuries over the past few years.  We definitely need clarity on the law because, as far as I can see, there is ambiguity and the law on these vehicles needs to change.<\/p>  <p>  Some people who use these vehicles use them very irresponsibly, although a huge number of people use them very responsibly.  I am aware of two motocross clubs in Dublin, one in Mulhuddart and one in Dublin city.  They engage with young people and give them responsibility around vehicles such as quad bikes or motorbikes.  That shows them how dangerous these vehicles can be, but also how enjoyable they can be because once they are used in a controlled manner, they can be a very enjoyable hobby.  The vast majority of people who use these vehicles use them in a safe and controlled environment.  That is important.<\/p>  <p>  The current legislation is unfit for an urban environment.  This issue has been raised many times, not only here but in council chambers or at joint policing committees, JPCs, and working-class communities want to see some sort of action.  That action should be a change of law but it should also involve giving young people alternative things to do.  Local authorities are trying to address these issues.  It is not a panacea by any means but we should give young people an alternative in order that they can go from anti-social behaviour, although I hate using the term, to pro-social behaviour.  We can give them the adrenaline rush young people sometimes want in a safe and controlled environment where they can show responsibility, not only for themselves but for their peers as well.  It is vitally important that we engage with young people and look for alternatives to these vehicles.  As I said, they can bring immense joy but they can also bring immense misery if they are used irresponsibly.<\/p>  <p>  The law needs to change as the police are confined to certain things that cannot be done in public parks but we should go back to the societal issue as to why these vehicles are used in a way that can be extremely negative and irresponsible for the communities where most of these people live.  We need to change the law and look for an alternative.  As well as the clubs in Dublin, there are many clubs across the State that use motocross vehicles in very responsible manner.  We must look for alternatives and work with local communities and young people.  We will not get through to everybody.  There is an element of people who use them for other purposes, such as dealing drugs and so forth, but we have to look for alternatives.  If we can look for alternatives, we can in some way address the issue. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700042#RR00200","speaker":"1565"},{"type":"speech","time":1605642600,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I listened to the Minister's speech and I was struck by how out of touch the Government is as regards seeing how significant an issue this is.  That is nothing personal.  This is a huge issue for working-class communities.  The dangerous, irresponsible and unsafe use of scramblers and quad bikes is a scourge for working-class communities.  It should be a major political issue but it is not treated that way by the Government and was not treated that way by the Minister in her response.  I agree with Deputy Gino Kenny that the term \"anti-social behaviour\" is often overused but this is the definition of anti-social behaviour because it turns public spaces, which are social spaces to be used by communities for sports, walking, kids playing, and whatever else, into areas where people feel scared and do not feel able to use public facilities for what they are meant to be used for.<\/p> <p>People are genuinely in fear of their kids going out to play on the green or in the playground because they might be hit by a scrambler or a quad.  Older people who go for walks are genuinely in fear that they cannot go into the park, which at this time with Covid is more necessary for people than ever.  The point has been made about sports teams having their facilities and their pitches ruined.  None of that even touches what Deputy Paul Donnelly referred to with the tragedy of six people who have died over the past five years and 60 people who have been seriously injured by these bikes.<\/p> <p> Communities feel deeply frustrated by the general response of the authorities to this problem.  I spoke to a woman earlier who is involved in organising her community to stop this activity.  She said she goes to the Garda which tells her to get on to the parks department of the council.  When she does, the parks department tells her it is the Garda she should be talking to.  People feel nothing is done to address it.<\/p> <p> The majority of young people who are engaged in this anti-social behaviour are not bad or evil people.  They need to be brought face to face with the impact of what they are doing.  They need to understand that because of what they are doing, other people are scared or do not feel comfortable to use the parks that they should feel able to use.  We need a programme of education around that, aimed at young people and making them realise the consequences of their actions, as well as aimed at parents who might be considering buying scooters or quads.  In some cases, these can be very young children and it should be made clear that it is not an appropriate present.<\/p> <p> We must look at the broader societal context.  The point is being made repeatedly, and it is clearly accurate, that this is a problem that particularly exists to a much greater extent in working-class communities than in better-off communities.  Why is that?  Is there something inherent in the genes of working-class young people which makes them far more likely to want to get on a quad or scrambler to fly around the local park?  Obviously there is not.  It is linked to wider disadvantage, lack of opportunity and a lack of facilities.  In my opinion, it cannot be separated from the kind of brutal cuts that we saw across the board throughout the course of the crisis, in particular to youth facilities.  Between 2007 and 2015, youth services were cut by 31%.  Even now, after some element of restoration, they are still down 15% than when before the crisis hit.<\/p> <p> Actually investing in and giving people facilities, opportunities and so on is vital.  I agree with Deputy Gino Kenny that part of that can actually be investing in motocross facilities, making it a safe, enjoyable sport for people to participate in as opposed to it being an anti-social action.  These are the kind of alternatives that we need to provide for young people, as well as educating them and so on about the impact of their actions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700042#RR00300","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605643200,"counter":467,"content":"<p>The unlawful use of scramblers and quad bikes must be extremely difficult, especially in city places and highly built-up communities.  I can well imagine the frustration, upset and dangers this is causing for residents in those areas.<\/p>  <p>  The main users of these scramblers and quad bikes are young people.  We need to focus on the positive things that young people do.  Unfortunately, with this situation, that is not what we are doing.  If there is wrongdoing, then it is right.  However, I look at situations where we tried to turn things around in my constituency with our young people and Garda youth awards.  This encouraged young people to keep away from mischievous behaviour or crime.  It turned their lives around in some ways.  Some of those kids were going in the right direction but more may not have been.  Garda Damian White and others in west Cork have been strongly pushing this initiative.  It has succeeded each year, with 20 young people getting a youth award and focusing their minds more positively.  If that is the way that these communities could travel, they should certainly look at it.<\/p>  <p>  I am in a community alert group in Schull.  We have a young person of the year award aimed at encouraging young people to do right in their communities.  Unfortunately, some go wrong and end up in unlawful situations with scramblers and quad bikes, which sometimes leads to drugs and so forth.  There are facilities for them.  However, such a facility in west Cork, Cara Lodge in Enniskeane, was closed recently.  It was a treatment centre for young people who needed help with addiction and other issues in their lives.  They would probably have been well able to turn it around if they had had that little bit of encouragement.  Sadly, the Government &ndash; I raised it here with the Taoiseach - refused to intervene.  Unfortunately, the HSE refused to give the funding and the centre for young people in Enniskeane in west Cork is now closed.  That is an indictment of where we are going.

If people were playing hurling on the road, hurling pitches would be made available, the same for soccer.  The Minister has to give those using quad bikes and scramblers the facilities in which they can be trained like in any other sport.  If that is done, it can be regulated and people shown how to use them safely.  If we want people to drive vehicles properly, we have to give them a facility where they can be taught.  That comes back to the Minister.<\/p>  <p>  Mondello Park is a facility for racing cars.  However, a person living where I come from has to travel nearly two hours to get there to race his or her vehicle.

I want to pay tribute to him and his colleagues who came together for their fallen hero while observing social distancing.  The community police are all important.  They must know their community, stand in the kitchens, know the people and visit the schools.  Sergeant Niall O'Halloran would bring the national school fifth and sixth classes gach bhliain on a turas go dt&iacute; Templemore and the Garda headquarters there to show them, to give them an enthusiasm for the uniform and for all the aspects of Garda life.<\/p> <p> That is what we have to do.  We should not create an \"us and them\" mentality by chasing them with a squad car whenever there is an issue.  I know how dangerous these vehicles are and how serious it is to be hit by one.  I have a quad for use on a hilly sheep farm.  I know how dangerous they are.  They have to be used properly.  We can never beat this behaviour out of young people.  We have to encourage them and give them tracks to use.  A new track for cars is being developed near Duneske in Cahir.  It is to be hoped people will be able to use it to train.

Just like a tractor, a quad is used for getting to places, carrying goods, maintaining wiring and doing all the work that needs to be done around a farm.

It is important to recognise that they can be essential work vehicles but they can also be a complete nuisance.  I commend Sinn F&eacute;in on putting this motion before the D&aacute;il.  It is important that we discuss the serious injury and death as well as the mere nuisance that quad bikes and scramblers can cause when inappropriately used.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to bring to the attention of the D&aacute;il one other thing which I think should be included in this category, namely, jet skis.  I do not know anybody for whom a jet ski is an essential work vehicle.  They are a nuisance which I encountered throughout this summer.  There were a lot more people in the water in Clare than in previous years.  As a result, jet skis were used in lakes throughout the county.  I urge the Minister to look at the nuisance jet skis cause.  The last Minister to look at this and propose a licensing regime was the former Minister for State at the then Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Hugh Byrne, a Fianna F&aacute;il member from the Minister's part of the world.<\/p>  <p>  I know that general boating is not subject to licensing in Ireland and I do not think it should be.  There is a long tradition of lake boating where I come from in Clare, and I am sure it is the same in most counties with lakes.  However jet skis are very different from a young lad doing a bit of fishing in a boat on a lake.  He can ramp up the outboard engine as much as he wants but he will not cause much nuisance.  However, one of my earlier childhood memories is of someone wrapping a jet ski around a pier.  The rider was going at full throttle and simply did not know how to stop.  Apparently a jet ski will stop if one drops it, but this person did not know it and ploughed straight into a pier.  They were brought to hospital by an ambulance.  Luckily they survived, though the jet ski did not.  The nuisance continues in that same spot year after year.<\/p>  <p>  I refer again to the increased number of people on the water this summer because of the lockdown and the initial good weather.  Jet skis were used on lakes where they had never been seen before.  I spoke to a constituent about it yesterday.  She told me of an incident on her family farm, which adjoins a lake.  A cow was so panicked by jet skis on the lake that she threw a calf.<\/p>  <p>  There can be no doubt that jet skis are a nuisance.  I am not suggesting for a moment that all jet skis are a nuisance.  There is a time and a place for jet skis, just as there is for quad bikes and scrambler motorcycles, as Sinn F&eacute;in fully recognises in this motion.  Those vehicles are appropriate in properly fenced and secured mountain biking areas.  However, jet skis on the water and motorbikes in parks are potentially very dangerous vehicles.  We are all very aware of the very sad story of the Armenian couple which might have partly inspired this motion.  Other people have come close to very serious harm because of the inappropriate use of motorcycles and quad bikes.<\/p>  <p>  I urge the Minister to keep jet skis in mind when dealing with this issue because they pose a particular threat.  They also pose a threat to people who just want to go about their lives and enjoy a tranquil and scenic day on Lough Derg or Lough Corrib.  Someone wishing to do some quiet and contemplative fishing can be confronted with an idiot on a jet ski.  Not every jet ski owner is an idiot.  Many are highly responsible, but unfortunately not all of them are.  Some kind of regime must be put in place to differentiate between those who use jet skis in appropriate places and those who do not, and thus break the peace and tranquility of the area and endanger human and animal life on quiet lakes, frequently frightening cattle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700044#TT00300","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1605643800,"counter":473,"content":"<p>That was a lenient interpretation of the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700044#TT00400","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1605643800,"counter":474,"content":"<p>They pose a similar problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700044#TT00500","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1605643800,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak in support of this motion.  We were all young and we all tried to have a go on the first engine we saw.  Everything is fine until something goes wrong.<\/p> <p>There is a wild streak in every youngster.  Young people need opportunity as well.  The one thing we have not done in this country is provide a safe environment where youngsters who want to use these vehicles can do so responsibly.  We do not seem to want to do that.  This activity is a torment in a lot of cities and areas.<\/p> <p> Unfortunately, what is a great bit of craic sometimes ends up in someone losing a limb or a life, which is regrettable.  We have to start regulating them.  It is as simple as that.  We have to make sure we put a person's life or limbs ahead of everything and make sure that this activity takes place in a safe environment.  The message that needs to go out is that when doing one thing, a person needs to be doing something else in parallel.  We need to give them the facility to express and enjoy themselves but in an environment operated by people who ensure the proper precautions are taken and, above all else, in an environment that is safe.  This activity is a problem in many large cities.  In the country, we do not see much of it.  A person might see a quad bike quicker than he or she would see a scrambler.  In the cities or the large towns, this activity gathers a crowd.  There is no point in saying otherwise.  It is great craic going up hills until something goes wrong. <\/p> <p> There is one thing we could do in regard to quad bikes.  I recall that years ago when we had a problem with very old tractors turning over and, unfortunately, people were being killed, a safety bar was put around them.  Similar to the safety bar that was developed for the tractors which years ago had no cabs.  We should look to that in regard to quad bikes.  Unfortunately, the statistics show that a lot of people get caught when a quad bike tumbles over.  I am not suggesting a safety bar is the be-all and end-all and that it would resolve everything but it could help.  We need to make sure quad bikes have indicators for road use.  To be honest, I think the cost of road tax on a quad bike is scandalous, especially for the farming community.<\/p> <p> I will not labour and talk all night.  I support the motion.  We need to do it.  In terms of recreation and sport and youngsters, they have had little to do over the past eight or nine months.  The media sometimes likes to show them on television doing this or that wrong, or to show them outside some place in Dublin, Limerick or Galway and so on.  In general, they can take a bow for the effort they have made in this country over the past seven or eight months.  For people in our age group it is not as tough as it is for young, energetic people who want to go out and break free.  We should be giving them the option to enjoy themselves safely and putting in place the facilities to enable them to do that.<\/p> <p> I have spoken many times about Mondello Park.  Last Sunday night week I spent time with a person aged 74 whose licence had expired.  What have we become as a society that a person of 74 years of age who is well able to drive but whose licence has expired had to retake a theory test?  Could we not have a bit of cop-on and bring them into the likes of Mondello Park, put up the signs and see whether they are fit to drive or not.  This is what we are doing.  As a society we tend to apply the hammer.  We do not seem to have a sweet at all to try to bring people with us.  We should look at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700044#TT00600","speaker":"1508","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605644400,"counter":477,"content":"<p>I thank all the Deputies who have contributed this evening.  I think we all agree on the importance of ensuring this issue is effectively addressed.  It is an issue of serious and genuine concern that makes our public and social spaces unsafe for others and creates a sense of real fear among the public.  Anti-social behaviour in any form negatively impacts on the quality of life of our communities and it is an issue that as Minister of State I am keen to address.<\/p>  <p>  Those who engage in the reckless or dangerous misuse of these vehicles require support from the whole of government.  Raising awareness of the dangers inherent in the misuse of these vehicles is key in helping to reduce the number of young people engaged in this type of behaviour.  The Garda and Road Safety Authority, RSA, launched a new public awareness campaign on 23 October to highlight the dangers quad bikes and scramblers pose to children and to urge parents not to gift these as Christmas presents.<\/p>  <p>  The Road Safety Authority reports that three of the six people who died in Ireland as a result of an incident involving a quad bike or scrambler in the period 2014 to 2019 were aged 18 or under. The casualty figures also show that between 2014 and 2019, 60 people were injured in collisions involving a quad bike or scrambler on a public road.  Of those killed or injured between 2014 and 2019, 41% of casualties were 18 years of age or under.  These collisions occurred on public roads, were reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and involved a vehicle specified as being a quad bike or scrambler.<\/p>  <p>  The public awareness campaign includes a national and local radio advertising campaign, which is fronted by Mr. Keith Synnott, consultant orthopaedic and spine surgeon of the national spinal injuries unit in the Mater hospital.  This campaign also features the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton.  As stated earlier by the Minister, Deputy McEntee, the seriousness with which the Government takes this issue is reflected in the programme for Government commitment to enhance powers available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to limit the use of scramblers and quads by those engaged in anti-social behaviour and to enact legislation to add to those powers if needed.  Legislation is just one part of the solution and we will not hesitate to look at new legislation if it is required.  The Department of Transport is responsible for road traffic law, road safety and road traffic enforcement, but the Department of Justice will do whatever it needs to do.<\/p>  <p>  Clearly, the issues underlying anti-social behaviour of whatever sort cannot be addressed entirely through new legislation in this area alone.  Public awareness of the dangers posed by the misuse of these types of vehicles is a key element of tackling any such misuse and my Department has agreed to consider and develop actions to increase awareness of the dangers of these vehicles.  The intention is that this work will be carried out in conjunction with affected communities, community groups and other stakeholders affected by the misuse of scramblers.  It will also explore how best to engage with young people who are drawn to this behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies will also be aware that a draft new youth justice strategy was published by my Department earlier this year to facilitate a public consultation process.  Implementation of the youth justice strategy will make a valuable contribution to ongoing efforts to combat anti-social behaviour, including the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes.  Issues such as the need for early intervention and family support, coupled with collaborative working by agencies and community partners, are central to the approach contained in the youth justice strategy.  The importance of the strategy is endorsed by and prioritised in the programme for Government.  Acting on the issue of anti-social behaviour will not be solved by stand-alone interventions.  It will need a cross-governmental approach to tackle the causes of anti-social behaviour as well as the actions that are being carried out.  It means also creating opportunities and will involve, I believe, restorative justice, requiring face-to-face interaction with the victims and their communities by those carrying out these activities.<\/p>  <p>  The strategy has been developed in light of the experience of State agencies and community partners who work with the comparatively small number of children and young people who come in contact with the criminal justice system.  This work has built on the 2008 youth justice strategy and the subsequent Youth Justice Action Plan 2014-2018, and it tries to deal with many of the gaps that remain, as well as new challenges which have emerged.  It is intended that the new strategy will align with successor frameworks to the current National Policy Framework for Children and Young Adults 2014-2020, which is overseen by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  It will also align with a new community safety strategy which my Department is preparing.  The Minister, Deputy McEntee, recently announced locations for new community safety pilot projects which will inform the development of that strategy.<\/p>  <p>  It is intended to bring the finalised youth justice strategy to Government later this year for approval.  In terms of supports and programmes currently available, there are 105 Garda youth diversion projects throughout the State.  The intention is to develop this service further so that it is available to every child in the State who could benefit from it through an ongoing expansion of existing services and, where necessary, the foundation of new projects.<\/p> <p>The projects are being developed to provide family support to the parents of young people participating in the projects and are undertaking early intervention and preventative work.  The role of the projects in respect of harder to engage young people is being enhanced and extended as part of the evolving youth justice system.<\/p> <p> My Department is supporting ongoing development of practice in Garda youth diversion projects through the action research project led by the University of Limerick.  The project works directly with front-line youth justice workers from local projects to develop interventions and best practice.  Based on initial outcomes from the project and evaluations of several pilot projects, it is intended to develop proposals to expand existing services to ensure national coverage and a strong focus on difficult issues such as the hard to reach cohort.<\/p> <p> More broadly, the programme for Government also contains a commitment to convene an expert forum on anti-social behaviour.  This will provide a key focus for further development of policy and engagement with stakeholders on the issue.  The commitment in the programme for Government to establish the forum refers not only to Garda enforcement powers but also to the provision of parenting supports.  As Minister of State, I convened the initial meeting of the new forum on anti-social behaviour on 27 October.<\/p> <p> It is through collaboration across Government, the public service and community stakeholders that the issue of the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes, and anti-social behaviour in general, can be tackled and our communities can be made safer.  In the interim, I commend the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the issue.  Targeted enforcement measures have been introduced in several areas where quad bikes and scramblers were causing difficulties.  I am informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to pursue enforcement through the implementation of appropriate local plans and policing strategies.  The Garda has advised my Department that it responds to all reports of anti-social behaviour and conducts operations on an ongoing basis to target anti-social activities of persons using scramblers, mopeds or quad bikes in parks and green areas.  I ask the House to support the countermotion and the ongoing work to tackle this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700045#UU00200","speaker":"1618","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605645000,"counter":479,"content":"<p>Many of the communities I represent in Cork North-Central, like other communities nationally, have been ravaged by scramblers and quad bikes.  I commend my colleagues, Deputies Paul Donnelly and Ellis, on bringing forward the motion.  They did so because Sinn F&eacute;in is committed to supporting communities and ending this scourge.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister of State said, in October the Garda, along with the Road Safety Authority, launched a campaign pleading with parents not to purchase these bikes or scramblers for their children for Christmas.  In my constituency, several clubs have had their pitches destroyed by these bikes.  These clubs cannot afford the thousands of euro needed to repair the pitches because they are run by volunteers in working-class areas who are doing their best.  There is a green space close to where I live.  Cork City Council has done brilliant work to make it an amenity with walkways and pitches for young people, older people and everyone else to enjoy, walk on and use to get out of the house.  However, time and again it has been destroyed by quad bikes and scramblers driven by people who do not care about their neighbours or communities.  We need action and the motion outlines the action we need to deliver.<\/p>  <p>  I know some people who are really interested in bikes and quads.  For young people, it would be a great initiative to provide facilities and places they can go to and enjoy themselves in a safe manner and be educated.  What Sinn F&eacute;in is proposing are solutions for young people who are genuinely interested and for their friends as well as stronger measures to tackle those who wish to engage in anti-social behaviour and destruction.  The noise that is generated by these bikes can be deafening for some people.  Last Saturday, I drove through an area where I saw five or six young boys who were no more than 13 years old or 14 years old and were racing two scrambler bikes through a green space in the middle of a residential area.  No disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, but if communities have to wait on what he offered in his speech, they have no hope.  I ask him to please support the motion.  It makes sense and it will deliver now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700046#VV00200","speaker":"1453"},{"type":"speech","time":1605645000,"counter":480,"content":"<p>In Dundalk and elsewhere in County Louth I have dealt with countless constituents, as have many other Members in their areas, who are worried about the issue of scramblers and quad bikes racing through streets and community green spaces at all hours of the day and night.  I refer to estates in Dundalk, council land, parks, private land and even farmland on the edge of town where crops were destroyed by scramblers.<\/p>  <p>  Yearly, we are told by An Garda and the Road Safety Authority of the serious safety hazard of these powerful machines.  They have the potential to injure people severely or fatally.  Reference was made to the six people who died between 2014 and 2019 as a result of these machines.  That is six families too many who have had their world turned upside down.  That is why gates and bollards are erected to make it more difficult for scramblers to get into particular areas.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda is often powerless and unable to chase people driving these bikes.  That is understandable from a safety point of view.  There have been instances when they have chased and seized some of these vehicles and generally that has been impactful.  However, the legislation ensuing from the motion will give the Garda the legal powers and the necessary resources to tackle this issue.<\/p>  <p>  I accept that some people use quad bikes and scramblers for essential work and for sport.  I get that young people are lured to adrenaline sports.  I would be the first to try out one of these bikes.  As many would attest, I would also be the first to fall off the bike and do myself an injury.  The use of these bikes for sport must take place in a controlled environment with rules, regulations and checks.  Facilitating that needs to be explored, but that will not really happen until we deal with the serious issue of the underfunding of youth services and local authorities and the significant issue of insurance.  Every summer, I have received calls regarding groups of kids in fields with scramblers and quads, drinking and doing whatever else and causing havoc for hours on end.  I refer to parents with autistic children who are sensitive to noise and have to go through what, for them, is an absolute nightmare.<\/p>  <p>  We need to ensure we do all we can do deal with this issue.  Reference was made to the anti-social behaviour element and even to scramblers being used in drug runs.  Later this week, Sinn F&eacute;in will deal with the issues of the lack of addiction services and interventions and the need for more community policing.  The motion before the House deals with an issue that is impacting on communities.  We need to facilitate them.  I am calling on Members across the House to find a solution to this problem.  I urge the House to support the motion and the ensuing legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700046#VV00300","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1605645000,"counter":481,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for their contributions, particularly those who have supported the motion.  I am really disappointed by the response of the Government.  I am not talking about the remarks of the Minister, Deputy McEntee, or the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, which, to be honest, I take with a pinch of salt.  The amendment tabled by the Minister, which I will go through, speaks volumes regarding where this Government is at.  It states, \"An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na pursue appropriate policing strategies with due regard to the need to ensure that responses to the misuse of vehicles do not lead to increased and exacerbated public safety risks\".   It is obvious that the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, who is present, has not listened to a single word uttered by any of the contributors to the motion.  There is no strategy or training in place and the Garda does not have the resources to tackle this issue.  How do I know that is the case?  I know because that is what they have told us.  That is what Deputies have been saying all night.  That is the situation is on the ground.<\/p>  <p>  The amendment claims that \"the existing legislation requires the safe use of vehicles as well as compliance with conditions for driver licensing, motor taxation and insurance, and the relevant legislative provisions have already been subject of close examination by Government departments\".  If that is the case, why have we heard Deputies speaking on the motion tell story after story of parks and open spaces being completely destroyed and how people, including older people, are afraid to walk down the street and parents are afraid to let their children out onto green spaces?  I only have to look out my front door to know what the situation is on the ground.  There is a green space in my area where there can be up to ten quads and scramblers driving up and down, especially in the summer, but also at all other times of the year.  That is how I know that the strategy is not working.<\/p>  <p>  The amendment further states that \"Garda&iacute; already have significant enforcement powers in relation to dangerous misuse of vehicles\".  If that is the case, why were two Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies saying on social media this week that they will bring in legislation to change the situation around quads and scramblers?<\/p> <p>Why did Deputy McAuliffe say in the Chamber today that he is bringing forward a Bill to change the legislation?  This is in the Minister's amendment so why was he saying that, if this is okay and we do not need extra legislation?  This flies in the face of the experience of every community I represent.<\/p> <p> I wish to refer to one comment, as it is important that we hear from ordinary, local people.  The person concerned lives in the estate next to me and we were tortured over the summer, and particularly during lockdown, with quad bikes and motorbikes in our community.  When the woman rang the Garda station, after days of torture, the garda said he would send a car up when one became available, but said there was not much more the Garda could do.  That was said directly by the garda.  The call was in the middle of the day.  The person was working from home because she was told to do so, but she could not work.  She had to go somewhere else to work because of the noise.<\/p> <p> Finally, the Minister of State said that the Garda successes in the seizure of vehicles underline the need to support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to respond to local situations and to provide appropriate resources and technical support.  He then went on to speak about the response to drug dealing and intelligence-led approaches to counter the activities of drug gangs.  That is out of touch with the reality of what is happening with quad bikes and scramblers.  The reason the gangs use these vehicles for drug dealing is that the Garda has a policy not to follow or chase them, not to deal with them and not to seize the vehicles.  As Deputy Ward said earlier, that is why younger people are now being sucked into these gangs.<\/p> <p> We put forward a very detailed motion.  It does not tie the Government to a legislative process, but it certainly charts a way forward.  I am very disappointed with the Government's response.  The message will go from the House to every community in urban areas living with this daily nightmare that the Government has no intention of dealing seriously with this scourge in those communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700046#VV00400","speaker":"1476","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1605645600,"counter":483,"content":"<p>Amendment put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1605645600,"counter":484,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 80(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time on Wednesday, 18 November 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700047#WW00300","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1605645600,"counter":485,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 8.33 p.m. and resumed at 8.53 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
