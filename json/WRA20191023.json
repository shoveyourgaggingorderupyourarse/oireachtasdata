<p>  In developing\u00a0its recommendation on the National Minimum Wage, the Low Pay Commission assesses various economic indicators such as changes in earnings, exchange rates, employment, unemployment, productivity, international minimum wage comparisons, the need for job creation and the likely impact of the National Minimum Wage changes on levels of employment, cost of living, and national competitiveness. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Numerous economic commentators, both in Ireland and overseas, have highlighted that any form of Brexit has the potential to impact negatively on the Irish economy.\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, although the  Low Pay Commission recommended an increase in the national minimum wage of 30c to &euro;10.10, it did so on the assumption of an orderly Brexit and acknowledged that the Government might wish to reserve its position in the event of a disorderly Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  Although we are all optimistic of a deal being ratified, the\u00a0possibility of a disorderly Brexit is still present and, therefore, the economic circumstances which will apply in 2020 continue to be very uncertain.\u00a0 Nevertheless, the Government accepted the recommendation of the Commission but decided to defer a decision on when the Commission&rsquo;s recommendation will commence until the nature of Brexit become clearer.<\/p>  <p>  I intend, therefore, to\u00a0make provision in the Social Welfare Budget Bill to declare the National Minimum Wage in 2020\u00a0in line with the Commission's proposals\u00a0once the situation in respect of Brexit is clarified.\u00a0 If\u00a0a Brexit deal is agreed before the end of the year, I expect that the minimum wage will be changed in January 2020 as it was in previous years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300077#WRC01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social

October to April, to over 372,000 low income households, at an estimated cost of &euro;240 million in 2019.\u00a0 The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.\u00a0\u00a0It is not intended to meet those costs in full.\u00a0 Only one allowance is paid per household.<\/p><p>My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance under the household benefits scheme at an estimated cost of &euro;188 million in 2019.\u00a0\u00a0Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, exceptional needs payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources and this may include exceptional heating costs.<\/p><p>In Budget 2020, I increased the Fuel Allowance payment by &euro;2 to &euro;24.50 per week.\u00a0 This is an increase of just under 9% and\u00a0will increase the annual Fuel Allowance rate from &euro;630 to &euro;686, i.e., a &euro;56 yearly increase.\u00a0\u00a0This increase will\u00a0bring the total payment made to over 200,000 customers in receipt of Household Benefits and\u00a0Fuel Allowance to\u00a0&euro;1,106 per annum towards their energy costs.<\/p><p>This increase follows on from a number of other improvements and increases made to the Fuel Allowance scheme in recent Budgets including\u00a0an increase\u00a0from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 per week and the number of weeks the fuel allowance is paid for increasing from 26 to 27 and then to 28.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Last year the ESRI published its report &quot;The Economic and Environmental Impacts of Increasing the Irish Carbon Tax&quot; (available at ) in which it\u00a0set out\u00a0a detailed analysis of the impact of increasing carbon tax at various rates, using a Energy Social Accounting Matrix (ESAM) covering a range of activities and commodities, reported across 10 household groups, including a treatment of the effect on households at each income decile.\u00a0 Interpolating these figures\u00a0clearly shows that the additional cost of the carbon tax will be less than the weekly net value of the Fuel Allowance increase I have announced for at least the three lowest income deciles - the very people targeted for receipt of the Fuel Allowance.\u00a0 Accordingly, it is intended that the\u00a0increased Fuel Allowance increase will compensate these households effectively.\u00a0 In addition, it is important to note that, while the Fuel Allowance increase will\u00a0come into effect from the 6th January 2020, the carbon tax increase will not take effect until May 2020 for home heating fuels, giving such households additional headroom for its introduction.\u00a0<\/p><p>Therefore, all households in receipt of the Fuel Allowance will see a net gain in their income arising from these changes.\u00a0 This ensures that the most vulnerable in society are protected from the increased carbon tax. <\/p><p>My colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment has the role of reducing energy poverty by implementing measures (administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI)) to improve the energy efficiencies of Irish homes.\u00a0\u00a0In June 2019, the Government published a Climate Action Plan.\u00a0 Action 173 of this Plan requires the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to review ways to improve how current energy poverty schemes target those most in need.<\/p><p>My Department undertakes ex-ante and ex-post social impact assessments of the main welfare and direct tax budgetary policies.\u00a0 The Social Impact Assessment (SIA) is an evidence-based methodology which estimates the likely distributive effects of policies on household incomes, families and poverty.\u00a0 The analysis is generated through the ESRI&rsquo;s tax \/ benefit micro-simulation model, SWITCH.\u00a0 The model simulates the impact of budgetary changes on a representative sample of households from the CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions.\u00a0 Indirect tax measures such as the carbon tax are not currently included in the full post-Budget Social Impact Assessment but the potential for the

have noted with interest the contributions made by all parties during recent\u00a0the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Scheme of the Payment of Wages (Amendment) Bill by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection. <\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0Bill carries forward the long-established distinction between &lsquo;tips and gratuities&rsquo; on the one hand and &lsquo;service charges&rsquo; on the other.\u00a0 Existing legislation allows service charges to form a reckonable component of a worker&rsquo;s pay or wages.\u00a0 In developing these proposals,\u00a0I have been guided\u00a0by both the National Minimum Wage Act and the Low Pay Commission&rsquo;s 2018 report: &ldquo;A Review of Current Practices in relation to Tips &amp;amp; Gratuities&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, service charges are a non-discretionary contractually imposed\u00a0element of a customer&rsquo;s bill, are liable for VAT, and form part of a business&rsquo; operating income.\u00a0 They are used by businesses in a variety of ways, including covering some or all of their wage costs.\u00a0 I believe, therefore, that it is not currently possible or desirable to ignore this reality in my proposed Bill, which I have committed to progress in the short term.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0Bill will prohibit tips and gratuities from forming part of a person&rsquo;s contractual wages, not just the National Minimum Wage.\u00a0 It will also bring transparency to tipping policies for the benefit of staff and customers.\u00a0 This is obviously a step in the right direction.\u00a0 However, I remain\u00a0concerned by the potential for monies, generally intended by customers for the staff who have served them, to go elsewhere as a result of how service charges are treated under existing legislation. <\/p>  <p>  In this regard I have\u00a0requested the Low Pay\u00a0Commission to include this question in relation to service charges as part of its year&rsquo;s work programme and report to me its views and recommendations. <\/p>  <p>  I look forward to working with members on all sides of the Houses of the Oireachtas to progress this Bill as expeditiously as possible in order to

to immediately address the problem of rapidly rising insurance premiums.\u00a0 Instead, a broad series of initiatives are required to address this problem.<\/p>  <p>  Consequently, the Government has brought forward a number of pieces of legislation, arising from recommendations of the Cost of Insurance Working Group.\u00a0 These include the following:<\/p>  <p>  - The Judicial Council Act 2019, which was enacted in July.\u00a0 This is a key piece of legislation in the context of insurance reform.\u00a0 It provides for the establishment of a Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee, which will introduce new guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum, following the formal establishment of the Judicial Council.\u00a0 It is now matter for the Judiciary to put in place the Judicial Council and to operationalise the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee. \u00a0While the Government cannot interfere in their deliberations, I would hope that the Judiciary will recognise the importance of this issue and prioritise it accordingly;<\/p>  <p>  - The Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018, which has established the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank.\u00a0 This will increase transparency around the future cost of private motor insurance.\u00a0 The CBI is due to make its first report by the end of 2019, and will also make recommendations to me regarding potentially expanding its scope to include employer and public liability insurance;<\/p>  <p>  - The Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019, which makes important reforms to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, by strengthening its powers around compliance with its procedures; <\/p>  <p>  - The Insurance (Amendment) Act 2018 to reform the Insurance Compensation Fund to provide certainty to policyholders and insurers, resulting from the failure of Setanta Insurance; and<\/p>  <p>  - Amendments to Sections 8 and 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 to align the timeframes by which claims should be notified to businesses with GDPR time limits on the keeping of CCTV footage to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected.\u00a0 These were introduced through the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018.<\/p>  <p>  I would also note that an important piece of work that may entail legislation in the future is the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s (LRC) work to undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries, as part of its Fifth Programme of Law Reform.\u00a0 This work is well underway and I am hopeful that it will conclude in the second half of 2020.\u00a0 This could in turn have a positive impact on the cost of insurance. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s question in respect of sanctions for false or exaggerated claims, I would note that the CIWG considered this issue during its consideration of employer and public liability insurance.\u00a0 In particular, it reviewed the relevant sections of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 (sections 25 and 26). \u00a0The CIWG noted that the number of recorded prosecutions and convictions for the offence of false evidence in section 25 is very low and that this suggested a need for further co-operation between the insurance industry and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. \u00a0It also noted that while the majority of applications in respect of alleged fraudulent actions under section 26 were refused, it concluded that there was nothing fundamentally wrong with the provision. \u00a0It also commented that there was a need for defendants to more regularly challenge misleading evidence, where appropriate by taking it to court, rather than settling on the court steps for fear of an unsatisfactory outcome.<\/p>  <p>  A number of other measures are being taken by way of ensuring that sections 25 and 26 can have their intended effect in relation to insurance fraud. \u00a0For example, the various reforms of how fraud is reported to and dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including increased co-ordination with the insurance industry, are key to this.\u00a0 The recent decision by the Garda Commissioner to develop a divisional focus on insurance fraud which will be guided by the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) which will also train Garda&iacute; all over the country on investigating insurance fraud also demonstrates the commitment by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to tackle false or exaggerated claims, and I commend the Garda&iacute; for their recent raids under Operation Coatee, which targets insurance-related criminality, in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  As I think the Deputy will appreciate from these developments, a concerted policy approach is being taken with the support of the Cost of Insurance Working Group to address the issue of insurance fraud including as it impacts on small and medium enterprises and the broader business community. This is being done by means of a series of mutually reinforcing measures. \u00a0At the same time, they are intended, in their collective implementation, to give greater effect to the existing provisions of sections 25 and 26 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I believe all of the reforms mentioned above are already having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from September 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24% lower than the July 2016 peak) and the Government is determined to continue working to ensure that these positive pricing trends can be extended to other forms of insurance, including those relevant to businesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300078#WRD02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs Application","counter":114,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300078#WRD02500"},{"type":"question","counter":115,"qnumday":91,"qnumall":"[43722\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300078#WRD02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position on tax relief for employees and the self-employed in respect of pension contributions;

These include the clinical and cost effectiveness of the product, the opportunity cost, the potential or actual budget impact, and the impact on resources that are available to the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  In line with the 2013 Act, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE pursuant to the Community Drugs scheme, the company must first submit an application to the HSE to have the new medicine added to the Reimbursement List.<\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the IPHA agreement, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse the medicine.<\/p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE National Service Plan 2019 included a provision of &euro;10m for new drugs enabled by an &ldquo;invest to save&rdquo; programme. To assist the HSE in creating this financial headroom, the National Service Plan 2019 included a provision of &euro;3m for the establishment of an HSE dedicated pharmaceutical value improvement programme, to bring about greater efficiencies in medicines management and to promote changes in prescribing behaviour in favour of more clinically efficient and cost-effective products in both community and hospital settings.<\/p>  <p>  These new measures are expected to complement existing cost control initiatives which are being undertaken by the HSE under the auspices of the Medicines Management Programme. Among the initiatives already being pursued are improvement in practices for the procurement of drugs in hospitals and the designation of preferred products, with a focus on high cost prescribing areas.<\/p>  <p>  I and officials have also been engaging over the past number of years with a number of voluntary EU forums.\u00a0 In June 2018, I signed the Beneluxa Initiative on Pharmaceutical Policy. This Agreement is in line with my objective to work with other European countries to identify workable solutions, in an increasingly challenging environment, to secure timely access for patients to new medicines in an affordable and sustainable way.\u00a0 In June 2019, Ireland became a Founding Member of the International Horizon Scanning Initiative (IHSI) which is being established as part of the work programme of Beneluxa.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  These domestic and international measures are being taken to ensure the greatest possible access to new treatments for patients in Ireland. In 2019 to date, the HSE has approved 29 new medicines and 5 new uses of existing medicines representing a significant investment by the HSE to provide access to new and innovative treatment for Irish patients.\u00a0 It is expected that over 3,000 patients will benefit from access to these new medicines over the next five years.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  With regards to\u00a02020, funding is provided to the HSE for health services in accordance with the letter of determination which sets out the approved level of overall HSE expenditure for the year.

Under the first call for applications from the Climate Action Fund, funding of up to &euro;10 million will support ESB eCars to develop a nationwide, state-of-the-art electric vehicle fast charging network, with ESB eCars also investing &euro;10m. This project includes the installation of 140 fast chargers consisting of 90 150kW chargers (each of which will be capable of charging two vehicles simultaneously) and upgrading 50 existing standard chargers (each consisting of 2 charge points) to 50kW chargers The project will also involve replacing over 500 existing standard charge points with next generation high reliability models. <\/p>  <p>  This is a multi-annual project and is expected to be fully completed by 2022.

The rollout will occur in a structured and phased basis, commencing with an initial delivery of 20,000 meters by year end, rising to 250,000 meters by end 2020 and a further 500,000 meters every year from 2021 to 2024.<\/p>  <p>  On 2 September 2019 ESB Networks commenced the rollout in Portlaoise and Bandon and their surrounding areas. North east areas of county Cork are not included in the short term schedules but these will be reviewed in the new year. ESB Networks have committed to ensuring that customers will be given plenty of notice ahead of their meter replacement. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300081#WRG05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Service Provision","counter":371,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300081#WRG05900"},{"type":"question","counter":372,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[43740\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300081#WRG06000","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if the provision of broadband in an area (details supplied) will be investigated.","asker":"1278","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":373,"content":"<p>Every home, farm, school and business in Ireland will have access to high speed broadband &ndash; no matter where they are located &ndash; following the Government&rsquo;s decision to approve the appointment of a preferred bidder to the National Broadband Plan.

A deployment plan will be made available by the Bidder once the contract is signed. In the first year of roll out, the Bidder will deploy approximately 300 Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) across all counties.

The review did conclude that despite achieving good levels of participation and engagement some challenges remain. Consideration was given to the size of LCDCs when they were being developed, with a focus on achieving the optimum balance between a tight and effective committee on one hand and securing sufficient participation on the other. This remains the objective and LCDCs are using mechanisms such as sub-committees and working groups to broaden participation and engagement.

In addition IHREC presented at the Social Inclusion Forum which the Department hosted in the Aviva Stadium and the Department's Assistant Principal forum in Dublin Castle, attended by over 200 senior managers.\u00a0A departmental\u00a0working group\u00a0was established in 2018 which assessed DEASP's actions in the area of public sector duty.<\/p>  <p>  This Department has also promoted the Professional Diploma in Human Rights and Equality offered by IHREC in conjunction with the IPA and a number of staff have undertaken this course. In addition, representatives from the Department's policy areas are due to undertake Public Sector Duty training with IHREC in November, 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The Department provides ongoing supports and learning programmes to create awareness in relation equality for the benefit of staff and customers.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  All new staff undertake a\u00a0two-day Induction and Orientation course, one day of which is focused on best customer service practice and addresses issues of equality and diversity, discrimination and unconscious bias to underpin the significance of these matters.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>The Department's\u00a0Staff Development Unit promotes to staff the e-learning module, Delivering Equality in Public Services: An Introduction for Frontline Staff hosted on the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.\u00a0 This e-learning course provides an introduction to equality in service delivery.\u00a0 It is designed for frontline workers in the public sector to help them make equality real in\u00a0their day-to-day work in the context of equality law.\u00a0A dedicated intranet\u00a0site also provides access to\u00a0e-learning modules from the National Disability Authority-   Disability Equality Training for Public Sector Staff. <\/p>  <p>  The Department has recently\u00a0developed\u00a0a suite of Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) accredited learning programmes in collaboration with the National College of Ireland (NCI) directly addressing topics such as decision making and bias as well as ethics, equality and diversity. The current Certificate in Social Protection Studies explicitly references the Public Sector Duty and is available to all staff in my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300082#WRH06700","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pensions Reform","counter":455,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300082#WRH06900"},{"type":"question","counter":456,"qnumday":206,"qnumall":"[43772\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300082#WRH07000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the body that will manage the funds in the context of the plan for an auto-enrolment pension scheme;

who would deliver retirement saving services to members.\u00a0 In this regard, the CPA would tender for service delivery by the Registered Providers through the open market on a periodic basis.\u00a0 The CPA would also establish the standards for retirement savings services to be delivered by the &lsquo;Registered Providers&rsquo; and the product features and options that would be offered.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In order for the Government to be able to make decisions on the preferred delivery option, further work is being carried out to determine the implications of any option being considered.\u00a0 To this end, my Department was successful in obtaining technical support through the EU Structural Reform Support Services in relation to the design of the AE system.\u00a0 In this regard, the Department is being supported by a project team of international pensions experts on the scope and design of the CPA, with the aim of finalising proposals for Government by the end of the year.<\/p>  <p>  Most recently, the Cabinet Committee on the Economy was updated on progress with the design of the AE system including an overview of findings from the consultation process.\u00a0 I intend to bring a further report to Government in the coming weeks to facilitate the next steps for implementation of the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300082#WRH07100","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pension (Contributory)","counter":458,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300082#WRH07200"},{"type":"question","counter":459,"qnumday":207,"qnumall":"[43784\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300082#WRH07300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if a payment to a person (details supplied) will be reviewed;
