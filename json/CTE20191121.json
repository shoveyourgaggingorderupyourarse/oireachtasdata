No apologies have been received for today's meeting.<\/p> <p>  We need to agree minutes for previous meetings.  We met on Tuesday, 5 November regarding greenhouse gas and financial transactions with witnesses from the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and the Central Statistics Office, CSO.  We had our normal weekly meeting on 7 November, for which certain details have been circulated.  We had a private meeting on 12 November to consider our periodic report.  A note on that has been circulated.  We also had a normal weekly meeting on 14 November, last week.  Can we agree and publish those minutes?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  As no matters arise, I will move to correspondence, starting with category A, briefing documents and opening statements.  Nos. 2552 and 2562 from the Charities Regulator are briefing documents and opening statements for today&rsquo;s meeting.  We will note and publish these.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 2564 dated 20 November is the opening statement from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment for the session this afternoon.  We will note and publish this.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Category B is other correspondence.  Some items that we published last week have been held over in case members wish to raise any matters.  The first of these is No. 2530 from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, dated 7 November provides information requested by the committee following our recent meeting with Caranua on 17 October as follows: a report on the consultation with survivors of institutional abuse; information regarding pension liabilities incurred by Caranua under the public services single scheme; and details regarding four properties that were initially offered by religious congregations under the 2002 indemnity agreement and accepted for transfer to the State which subsequently had to be rejected, mainly because of title issues, and cash amounts equivalent to the agreed valuation accepted instead.  We agreed to note and publish this last week.<\/p> <p>  No. 2532 from Caranua, dated 7 November was also noted and published last week.  It deals with salaries paid to the acting CEO and non-acting CEO during the period of overlap in 2018; a breakdown of the cancelled payments returned to Caranua; details of when the 2018 accounts came before the board; details of expenditure of &euro;80,000 under the human resources heading in 2016; breakdown of expenditure on consultancy work; details regarding 317 outstanding applications; any surplus or interest accrued on contributions received from the Christian Brothers; details regarding statutory redundancy payments and the amount set aside for redundancies; details regarding statistics on phone calls to Caranua; a note on Caranua's total administrative costs since its inception; a breakdown of administrative costs for each year since Caranua's inception; and a note on ongoing mediation involving construction companies and alleged defective work.  We have already agreed to note and publish this.  If any member wants to discuss it, that is fine.  If not, it has been circulated, members have it and are free to discuss it among themselves in any forum they wish, but we have already published it.<\/p> <p>  No. 2544 is from Mr. Paddy O'Keeffe, tax appeals commissioner, dated 8 November providing the regular update which we require from the Tax Appeals Commission.  The value of the top ten cases amounts to &euro;2.558 billion.  All bar one relate to corporation tax issues.  One relates to the environmental levy, which was subject to a recent Supreme Court decision and parties are now reviewing that judgment.  All the other cases have been listed.  There is a proposed timetable for February 2020.  In one or two they expect progress to be reviewed this month.  The schedule is there.  We note and publish it.  There are no details of names of individuals or companies.  Many of them are in respect of items that could potentially be more than &euro;100 million.  The total is provided.  It is in line with the previous report.  We are getting reports on a regular basis.  We will note and publish that and people can make observations on that.<\/p> <p>  No. 2545 is from Mr. Fergal Lynch, Secretary General, Department of Children and Youth Affairs, dated 8 November providing an update requested by the committee on pending claims being managed by the State Claims Agency on behalf of the Department, including a geographic breakdown.  In particular, I draw attention to the 57 active claims relating to Oberstown detention centre, 49 of which are claims from members of staff.  We will note and publish this.  It contains information we were seeking regarding our discussion with the State Claims Agency.  It is very worrying that 49 staff members have claims against the Department in respect of Oberstown.  We will note it.  That is a serious matter for the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs, and Justice and Equality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019112100002#B00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1574326800,"counter":7,"content":"<p>On the geographic breakdown, the letter did not provide details of who was making claims in those areas.

That is noted and published.  We will follow that up.<\/p><p>No. 2546 is on the school transport scheme.  It contains two sentences which I find almost mutually contradictory.  It is from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, dated 8 November responding to our request on whether Bus &Eacute;ireann's auditors are satisfied that profits from the school transport scheme have not been used to cross-subsidise Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; advises that reimbursement to Bus &Eacute;ireann is on a cost-recovery basis for a range of costs identified as being incurred in the operation and administration of the scheme, together with other direct and indirect costs attributable to the work carried out for the Department, referred to as the transport management charge.  A separate account for the school transport scheme is audited each year by independent auditors in Bus &Eacute;ireann.  The Department is satisfied that the appropriate assurances have been received from Bus &Eacute;ireann that all moneys in the school transport scheme are retained within the scheme and expended only on the requirements of the scheme.  We will note and publish this.<\/p><p>However, Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; also contradicts that statement in his letter.  The essential element of what he is saying is that reimbursement is on a cost-recovery basis under an old agreement going back to 1975.  The letter refers to that.  The last paragraph on the first page states:<\/p><blockquote>The C&amp;amp;AG report referenced a surplus in the Transport Management Charge element of the costs.  This amount was held by way of an uncommitted reserve by Bus Eireann to be used solely for the purposes of the school transport scheme.  The uncommitted reserve was repaid in full to the Department in December 2018.<\/blockquote> <p>I cannot understand this letter stating there is not a surplus and it is on a cost-recovery basis.  I can understand that there might be a surplus one year and it goes into the next year to meet known costs coming up in that year because it cannot be cut off at the end of the year.  There is a follow through.  However, at the end of all that the letter states, &quot;The uncommitted reserve was repaid in full to the Department.&quot;  Why would it hand money back to the Department if there was not a surplus?  I do not understand that sentence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019112100002#B00600","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1574326800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>There is a bigger issue there, relating to the group of companies under CI&Eacute;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019112100002#B00700","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1574326800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>The Comptroller and Auditor General has been all over this and produced a special report.

We will note it because it deals specifically with this and highlights a parliamentary question published on 12 November asked by Deputy MacSharry, a member of this committee, in respect of this issue.  The reply is suitably vague.  We will note that item.  We will not publish the name of the person but we will publish the parliamentary question and reply because they are a matter of public record.  We are satisfied that we are going back to the Department on this issue.<\/p><p>Next is No. 2547B from Mr. Ray Mitchell of the HSE providing information we requested regarding Daisyhouse Housing Association.  There is an ongoing issue.  Issues were highlighted.  They have given us an extensive briefing note in respect of the structure of what Daisyhouse does.  We will note and publish this.  They deal with 15 residents for residents to successfully move into long-term housing.  They work with 14 tenants in long-term accommodation and have provided 32 people with access to health and well-being opportunities.  In respect of funding to Daisyhouse, &euro;237,000 is 51% of their funding and comes from the HSE under a section 39 agreement.  They receive donations of 26% and receive some rent themselves and have some fundraising activities.  Following the issues raised, they had a meeting in August 2018 and the social inclusion teams in the relevant areas in Dublin city and Wicklow met them.  This organisation has now been included on the 2019 agreed audit plan by the HSE.  There is a audit ongoing and we will ask to be kept informed of that audit when it is completed.  We note and publish that.<\/p><p>Next is No.<b><\/b>2548B from Mr. John O'Sullivan, chief executive and Commissioner of Valuation, dated 12 November 2019, providing the information we requested in relation to the valuation of public utility undertakings.  Mr. O'Sullivan advises the global valuation process relates to the physical network occupied by certain public utilities for its principal purposes, mainly the supply of gas and telecommunications, issues like that.  They have an overall valuation of &euro;970 million which is designated as public utility undertakings for the purpose of the valuations.  I just want to explain this to the public who will find it interesting.  Global valuations apply where there are major organisations providing public utilities.  They can be private companies providing public utilities across the vast majority of local authorities.  The way the Valuation Office does it is to value the total assets and then apportion this to the relevant local authority areas in which there are assets of that organisation.  This is so people will know what we are talking about.  They have issued very good information here on a county-by-county basis for each of the following companies: 2RN, formerly RT&Eacute; Transmission; BT Communications; Eircom; EirGrid; Eir Mobile; ESB Networks; Gas Networks Ireland; Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann; Irish Water; Three Ireland (Hutchison) Ltd.; Virgin Media Ireland Ltd.; and Vodafone.  The highest valuation is in respect of ESB Networks across the country.  The next highest valuation was Irish Water.  The next highest was Gas Networks Ireland.  Eircom was the fourth highest.  The other ones are down the line.  They give a breakdown of the valuation for each of those companies by local authority.  People will know by looking at this that the 31 local authorities are split showing the valuation.  Gas Networks Ireland has only 27 local authorities because there are some counties that have no natural gas network.  It is not included.  Eight local authorities have not had a recent revaluation and they are listed on the right hand side as a separate amount.<\/p><p>What I want to stress, because it is not covered in the letter - and perhaps there is an assumption that we know it but the public will not know it - is that while it gives the total global valuation of these organisations as &euro;970 million, which is almost &euro;1 billion, members of the public watching should know that is not &euro;1 billion for local authorities.  The local multiplier is applied in each local authority area in respect of the valuation designated by those organisations.  We all know about counties that have had revaluations.  People got a figure showing what the valuation was and they panicked.  Then they went in and the local authority multiplier might have been 0.25 or 0.23 or whatever the case was.  That is not money for local authorities from rates.  It is the valuation and each local authority has its own local multiplier.  The amount for local authorities is a fraction of this and it can only be obtained by getting the multiplier in each local authority area.  Irish Water is the one that raised this issue in particular.  There is great information for people who want it.  I have run through it so the people watching understand what this correspondence and discussion is about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019112100002#C03300","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574326800,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I want to raise the global valuation of Irish Water because it has created significant problems for some local authorities, including Dublin City Council, Fingal County Council and Waterford City and County Council, which is proportionately the hardest hit.  Through no fault of their own some of these local authorities have found themselves significantly short-changed.  Local authorities in Dublin, Waterford and a couple of others happened to have the revaluation process when Irish Water was established.  Prior to this, I understand most, if not all, local authorities had a nominal charge on rates because it was just money in and money out for them.  Taking Waterford as an example of a revaluation of the rates done after Irish Water was established, the contribution from Irish Water was &euro;4.7 million.  It was paid in the first year and then, because of the difficulties with Irish Water, it stopped paying the rates and compensation was paid by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Each local authority has received this until now.<\/p> <p>  The Water Services Act was amended in 2017 to allow Irish Water to pay rates again.  Because of the global valuation, which is not based on the infrastructure in any local authority area but on population, some local authorities have been hit with massive reductions, such as &euro;8 million in Dublin and &euro;3.3 million in Waterford.  Through no fault of their own, they now have to take an axe to cut services or increase rates.<\/p> <p>  When the revaluation was done in all local authorities, there were some winners and losers.  The pot of money remained the same but that is eaten bread and it has been forgotten.  What is now happening is that ratepayers and those using local services are being affected.  This is quite a serious issue.  Dublin City Council cannot pass its budget and something similar will happen in Waterford.  There are ongoing discussions with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.<\/p> <p>  We should go back to the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Housing, Planning and Local Government to ask about the history of this and how it came about.  Some authorities, through no fault of their own, just happened to go through the revaluation process at the time.  Waterford City and County Council was given the figure of &euro;4.7 million and did not come up with it.  It was built into their income over seven years and taken away from them with all of the consequences of that.  Dublin City Council's proposed budget included an increase in rents on local authority tenants and an increase on toll charges and rates.  This will have an impact on a lot of people.  It is not the case with every local authority and, in fact, some local authorities gained.  Some were winners and others losers.  For those who are losers it is not their fault but they are taking a hit.

The Dublin city manager, Owen Keegan, stated publicly that he had an understanding with the Minister that any shortfall would be met by Exchequer funding.  It is unusual for a member of the County and City Management Association to make such a public statement.  This is not happening and, as I said last week, that issue alone is leaving Dublin City Council with a substantial shortfall of &euro;8 million.

We must remember the central allocation by the Department of Finance to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government out of the overall pool is &euro;35 million.

He takes our point but says that the corporation will explore the viability of seeking additional data at the time of application about the number of jobs to be assisted.  However, he says that its preference in such matters is to gather the minimum information needed from small and medium enterprises which are borrowing to meet policy, state aid and founder requirements to keep the application simple and straightforward.  If that is the approach it takes, that is fine.  It should not be publishing the other information regarding employment if it is not related to what it is doing.  My only gripe is that it was claiming some connection between a small loan to a particular organisation and total employment.  If it cannot do it and the amounts are small, where it involves small organisations which meet all the other requirements, that is fine but it should not be putting the employment figures in its annual report unless it can stand over them.<\/p> <p>  No. 2553B is from Professor Willie Donnelly of Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, providing details requested by the committee regarding the build-up of budget deficits in recent years.  There is much documentation and Deputy Cullinane might want to comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019112100002#E01500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1574326800,"counter":94,"content":"<p>We sought this quite comprehensive report because this committee recently shone a spotlight on third level institutes and their funding.  A number of institutes of technology are running deficits.  When we looked at it, I think Waterford had the highest deficit proportionally.  We are trying to understand the reason for that and what corrective action is being taken.  It seems that there a number of reasons, including consolidation of companies after a statutory inspection that took place in the institute.  There was regularising of certain income streams.  It noted the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General into how certain income streams were accounted for.  It also talks about cutbacks in funding for higher education.  I assume it is talking about the austerity years, when there were cutbacks.  It has an accumulated deficit of &euro;6.8 million.  The last line is worrying, where it states that despite making savings in both pay and non-pay, the institute could not match the income cuts with comparable expenditure savings.  It is essentially telling us that it cannot bridge the gap, which is a considerable deficit.  It looks like it is not entirely the institute's fault, if at all, if it was a result of significant cuts at the time.<\/p> <p>  If that has not been dealt with by the Department, that is a difficulty for the institute.  I know that a cost containment plan was put in place that resulted in significant reductions in services on at least one campus in an attempt to deal with it.  The problem here is that the institute cannot deal with pay, which is a big part of any institute's spending.  When it starts trying to cut non-pay expenditure, it becomes very difficult.  It is a very similar situation to a hospital.<\/p><p>It might be useful to look at WIT as a test case in terms of the other institutes.  Perhaps we could bring representatives of WIT in and look at what happened and the history of this.  WIT has set out very clearly for us the history going back to 2011 and how it ended up in this situation.  It is, it seems, trying to recover and to deal with the deficit.  There was a drop-off in student numbers.  WIT says there has been an increase again, which is helping.  However, I find the last line very worrying because this is an institute that, it is hoped, will transition into a technological university with Carlow yet it is carrying this big deficit and does not seem to be able to manage it, it seems, through no fault of its own because it just does not have the income to do it.  It cannot cut in areas in which it cannot cut, such as pay, obviously.  I request that we have a look at this as part of our work programme.  We did a lot of work on third level institutes and now we have moved on to other issues.  However, this is one of those legacy issues.  I refer to how WIT is funded; consolidation of other companies, which in this case happened; how that has played a part in the deficit; and, more importantly, the cuts in funding to higher education and how they are still biting for some institutes of technology.  Would that be a reasonable request, that we perhaps look at Waterford as-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019112100002#E01600","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574326800,"counter":96,"content":"<p>Yes, and we will ask the HEA its view-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019112100002#F00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1574326800,"counter":97,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019112100002#F00300","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1574326800,"counter":98,"content":"<p>-----on this, not just in the case of Waterford but across the board.<\/p> <p>  I refer to two other notes in the letter from WIT, one of which is good news.

I remember that a few years ago we almost suspended a meeting because the most recent accounts we had were two and a half years old.  Again, the input of the Committee of Public Accounts has certainly brought a bit of realisation to the boards of these organisations that there must be proper corporate governance, which includes producing financial statements in a timely manner.  WIT now seems to be doing so.  However, as Deputy Cullinane said, the last sentence reads, \"The Institute, despite making savings in both pay and non-pay, could not match the income cuts with comparable expenditure saving.\"  I take it that that is the historic position, not the position into the future.

We will certainly come back to it at that stage.  We will note and publish that information in the meantime.  It is good to get it.<\/p> <p>  The next item of correspondence - we are nearly there - is No. 2554B, from the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, dated 14 November, responding to our request for information regarding asylum seekers.  The information was requested by our secretariat as part of our periodic report work.  There is also the next item, No. 2560B, from Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll, Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, dated 5 November, providing information requested by the committee on direct provision centres.  This is also to feed into our periodic report, which we will publish next week.  For the benefit of people watching the meeting, I wish to highlight a couple of matters.<\/p> <p>  In No. 2554B, which contains some useful figures and statistics, the Department of Justice and Equality states the following.  At the end of October there were 8,560 persons with active international protection claims in Ireland, with 4,198 applications being made between January and the end of October of this year.  There were 6,760 persons in direct provision centres at the end of October.  The number of asylum seekers in hotel accommodation was 1,433 at the end of October.  The number of individuals currently residing in direct provision centres who have been granted leave to stay in the State is 778.  The average length of stay in direct provision centres, the Department says, is 22 months.  There is a chart in the correspondence, which we will publish.  The Department goes on to state the average time it takes for an application for international protection to be completed.  This was new to me, but the Department refers to the cases that were completed in October, in the last month, and seems to be saying it is shortening the procedure.  What happens is that when people arrive and present themselves at the office, they are granted accommodation on the day and then, as soon as possible, they complete the questionnaire with all the information, making their application for international protection.  It states here that for prioritised applications there will be an interview scheduled within four to five months.  For non-prioritised applications it will take nine to ten months.  Then, after the interview, it takes about two months, depending on the complexity of the case, for a decision to be recommended.  The Department is saying that the processing time during October 2019 was 15 months and for prioritised cases it was 9.6 months.  What are the criteria to be considered in determining whether an application is prioritised versus non-prioritised?  That is new to me.  I had not encountered it before.  Members can see what the Department is saying.  The figures are there and they are useful.<\/p> <p>  This is complemented by the next item of correspondence, No. 2560B, from the Secretary General of the Department, Aidan O'Driscoll, again providing information that we will need for our periodic report.  He refers in this short letter to the numbers in direct provision, and I have given those figures.  He states, \"Because of a shortage of places in centres, there are now, as of 29th October 2019, 1,531 people are in emergency accommodation in hotels and guesthouses.\"  He accepts that this is highly unsatisfactory and says that some time ago the Department put an advertisement in the national media looking for such centres.  The Department further states that it held a competition on a regional basis for people to provide emergency accommodation centres - that is, accommodation through hotels and guest houses - and that, following the regional competitions, the Department is now in the mobilisation phase in the south-east, the midlands and the mid-west regions.  Accommodation for the south-west and western regions is still on the way.  For the mid-east region, which I presume includes Dublin, the closing date for submissions was 16 September and the valuation will commence shortly.  I am providing all this information just by way of an update.  The issue is very clear: because the accommodation centres are full, the Department has been trying to get emergency accommodation in various centres around the county.  These are meant to be temporary.  The Department says it could take three months, but that could be one or two years at the end of the day, depending on the numbers coming.  The Department notes it has no control over the numbers arriving in the country.  It must deal with people on the day they arrive and present at the office.<\/p><p>That is interesting information, some which will be in a periodic report.<\/p><p> Did the Deputy wish to comment on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019112100002#F02700","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574326800,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I do.

Most of the centres are former hotels.  Some of the hotels and guest houses are solely dedicated to emergency accommodation.  There are no other people in this accommodation, although a certain number of rooms are set aside in some hotels.  Any of the centres I have encountered are dedicated solely for emergency purposes.  We need to know what is the difference in the quality of service for the people who arrive here versus the other accommodation provided.<\/p> <p>  The other issue I wish to mention, which I believe RT&Eacute; highlighted, is that we had a detailed discussion regarding the costs of direct provision, and it emerged long after our meeting that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade had allocated part of its overseas development aid, ODA, budget towards provision for people who arrive here seeking asylum for their first 12 months here.   We were never told that and I am disappointed at the way this Department works.  The public were entitled to believe that the committee had a full, frank and complete discussion on the cost of the direct provision centres with the Department of Justice and Equality and that that was the full picture.  It transpired shortly after meeting, according to a report published by RT&Eacute;, that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade expended considerable millions of euros in recent years from the ODA budget to meet our international targets for people who come to Ireland from these countries.

The financial statements of the common investment fund are not presented to the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>  The 2018 financial statements of the authority recorded total income of &euro;3.96 million, all of which is Oireachtas grant funding.  Its expenditure in that year was &euro;3.7 million, which included staff costs of &euro;2.1 million and other administration costs of &euro;1.5 million.  The authority reported an operating surplus for the year of &euro;47,000, after appropriation of &euro;236,000 for capital purposes.  A clear audit opinion was given on the 2018 financial statements.  Certain charity funds have been lodged for safekeeping with the authority or its predecessor, the Commissioners for Charitable Donations and Bequests, and are being held pending clarification of their proper use.  These funds are held by the authority in a separate charity funds account.  The authority uses the same account, as required, to receive and transmit funds between charities and the common investment fund.  The balance on the charity funds account at the close of 2018 was &euro;1.38 million.  Most of the balance related to funds of charities being held for safekeeping.  Receipts into the fund account during 2018 amounted to just over &euro;2 million, mainly comprising dividends from the investment fund and proceeds of investment units realised at the direction of participating charities.  The charity funds account payments in 2018 mainly represented distribution of the receipts to the charities concerned.  A clear audit opinion was given on the 2018 financial statements of this account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019112100002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1574326800,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General.

I am joined by Mr. Eamon O&rsquo;Halloran, who is the authority's head of registration and projects; and Mr. Niall Scanlon, who was recently appointed as the authority's professional accountant and finance manager.  The committee will be aware that the CRA, or Charities Regulator as it is known, was established as an independent authority on a statutory basis in October 2014 in accordance with the Charities Act 2009.  The board of the authority has 12 members and the authority has 37.5 full-time equivalent members of staff.<br\/><br\/>The Charities Regulator is funded by the Exchequer through a subhead of Vote 42 of the Department of Rural and Community Development.  In 2018, our budget was &euro;4.4 million and our total spend was just over &euro;4 million.  Pay accounted for approximately &euro;2.1 million of our overall spend and non-pay expenditure amounted to approximately &euro;1.9 million.  Monthly financial reports are used by senior management, by the finance, audit, risk and governance committee and by the board to monitor performance against key strategic priorities, objectives and yearly business plan targets.  We have a number of statutory functions, such as maintaining a register of charities, ensuring charity trustees comply with the 2009 Act, carrying out inquiries and investigations into the affairs of charities and issuing guidance and other codes to assist charity trustees.  We deal with applications by charities under the Charities Acts, 1961 and 1973, for services and assistance such as authorising <i>cy-pr&egrave;s<\/i>schemes and sales of charity lands.  When it was established, the Charities Regulator took over responsibility for administering a common investment fund scheme for charities, established under the Charities Act 1961.  The current value of this fund is approximately &euro;39.7 million.<br\/><br\/>Our first statement of strategy supported the establishment of the Charities Regulator and guided us through our formative years from 2016 to 2018.  Over this period, significant time was dedicated to establishing organisational structures, processes and procedures to ensure compliance with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  During the period of our first statement of strategy, we developed an online public register of charities and established a contact centre for charity trustees and other members of the public to call or email us with any queries they may have.  Other key milestones during that period included the publication of a suite of practical and informative guidance materials to assist charity trustees, including guidelines on fundraising from the public, the development of a concerns unit and an online concerns process, the completion of a number of statutory investigations under the 2009 Act, the implementation of a new digital platform to support our regulatory and organisational activities, the launch of an enhanced website and a quarterly e-magazine to keep those involved in the sector updated on key developments, the formulation of a draft scheme for a charities (amendment) Bill along with associated draft accounting and reporting regulations and the launch of the charities governance code.<br\/><br\/>In 2019, we published our second statement of strategy, for 2019 to 2021, which aims to move us closer to realising our vision of a vibrant trusted charity sector that is valued for the public benefit it provides.  Strengthening public trust and confidence in charities is one of four strategic priorities under our second statement of strategy.<\/p><p>A key objective in this regard is to enhance further the public register of charities, which is a searchable online facility.<\/p><p> Charities are independent organisations run by charity trustees.  They play a vital role in our society and provide public benefit in diverse ways to communities in Ireland and across the world.  It is, therefore, essential that charities are transparent and accountable to volunteers, beneficiaries, employees, funders, donors and the wider public.  The register is intended as a point of reference for members of the public to learn more about individual charities.  There are currently 10,370 registered charities in Ireland and 65,904 charity trustees listed on the register.  According to research published by the Charities Regulator in 2018, the majority of charities on the register are small volunteer-led charities with income of less than &euro;50,000.  However, there is no doubt that registered charities make a significant contribution to our economy and society more generally, with income of &euro;14.5 billion, approximately 189,000 people employed in the sector and more than 300,000 volunteers.<\/p><p> Other general functions of the Charities Regulator include the promotion of compliance by charity trustees with their legal duties and ensuring the accountability of charities to donors, beneficiaries and the public.  In this regard, we work closely with charities, charity representative groups and other experts and stakeholders to ensure that the guidance materials that we publish are of practical assistance to those volunteering and working in the sector.  Examples include the guidelines on fundraising from the public, guidance for charity trustees, internal financial control guidelines for charities and, more recently, a governance code toolkit comprising templates and other guidance materials to underpin the charities governance code.  Promoting compliance with the charities governance code and working with charities to support them in its implementation will remain a key focus for the Charities Regulator for the period of our current strategy.<\/p><p> Our statutory remit also includes monitoring compliance by charitable organisations with charity law and carrying out investigations.  We actively monitor compliance with key regulatory requirements, such as the requirement for charities to submit annual reports.  Compliance rates in regard to this obligation have increased significantly over the past three years, with the overall compliance rate for annual reports due in regard to 2017 reaching 98%.<\/p><p> We also carry out inquiries as part of our concerns process.  In 2018, we received in excess of 686 concerns, which was an increase of 29% on the previous year.  Of the concerns received in respect of registered charities, over 50% related to internal financial controls and transparency and other governance issues.  We closed 722 concerns during 2018.<\/p><p> Other compliance activities in 2018 included 48 statutory directions to provide information or produce books, documents and other records for the purposes of our inquiries.  In addition, we published two inspectors&rsquo; reports into the affairs of two registered charities, GLEN and Solas&ndash;Galway Picture Palace, and we imposed intermediate sanctions on one registered charity.<\/p><p> Developing our compliance and enforcement function further is a key objective in terms of meeting our strategic priorities of providing proportionate risk-based regulation and protection, and promoting compliance within the sector.  Supported by our new IT platform, along with a number of important legislative amendments, which the Minister for Rural and Community Development is progressing through the charities (amendment) Bill, we hope to enhance our proactive monitoring capabilities further, using data to identify and anticipate risks to facilitate targeted and proportionate regulatory interventions and engagement with charities.  The charities (amendment) Bill is key in this regard as it will create a level playing field for all charities, including those that are companies, and will facilitate increased levels of transparency and greater accountability in regard to the finances of charities.<\/p><p> Since our establishment in 2014, the Charities Regulator has made significant progress in meeting its statutory mandate.  Through the hard work and commitment of the authority, its staff and those working in the charities sector, we have a strong foundation on which to build and deliver on our second statement of strategy.  We remain committed to working with all our stakeholders to fulfil our mission to regulate the charity sector in the public interest so as to ensure compliance with the law and support best practice in the governance, management and administration of charities.  I am happy to respond to any questions members of the committee might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019112100002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Martin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574326800,"counter":194,"content":"<p>Thank you.

It is a relatively new organisation and has had to develop and get structures in place.  While I believe this is a positive thing, and I do not say that regularly, it seems a small number of staff for the work it does, given there are 10,370 registered charities.<\/p> <p>  The Charities Regulator has had a turnover of senior staff lately.  That usually sets off alarm bells here.  Ms Martin might explain, so we can clear that up, why the three senior people left.<\/p> <p>  How often does the Charities Regulator liaise with the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda fraud squad, the Data Protection Commissioner and the Companies Registration Office?

That would be in terms of supporting charities but also, at the same time, since 2016, building up our concerns unit.  In future, when we have more staff, we will look to move into the area of more proactive monitoring, and I will come back to that later as there are certain things we require in that regard.<\/p> <p>  We have managed to get staff over the past year, having lost some staff.  We have a new in-house finance manager, which we did not have before as we previously used a consultant.  I wanted to bring that role in-house so that person would be reporting to me, as CEO.  We have also got our head of communications and stakeholder engagement, which is another key position we have filled since June of this year.  In addition, we have a number of positions that are obviously key and which we absolutely need to fill, such as the corporate affairs manager, and we also need more legal resources.  On the legal resources, it is a very challenging marketplace out there but we are using the different avenues available to us and working with the Department on that in regard to seeking expressions of interest for secondment of people from within the civil and public service and drawing down from past panels that are available to us.  That is very much the focus at the moment.  Another key position was filled in recent weeks when Thomas Mulholland joined us as our head of compliance and enforcement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019112100002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Martin"},{"type":"speech","time":1574326800,"counter":197,"content":"<p>Why the turnover?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019112100002#L00500","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574326800,"counter":198,"content":"<p>The turnover was due to promotions that were available to others within the Civil Service.

The main agency we interact with is Revenue, with which members of our registration team would interact.  The Deputy might be aware from our briefing material that 6,500 of the charities on our register are there because they were deemed registered at the date the register was established.<\/p><p>The deeming was related to the fact that on that date, they held a charitable tax exemption so, effectively, they came on to the register.  We have over 3,500 others which are what we call section 39 bodies.  They are the charities that registered with us.  As a result of the fact that we have a huge number of section 40 bodies, the ones that are deemed registered, we would deal with Revenue a lot.  Where a section 40 charity that has been deemed registered loses its charitable tax exemption through the operation of the Act, it automatically comes off the register.  We have no input into that decision.  Once a charity loses its tax exemption, it comes off the register and must try to re-register.  That is why we interact regularly with Revenue.  <\/p><p> In addition, we would be in contact with the Companies Registration Office regarding our IT platform and the fact that we would draw down certain materials from its website regarding the accounts of those charities that are companies.  Our compliance and enforcement team would be in contact with staff from the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement where particular issues arise, for example, if we were dealing with a company that was not keeping proper books of account.  Unfortunately, under our Act at the moment, we would not be able to proceed against such a company for breach of the Charities Act because it is a company and is carved out.  That is something we are looking to address under the charities (amendment) Bill because we believe all charities should be equally regulated by the Charities Regulator.  It means that in those situations, we have to contact the ODCE because, obviously, it is an offence not to keep proper books of account under the Companies Act.  We are reliant on the ODCE to take action in that regard.  Similarly, we would have almost daily contact with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019112100002#L00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Martin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574326800,"counter":202,"content":"<p>Regarding donations and donors, we know that quite a number of people leave bequests to charities.

Have there ever been instances where anyone in the legal profession has had to be investigated for ignoring or not following instructions 100% regarding the leaving of money to these organisations?  What procedures has the Charities Regulator used to follow up in such scenarios?  Does it ever carry out random checks in respect of these sort of donations to make sure the money is being spent appropriately to ensure public confidence?

We know that Ireland Funds and various other organisations are providing funding to third level.  We have had debates where representatives of colleges and universities have come in and said they are putting a sign over a building in Cork, for example, stating that the funding came from private funds they generated themselves, whether through donations or other income.

As a public representative, people often tell me that they do not donate to charities other than those which are local to them because they are confident of their bona fides.  I am concerned that a lot of charities are being painted in the wrong way.  There have been issues with the sector in the past, which I will not detail today.  There are one or two organisations that stand out at a national level because they are so large and well known, such as the Irish Cancer Society.  Some charities, however, are being damaged by association with what went on in the past, and potential funds are not coming to them because of this.  Could the Charities Regulator devise some type of campaign to engage and inform people?  It will be challenging because of the range of charities in operation, but it would be helpful.

I am aware that Ms Martin is bedding down the organisation.  I have gone through the opening statement and the corporate plan and have done some research on some of the work done by the Charities Regulator.  In her opening statement, Ms Martin referred to a number of \"statements of strategy\".  Initially, for the period of 2016 to 2018 the regulator was bedding down organisational structures, looking at processes and procedures in order to ensure compliance with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  The next part of the strategy for 2019 to 2021 will be, in Ms Martin's terms, to move \"closer to realising our vision of a vibrant trusted charity sector [and] ... strengthening public trust and confidence in charities\".

The work is about ensuring the register has as much information as possible relating to charities in order that members of the public can check out the individual charity in which they might be interested and can see what the charity is about.  Hopefully, the public can also take some confidence that the sector is regulated.<\/p> <p>  We are also working with the charities on the charities' governance code.  This is a huge part of our strategic priorities over the next two years in particular when we will work with the charities on that.  This is about getting the charities to engage with the tool that is available to them, which is the charities' governance code, and to increase standards of best practice in governance.  We would hope to see that reflected in levels of trust and confidence.<\/p> <p>  We will be monitoring and doing our own research to establish a baseline early next year for what are the levels of trust and confidence.  The members may be aware that in 2012 it was at the highest rate, which was 74%, but it had fallen quite considerably over the last years.  In 2017 the level of trust and confidence was at 46%.  I want to ensure that we establish a baseline and then look at that in subsequent years.  In that way we can see if we can work out the impact of the work we are doing and see how it has assisted the charity sector.<\/p> <p>  On the other side, which is the compliance and enforcement piece, charities themselves will agree that they want to see the Charities Regulator holding charities to account when things are not being done correctly.  This is a key focus over the coming years also, and especially on the resources side.  New resources we get in over the next year certainly will be going into the compliance and enforcement area.

It decided to consolidate its accounts in the past few years; it is a new step and is an example to other universities.<\/p> <p>  Ms Martin has an extremely important job.  The figures she gave in her opening statement are extraordinary, with over 10,000 charities, almost 66,000 trustees and &euro;14.5 billion, not to mention almost 190,000 volunteers.  It is an extremely important area on every level, both on an economic level and on a psychological level for the work being carried out, and there is also what volunteers get out of it. <\/p> <p>  I will follow on from the last Deputy's concerns.  In her opening statement, Ms Martin noted \"In 2018, we received ... 686 concerns, which was an increase of 29% on the previous year.\"  If we have learned anything in recent years, it is how difficult it is for someone to complain.  It is not in the interest of someone living here to complain, they suffer as a consequence.  That is why the processes and procedures need to be robust.

It is really important that people feel confident in this incredibly important sector.  The work of the witnesses is incredibly important from that point of view.  When I went through the list of charities, I noticed that some of them have 19th century names.  People know the names of many of the big charities, but there are also local charities like schools that crop up on the list.  The number of charities is incredibly large for the size of the country.  Perhaps this is a reflection of the fact that the charitable sector in this country is providing services that would normally be public services in some other countries.  I refer to charities like Rehab, Enable Ireland and the Irish Heart Foundation.  Some of their work is promotional.  It is understandable that they would have charitable status.  In many other countries, the services being provided by a charity like Enable Ireland would be a matter of public provision.  I think there is a gap being filled.  Some confidence was lost when attention was focused on the amounts of money being paid to the CEOs of charitable organisations.  I assume that does not come under the remit of the Charities Regulator.  At a time when the public is being very generous but is seeing very large salaries being paid to CEOs, it is very difficult to retain public confidence in this sector.  Is any guidance available in this regard?  Some of these companies are very big and need to have good personnel.  Is there any guidance on engagement with some of the bigger charities?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019112100002#T00700","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574326800,"counter":503,"content":"<p>I can answer that more generally because it comes under the charities governance code and the whole area of private benefit.  When salaries are paid to the people involved in running charities, that is considered to be a private benefit.  The Act provides that the private benefit must be reasonable in all the circumstances, must be ancillary and must be necessary to the furthering of the public benefit that the charity entails.  We tell charities they must ensure the amounts of money they pay to members of staff should be benchmarked and should be reasonable.  They have to be reasonable and necessary.  It is obvious that a charity which provides healthcare services in the home will need nurses.  We consider that to be a private benefit which is absolutely required and is permissible under the Charities Act.  The charity would have to make sure it is benchmarked against what a nurse would be paid elsewhere.  That is where we would come across that.  People would be asking about that, and that would be our general advice in this area.<\/p> <p>  I would like to refer to research that has been done on salaries more generally.  We might consider a salary of more than &euro;70,000 to be a high salary for these purposes.  Research indicates that less than 1% of the workforce in the not-for-profit sector, which obviously is wider than the charitable sector, is paid more than &euro;70,000.  The relevant percentage is much higher in other areas.  I believe it is 13% in the rest of the economy.  There is certainly a perception out there.  We often see it when the results of research come back.  People want charities to be well run, but at the same time they do not think people in charities should be paid the same as they might be paid elsewhere.  Our view is that a nurse who is working in a charity should be paid the same as a nurse who is working in a hospital, if they are doing the same job.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019112100002#T00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Martin"},{"type":"speech","time":1574326800,"counter":504,"content":"<p>I would not dispute that.

Operating under the Department's aegis, the Environmental Protection Agency monitors and reports on the level of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions.<\/p> <p>  Through its EU membership and participation in various international agreements, Ireland is committed to a number of climate action targets.  While some of these have been adopted voluntarily, others are binding and there will be significant financial consequences if they are not met.  Following on from these commitments, Ireland is pursuing climate targets through a combination of carbon pricing and taxation, payment of grants and subsidies, regulation and public awareness campaigns.  These activities give rise to financial transactions but because they are spread across a wide range of State organisations, the net impact on the Exchequer finances is not readily visible.  My objective in compiling this report was to present an overview of the key current financial transactions that are related to greenhouse gas emissions.<\/p> <p>  In the context of EU climate policies, a distinction is made between greenhouse gas emissions emanating from sectors of activity subject to the EU emissions trading system, ETS, and those of all other, non-ETS, sectors.  In Ireland, economic activity subject to the ETS accounted for about 28% of emissions in 2017, which is low by comparison with the EU average.  This includes power generation, manufacturing and industrial processes.  The level of emissions allowed for each operator declines each year, and if the cap is breached, carbon credits must be purchased through an EU-wide auction system.  Revenues from the auction of credits is divided between European Union member states, which must use at least 50% of the proceeds to finance specific climate and energy programmes.  Ireland's Exchequer has benefited from such sales to the amount of &euro;367 million between 2013 and 2018.<\/p> <p>  Since 2013, separate targets apply to non-ETS emissions, which accounted for 72% of Ireland's output of greenhouse gases in 2017.  This includes the agriculture, transport and residential sectors.  On the basis of projections that Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions for the period 2008 to 2012 would exceed the level committed to under the Kyoto Protocol, resulting in an obligation to surrender what are referred to as carbon credits, the State spent a total of &euro;121 million on acquiring carbon credits.  Ultimately, Ireland met its emissions target for that period, but mainly due to the contraction in economic activity as a result of the banking and financial crisis.  Just over one third of the credits acquired had to be surrendered at the end of the target period.  The balance of the credits remains to assist in meeting further obligations as they arise.<\/p> <p>  In contrast to the first Kyoto period, the Environmental Protection Agency projects that Ireland will not meet the non-ETS emissions reduction target for the 2013 to 2020 period.  The available unused carbon credits are not expected to be sufficient to meet the resulting obligations.  The Department has estimated that the cost of purchasing additional required credits in 2020 will fall within a range of &euro;2 million to &euro;14 million, depending on the quantity of credits required and the prevailing market price.<\/p> <p>  In terms of renewable energy, Ireland has a mandatory target for at least 16% of gross final energy consumption to come from renewable sources by 2020.  While progress has been made in that regard, it is expected the target will not be met.  Based on the likely shortfall projected by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, the Department estimates that the future cost associated with failure to achieve the target could be in the order of &euro;110 million.  Against a targeted improvement of 20% in energy efficiency by 2020, the latest projections indicate that the actual increase will be around 16%.  However, as the energy efficiency target is non-binding, there is no direct financial penalty for failing to achieve it.<\/p> <p>  Carbon tax is one of a number of environmental taxes based on the consumption of fossil fuels.  While other fuel-related taxes were introduced for revenue raising purposes, carbon tax is intended to have a disincentive effect on the consumption of such fuels by raising prices.  Exchequer receipts of carbon taxes in 2018 amounted to around &euro;431 million.<\/p> <p>  A range of State bodies are incurring substantial climate-related expenditure.  At the same time, the State is receiving significant income in the form of environmental tax receipts and revenue from the auction of emission allowances.  However, there is currently no comprehensive national account to capture this income and expenditure.  Even in individual accounts where climate-related transactions are recorded, there is little transparency.  The report concludes that it would be timely for relevant Accounting Officers to consider including additional information and disclosures on climate change initiatives in the statutory accounts they produce.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019112100002#MM00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1574326800,"counter":874,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

The chapter examines transactions associated with Ireland's participation in the EU emissions trading system and purchases of credits by the State for compliance with Ireland's commitments under the Kyoto Protocol between 2008 and 2012, and the EU effort sharing decision, which spans the period 2013 to 2020.  The report also briefly examines the revenues accruing to date from carbon tax.  The report notes that a total of &euro;121 million has been spent to date on the purchases of credits for Kyoto Protocol and effort sharing decision compliance, with a further amount of between &euro;2 million and &euro;13 million expected to be required to meet the costs of purchasing further credits for compliance with the effort sharing decision.  The report also examines the costs of compliance with Ireland's renewable energy targets for 2020.<\/p> <p>  The report does not examine other transactions or expenditure associated with the implementation of climate change policies, whether in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment or elsewhere.<\/p><p>The report recommends that accurate and comprehensive information on relevant costs, including costs of abatement measures and carbon credit purchases, and incomes, including auction revenues and tax yields, would assist in informing future decisions on climate change initiatives and notes that, in budget 2019, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform indicated his intention to introduce a green budgeting framework with the aim of embedding climate change in the budgetary process.  Implementation of this framework offers the opportunity to develop a comprehensive national account capturing income and expenditure relating to climate change initiatives.<br\/><br\/>The Department also notes and welcomes the recommendation of the Comptroller and Auditor General regarding the provision of additional information on climate change related policies and measures in the statutory accounts of Departments.  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment supports this recommendation which it considers will help to improve both the transparency as well as the robustness of evaluation of climate change policies across all Departments.<br\/><br\/>The Government published its climate action plan on 17 June.  The plan sets out, for the first time and on the basis on the best available evidence, the measures that are required to meet our 2030 targets, with the burden shared across all sectors.  The plan will also put us on the right trajectory towards net zero emissions target by 2050. <br\/><br\/>In respect of the of the Comptroller and Auditor General report's assessment of the distance to target for 2030 compliance, presented in figure 9.11, it is important to note that the report uses EPA projections that do not yet take into account the impact of the climate action plan.  The EPA is currently updating these figures as part of finalising the national energy and climate plan, for submission by the Minister to the European Commission by the end of 2019.<br\/><br\/>The climate action plan contains a strong focus on governance and accountability, including a commitment to publish progress reports quarterly.  The first such progress report, launched at the end of October, shows that 85%, or 149, of the actions due for delivery in quarters 2 and 3 of this year have been delivered, with the remaining in progress and due for delivery by the end of the year.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>At the end of September, there was approximately 4,100 MW of renewable generation capacity connected to the national grid.  Of this, wind generation accounted for over 3,800 MW.  The most significant progress towards our 2020 renewable energy targets has been made in renewable electricity and we expect to be at or very close to the 40% sub-sectoral target for renewable electricity by 2020.  In the transport sector, we expect to achieve over 9% of the 10% target primarily due to the biofuels obligation scheme with electric vehicles also making a contribution.  The target in renewable heat is more difficult due in part to our dispersed population and our reliance on fossil fuels for a large share of our domestic heating.  The support scheme for renewable heat and supports for the roll-out of heat pumps under the national development plan are important measures to help us close the gap to target.<br\/><br\/>The fact remains that we are projected to have a shortfall to the renewable targets of approximately 3 percentage points based on analysis by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  Ireland will not be alone in falling short of our 2020 targets and there are compliance mechanisms available to us, known as statistical transfers, to enable us to purchase compliance.  The cost of purchasing statistical transfers should any potential shortfall in Ireland's target arise has yet to be established and will depend on a number of factors, particularly the availability of supply and market costs.  The focus of the Department is on maximising renewable energy in our energy mix by 2020 and on implementation of the comprehensive actions set out in the climate action plan that will enable our transition to a low-carbon economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019112100002#MM00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Carroll","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574326800,"counter":877,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Carroll for his opening statement.

If an increase is put on their oil or gas, although insulation can be put in their homes and that is fine, they are still using oil and gas, and what the Department is doing is increasing the cost for them.  It is not allowing them to transform their home into one that has an electric heat pump, for example, or some alternative and it is going to take an awful long time for us to get to that position.  It is just increasing the carbon tax on them, not just this year, but next year, the year after and the year after that.<\/p> <p>  I have a question on the just transition, which is important.  We had the trade unions before the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment recently and Patricia King headed a delegation of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  She was scathing in her criticism of the Department, the Government, Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB.  Two plants were closed and no just transition has been put in place.  Ms King feels many of the workers will lose their jobs without any transition being in place.  Bord na M&oacute;na has refused even to engage with the unions and is refusing to engage with the just transition forum that the Government says is going to be put in place.  An announcement was made prematurely to close the two ESB plants in question and three Government Ministers scrambled down to the midlands to talk to the workers.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Carroll talked earlier about the &euro;70 million that will come from the carbon tax increase in a full year.  The Comptroller and Auditor General might be right that it may not be &euro;70 million next year but we will see what that figure is.  Mr. Carroll talked about the money for the midlands that is being made available for retrofitting.  There is no retrofit plan in place.  They are still looking at the detail of it and trying to work out what that will mean.  The Department does not have a plan for those workers.<\/p> <p>  We all knew a just transition was necessary.  We all knew for years that those plants were going to have to close and that there had to be plans in place.  Yet, here we are, already prematurely closing some of the plants, when the trade unions who represent the workers say the just transition has been a farce.  A just transition commissioner is being appointed who does not have any remit in regard to workers - none whatsoever.  Is that not correct?  Ms King was quite critical of that as well.  How is it the case, when we have workers potentially losing their jobs, that the most senior trade union leader in the country can say Bord na M&oacute;na is refusing to engage with the unions and is involved in de-unionising the company?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019112100002#PP01300","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574326800,"counter":934,"content":"<p>I will come to the just transition shortly.

If we are spending all that money on changing behaviour and mitigation, we must be lousy at it because we are missing our targets.  It seems like a sizable amount of money.  Some of it is spent on purchasing credits, although not that much.  It would help if we could see the balance sheet.  If they are spending money, people will want to know what they are getting for it.  They have a right to see that.  There is a lack of transparency and I think Mr. Carroll accepts that.  A lot of schemes were promised, for example, the pay as you save scheme for utilities.  That was to meet the need of people who were unable to come up with a large chunk of money by allowing them to do the retrofit themselves and then save it in their utility bills later.  That was announced to great fanfare during the previous Government and it was never rolled out.  I recall investment in wave energy, although it was not enough.  Wavebob is one example that comes to mind.  We spent something like &euro;10 million or &euro;12 million on that and then decided not to continue the investment.  A Scottish counterpart agency took the investment we had made a stage further.<\/p> <p>  There are many positives in terms of our location and the generation of wind energy.

It is a case of just trying to stay compliant or trying to avoid have to pay large amounts for non-compliance.  Positive things could come out of that very large amount of money that was collected.  We could not only meet the targets but be leaders in this area.  That is really frustrating.

The picture has become overly complicated.  We need to decarbonise and there are many initiatives for so doing.  I have concerns based on our most recent meetings with the Economic and Social Research Institute and the Central Statistics Office regarding the way the system is divided and Ireland's place in it.  When one breaks it down, the emissions trading system is heavily weighted.  Some 72% of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions are categorised as non-ETS emissions.  A third of that 72% is agriculture based.  Ireland seems to be overly negatively affected by the European method of calculating or quantifying emissions because of our dependency on agricultural and the amount of food we export.  Some 90% of agricultural product is exported.  What are the witnesses' views in that regard?  Is there an uneven playing field?  Big industry has significant power in this area.  The two ESRI representatives who appeared before the committee stated that once one's profit margin is sufficient to buy one's way out, one can pollute as much as one wishes.  I do not need to explain this to the witnesses.  If one's margin is big enough, one can pay the carbon bill.

I am referring to everyday people eating, dressing themselves to stay warm and going places.  It is very difficult to bring people with one if there is a possibility that a company, through whatever it is producing, can pollute continually and buy its way out.  Deputy Cullinane mentioned somewhere in Waterford the last time.  There are those who do not have the capacity to change their behaviour because there is no alternative available to them.  It is going to be very difficult to bring people with us.  The whole point is carbon reduction and decarbonisation.  People get that because it is not that complicated.  If the Department is telling people to invest in and retrofit their homes, walk to work or buy an electric car while big industry is pumping out carbon, albeit in a way that it is balancing out somewhere else globally, it will be very hard to sell to average people just trying to go about their daily lives.  There is not so much choice available to average people.<\/p><p>With regard to the retrofitting, the scene in an urban area is completely different from that in a rural area.  I am originally from a very rural part of Ireland.  There are many people in homes around my family home that would have regarded the getting in of oil-based central heating as being progressive recent years.  They would have moved from turf or wood.  I refer to heavy-duty fossil fuel burning.  I just do not see how we can convince somebody who is perhaps of retirement age and who might be considering her life expectancy and saying she could be around for another week or 30 years.  The position is very different in terms of getting loans to retrofit homes.  With regard to the suitability of many rural dwellings, many have lime-based mortar and stone bases that cannot be wrapped in insulation.  There are considerable barriers if those in rural Ireland are to apply the same rules as would apply in urban Ireland.  Insulation pads cannot just be put on the outside and inside of stone walls.  Heat pumps cost a huge amount of money and require maintenance every year.  I just cannot see how older people would buy into the idea of investing in this.  Practically, the Department is missing a trick here.  I can understand the thinking on modern homes and people building new homes but I believe older people in rural areas with homes that will never be suited to standard retrofitting or standard heat pumps will be very much left behind because there is nothing they can do - other than knock the house and start again - to change their behaviour and reduce their bills.<\/p><p>With regard to the increase in the fuel allowance to mitigate against the carbon tax, I agree with Deputy Cullinane.  We are back to the point I made at the start.  We have to be reducing carbon emissions.  If we are subventing the use of carbon to balance against tax, it seems like a style of economics equivalent to moving deckchairs around the <i>Titanic<\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019112100002#SS00400","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574326800,"counter":972,"content":"<p>There are a few points to come back on there.

It does not seem to have been taken into account that the effect of carbon is cumulative.  Carbon gathers in the atmosphere whereas methane breaks down within a 12-year cycle period.  Therefore, the effect of methane is not cumulative.  I cannot find anything in the documentation from the Department, the ESRI or the CSO that brings in a variable to take into account the fact that the methane cycle is a cycle within the carbon cycle.  I brought this up with the ESRI and the CSO representatives when they were before us.  My point is that there is over-calculation of the impact of agriculture on the carbon footprint of Ireland because methane, although it is considered to be 25 times more warming than carbon, is constantly on the move and constantly breaking down.<\/p> <p>  The British Veterinary Association has done some work on this.  New Zealand, which has a similar agricultural profile to ours and the same type of grassland, has recently brought in a variable to account for this.  It would be in the interest of heavily agriculture-based economies to examine this area.

Effectively, what has been shown there is the amount that was received from ETS auctions each year.  What it is reporting is sufficient spending in other areas that make up the equivalent of that.  It is not working in the way a hypothecated tax is supposed to work, which is that one raises \"X\" amount and demonstrates how that amount was used.

There is a footnote stating that a European Commission report from 2017 entitled \"Analysis of the use of Auction Revenues by the Member States\" noted that Ireland is one of the ten member states where revenue raised through the auction of allowances is not earmarked or ring fenced in its budget and that along with the other nine member states, Ireland was also deemed to provide a low level of detail on the application of revenue to projects aimed at reducing emissions.  That is why we are here.  We want to get to the point where we are not in the bottom league within the EU when it comes to accounting for it.  That was stated by the EU two and a half years ago and we are here today not having advanced an awful lot since then.  This is all we want to achieve.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the &euro;570 million that was collected in 2018, the &euro;440 million collected in carbon tax was read out.  We also received &euro;140 million in receipts from the emissions trading scheme.  We want to bring the public with us.  This is the message I am bringing back.  We want to bring the public on the right road on this.  I am putting the responsibility on the Department as the lead Department in respect of climate change.  Revenue will appear before us next week when we can ask it about the revenue and we can talk to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform but the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is the one deemed to be the climate change Department.  All I am saying is that the public gets very cynical when it is told that &euro;570 million was received in 2018 and we cannot document that it went on climate change initiatives.  It would make the job of bringing the public around to the idea of an extra tax a whole lot easier if it could be assured that not just a marginal increase in tax but all of the carbon tax was going on climate change initiatives.  People would buy into it but when they see that it is just a wheeze and that we are collecting carbon tax but will not really show how it is being spent, it damages the national effort to bring people around on this issue.  I worry that it could lead to a backlash against a carbon tax.  We saw it with water charges because people just saw them as a mechanism for collecting money and paying for meters.  They did not necessarily see them as improving the water infrastructure because they were not connected.  One was just to collect money and pay for the installation of meters to a large extent.  The people will have a difficulty with the carbon tax.  We want all this to be clear, transparent and upfront so that if the public is told next year that &euro;500 million is being collected, it knows it will be spent on climate change initiatives.  I have great faith in the Irish people and believe that they will accept that without a quibble but if they are told it is being collected but the Department will only show them where a tiny percentage of it is going, they will not come along fully.  <\/p> <p>  One of the reasons why we have had these hearings relates to when the CSO appeared before us recently.  We found it slightly unusual that when it appeared before us, the CSO document stated that some publicly funded supports have a negative impact on the environment.  I know there are other objectives relating to fuel poverty.  The CSO stated that a subsidy is classified as potentially environmentally damaging if it is likely to incentivise behaviour that could be damaging to the environment irrespective of the importance of other policy purposes.  Some people might say it is an academic argument but we all know that if we increase carbon tax, raise money from it and hand some of the proceeds back by way of a fuel allowance, we will increase CO2 emissions by burning oil, gas, coal or turf.  The CSO states that this will have a detrimental effect.  I know it costs money but the CSO is saying that it would better if the funds collected were spent on the retrofitting and home heating scheme rather than on giving allowances to people to allow them continue to burn fossil fuels.  The CSO is saying that some of what is happening here is detrimental to the environment.  Is Mr. Carroll familiar with that document?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019112100002#UU01500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574326800,"counter":1020,"content":"<p>I know the argument that is being made.

If it is brought in to make sure that people are not worse off, that is different from bringing it in to discourage them from continuing to burn fossil fuels.

The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment probably has some documentation done, or perhaps each Department has it done, on the Estimates for the coming year.  I am just saying this myself - I have not run it by the committee - but it would be a tremendous assistance and of benefit to the public, when the Estimates come before their respective committees next year, to be shown where the more than &euro;500 million that will be collected in carbon tax next year will go on climate change initiatives.  It would be a tremendous help to everybody.  It would help the Government in its initiative.  Some 170 young people were sitting in the D&aacute;il Chamber last Friday.

The motion that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has been asked to approve reads:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the terms of the Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Armenia, of the other part, signed in Brussels on 24th November, 2017, a copy of which was laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 11th November, 2019. <\/blockquote> <p>This modern, comprehensive and ambitious agreement, which was signed in the margins of the Eastern Partnership summit in Brussels in 2017, provides a framework for Armenia and the EU to work together for the benefit of the citizens of Armenia to strengthen democracy and human rights and to create more jobs and business opportunities, fairer rules, more safety and security, a cleaner environment, better educational opportunities and more opportunities for research.  The scope of the new agreement, which has been concluded within the context of the Eastern Partnership initiative, is comprehensive.  It covers issues of EU competence and interest and reflects the existing wide range of co-operation in economic, trade and political areas and on sectoral policies.  It develops these areas further, thereby providing a long-term basis for the further strengthening of EU-Armenia relations.  In addition to facilitating stronger economic relations, the agreement aims to enhance political dialogue and to promote peace and stability.  By intensifying this dialogue and improving co-operation across a broad range of areas, the agreement lays the foundations for more effective engagement with Armenia.  At its core is a commitment to strengthen the promotion, protection and implementation of fundamental freedoms, human rights, the respect for democratic principles, the rule of law and good governance.<\/p><p>Armenia is undergoing a period of rapid and positive political change.  In what was termed the Velvet Revolution, the spring 2018 protests against the then Prime Minister, Serzh Sargsyan, eventually forced his resignation and led to the elevation of Nikol Pashinyan to the office of Prime Minister.<\/p><p>Along with our EU partners, Ireland watched the events of spring 2018 in Armenia with great interest.  The revolution resulted in a remarkably peaceful transition of political power in the country.  Ireland, together with the EU, continues to encourage and support Armenia&rsquo;s reform efforts, with a number of positive steps having already been taken, including Armenia's new five-year government programme, containing a series of political, economic, judicial and governance reforms, which focuses on enhancing rule of law, fighting corruption and improving protection of human rights.<\/p><p> Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral trade with Armenia is not hugely significant.  However, this comprehensive and enhanced partnership agreement will allow for more access into the region and will help to develop greater opportunities for trade and investment, including in the areas of education, research and innovation.<\/p><p> While Armenia is not seeking EU membership, relations have gone from strength to strength in recent years due to the EU&rsquo;s Eastern Partnership mechanism. The most visible illustration of this is the 2017 comprehensive and enhanced partnership agreement.  The EU is the largest provider of financial support to and a key reform partner in Armenia.  The EU stands ready to continue engaging in Armenia and to provide support through political dialogue and financial and technical assistance in order to support the Armenian Government's ambitious reforms for the benefit of the citizens of Armenia and EU-Armenia co-operation.  This support is critical to ensuring a sustained approach to ongoing reform efforts in Armenia aimed at enhancing democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights, with the ultimate aim of increasing security, prosperity and socio-economic resilience.<\/p><p> The EU contributes &euro;40 million annually to Armenia in grants at present, with the focus on supporting the reform agenda of the new Government, private sector development, education and the development of focal regions, including the promotion of e-governance.  In addition, more than &euro;1 billion in the form of blended loans and grants has been invested in the energy, agriculture and transport sectors since 2014.<\/p><p> I wish to acknowledge the ongoing concerns over the so-called frozen conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh.  The Armenian Prime Minister recently affirmed Armenia&rsquo;s commitment to the peaceful settlement of the conflict, which Ireland and the rest of the EU have welcomed.  I understand that there has been some progress in talks between Armenia and Azerbaijan, with the EU welcoming the current decrease in tension on the ground and the constructive and calm attitude shown by both leaderships.  Ireland&rsquo;s position, like that of the EU as a whole, has been supportive of the Minsk process of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, with the aim of moving towards the peaceful resolution of the conflict on the basis of mutual compromises.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to present this motion.  The agreement will not only broaden and deepen the EU&rsquo;s relationship with Armenia and provide for closer economic and political ties, but will also provide the framework for further constructive dialogue on human rights, fundamental freedoms, rule of law and governance.  I must emphasise that, by ratifying this agreement, we will be in a position to add our voice to the EU and 27 other member states in encouraging Armenia on its path to reform, rather than sitting on the sidelines as others engage.  I hope that the committee will support the motion and that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann may approve the terms of this agreement in order that Ireland might proceed to ratification before the end of 2019.  I am happy to take committee members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2019112100002#A00300","speaker":"1241","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574294400,"counter":1060,"content":"<p>I am happy to support the motion as the Minister of State has presented it but will he flesh out the political landscape a little more?

Should we choose not to ratify the agreement, we can only observe from the sidelines while others continue to engage effectively and press for the kinds of reform that need to happen.  Ireland engages with human rights in Armenia through the EU, the Council of Europe and the OSCE by ensuring that focused attention remains on human rights issues.

I am joined by Ms &Aacute;ine Carroll, director of communications and policy. <\/p> <p>  We are aware that the committee&rsquo;s primary focus in this matter to date has been on insurance and we will offer our views on same.  Given that the CCPC&rsquo;s role is economy wide, we will also provide details of our work on pricing strategies in a broader context.  I hope that this will be of use to the committee as it considers these matters.<\/p> <p>  By way of very brief introduction, the CCPC works to improve consumer welfare across the economy.  We do this through enforcing competition and consumer protection laws, our advocacy efforts and our consumer information activities.  Currently, we are active in a number of markets, including ticketing, public transport procurement, the motor sector, nursing homes and in the retail sector for pricing and product safety.<\/p> <p>  Over the last number of decades we have seen the benefits that competition and market liberalisation have brought in many sectors.  For us, telecommunications are a good example of this as consumers went from a situation where there was a single provider and it took weeks or months to get a new telephone line to now having choice, competition and innovation in the market.  Where consumers are vulnerable, there is a low level of competition or the potential for harm is high, these sectors require a higher level of supervision and intervention.  Sectoral regulators, therefore, have access to industry information thus enabling them to build up knowledge and expertise so that they can see market trends or issues as they develop.  They can also, if required, take preventative steps or alter the rules so that they reflect new market dynamics.<\/p> <p>  In addition to sector specific regulation and regulators, the CCPC enforces competition and general consumer protection laws, provides information to consumers and advocates on their behalf.  The roles of sectoral regulators and the CCPC are complementary in that regulators can deal with problems that are specific to their industry, while we can identify and analyse broader cross-cutting trends.<\/p><p>Financial services are particularly complex markets for consumers to navigate because of the risk, value and importance of the products involved.  In recent years, the CCPC has been extremely active in the sector.  As the committee will be aware, we currently have an ongoing investigation into price signalling in the motor insurance sector.  We have assisted the European Commission in its motor insurance investigation.  Most recently we commenced a study into the public liability insurance market which is an important piece of work for us.<\/p><p> We also work to improve consumer welfare through our advocacy efforts and our financial education programmes.  We undertook a detailed examination of the mortgages market, making recommendations on improving competition and identified issues with consumers&rsquo; ability to navigate cashback offers.  Having witnessed a significant increase in the popularity of PCP car finance, we completed a market study including commissioning research to understand consumers&rsquo; experiences with PCP finance and as a result we made recommendations that they should fall within the same regulatory scheme as car loans and other financial products.  In recent weeks a consultation has been opened on a Bill which we hope will soon address this regulatory gap.<\/p><p> Our financial education work is of significant priority to us and in addition to extensive public awareness campaigns we provide mortgages, savings, current accounts, credit cards and personal loan money tools on our website to help consumers compare rates and make informed decisions.  Last year we published the first financial well-being study ever conducted in Ireland.  The research examined the behaviours and circumstances that influence financial decision-making and the extent to which people are able to meet their current financial needs and their financial resilience to do so.  Through our financial education programme we have also delivered independent personal finance information to thousands of employees in workplaces across the country.  We also work with the Central Bank and Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman to ensure the information we provide to consumers is up to date or to share insights or trends that we are seeing in our engagement with consumers.<\/p><p> I mentioned that competition has brought about choice and innovation for consumers.  It is also a fact that businesses, where they have one, will use their information advantage to try and maximise the prices they charge.  Therefore, in order for the full benefits of competition to be realised, consumers need to be active participants in markets by researching their options and availing of better deals through switching.  Over the last decade, as part of our public awareness work, we have used research to identify the sectors where consumers are most and least active and identified what contracts could provide significant savings if consumers moved.  We have advocated on behalf of consumers for improvements to be made in switching processes in a number of markets.  We have run numerous consumer information campaigns targeting where consumers may benefit from switching providers.  Significantly, in financial services we developed and recently redeveloped cost comparison tools to help consumers compare products more easily.  Last year, these tools provided details of 518 financial products and received over 180,000 visits.<\/p><p> More recently, however, it is increasingly felt that this may not be enough.  Through our market monitoring and through participation in European groups, we are aware of pricing strategy concerns.  Relevant reports include the work done by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Competition and Markets Authority in the UK which have examined loyalty penalties across financial services and other sectors.  We have also looked at the use of dual-pricing bans and other initiatives in the United States.<\/p><p> In addition, two weeks ago the European Council adopted the omnibus directive to modernise consumer law.  Among other things it provides for enhanced transparency in online transactions, in particular regarding the use of online reviews, personalised pricing based on algorithms or higher ranking of products due to paid placements.  On personalised pricing, the directive amends Article 6 of the consumer rights directive to insert a specific requirement to inform consumers when the price is \"personalised, on the basis of automated decision-making\".<\/p><p> A number of reasons have been put forward as to what has changed and why advising consumers to switch may no longer be a sufficient response in all markets.  With digitalisation there is a greater opportunity for businesses to know more about us and exploit that information; with the use of the loyalty penalty mechanism, businesses increasingly know that many consumers do not have the time or the ability to switch, so consumers experience successive price increases, sometimes called \"price walking\" and unfortunately loyalty is no longer rewarded, which is disappointing but is a reality for consumers.  Also, products are getting more complex which makes switching more difficult and this amplifies all of the above reasons.<\/p><p> What is the CPCC doing?  From our experience in examining dozens of markets per year we know that the solutions are rarely the same across different sectors.  The most effective solutions come from an accurate understanding of the problems and their impact on consumers, as illustrated in our work on PCP, mortgages, waste collection and nursing home contracts.  Having that clarity not only ensures effective solutions but, crucially, an in-depth understanding of the issues ensures that there are no unintended consequences, such as one consumer group benefitting from an intervention at the detriment of another.<\/p><p> Although work has been undertaken internationally to look at the issues and there have been measures introduced to address them, it is important to stress that the solutions for Ireland need to be developed with the realities of our markets in mind.<\/p><p> As our remit is economy-wide there is an onus on us to look at practices which may be of concern across all markets, to identify where the detriment is and the potential solutions.  Therefore, building on our previous switching research, the CCPC is undertaking considerable consumer research into pricing strategies in key consumer markets, including utilities and financial products.  We will look at the incidence of switching and price-checking, the impact of loyalty penalties on particular groups of consumers, for example, older consumers or those with low financial well-being.  We will examine the role and impact of contracts rolling over.  We also think it is important to understand consumers&rsquo; perception of fairness: are some happy to pay more so that everybody pays the same price?<\/p><p> Without pre-empting that work I expect that it will result in the following actions in 2020.  It will provide a basis for our advocacy work which will include, where appropriate, making recommendations to Government, sectoral regulators and advocacy groups to address any identified consumer harm.  This will focus, in particular, on groups of consumers who may find it hard or impossible to switch providers.  Specifically in relation to insurance, we will engage with the Central Bank as our research and their market study progresses and will also engage with the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  We will use the research to engage with national and European counterparts to share information and keep up to date with developments.  It will also provide us with the basis for a public awareness campaign which will inform and provide information to consumers as to how they can switch service providers.<\/p><p> In conclusion, I am acutely aware that the committee is concerned with and has undertaken considerable work in examining dual-pricing to date.  The CCPC recognises the importance of this work and is committed to playing its part as quickly as we can in providing an evidence base for firm actions to help consumers.  We would welcome any questions that the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019112100002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal O'Leary","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574294400,"counter":1078,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Leary and call on Mr. Hassett to make his opening statement on behalf of Insurance Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019112100002#C00200","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574294400,"counter":1079,"content":"<p>Good morning Chairman.  I thank the committee members for the opportunity to speak here.<\/p> <p>  By way of background I was asked by the board of Insurance Ireland to take on the role of interim CEO of the organisation pending the appointment of a replacement for Kevin Thompson.  I have spent over 30 years in the insurance sector primarily with Irish Life and more recently with Great West Life in Canada.  In both cases I was focused on the life and retirement part of the business.  I now have a consultancy business which I will be returning to full-time once a new CEO has been appointed to Insurance Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I am pleased to be joined today by Michael Horan, non-life insurance manager with Insurance Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Insurance Ireland represents the Irish general insurance, health insurance, life assurance, international, reinsurance and captive management sectors.  We represent 140 companies providing insurance domestically in Ireland and internationally from Ireland.<\/p> <p>  About 28,000 people are employed directly or indirectly in the sector, with one in four financial service jobs being in insurance.  Our members pay out &euro;13 billion in claims and benefits annually and contribute over &euro;1.6 billion in tax to the Irish Exchequer every year.<\/p> <p>  The Irish market for motor insurance is currently served by 35 companies.  However, the core market is primarily served by eight firms most of which are leading international players, with the balance serving niche markets like high-powered cars or specialist commercial vehicles.  There are approximately 2 million Irish consumers with motor insurance and about &euro;1 billion is incurred annually in motor claims.  The market is highly competitive and the market share of the various players ebbs and flows in line with commercial activity.<\/p><p> Like any company or trade association, Insurance Ireland must fully comply with the law, including competition law.  It was this requirement that informed our recent correspondence with the committee explaining the limitations relating to our ability to make a meaningful contribution on the topic of dual pricing due to the constraints of competition law.  Our track record with the committee is one of always being available and open to discussing key policy issues, including the important issue of reform of the sector and issues pertaining to the cost of claims.  When it comes to pricing policy, however, the rules are clear.  Insurance Ireland as a trade association does not hold, discuss or facilitate any material in respect of the pricing of products.  We have no access to data around product pricing or pricing strategies either on an industry basis or for individual firms.  The pricing policies of companies is proprietary and highly confidential.  For these reasons, it is difficult for us to help the committee in understanding the application of various pricing strategies operating in the Irish market.  Competition law means that we cannot discuss how a company strikes a price for a particular risk.  This is not something that we know nor something that we should know.  I trust that committee members will understand the sensitivity with which we view this topic.  We fully respect the committee's role, and having actively participated in previous meetings, we will do everything possible to participate constructively at today's meeting, notwithstanding the constraints.  However, I should stress that we will be particularly constrained on the specifics of pricing policies at an industry level and in respect of specific company practices.<\/p><p> While Insurance Ireland has not been directly involved in the Central Bank review of the insurance market, we are aware that member companies have been engaging with the bank in recent months on the topic of differential pricing.  We note the decision by the Central Bank to carry cut a formal review to: seek to establish the impact of differential pricing on consumers while at the same time establishing the drivers of consumer behaviour, including how customers engage with the insurance industry; and assess the extent to which these pricing practices lead to outcomes that are consistent with the consumer protection code.  We welcome this review.  In particular, we welcome the fact that it is evidence-based and will involve a comprehensive data-gathering and analysis phase.  While Insurance Ireland does not see itself as being directly involved in the review process, we are confident that member companies will co-operate fully with it and engage proactively on any recommendation made.<\/p><p> I look forward to a good engagement and welcome committee members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019112100002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Hassett","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574294400,"counter":1081,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hassett and call Deputy Michael McGrath.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019112100002#D00200","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speech","time":1574294400,"counter":1082,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests and thank them for their opening statements.

We even heard Mr. Fergal O'Leary say that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission's review will be across several sectors.  Essentially, it is driven by companies that want to grow their market position.  It stimulates competition.  As a practice, very often a company might even have a teaser rate as a loss leader to attract new business.  There are some dimensions to it that are positive.  It stimulates competition in the market, rewards customers who shop around and, hopefully, in time, it would attract new entrants into the industry.  That is positive.  The question is the extent to which that practice penalises the loyal customer.  There must be a balance.  For example, a recent CCPC survey shows that motor insurance has one of the highest rates of switching of any market in Ireland.  It was up at 27% to 28% annually.  I personally believe that is a good thing.  It signals a vibrant market and that is a good thing but we must be cognisant of consumers who are loyal to companies and whether they are they being treated fairly.  For me, it is a question of balance and getting that balance right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019112100002#E02900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Hassett"},{"type":"speech","time":1574294400,"counter":1136,"content":"<p>Is it not more than using a distinction between new and existing customers?

If one puts a black box with all the telematics in one's car, a motor insurance company will give one a discount because the customer is providing more information that allows the company to more accurately price the risk.

For us, as I mentioned in our statement, the difference is whether the price differentials are bigger than they were before.  Is it the case that firms are using information to test consumer groups to see if they can pull more margin out of those consumer groups?  What we want to do with this piece of research, which is broadly similar to what our counterpart in the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority did, is to see how much the loyalty penalty is in the 16 markets that we are going to look at.  What we will do then is try to target the customers who are losing out at the moment, see what groups are there, and then we will look at solutions.  Traditionally, the solutions we have looked at have been public awareness and trying to get consumers to switch.  We are very well aware that not all consumers have access to online information, so a lot of our work, including sponsoring a television programme, is to try to get to people who do not have access to the Internet.  However, there is a genuine question, which is the reason we are doing this research at the moment, namely, to see if that is enough.  Without pre-empting the work that we will do over the next three or four months, I think we have come to a stage where it is unlikely to be enough to make sure that competition can remain in markets, that new entrants can come in and look for customers, but people should not be penalised for being on long legacy products or the differentials should not be as large as I think we are seeing in some sectors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019112100002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal O'Leary"},{"type":"speech","time":1574294400,"counter":1141,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Leary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019112100002#F00300","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1574294400,"counter":1142,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses to the committee today.

Deputy Doherty has quoted it plenty of times.  What I am saying is that the CSO motor insurance index has reduced over the past three years, since mid-2016.

These include policyholder damage claims, third party damage claims and windscreen claims.<\/p> <p>  We have not actually addressed the defining issue, namely, the high level of personal injury awards in Ireland, especially for soft tissue injuries.  Some 80% of motor claims are for whiplash.  We need to address the defining issue.  The high level of awards is a cost and a problem.  It has bedevilled the Irish claims environment for decades.  We need to address that fundamentally.  Earlier this week, we welcomed the announcement by the Chief Justice of the interim personal injuries guidelines committee as part of the Judicial Council, which will recalibrate those awards.<\/p> <p>  We welcomed the other point made by the Chief Justice that in future when those judicial guidelines are produced judges who depart from the guidelines would need to explain why they have done so.

The national claims information database, regarding which there will be some outputs and a report published in the coming months, will show the high levels of legal fees as a percentage of compensation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019112100002#J05100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Horan"},{"type":"speech","time":1574294400,"counter":1286,"content":"<p>I do not buy that analysis.  If one is providing reserves based on a combination of actual awards plus expected awards, that is a finite and absolute figure and that figure is then built into a provision within the accounts of the individual insurance companies which dictates the overall level of the premiums they will charge.  If the overall number of claims is down by 55,000 and the overall number of awards, particularly in the courts, is down by 40%, it stands to reason that the average could go up.  If there are fewer people claiming, the average could go up.  I do not wear that argument.

First, 75% of awards relate to personal injury claims.  While the number of cases is relevant, the amount of money is dictated by what is happening in the personal injury section.  Second, even though the case count is coming down, that is in the year in which a claim is made whereas, typically, personal injury cases take three, four and five years to go through the system so there is a sort of multi-annual process.  What we are also seeing is a reduction in the number of cases in the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and more cases going through the Circuit Court process.  Therefore, the total numbers are masking some of the trends that are happening underneath the bonnet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019112100002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Hassett"},{"type":"speech","time":1574294400,"counter":1288,"content":"<p>The point I am making is that, for the incurred claims, the element that is provided for expected claims is a judgment call.  One could make the case that an insurance company is being very prudent in that it errs on the side of caution and it ups the amount it provides.  The trend is that the number of claims overall has gone down by 20% and court awards have gone down dramatically - by 40% in the period - yet we are not seeing reductions.  We had the insurance companies before us recently and I went through their figures.  They are looking for an average net return on premiums of 5% or 6% but many of the companies are earning substantially more than that.  The insurance companies will blame the legal costs and the claims, the legal profession will blame the insurance companies and it is the consumer who is losing out.

I am joined by the IWA's national director for services, Tony Cunningham.<\/p> <p>  The IWA has a vision of an Ireland where people with disabilities enjoy equal rights, choices and opportunities in how they live their lives and where the country itself is a model worldwide for a truly inclusive society.  The IWA is a leading representative organisation and service provider for people with physical disabilities, with 20,000 members, over 2,500 employees, 57 local community centres and 2,000 volunteers.  For almost 60 years, the IWA has pioneered the development and delivery of innovative, quality assured services to people with physical disabilities and has continually advocated for greater access to society on behalf of our membership.  The IWA is a major provider of services to the HSE under the mandate of the service arrangements process.  In 2018, the association received &euro;41.7 million from the HSE towards delivering over 2 million hours of services nationally, including assisted-living services, resource and outreach centres, respite care and supported living.  The funding received from the HSE for these services does not fully cover the associated costs of delivering those services and in 2018, the IWA contributed &euro;1.87 million from its own unrestricted operating income in order to maintain those services. <\/p> <p>  In June, this committee was briefed by a number of disability service provider umbrella groups on the growing funding crisis in the disability sector.  In this context, during the period 2008 to 2018, the IWA has seen its financial reserves diminish by &euro;5.7 million as it used its own funds to ensure continuity of service provision across all our services.  The association's cash balances at the end of 2018 represented just four weeks' operating costs.  The IWA is a registered charity and a company limited by guarantee governed by a voluntary board.  The majority of board members are elected from our membership at the annual general meeting and at least a third of all members must be, and are, persons with physical disability.<\/p> <p>  For 22 years, Cuisle has been a core part of the IWA as well as the community in Donamon, providing employment and social opportunities for people in the locality, as well as providing accessible holiday and respite for people with physical disabilities, particularly at a time when Cuisle first opened and when there were few or no alternatives for people with physical disabilities.  The board and management of the IWA understand and share the sadness of those who visit and work in Cuisle at the news that the facility will not reopen in 2020.  The difficult decision to close the Cuisle building has not come easily and was made by the board of the IWA on 18 October last following over two years of trying to find an alternative solution.<\/p> <p>  The building, which is not owned by the IWA and the lease on which expires in 2026, is in need of significant repair works, including full electrical installation and fire safety upgrades.  These will cost in the region of &euro;1.15 million at a minimum.  We are aware that there is asbestos in the building and there is a high risk that if this is disturbed during construction the cost of necessary remedial works could escalate significantly.  The IWA does not have the funds to pay for these essential upgrades, which are vital to keeping the leased building open for respite.  During the period 2017 to 2019, there were a number of IWA board visits to Cuisle and a full meeting of the board took place in Cuisle during 2017.  Also during this period, Cuisle was discussed at 14 of 21 the association's board meetings.  In March 2018, the IWA commenced implementation of a new social enterprise business model for Cuisle and invested from its own funds to generate new income for Cuisle as demonstration of its commitment to continuing to provide services there, subject to the funds to pay for the essential upgrade works becoming available.  For over two years, the IWA has engaged extensively with public representatives and funders but unfortunately there is no funding available to complete the essential capital works and no viable alternative has been proposed to the association by any third party.<\/p> <p>  The board has a legal obligation to everyone who stays in Cuisle and had no choice but to make the decision to close the building at the end of November.  Cuisle usually closes from December to February annually due to limited bookings during this period.  The IWA acknowledges the loss of employment associated with the closure of Cuisle and the impact on the local community.  We are grateful to the staff for their commitment and dedication to the Cuisle-based service and the local community for their support over many years.<\/p> <p>  Over the past number of weeks, the IWA has been in discussion with Cuisle staff and their representatives.  All staff have received an \"expressions of interests\" letter and form, the purpose of which is to capture their preferences with regard to redundancy or redeployment.  At time of writing, 19 November, 25 of 42 staff had returned this form, with 24 choosing redundancy and one opting for redeployment.  the IWA has written to all impacted staff with an estimate of their redundancy entitlement in accordance with the terms of the redundancy package agreed on their behalf with SIPTU.  The IWA will write again to Cuisle staff with a final calculation of their redundancy entitlements when any corrections or amendments have been made following the circulation of the redundancy estimates letters.  A small number of staff will remain in employment at Cuisle for two to four weeks after 29 November to assist with the closure.  Future use of the Cuisle facility will be a matter for the owners of the building.  The IWA assumes that any future use will be contingent on completion of the required capital works.<\/p><p> In response to the difficult decision to close the Cuisle facility, and to ensure continued provision of holiday respite breaks, the IWA will commence its new holiday service in the west to provide a wide range of choices to people with disabilities seeking to take a supported respite holiday in the region by partnering with fully accessible hotels.  This new and innovative service will commence in March 2020 in collaboration with the HSE.  Cuisle ordinarily closes between December and February, which means that there will be a limited impact on guests during that period.  Our new holiday service will provide people with a modern, inclusive hotel break in a range of locations with easy access to local towns and a wider choice of amenities.  It will also enable people with disabilities to take an enjoyable holiday with friends or family in the same hotel as chosen by them from a selection of options.<\/p><p> The IWA has been operating comparable hotel breaks in Kilkenny since 2018 and has received positive feedback from our guests.  This service was shortlisted for an Irish healthcare centre award in 2019.  Some of the feedback that we have received includes \"staff excellent\", \"food excellent\", \"feel equal going on holidays with everyone else\", \"I no longer feel like people with disabilities are in a box\", \"it is all excellent\" and \"you gave us a great holiday, not just respite\".<\/p><p> The IWA has developed a range of holiday respite options for all of our guests regardless of their level of support requirement - low, medium or high.  The IWA will provide support to guests on a tailored individual basis.  We will ensure that guests have everything they need, including fully accessible en suite bedrooms, specialised beds, aids and appliances, hoists, support with medication management and clinical tasks, and the IWA's 24-7, staffed and skilled personal assistance service.  The IWA's fully accessible transport can be arranged during holiday breaks and will be available to provide transport to activities and events in the community.<\/p><p> An information sheet included in the documents provided to the committee has been distributed and explained to our members through more than 252 engagement meetings at our resource and outreach centres across the country.  The IWA and HSE representatives were invited by the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, to meet on Tuesday, 12 November to provide the necessary reassurances in respect of what is a fundamentally progressive and innovative way of meeting the needs of people with disabilities who wish to avail of holiday respite breaks and to bridge the gap that will arise from the closure of Cuisle.  The IWA has stressed to the Minister of State that the clear choice and preference of people with disabilities is increasingly more about having access to fully inclusive settings where existing commercial hotel provider settings implement universal design initiatives to accommodate people of all levels of ability.<\/p><p> It goes without saying that the new model of service will be different.  It will be a big change for those who have loved going to Cuisle.  We are optimistic, based on the feedback from those who have availed of our Kilkenny services, that as time goes on and people get a chance to experience this form of holiday respite break, they will see the benefits of enjoying it.  The IWA has a 60-year track record of ensuring that our services meet the wants and needs of our members.  We will continue to adapt and innovate to ensure that this remains true in future.<\/p><p> I thank the committee members for listening.

We took on the building in 1997 and developed it extensively over the past 22 years.  Most of that was funded by grants and local fundraising.  The staff in the past year raised funds towards the matching funding for the LEADER grant, which were some of the figures to which the Deputy referred.  We qualified for 75% of a &euro;216,000 LEADER grant.  We had to then raise &euro;50,000 for that.  Some &euro;25,000 was secured through the Athlone municipal district.  The remainder was fundraised locally.  That fund is still there, as it was not spent.  The LEADER grant was also not spent because we would have been undoing the work of the grant with the electrical works.  The grant was for the upgrade and removal of the institutional look of Cuisle to try to make it more like a hotel and, therefore, more appealing to the public and more comfortable for our members.  This would involve a theme running through the centre, such as a hotel, and enhancing the look of the corridors, bedrooms, en suite bathrooms and reception area, including carpets and wallpaper and so on.  The problem was if one were to then do the electrical and fire-safety works, one would need to chase the wiring through the wallpaper and the carpets.  We asked about this on a number of occasions and the Roscommon LEADER Partnership has worked very well with us.  That fund still sits there on hold.  It would have been negligent of us to spend that money and undo a lot of the work later on.  The funds that were raised were then put towards that.  I am not be familiar with the entire series of smaller fundraisers.

I attended three general staff meetings and my purpose for being there was to update the staff team on the issues and on the efforts that were being made to secure the funding.  It is not my job to inform staff that a place might be closing or that we might not get funding.  It damages the business and it damages morale.  We tried to be as upbeat as we could in our efforts all through that period.  I recall three staff meetings where we looked at that.  Staff were aware of the bigger issue.  I went as far as saying that if we did not get the money, I did not know what would happen, and that it was not good but we were working away on the issues.  That is the information we gave and I have said this at other meetings.<\/p> <p>  It has been asked why this is happening at this point in time.  I was at the meeting and it was devastating.  There is no right time, be it 1 January or 1 December.  It was one of the toughest things I was ever involved in.  With regard to the time of the year, it has come after we were sure there was no funding coming.  At this time of year, Cuisle usually closes for most of December, January and into February.  A month's notice was agreed to pay people for the additional notice period as required.  There is no right time and it has been devastating for the staff.  It was the end of the road.  As Ms Keogh said, the board has the legal responsibility for everybody's safety in the building.  We cannot guarantee that now.  This is why the issue was discussed at so many board meetings in the past two years, including our efforts to secure the funding.<\/p> <p>  I also refer to her point about the financial position in the organisation.  Our fundraising efforts around the country were to maintain essential services, and this was covered at a meeting here some weeks ago.  The association does not have the money to do these works.  We do not own the building.  It is leased, and the lease will be out in a few years.  Accessibility has improved in the community.  I am at a loss about what to say to say to the staff.  I have met many of them on a one-to-one or group basis and there are no words for it.<\/p> <p>  As Ms Keogh said, the service is looking at transitioning into the community.  The first place we looked at was Roscommon with regard to hotels and how that might create opportunities for the staff locally as a redeployment option.  This was not possible in Roscommon because the necessary accessibility, the numbers of rooms and the interest in partnering with us was not there.  We are also looking at places such as Ballinasloe, which is a commutable distance, where we looked at redeployment options for people.  Originally, we were considering two hotels - one in Galway city and one in Ballinasloe - but to create more sustainable jobs for redeployment, we went for a longer, full-year effect in Ballinasloe to start with.  These are the redeployment opportunities we have put out there for people, our colleagues, and the uptake on that is very low.  One can always do things differently, and everyone could say that.  There is no right way of doing it.  I am at a loss in one way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019112100002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Cunningham"},{"type":"speech","time":1574294400,"counter":1669,"content":"<p>I want to focus on two major issues, one of which relates to the funding.

We are providing this service fully in Kilkenny currently.  We have people who visit the service in Kilkenny.

IWA staff are in the hotel with the visitors 24-7.  IWA-trained personal assistants who are doing this type of work day in, day out and have been for many years are providing the service in the hotels to our guests.

Would the board be open to that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019112100002#F00400","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574294400,"counter":1690,"content":"<p>The Deputy covered a number of matters.  I will take each in turn before getting to the last one.  He spoke about the telephone calls he had made to the hotels.  If one rings any hotel in Ireland and asks if they have hoists, they will say they do not have them.  I refer to what is unique about the IWA's model of service.  I challenge the assumption that it is an experimental model.  It has been in place for more than 18 months and it is constantly fully booked.  We cannot keep up with the demand for the service.  I believe we have gone past experimental at this point.<\/p> <p>  As regards the hotels we are working with in Kilkenny and those we will be working with in the new model for people who have previously visited Cuisle, we concluded the procurement process with those hotels yesterday.  We will be able to provide the same number of bed nights that were HSE funded in Cuisle in 2019 and into 2020.  That is 1,700 bed nights, and probably more than that as things grow.<\/p> <p>  With regard to equipment, hoists, beds and so forth, the IWA provides all the equipment in the hotel environment.  If people wish to book a break through the IWA, they call our regional respite manager, say where and when they want to go and how many people wish to go.  We go into great detail with them about their requirements, be it medication, clinical tasks, personal assistant service, equipment and so forth, and we provide it on site.  The people who work for the IWA providing that service are part of our personal assistance services.  The association provides 1.2 million personal assistance hours on behalf of the HSE every year.  It is by far the largest provider of personal assistance services in Ireland.  We know how to do this and we do it well.<\/p> <p>  In the context of the decision for the board and whether we could bring something back to the board if funding became available, if there is a realistic proposal on the table we will bring it back.  We have not seen anything in that regard at this point.  The only caveat I would add is that, at present, the estimate we have for the cost of works is &euro;1.15 million.  We are greatly concerned that if we start pulling down walls, ripping out fuse boards and so forth, the asbestos in the building will be disturbed.  If that happens, we are facing an inestimable cost and the question of who will pay for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019112100002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Rosemary Keogh"},{"type":"speech","time":1574294400,"counter":1691,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Keogh.  The other issue is that the people we deal with here, the users of the service whom the association very generously works with, are people who do not have many choices in their lives.  One of the points they are making to public representatives is that it is their choice to have a special place, which Cuisle provided.  That is what they want.  There is a responsibility on us as public representatives and also on the association to do everything we can to deliver that choice.  We must try to move this forward in that context.  All Members of the Oireachtas would play their part in trying to move it forward.  However, I am still slightly perplexed about the board.  One of the matters that has come through in all of this, and it appears to be the case for everyone we talked to, is that people were unaware that it was at this level of crisis until very recently.  If this crisis was developing, we would have thought that the board, conscious of the possibility of having to close this centre, would be shouting from the rooftops much sooner to try to resolve the situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019112100002#F00600","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574294400,"counter":1692,"content":"<p>We have been engaging with public representatives on this issue since early in 2017.

We engaged immediately.  I met Department of Health officials and the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath.  They ultimately directed us to the HSE.

Ms Keogh outlined the financial position in which we found ourselves.  Pay restoration for the sector was a major issue and had a big impact on the association.

Ms Keogh is right and I have said publicly on numerous occasions that the board and the association would not have decided at this point to move from Cuisle except for the situation that we find ourselves in.  The design team is made up of electrical engineers, who were brought in first, fire safety consultants, the quantity surveyor and the architect.  People asked where the &euro;1.15 million in known costs comes from.  There is a question of whether that calculation and those drawings exist.  I presented all of that to the landlords.  There is an issue regarding procurement and EU directives.  It is not rocket science that we cannot throw out a lot of information.  People say that the money will come and the works will be done, whether by the Irish Wheelchair Association or the landlord.  We have invested substantially in bringing this to where it is.  I met the landlord last week with my colleague and we shared all the work done to date.  The landlord was very satisfied with the financial investment that the association had made to bring it to that point.  We showed the landlord all the drawings and specifications for the electrical and fire safety works.  The unknowns are the big concern, bearing in mind that it is a leased building.  We had an asbestos report done and there is both known and unknown asbestos.  Unknown means that the heating system is probably all insulated with asbestos, because the building is from the 1960s.  I do not know how many members have been to Cuisle.  Deputies Harty and Naughten know it.  It is a huge, three storey building.  There is a long corridor to another building.  It is more than 3,000 sq. m in size.  If the heating system fails, that would cost hundreds of thousands more.<\/p> <p>  When we looked at our investment and planning, we were looking at a long-term facility.  Sales and marketing work was done.  The website was developed.  Our vision was that this would grow bigger and better over time.  The energy rating in the building is pretty poor, but people focus on the beautiful views from the windows.  There are huge windows in every bedroom and the heat flies out through them.  It is a mass concrete building, and that has to be considered.  If one is doing work on one's own home, one will look at the bigger picture to see if it is worth doing up the house or if it is better to knock it down and build a new one.  While we talk about &euro;1.15 million to address known issues, that is all we will do.  To go back to the question of what we would do if we got the money in the morning, we would have to consider that it is an estimate of &euro;1.15 million.  I am told that it could be 5% more because that estimate was a year ago.  It is only when it goes to tender that one knows what the actual price will be.  It has to be considered whether it is worth doing it.  The lease goes until 2026.  The Divine Word is open to extending that further and we asked it about the matter previously.  If that money is invested and the heating fails, what will happen?  The process has been verified with the HSE and the Department of Health, and the IWA does not have money for this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019112100002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Cunningham"},{"type":"speech","time":1574294400,"counter":1705,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for having this meeting focused on this issue.  I have a special gr&aacute; for Cuisle.  I was involved when it was a musty old seminary that had not been used for two decades.  It brought back other memories for me but those are not the business of this meeting.  I will tell Mr. Cunningham that the building has mass concrete walls internally, for the en suites, which was a surprising find at the time.  I first heard about this when people with disabilities on social media engaged with me.  They were very sad, upset and worried about it.  Added to that were people from a number of organisations for Huntington's disease, spina bifida, ataxia and such like.  The Chairman is a medical doctor and has particular understanding of the complexities of some of those issues and the stigma related to them for people as they advance, and all of the different elements of some of those and other conditions.<\/p> <p>  While I knew this already, it has been said to me again over the past couple of weeks that Cuisle was a home from home.  It was a safe place where the staff were people's family.  As somebody with polio, it is important for me to have time out with others with polio, to give out about doctors, medics and consultants and who is the best one to go to, save in the Chairman's presence.  People can exchange how they work things out and what works for them.  It is more than gossip.  There could be many more places using the hotel model, but something would be missing if there was no Cuisle.  The association said that if it had the money to keep Cuisle going and this issue had not arisen, its intention was to keep the show on the road.  We need to come back to that, whether today or after today.<\/p> <p>  There is much local, community and political interest in what Cuisle is and the value that it has had.  I regularly travel to various countries in Europe.  Not only is there no Cuisle anywhere else in Ireland but I have not heard of one anywhere else in Europe.  It is a gem.  Following up on what Deputy Kenny has said, people are raw, sour and hurting about what has happened over the past month or so.  From an employer's point of view, nobody likes making people redundant.  I made five people redundant in my own organisation in the past five or six months.  Deputy Kenny talked about the level of crisis.  It is not just that Cuisle is an issue.  The Irish Wheelchair Association runs personal assistance services that it cannot keep up with.  There is a crisis across the whole platform of funding for people with disabilities.  Everyone in the Oireachtas knows that from the representations they get, and we try to plug holes in places.<\/p> <p>  A number of statements have been made by our witnesses.  Can we find a way to have them signed off?  They referred to what they have received from the LEADER programme and such.  Can we find a way to agree what playing pitch we are on and to confirm what the IWA said about the sums of money, such as the &euro;400,000?  There is great interest in solving this issue here and people with disabilities keenly want it to be solved.  Any chief executive such as myself cannot speak for an organisation's board when the board has not yet made a decision but has to play the ball he or she is given.  The reason for the decision related to funding.  If the issue of funding can be decommissioned, there is a possibility that we could get back in action.  I do not want to overplay that but this needs other players.<\/p><p>It is clear the people in government and in the HSE have not yet put their hands in their pockets for the money, or even returned to say the figure is inflated and that it will cost only &euro;500,000.

We stand over the statements we have made on the LEADER funding and the assertion made to Senator Hopkins in respect of the HSE offering the IWA &euro;400,000 at one stage.  It did not make such an offer and that is all I can tell the committee in that regard.<\/p> <p>  On the assurances needed, the IWA is not the body to give those assurances.  We can tell the committee about our interactions but that is all we can do.  We cannot speak for any other organisation and it for other organisations to speak for themselves.  As I stated in my opening statement, everybody is sad about the decision.  Nobody wanted it to come to this.  Cuisle has been part of the fabric of the IWA for 22 years and the Senator was involved in establishing it in the 1990s.  It has been a difficult time for our board members.  I remind the committee that a number of our board members regularly holiday at Cuisle and were among the people who made the decision.  It has not been an easy decision for anybody to make.<\/p> <p>  The Senator talked about Cuisle being a safe place.  I hope we have demonstrated during the meeting that, unfortunately, Cuisle will no longer be a safe place in respect of the structure of the building and related issues.  I reiterate that even if the funding was to become available, &euro;1.15 million is not the solution to the problem.  The figure is &euro;1.15 million based on our current estimates, which are now one year old.  We would also need assurances that if the sum is larger, asbestos is uncovered, there are issues with the water treatment works or whatever else there might be, there will have to be enforceable commitments that the funding will also be available into the future.  Otherwise, in a year's time, having drawn down the &euro;1.15 million, we could rip the building asunder and discover we will need another &euro;1 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019112100002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Rosemary Keogh"},{"type":"speech","time":1574294400,"counter":1708,"content":"<p>The other issue is that 40 jobs are on the line.

Over the years, the people of Roscommon have come to know about Cuisle and it is an important issue.  I will not make a case that might be made by a trade union but rather a business case.  If we cannot keep Cuisle, it will not just be the building that will have to be replaced but the more difficult part will have to be replaced, namely, the calibrated and qualified staff.  I do not refer even to staff with professional qualifications but instead to people who know what the organisation is about.  That unquantified asset will be lost.

It worries me that that is the language of people trying to build a case for a decision they have made.  It also worries me that when our guests spoke about having been upbeat in their efforts, or when they said to staff that if they did not get the money, they do not know what they would do, that is a \"don't frighten the horses\" type of approach that I do not regard as a professional approach to saving a service.  If the IWA is serious about getting money from the State or other sources, the political machinery will involve going public with the risks, dangers and needs at an early stage, and it certainly will not involve tip-toeing around and saying to staff, \"Gosh, I do not know what will happen\" and so on, while perhaps the board gets ready for a decision it will have to take, as sure as there is a cross in an ass.<\/p> <p>  Was the effort high on spin and low on consultation?

It is partly to do with people having greater access to other venues around the country than they would have had in 1997.  Another reason is a lack of disposable income among people with disabilities.  The Cuisle facility is not fully funded.  We get a contribution from the HSE towards the cost of running Cuisle.  The rest of our costs have to be met from guest contributions or from our catering business, our bar or other independent guests who might visit.  We had the BDO business plan drawn up to see how to attract more external income to subsidise the service, which was in deficit. All of those factors operate together.  Some of the decrease is because people are accessing holidays abroad or in other hotels in Ireland.  That is a reality which we accept.  Part of the reason concerns budgets.  We do not have the funding to support people.  Another part of it concerns our limited staffing at Cuisle.

If we leave anything out, please revert to me.<\/p> <p>  The staff at Cuisle have done a fantastic job and have been fabulous ambassadors for the IWA for the past 22 years.  It has been extremely difficult for the IWA to reach a position where we are making people redundant.  It is not something that we do lightly or without great thought.  Regarding the level of notice given to the staff, we have operated within the legislation.  Since the centre would have been due to close at the end of the first week in December anyway - it normally closes between then and some time in February - we did not believe that it would be fair to tell people on 1 November that they would be losing their jobs next February and then leave them sitting in limbo until then.  To reference some of Senator Dolan's points, it is never easy to make anyone redundant.  I have been on the receiving end of redundancy twice - it is devastating.  We accept that.  If there is an easier or better way to do it, we will reflect on it for the future.<\/p> <p>  I will ask Mr. Cunningham to provide clarification on the Deputy's meetings with him.  The Deputy contacted me within 24 hours of the notice of Cuisle's closure.  I asked Mr. Cunningham, as national director of services for Cuisle and a number of other IWA services, to contact the Deputy on my behalf and give him the background to and reasons for the closure, which I understand he did.  The Deputy sent two further emails to me requesting that certain actions be taken, including keeping the centre open for a further 12 months while solutions could be found.  As CEO, that is not within my remit or my gift to do, but I will relate those comments to the board.<\/p> <p>  Regarding our willingness to postpone the decision, it is not my decision to make.

They have made great efforts and a lot of work has gone into the area around Donamon and Castlecoote, and the whole county.  It is a national issue, not just local.  I thank the Divine Word Missionaries for their commitment to this project since 1997, to Seamus Thompson, who was chief executive at the time, and the dedicated staff who have committed themselves for so long and so well, and who are being treated in the most abhorrent manner by Ms Keogh, her staff and the board of the Irish Wheelchair Association.  I have never in my political life come cross anything like the way they have been treated.  I want to put that on record.  It is a very significant point.<\/p> <p>  Ms Keogh came here today with her mind made up.  She did not come here for dialogue.  She had her opening statement prepared and she submitted what she had decided to do before she came here today.  She was not interested in listening to the proposals and suggestions of the members of this committee, Oireachtas Members, councillors, supporters and friends of Cuisle.<\/p> <p>  I have many questions and I will use every minute I have.  I put the first question to Ms Keogh.  In light of the very strong case made by my colleagues, will she put to her board that, in justice, the IWA should postpone this decision for six to nine months to see what we can do?  We were not informed there was a problem.  I was not contacted.  As the longest serving Oireachtas Member in the county and the area, and as a neighbour of Cuisle, given our lands adjoin, I was not contacted.  However, I was involved when Charlie McCreevy and Brian Cowen provided up to &euro;1 million, although I do not know the exact amount.  I was involved with my colleagues and councillors in regard to the provision of specially designed fishing stands, the development of the roof and the development of the buildings.  I know that building back to front because I live beside it.  To avoid me having to put more questions that may have been answered, I am asking Ms Keogh to now give a commitment that she will go back to her board and say that, arising from the dialogue today at this important committee, she will postpone the decision to close for six or 12 months to give us time.  Will she please put this to the board arising from the discussions today? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019112100002#N01900","speaker":"1393"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574294400,"counter":1926,"content":"<p>I would like to make reference to Senator Leyden's contact to the IWA office on 5 November.

I want to talk about the promotion leaflet for hotel breaks.  The leaflet has quotes that read like comments on Trivago or Booking.com.  There are references to the staff and food being excellent and to patrons feeling equal going on holidays with everyone else.  They no longer feel that people with disabilities are put in a box.  They say the service is excellent and gives them a great holiday and not only respite.  Those quotes were also in the IWA presentation, as Ms Keogh will be aware.  The reason I have read them out is because I believe there is a major imbalance in the representation of what people with disabilities may or may not choose and what may or may not be open to them.<\/p><p>Like everyone else, and I assume it is the same for the IWA representatives, we have been heavily lobbied by those who use the centre regularly for their holidays.  Some of the quotes would break hearts.  I want to read some of them into the record because it is only fair to have people praise Cuisle in the same way as the brochure praises the hotels.  One comes from the sister of a 37 year old woman.  She said her sister is vulnerable and cannot talk or walk, but she calls Cuisle her boozing holiday because she can drive herself to the bar, where the staff know her and know what she likes.  One man goes to visit her every year she is there and has even written a song about her.  How special is that?  Another comment comes from a woman directly.  Cuisle offers her and her friends from her centre a holiday together where they look forward to seeing each other very much.  It is the only opportunity they have for a holiday together.  They have a great time meeting other wheelchair users.  The next comment is from the father of a young teenage girl.  He is actually a friend of mine.  He says his daughter will not stay in anyone's house except his mother's because the girl knows her granny will look after her in the same way that the staff in Cuisle look after her.  The idea of throwing her into a new surrounding because of some notion of integration is nonsense.  She needs to feel safe and secure and that only happens when she has continuity.  If we force people into more isolation when they do not want to go somewhere else, they will feel more anxiety.  That will deter their families from sending them on holidays.  When people suffer from mental and physical disabilities, it is all about safety, security and knowing what to expect.<\/p><p>I have read their testimony because I believe it is important to put balance on this.  It strikes me as strange that when the IWA is asked for the numbers on what users say, the number of people who want to use Cuisle and the numbers who do not, the association does not have exact numbers.  It has a general pattern of what may be happening with service users.<\/p><p>In <i>thejournal.ie<\/i>and the association statement today, the IWA &quot;stressed to Minister McGrath that the clear choice and preference of people with a disability is increasingly more about having access to positive and non-segregated settings and where existing commercial hotel provider settings implement universal design initiatives to accommodate people of all levels of abilities&quot;.  That is a big statement to make without a questionnaire or survey that we can all look at and determine, for example, that 99 users prefer to be in Cuisle while 299 would prefer to go to commercial hotels.  That is a big statement to make.  If the IWA made that clear to the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, and that is what the IWA believes to be the pattern based on what we know about the actual results, then the IWA representations to the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, expressed a preference for the hotel model over the Cuisle model.  It may well be the case that had the IWA done it the other way around, the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, might have decided to find the &euro;1.5 million.  I am not a big fan of any Minister but, as it happens, the Minister of State may well have done that.<\/p><p>I agree with the IWA in one respect and I see where the association has a problem.  This is a bigger political issue.<\/p><p>This is the same week in which the Government announced it will put &euro;3 billion of taxpayers' money into broadband.  There has just been a big announcement on the overspend on the children's hospital, which although we cannot prove it, most of us believe impacts on all services, including mental health and disability.<\/p><p> In her submission, Ms Keogh stated, \"In June, this committee was briefed by a number of disability service provider umbrella groups on the growing funding crisis in the disability sector.\"  That is an important statement.  She went on to state, \"In this context, during the period 2008 to 2018, the IWA has seen its financial reserves diminish by &euro;5.7 million\".  In 2008, there was a banking collapse, the then Government bailed out the banks to the tune of &euro;64 billion, and many services suffered.  We now live in the fastest, healthiest-growing economy in the EU.  In the context that this is happening to the most vulnerable sectors of society, the IWA stated its funding is depleted and that there is a crisis in the funding of the disability sector.  It is an absolute disgrace that Cuisle will close.  Anybody who was at the protests last week would fully back the users to retain the service.  We have to find a way to retain it.  Given that the Government makes a bags of everything else, overspends on everything and deprives people of proper funding, we will have to find a firefighting service way out of the matter.  We cannot let down the father of the girl, the sister of the woman, all the people attending the meeting and their families.<\/p><p> Whatever proposals the Senator made may be the way out but the IWA should tell the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, that the emphasis put on the hotel model was outweighed by the protest and the sentiment coming strongly from the people use Cuisle day to day and year to year, and that we cannot afford to close it.  People have to have the choice and preference, and the IWA should state that, unfortunately, it gave the Minister of State the wrong impression there is only one way to go, namely, into commercialised hotels.  What IWA stated to the Minister of State was flawed, or if it was not, we need to hear what the wheelchair users and the people who use the service say to the IWA about the service.  Our guests might comment on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019112100002#O02900","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574294400,"counter":1970,"content":"<p>I return to the fact that the decision for Cuisle was made because the Government was not able to provide funding for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019112100002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Rosemary Keogh"},{"type":"speech","time":1574294400,"counter":1971,"content":"<p>That does not seem to be what the IWA asked of the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019112100002#P00300","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574294400,"counter":1972,"content":"<p>Two years ago, when we had our first engagement with the Minister of State and the HSE, our request at that point was to secure funding in order that Cuisle could remain the fantastic, wonderful facility it is, as the Deputy expressed well and as the comments of the people who go there show.

First, I thank the witnesses very much for coming in to give their evidence and explain the position regarding Cuisle.  They will have picked up the passion of the committee for this facility and of its members closely associated with the area where it is located.  The issue is now in the political arena.  There is consensus among the members who have attended this committee that they want this facility to continue to operate in whatever way that can possibly be done.<\/p> <p>  It would seem to be a unique service not only in Ireland but in other jurisdictions.  It would be a shame to lose it without us, as politicians, giving the witnesses every assistance to try to keep it open.  I understand they have gone down the channels they have gone down and have not been successful.  However, having aired the issues this afternoon, I propose,as Deputy Fitzmaurice suggested, this committee would write to the Minister asking for a review of how Cuisle is being funded, how funds are being made available to it, and ask if the witnesses could defer their decision to close the facility for a number of months to allow the political process that has started here today to feed through to see if funding can be found, or if there is a philanthropist who has not been identified yet, or whatever way funding could be provided.

A family relation has died and he is attending the funeral.  I acknowledge letters received from Erica Boucher and her mother about what Cuisle has meant to them and the heartbreak they are suffering over its proposed closure.  They are full of compliments for the staff.  The Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, made a statement on Monday, 18 November indicating that the main reason behind the decision to move away from Cuisle is that there has been a significant drop-off in numbers seeking to avail of respite in the facility in recent times and the preference of people has been for hotels, as has been facilitated in Kilkenny.<\/p><p>There have been substantial price increases in Cuisle.  In 2015, a person with high-dependency needs paid &euro;175 per night for full board and care.  In 2019, this increased to &euro;220 in mid-season, representing a 26% increase.  It rose to &euro;230 in peak season, representing an increase of 31%.  Even during the low season, when there is a lot of unused capacity, the price rose from &euro;175 to &euro;200, a 14% increase.<\/p><p> There has been a major reduction in funding to provide respite breaks.  For example, the Dublin and mid-Leinster budget decreased from &euro;150,000 to &euro;60,000 in recent years.  There has been a reduction in staffing resources in Cuisle, limiting the number of people who can access the service.  Currently, there is one nurse with a 19.5-hour contact and another who can work two weeks out of four and who has a 12-hour contract.  Numerous people have allegedly been told by the IWA that they could not visit the centre this year as a result of the staffing issues.<\/p><p> The number on the carers' roster in Cuisle has reduced from 30 in 2017 to 18 at present.  Duty manager positions have reduced from three 39-hour positions in 2016 to one 39-hour position and one 20-hour position in 2019.<\/p><p> I have one question.

I have heard the IWA state that if the funding issue did not exist, it would be carrying on with Cuisle.  Therefore, we are in a place where we now have to turn a corner and get into a mode that is more technical and detailed in respect of finding a way.  I totally agree with Deputy Denis Naughten and the Chairman on communicating directly with the board of the IWA on the basis of what has been said here and the various questions and requests made, and on communicating directly with the Minister.  I wish to make a statement and I do not wish to be difficult in making it: there is a hurdle of some kind in that what is known cannot be unknown.  Mr. Cunningham said this.  Whether it is a game-stopper in terms of hanging on to the service for a period, I do not know, but it is a live issue.

A person who was very independent would have a particular rate for bed and breakfast.  Then there were different price ranges for people who required low, medium or high support or medication or clinical tasks.  There were price increases because the money was not there.

This issue is also about the quality of rural and community life, the choices that are being made and what is at stake.  To be clear, we are asking the witnesses for a stay of execution and that request will be formalised in due course.  We ask for that because there is an underlying sense of injustice about how the decision to close was reached.  I acknowledge everything the witnesses have said about their interactions with the Government.  The fact is we are in a different situation now; they are aware of the considerable public disquiet and they now have a public awareness asset.<\/p><p>At this point, the witnesses do not know what we are now capable of doing as a concerned community, particularly in Cuisle's hinterland area.  A very important point is that we are facing into a general election.  That brings a particular dynamic of its own to the lobbying for and extraction of commitments.  The witnesses have been at pains to stress how much they value Cuisle, and we take what they are saying at face value, but it does not lie with that to insist on a sudden death and shuttering of Cuisle.  I hear their concerns about safety and while such concerns must always be taken seriously, as things stand the witnesses have not been condemned.  They are under no legal obligation to immediately cease activities.  They are insured.  From everything I hear, they are in a position to show good faith by not taking a sudden decision.  They have knowledge of new issues but they had a certain amount of knowledge about the gradual and developing inadequacies of the facility that always were going to need updating.  It seems to me that there is a real test of the witnesses' goodwill here, not to take a sudden decision but, when members as a committee communicate formally with them, to do what they said they would do, which is to take a request back to their board.  We would, however, like them to give us some indication today as to what their advice would be because in almost every situation, what the CEO, Ms Rosemary Keogh, says will determine what the board decides.  Let us not pussyfoot about that.  We are asking the witnesses for a stay of execution for good reason because we have not had an opportunity to explore the potential to save Cuisle.<\/p><p> I turn now to the issue of how Cuisle might be saved, and let us hope that in turning to the future we are not wasting our breath and that there is real goodwill on the witnesses' side towards looking at what might come from this committee about that.  The witnesses talked about the significant capital costs of bringing Cuisle to a position where the association would be comfortable to continue to operate.  The only figure we have heard is &euro;1.15 million, but perhaps allowing for a further 5%.  The witnesses then spoke about other unknown knowns and known unknowns.  It is legitimate for them to say that they do not know the full cost if they went to address certain issues around heating or even around asbestos but they say that the projected costs they have given include full electrical installation and fire safety upgrades.  As I understand it, it is not confined to that.  I have two money questions for the association  We have to acknowledge at this point the very generous contribution from the Divine Word Missionaries over the years.  The sum of &euro;125,000, albeit in punts, for 25 years is less than the salaries of quite a few people in the sector might be on at the highest levels.  It is a very modest amount of money.  We are talking about &euro;5,000 a year.  They are proposing to give all of that back, retrospectively, therefore, the witnesses would be at no rent since the beginning of the operation.  Is that not correct?  That is the first sum the witnesses have to play with.<\/p><p> Another sum is whatever promised funding is there to be accessed, which the witnesses cannot access under their current decision.  Were they to reverse or postpone that decision, however, they then would be able to access certain moneys.  They might have outstanding commitments in terms of paying heating or other bills up until the end of the lease anyway.  In terms of their estimate, it is legitimate that they would have a conservative estimate and a more costly estimate because they do not know the full situation but it is always possible in these situations to identify a ballpark figure and there is an upper level and a lower level.  When we subtract from that figure the moneys the witnesses know are available to them, what is the actual shortfall?  I will put the question in theoretical terms.  If the secret millionaire was to present himself or herself in the morning and say, \"I want Cuisle to continue operating for the next ten years, I want value for money and I do not want to give you more than I have to give you, having regard to the money you are currently able to leverage from other sources, including the Divine Word Missionaries and so on\", what is the figure?<\/p><p> In terms of my second question, the witnesses have not mentioned it but is there a current cost of running Cuisle?  Leaving aside capital, there is the current cost.  Is part of the witnesses' decision-making process that they have been making a loss on Cuisle as they see it and that it is a drain on their current expenses?  Is that the undiscussed factor in their decision-making at this meeting?  If that is the case, can they give us an idea of what closing Cuisle would release for them moneywise on an annual basis, having regard to the fact that they are committing to fundraising hotel-based holidays and so on?<\/p><p> To summarise the three issues, first, is there genuine goodwill about taking a serious proposal seeking a stay of execution, so to speak, back to the board?  Second, what is the capital shortfall that a secret millionaire would have to come up with?  Third, what is the ongoing current drain - that is a negative word I would not want to use - coming from the operation of Cuisle and has that been a factor in the decision made?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019112100002#T00200","speaker":"1401","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574294400,"counter":2064,"content":"<p>The witnesses might take those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019112100002#U00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574294400,"counter":2065,"content":"<p>The first comment I want to make is that anybody who thinks the IWA board does everything the CEO says has clearly not met or engaged with the IWA board.  I can give a guarantee that, once a month, I have very long Friday night meetings and I do not always get out with what I wanted going in.  I want to put that on the record.  We have a dynamic and diverse board which takes its responsibilities extremely seriously and it would be wrong for it to be on record that that was not the case.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the capital piece, I am not trying to be obtuse when I say this but it is a difficult question to answer.  When we start with the &euro;1.15 million, if that is what it was, we can then do the Senator's calculation.  It is very difficult to do the calculation when we do not know what the full cost would be at this point.  However, if somebody came up with the money and it was enough to do the works and ensure that, for the next five or ten years or whatever period, any other unknown - asbestos or whatever it might be - that comes up would be secured, we would look seriously at that.  I want to reassure the Senator that if a proposal comes back through the committee, and we have already stated it here, we will bring it back to the board.  I do not know how many times I have said this afternoon, and I will say it again, that this is probably one of the most difficult decisions that has been made in the history of the IWA.  The association was founded by eight people who were wheelchair users in 1960.  That figure of eight has grown to more than 20,000 people across the country.  If we include staff and volunteers in that, we are up to approximately 25,000.  This organisation has been at the heart of developing services for people with disability and representing people with disability.

That goes back to Ms Keogh's meetings with the committee and the service level arrangement process in that every service stands in its own right.

Before discussing the public services card, it might be useful to give a brief overview of the history of the card, the background to the recent report by the Data Protection Commission on the card and the developments since the report was published on 17 September last.<\/p> <p>  The public services card has its genesis in the 1990s and its purpose has always been clear, namely, to provide a means of verifying a person's identity when accessing public services.  In December 1993, the then Government approved in principle the development of an integrated social services system, ISSS, which would provide a more integrated approach to the administration, delivery, management and control of statutory income support services.  An interdepartmental committee was established to progress that initiative.  That committee made a number of recommendations that were subsequently implemented, the main objectives of which were to improve customer services, provide value for money, and modernise the public service and the way it carries out its work on behalf of the citizens of our State.  The committee recommended that legislation be introduced to allow the then revenue and social insurance number, RSI number, to be adopted as a single public service identifier.  It also recommended that the use of the social services card be expanded across the public service to support customer identification, speed up access to social services and support new electronic payments.  It also suggested that the card should include a photograph of the customer to facilitate identification when he or she availed of public services.<\/p> <p>  These recommendations were published in a 1996 interdepartmental report and formed the basis for measures taken by one of my predecessors in this Department, the former Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, in February 1998.  He introduced legislation in the D&aacute;il to provide for the standardisation of the RSI number as the personal public service number, PPSN; the replacement of the social services card by the public services card, which would have the person's name, PPSN and the card number visible on the front; and the use of new technology on cards to develop new methods of paying social welfare benefits.  The Government made it clear at the time that both the public services card and the PPSN were to be used widely across the public service to assist people in their dealings with public sector organisations.<\/p><p>Subsequent Governments progressed this policy and introduced a small number of further legislative amendments, providing, for example, that the Minister would not issue a PSC unless he or she was satisfied as to the identity of the person to whom the card was being issued, and that the person's photograph and signature would be included on the card.<\/p><p> Following the development and implementation of the standard framework for authentication of identity, the standard authentication framework environment, SAFE, public service cards were first introduced in 2011.  The PSC is now widely used by a number of bodies as a means of identification.  These bodies include my Department, the Revenue Commissioners, the Passport Office, Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, the National Driver Licence Service and the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.  In practice, this means that once a person has authenticated his or her identity via the SAFE process and has been issued a PSC, that person does not have to submit the same information to authenticate his or her identity each and every time he or she makes an application to any of the bodies that use that card.  There are more than 3.2 million active users of the PSC, representing more than 80% of the adult population in the State.  In this context, it should also be noted that, each week, payments valued at approximately &euro;150 million are made via our post offices by more than 600,000 people, whose identity is verified on each occasion by using their PSCs.  Every week, approximately 600,000 free travel journeys are made using the PSC.  Every year, approximately 70,000 people over the age of 18 apply for a passport for the first time using their PSC to avoid having to resubmit identity data.  Almost 420,000 PSC holders have verified their identity to a standard that enables them to access a wide variety of online services with the bodies mentioned via MyGovID.  The development of the PSC has been welcomed by the public.  Research commissioned by my Department indicates high levels of satisfaction with the overall process among holders.<\/p><p> On 27 October 2017, the Data Protection Commission initiated an investigation into the Department's compliance with its responsibilities as a data controller in respect of PSC-related matters, including the legal basis for the processing of personal data and compliance with EU law.  The Department fully co-operated with the investigation, including through the provision of detailed responses to a draft report provided to the Department at the midpoint of the investigation process.  The final report relating to the legal basis and transparency issues contained eight findings and was received by my Department on 15 August 2019, together with a letter from the commission requiring the Department to take certain measures.  The Data Protection Commission stated that it did not have the legal powers to publish the report but it issued a press release setting out the key findings and the measures that it required my Department to take.  It requested that my Department publish the report of its own volition.<\/p><p> The commission found that my Department has the legal powers to require users of its services to authenticate their identity to SAFE standards, to issue a PSC to these users and to require them to produce it as a means of authenticating their identity when accessing Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection services.  It found that the right to issue a PSC did not extend to circumstances where the user was acquiring it solely for the purpose of transactions with other bodies in circumstances where these bodies did not offer their users an alternative means of authenticating their identity.  It found that the Department did not have the right to indefinitely and on a blanket basis retain documents and other information collected for the purposes of authenticating identity.  Finally, it found that the information provided to users in respect of the PSC did not satisfy transparency requirements.<\/p><p> My Department, together with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, considered the report carefully and we sought the advice of the Attorney General's office.  Following this consideration, it was concluded that the processing of personal data related to the PSC complies with legal requirements, the document retention is lawful and the information provided satisfies our transparency requirements.  The commission has advised my Department that an enforcement notice is being prepared which will be issued to the Department in respect of its investigation.  My Department will carefully consider this notice when it is received and we will take the appropriate actions in light of the advice from the Attorney General's office, which may include referral to our courts.  I look forward to hearing the committee's views and answering any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019112100002#A00300","speaker":"1338","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574294400,"counter":2130,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I understood, when I raised this during parliamentary questions, that this had been farmed out to a third-party lawyer.  Did this advice come directly from the Attorney General's office or an outside lawyer?  I suppose it would be too much to ask who the lawyer was.  We have not seen the legal advice.  It may not be possible to do so because there may be some precedent for not publishing it.  Can we at least have a synopsis of the legal advice?  I have read the report carefully.  It has been a while but I can read it again.  It represents two years of research and I thought the legal reasoning was impeccable.  How does the legal advice justify indefinite retention of data?  Does it tell us that there is currently sufficient transparency and that the public is adequately informed about the use to which the data can be put?  I am intrigued to find out if it provides justification in that regard.<\/p> <p>  The Data Protection Commission made a number of recommendations.  Have any of those recommendations been adhered to yet?  Is the Minister conscious that a number of other public bodies that were using the card have resiled from insisting that it be produced to grant people services?  Her colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, went so far as to say that his officials had been vindicated in having initial doubts about the legal validity of the card.  We saw only yesterday that under the childcare scheme announced recently by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, use of the card will come into play.  Since the online system will not be ready until next year, people will have to wait because they will have to produce the card to access the scheme.  Regardless of the recommendations of the Data Protection Commission and the all-party committee that the Minister spoke about, and regardless of what was or was not said in the D&aacute;il, the Data Protection Commission has found that, legally, the legislation introduced in 1998 does not give the powers that are being claimed.  The commission clearly found that the legislation does not allow public bodies other than the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to insist on compulsory production of the card and that is the fact.<\/p> <p>  The Minister was vague about the enforcement notice.  She has not yet received the enforcement notice, which is somewhat surprising.  Can she be a little clearer in this regard?  If the Attorney General or the Attorney General's lawyer has told her that everything is perfectly in order and she receives an enforcement notice, it follows naturally that she will contest the notice.<\/p> <p>  The committee's recommendations about the use of the card outside the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection seem to say that it can be used for purposes other than social welfare provided an alternative system is in place which people can opt to use if they wish.  We on this side of the House recognise that the public services card has been very useful.  I know many people in my constituency who prefer to access social welfare and some other services by just producing the public services card.  It is very convenient.  Our difficulty is that it is compulsory.  We get that it is compulsory for social welfare but it has been made compulsory for a range of other services for which the Data Protection Commissioner says there is no legal basis.<\/p> <p>  I remind the Minister of the 2016 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, which stated that no business case had been made for the card.  The report points out that in certain cases, the card seems to make it more difficult rather than easier to access services.<\/p><p>There is no obvious justification that the card must be produced in appeals for refusals of school transport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019112100002#B00300","speaker":"1227","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574294400,"counter":2133,"content":"<p>If I miss any of the 27 questions put to me, I appreciate that they were asked one at a time, I hope Deputy O'Dea will remind me.  The advice we took came from our in-house legal team and the Office of the Attorney General, in which there are many legal minds.  The Office of the Attorney General also took third-party advice.  As a former Minister, Deputy O'Dea will be well aware of the seasoned practice that the Office of the Attorney General is the Cabinet's adviser.  Its advice has never been published so there is precedence for it being between the Attorney General and his or her client which in this case is the Government.  I genuinely believe that all of my statements, including those I have made today, reiterate the strong legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General that the interpretation of the legislation by the Data Protection Commissioner is incorrect.  Our understanding and belief is that the legislation enacted in 1998 by the Deputy's Government, the Government of 2005 and subsequently Fine Gael-led Governments in 2011 and 2013 empowers us to do exactly what we have been doing since the PSC was published in 2011.  The synopsis of the advice is on the public record.  The use of the data is something that we have clearly set out and established in the 2005 legislation.  We believe that we are following the legislation to a T.<\/p> <p>  There was some misinformation about statements made and public commentary thereafter.  A PSC is not needed to make a SUSI grant appeal, which is the one on which people keep relying to show how we were wrong.  No one needs a PSC to make a SUSI grant appeal, that was never the case and there are no plans by the relevant Department or Government agency to make that the case.  The Data Protection Commissioner did find that there was absolutely a legal base for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to require people to authenticate themselves during the stage 2 process so that we could be absolutely sure that they are who they say they are and that they are only registered to access public State services once, and once only, in their own name.  Every other Minister has the right or entitlement in their own Department to determine how best they provide public services.  The Deputy needs to recall why his Government had the foresight to do this in 1998 and why subsequent Governments continued with it.  The idea was just to try to make access to public services easier, more efficient and quicker for the people we are here to serve.  People have spoken with their feet insofar as the Deputy has admitted that, where they wish to do things online, it is much faster to use the PSC as proof of identity.  The best example which most people can visualise is how one can get a passport by completing an application form online on Monday and receiving one's passport on Wednesday or Thursday.  That would have been unheard of some years ago.  However, it is not true to say that one cannot get a passport any other way because one can.  It is not true that one cannot get a driver licence any other way than having a PSC because one can, but it is by means of the old, inefficient way.  People can choose with their feet to decide if they wish to go to the post office, bring the photographs to the Garda station, get them signed, go in and sit in Mount Street for four hours or to just do it online.  That is their choice.<\/p> <p>  It is incumbent on any Government to provide services in the most efficient way possible but also to give people choices depending on their circumstances.  The childcare scheme is a case in point.  There is misinformation circulating that we have only changed the childcare scheme since the Data Protection Commissioner's ruling came out in August.  Since the inception of the childcare scheme 18 months ago, there were always plans for a paper application and an online application route, which is just what transpired since the scheme went live recently.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy suggested that I am vague on the enforcement notice.  I am not sure if he means how I will respond when the enforcement notice comes.  I am deliberately vague in this regard because the press releases which were issued by the Data Protection Commissioner on 15 August were incredibly strong, direct and robust.  I now find myself some three and a half months later, having initially been instructed to do things within seven days, within 21 days and within six weeks, of having no sight of the enforcement notice that was imminent on 15 August.  If I am being deliberately cagey it is because I genuinely have no idea what will be in the enforcement notice if it ever arrives.  I have no idea if it will be exactly the same as the findings given that some of the opinions have changed in the last couple of months arising from the findings.  I am not sure if it will be the instructions that came in the letter to us on 15 August which were different to the instructions that came in the findings.  I am not being obstructive, I just do not know what will be in the enforcement notice.  However, I guarantee that it will get as much careful thought and consideration in our response, if and when it comes.<\/p> <p>  The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General did suggest that there was a problem that we should have potentially a one-document business case.  That was raised at a meeting of the Committee on Public Accounts either last week or the week before.  The Department has acknowledged that there was no single business case document for the development of the SAFE identity process and the whole PSC project but that should not be taken as evidence that there was not a huge amount of planning over many years by successive Governments over the years and Departments.  Most of the elements of the business case were in place in various documents that were laid before the Committee of Public Accounts.  I have a document that I can give the Deputy today that lists 22 different documents which detailed exactly how, when, where, why and the purpose of what we were trying to do.  In hindsight, perhaps it would have been better had we started on day one with one document with 20 chapters but that is not the way it happened.  That was acknowledged by the Secretary General last week, that if we were to start from the beginning we might have one document.  However, just because there was not one document that does not mean that there were not 21 documents detailing all the facets.<\/p> <p>  Finally, I have had the privilege of holding this post for several years and have received legal advice on many matters.  The legal advice I have from the Office of the Attorney Genera is as strong as it could be.  We have a difference of interpretation of Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection legislation.  Our interpretation of our legislation which was passed by successive Governments is correct.  The advice is that the Data Protection Commissioner interpretation of our legislation is incorrect.  We have a simple case of two people interpreting legislation in a different way.  The Data Protection Commissioner is doing her job and we are doing ours.  We will take our next move after the Data Protection Commissioner has made its next move.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019112100002#C00200","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1574294400,"counter":2134,"content":"<p>The Minister has answered some of the questions and has been misleading on others.

It goes on to state that the processing of personal data by the Department in connection with the issuing of PSCs for the purposes of transaction between individuals and other specified public bodies other than the Department itself does not have a legal basis under applicable data protection laws, and that, specifically, such processing contravenes section 2A of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003.  Has the Minister responded to the Data Protection Commission on that matter?<\/p><p>The report also indicates that the Department's blanket and indefinite retention of underlying documents and information provided by persons applying for a PSC contravenes section 2(1)(<i>c<\/i>)(iv) of the Data Protection Act 1988 and 2003 because such data is retained for periods longer than is necessary than the purpose for which it was collected.<\/p><p>Has the Department responded to the Data Protection Commission on that issue to clarify the Department's legal point of view?<br\/><br\/>In terms of transparency, the scheme does not comply with section 2D of the Data Protection Act 1988, as amended by the Data Protection (Amendment) Act 2003, in that the information provided by the Department to the public about the processing of their personal data in connection with the issuing of PSCs is not adequate.  Has the Department responded to the Data Protection Commission?<br\/><br\/>The Data Protection Commission went to state that, critically, the Department will be required to complete the implementation of two specific measures within a period of 21 days.  Have those two specific measures been implemented, yes or no?  The first of the two measures was set out as follows: <\/p><blockquote>\tIt will be required to stop all processing of personal data carried out in connection with the issuing of PSCs, where a PSC is being issued solely for the purpose of a transaction between a member of the public and a specified public body ... .  The corollary of this finding is that bodies other than DEASP cannot insist that a person who does not already hold a PSC must obtain one as a pre-condition of accessing public services provided by that body. <\/blockquote><p>Has the Department responded to and implemented that measure?  The second required measure was:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe Department will be required to contact those public bodies who require the production of a PSC as a pre-condition of entering into transactions with individual members of the public, to notify them that, going forward, the Department will not be in a position to issue PSCs to any member of the public who wishes to enter a transaction with ... any such public body. <\/blockquote><p>How is the Department implementing those two points?<br\/><br\/>There is another question I want to ask the Minister before I finish up.  The Minister stated in her introduction that each year, approximately 70,000 people over the age of 18 apply for a passport for the first time using a PSC to avoid having to resubmit identity data.  The Minister is saying one can go the old route of getting one's two photographs, etc.  Has that been the case in all circumstances?  Maybe the Minister can also clarify the following point for me.  I have read that one needs to have a public services card to apply for the national childcare scheme.  Is it correct to state there is an alternative paper application process but that does not start until January and there is no back payment?  If I am correct, it means that the Department's system discriminates against those who do not have the public services card.  Those are the main points I wanted to ask on the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019112100002#D01700","speaker":"1306","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574294400,"counter":2155,"content":"<p>We will give the Minister an opportunity to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019112100002#E00200","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1574294400,"counter":2156,"content":"<p>Before I answer the specific questions, the Deputy made a statement that some people believe that this is a national identity card introduction by the back door.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019112100002#E00300","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1574294400,"counter":2157,"content":"<p>It is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019112100002#E00400","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1574294400,"counter":2158,"content":"<p>Many people have sought under freedom of information, FOI, legislation all of the documentation regarding meetings of interdepartmental groups right back as far as 1996.  At no stage was there ever any indication or action arising from the thought process that there would be any legislation passed or anything to give anybody the impression that this was a national identity card by the side door, the back door or the front door.  That fear, while real for a small number of people, is unfounded.<\/p><p>For the record, there is an assumption that members of my party have a great wish to have a national identity card.  I would abhor anybody walking down the road or anywhere being stopped and asked to produce papers.  It has massively negative connotations for me and I would not be able to support anybody who wants to introduce it.  Regardless of whether we have a national debate about it, which is what people keep calling for, I would not agree, sign up and subscribe to a policy that would introduce a national identity card.  For the record, I do not agree with it.<\/p><p>There were eight findings.  The difficulty I have in answering the questions without sounding like a smart-arse is that none of the eight findings has any force in law.  There is no enforcement notice and since 15 August, none has been issued as of yet.  I have nothing to challenge other than to say to the Deputy that I do not agree with any of the eight findings, not even the first one.  While that might sound bad, I do not have the ability to do anything other than wait.<\/p><p>It was never the case that the instructions that were given to us to be complied with in seven days, within 21 days and, in the final instructions, within 60 days, were ever to be complied with because we do not agree with them.  My legal advice is that the interpretation of the legislation by the Data Protection Commissioner's, DPC's, office is incorrect.  In fact, the advice we have been given is that if we did any of the things we were instructed to do, we would be acting outside of the legislation and effectively breaking the law.  While it might seem disrespectful, I find that we are in limbo.  Had the enforcement notice arrived on 15 August, we would have taken our time to look at it, get all of the advice and look at all of our practices over the past 20 years.  We do not have anything to legally challenge and until I have something to legally challenge, the eight findings that were issued in the report - the instructions that were issued in the DPC's letter - do not have any legal force and we will not be enacting any of the instructions.  If and when an enforcement notice is issued, we will consider carefully the instructions in that enforcement notice.  If there are things in it with which we agree, we will comply.  If there are things in it with which we disagree, our only recourse to challenge that is through the courts.<\/p><p>The Deputy asked about the photograph and the passport, as to whether one had the ability to get the passport by means other than having a PSC.  One always had the ability to go the old route.  That has never changed.  That is to facilitate people of all walks of life who do not necessarily like technology.  There are lots of people who still do not even send text messages.  We need to be able to provide public services in the manner that people expect to be able to use.  The most efficient manner for most people these days is online, which is why we have 3.2 million active users of the PSC and hundreds of thousands of people on a weekly basis who use it to get public services in a more efficient manner.  However, all other routes to be able to accommodate other people should be facilitated by each and every Department.  At the end of the day we are here to serve, not to control.<\/p><p>The Department is only the data controller of all of the data that are stored.  I do not have the directive powers to tell other Ministers how to draft and run schemes that come out of their offices but the governing responsibility allows them to ask people.  If people want to do business with the State online, they must be able to prove their identity and the most efficient way to be able to do so is through the SAFE 2 registration process, as 3.2 million people have found.<\/p><p>Lastly, the national childcare scheme was always in its foundations to have two ways to apply for it.  One was to be paper and one was to be online.  In order for one to make an application online through <i>mygov.ie<\/i>, one needs a PSC.  Some 80% of those who will qualify for the childcare scheme subsidies have already got a PSC and the paper form is going live on 1 January.  The Deputy is correct in stating that there is a month of a difference between the online version and the paper version.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019112100002#E00500","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1574294400,"counter":2159,"content":"<p>Is it backdated for those who apply?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019112100002#E00600","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1574294400,"counter":2160,"content":"<p>I do not think so.

There was some flurry of activity around 15 August and I think people expected us to either comply within two days or to respond within a number of days.<\/p> <p>  The issues here are complex and the legislation has been amended many times.  The Chairman will be aware that with consolidated legislation one must look back etc.  We considered everything to the nth degree right up to whether there is any possibility that we can strengthen the legislation.  At the end of the day, we do not want to fight with a Government agency.  If there was a way that we could have complied with the spirit of what the DPC was trying to do, we genuinely would have done it.  We looked at the legislation and the advice from our drafters was there was no way to be clearer in what we are trying to do than what was already stated specifically in the legislation.  In answer to the Chairman's direct question, we looked to see whether we could but the advice from the drafters was that it cannot be any clearer than it is.<\/p><p> Deputy Joan Collins asked me whether we responded to the DPC with regard to the seven days or 21 days.  My Secretary General and I have written numerous letters to the DPC in recent months seeking clarity on the difference between the instructions in the letter and the instructions in the findings.  We also requested meetings to find out exactly what the thinking was behind some of the instructions to see if we could find a way of avoiding going to court and to find some way of continuing the process of providing efficient services for all our people.  We recognised the concerns the office of the DPC had raised and wanted to see if there was any way to assuage those concerns.  We received no responses to our letters and the meetings were refused.  I am not trying to be humble, and I know people probably will not believe this, but I respect the office of the Data Protection Commission and I have a particular respect for the lady who holds the single role of our regulatory authority.  Neither I nor my Department want to be in conflict with her.  We tried as hard as we could to find an amicable resolution but in the absence of having anything to legally enforce, I have no choice but to say that we will robustly defend our legal standing and the legislation of successive Governments.  We will do exactly what we had intended and set out to do, which is to provide public services in an efficient manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019112100002#E01100","speaker":"1338","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574294400,"counter":2166,"content":"<p>I do not have a public services card.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019112100002#F00200","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1574294400,"counter":2167,"content":"<p>I can arrange an appointment for the Deputy if she would like.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019112100002#F00300","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1574294400,"counter":2168,"content":"<p>No, thank you.

In her presentation, she gave much detail about the 1990s but we skipped very quickly from 2017 to 2019, during which time many things were happening.  I have looked back at my own engagement with the Minister on this issue at that time, when many others also engaged with her.  In December 2017, I urged a period of slowing down and caution.  I asked that the Department would try to stop digging in respect of the public services card and creating trouble for us as a nation so as to avoid leaving us as hostages to fortune.  As an investigation had begun at that point, it would have seemed a good time to slow down but instead the Department doubled down on the roll-out.  In February 2018, when questions were being asked, Mr. Duggan from the Department said he did not believe the fact that an investigation had begun necessarily meant the DPC had concerns.  In December 2018, the Minister stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI cannot allow the Senator put on the record of this House that the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner has grave concerns with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  It does not. <\/blockquote> <p>The Minister had received the draft report at that time, which noted concerns about the retention of information, about which I will talk some more.  The Minister can surely understand why giving a sense of the mood of the Attorney General's advice or what she feels might have been said is not satisfactory to us.  We have been given assurances as to the general mood or tenor of an engagement that have not been backed up and which have effectively been contradicted by later revelations of the grave concerns raised, to which the Minister had access and we did not.  In 2018 a new contract was signed for a new roll-out while this investigation was under way.  These are serious concerns because many decisions were taken not to exercise even a modicum of caution for any period, not only as regards the contracts that had already been signed, but the new contracts as well.<\/p><p>I will group a few of the findings and go back to some others.  Finding No. 3 stated &quot;the blanket, indefinite retention of personal data consisting of documents and information (other than the applicant&rsquo;s photograph and signature) which are originally collected for the purposes of identity authentication in the context of SAFE 2 registration is in contravention of DEASP&rsquo;s obligations&quot;.  Some 3.2 million people have gone through the SAFE 2 process and satisfied the Minister as to their identity.  Not everyone has gone through the process but that is a separate issue.  According to Mr. Duggan, the PSC is the token which shows that someone has gone through that process and successfully verified his or her identity to a substantial level of assurance.  The Department satisfied itself as to their identity.  Why is it retaining their documentation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019112100002#F00800","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1574294400,"counter":2173,"content":"<p>I do not know whether the Senator is aware that some challenges were made to the Ombudsman's office last year regarding decisions made on appeal for a variety of scheme applicants.

We were instructed that if we did not keep the supporting documentation, we would not be able to stand over the decisions made thereafter.  Our office retains people's proof of the identity at the time of their application.  When somebody else makes an application or submits a second PSC card application, we refer through the system for all that person's supporting documentation.

The purpose of the Government's approach was to force people to use the PSC to access services to which they would otherwise have been entitled.  That is the position.  That is precisely the matter on which the Data Protection Commissioner disagrees with the Minister.  She said in response to a question asked by Deputy Brady that people who disagree with a legal ruling have the right to appeal.  Of course they have.  We all know that.  As the Minister well knows, it is a gross oversimplification of the position to say that.  The Data Protection Commissioner was set up as a statutory body to regulate data and to advise the Government on legislation concerning data, etc.  When a statutory body of this nature, having been set up and paid for with millions of euro of taxpayers' money, comes up with a finding that the Minister is unhappy with, it is most unusual for her to rush immediately to her legal adviser.  I am not sure whether the advice came from within the Department or from the Attorney General.  I am not sure whether the Attorney General agreed with the in-house advice.  I do not know where the third-party lawyer came into the picture.<\/p><p>Deputy Brady makes a valid point when he speaks about reputational damage.  The Data Protection Commissioner is the European regulator for outfits like Google and Facebook.  The Minister was highly condemnatory of the commissioner, a point I will return to in a moment.  The impression that this confrontation could create among multinational companies is that if one of them disagrees with a finding of the Data Protection Commissioner, it can go to the Irish Government and the Government will see it right.  In 2014, less than &euro;2 million was spent on the Data Protection Commissioner's office.  The figure now stands at &euro;15 million, which gives a good impression that we are serious about data protection.  However, this controversy is undoing that.<\/p><p> The Minister, in her response to me on a finding of the Data Protection Commissioner, was very condescending.  She spoke of compliance with enforcement notices being required within a certain number of days and stated she had not yet received an enforcement notice.  She said she would respond to the enforcement notice if it ever arrives.  There is no doubt that it will arrive.  My understanding was that the Minister was given 60 days to comply with some of the Data Protection Commissioner's requests.  As such, it is not unreasonable that she has not yet received enforcement notices.<\/p><p> What is the position?  Will the Government legislate in this area?  Will it fight the Data Protection Commissioner through the courts?  Will it accept, based on the fact that while the public services card is very useful and many people find it convenient and are happy to use it, those who do not want to use it for services other than social welfare should not be forced to do so?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019112100002#G06100","speaker":"1227","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574294400,"counter":2252,"content":"<p>Apart from the Deputy's personal insults which I will not stoop to respond to-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019112100002#H00200","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1574294400,"counter":2253,"content":"<p>I am not insulting the Minister.

It appears that increases in carbon tax will be a feature of budgets from now because of climate change policies of all parties, including those in government.  There is an argument as to whether increasing carbon tax has any impact in reducing carbon emissions but that is beside the point.  The Government has accepted the proposition, which seems widely accepted, that it has an effect.  That is the stated purpose, at least, of increasing carbon tax.<\/p><p>Increasing the carbon tax will have a disproportionate impact on lower-income families.  If an increase is X, a higher proportion of income will be sacrificed as the income gets smaller.  The Government's strategy to deal with this was to increase fuel allowance by &euro;2 per week.  The fuel allowance lasts for 28 weeks, giving an increase of &euro;56.  The Minister told me recently during Question Time in the D&aacute;il that some studies have been done and it is reckoned that this amount is needed to compensate people.  I would like something more specific than that.  Many categories of social welfare recipients do not receive the fuel allowance at all and, in effect, they are not being compensated for the increase in carbon tax, which is grossly unjust.  If it is the Government's intention and the intention of future Governments to increase the carbon tax year on year, I would like a detailed assessment of how this will affect lower income groups so we can make the necessary adjustments in budgetary policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2019112100002#B01500","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"speech","time":1574294400,"counter":2361,"content":"<p>My amendment and Deputy O'Dea's amendment are similar in some ways.  Deputy O'Dea's amendment focuses on low-income families but I have come at this from the angle of people in receipt of the fuel allowance.  We know the impact the carbon tax will have on people as it is not new.  It has been in place for a number of years.<\/p><p>By and large, they live in poor accommodation that may be badly insulated, that has little or no central heating and windows that are not in a good state of repair.  This affects local authority houses but also the private rental sector.  While we acknowledge there are some good landlords, there also some bad landlords in receipt of substantial amounts of State funding, whether through the rental accommodation scheme, the housing assistance payment or some other form of State assistance.  Carbon tax increased this year and it will continue to increase in the coming years.  This will disproportionately affect people in the situations to which I refer.<\/p><p> Other Deputies and parties have looked for an assessment to be carried out.  When I raised the matter previously with the Minister, she stated that it was not really her responsibility and she kicked it over to Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton.  There must be an onus on the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection to carry out this assessment, however.  I specifically honed in on people in receipt of the fuel allowance.  I take the point Deputy O&rsquo;Dea made.  I am happy to meet him to work on a formula on which we could jointly agree.  Leaving aside the wording, we need this assessment to be carried out.  Otherwise, a &euro;2 carbon tax rise does not take on board the massive rise in fuel costs over the past several years and into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2019112100002#B01600","speaker":"1252","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574294400,"counter":2363,"content":"<p>Carrying out a survey in respect of fuel poverty levels and how carbon tax increases impact on the most vulnerable should not be the Minister's responsibility but that of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  I am on the climate committee and fought hard to get such a study agreed on.  We got it agreed but it never happened.  The committee heard from witnesses from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, which had both carried out such studies.  We did not look hard at the evidence that shows increasing carbon tax actually reduces emissions.  There is much evidence to show that it does not.<\/p> <p>  Apart from that, because that is a kind of climate action issue, measuring fuel poverty by those in receipt of fuel allowance gets it completely wrong.  There is a cohort of people who do not get fuel allowance but who pay an extraordinary amount of money on electricity, gas or coal in order to stay warm because their houses are in poor condition, they are sick or one of their family members is ill.  If one looks at the way it is measured in other countries, all of these factors are taken into account.  They just do not consider someone being in receipt of fuel allowance or the level of social protection payments that applies.  I have met retired workers from RT&Eacute; and the Oireachtas who have been crippled by the increase in carbon tax, despite the fact they have a job pension.  They are cold but cannot afford to make the changes in their lives which this would require.<\/p> <p>  We need to look at a different measure.  If the Minister was willing to take this on board, that would be a start.  Another Department failed in this regard but this is also applicable to this Department.  Like MABS and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, a report would show this is a widespread and deep issue.  Fuel poverty is flying under the radar and will increase because of the actions taken by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2019112100002#C00200","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1574294400,"counter":2364,"content":"<p>On Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's point, is it still the case that the Minister is not responsible for compiling this report?

We cannot bring forward amendments that will result in a cost to the Exchequer.  The only proposal we can push for is reports on the impact of cuts, changes or measures brought forward by the Minister.  This amendment seeks a report on the cost of hearing aids and the adequacy of the financial support in this regard.  In July, the organisation Chime gave a comprehensive statement to the committee on the impact of the cuts imposed as part of the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation, FEMPI.  Some stark statistics came out of this.  We know changes have been made in terms of optical and dental benefits under the treatment benefit scheme.  Hearing aids have not, however.  I am trying to find out the entitlements prior to the changes but it was hard to get those exact figures.<\/p><p>The cuts were made in budget 2009.  There are over 300,000 people with significant hearing loss who need hearing aids.  Only one in five actually have them.  That is a low treatment rate.  If one has a look at those who have access to a medical card, they are twice as likely to have a hearing aid than those who do not.  Not having a hearing aid can have a massive impact on an individual.  There is much evidence to show that it can impact in terms of dementia and other medical issues, as well as social isolation.  This needs to be rectified.  Changes have been made in terms of the dental and optical treatments.  This also needs to change.  Unfortunately, I cannot bring forward an amendment calling on the Minister to reverse this cut.  My hands are tied.  Accordingly, I can only bring forward an amendment calling for reports on treatment benefits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2019112100002#C00800","speaker":"1252"},{"type":"speech","time":1574294400,"counter":2370,"content":"<p>Under the FEMPI legislation introduced by the then Fianna F&aacute;il Government in May 2009, the grant was reduced from what was then &euro;830 to &euro;760 per aid.

We only pay towards the cost.  Digital technology has changed significantly over the past several years around many items.  The price of many items has come down over the years.  A crude example is that this is probably somewhat similar to the price of TVs.  A couple years ago, a 32 inch flat-screen TV would cost &euro;1,000.

The matter has been the subject of a degree of focus and the Minister will be aware I introduced legislation in respect of it.  In advance of the changes being made, there was no consultation or meaningful debate in this institution, while there was little debate outside it.  The UK is the only other country examining increasing the pension age to 68 but it will not make the change until 2046, 18 years after Ireland.  We will increase our pension age to 67 in 2021 and further in 2028.  All the evidence shows that Ireland has nearly 30% fewer older people than other European countries.  Nevertheless, we are pushing ahead faster and further than all our EU counterparts.<\/p><p>In 50 years, Ireland will still have the lowest number of older people, with nearly 20% fewer than other EU countries.  We have always been given the rationale that the State pension age has to increase, while some use the terrible phrase of the ticking time bomb and so on.  The evidence clearly shows that is not factual.  We are nowhere near our European counterparts, yet we are pushing ahead faster and further than them.  In 2017, the committee published a report with cross-party consensus that indicated that further increases in the pension age had to be suspended.  The committee agreed to that, although I am not sure whether the Minister was aware.  It is an anomaly that someone who has to retire at 65 years old will sign on for jobseeker's allowance.  That is not acceptable.  If we increase the age in 2021, will we tell people who retire that they will have to sign on for two years before they can receive their State pensions?  It is an unfair anomaly and a report would be useful in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2019112100002#D00700","speaker":"1252"},{"type":"speech","time":1574294400,"counter":2378,"content":"<p>This is one of the most regressive measures any Government can take.  It is especially harsh on manual workers.  In the case of a bus driver who retires after more than 40 years, as my father did, it is evident that manual workers' lifespan is much shorter than that of white-collar workers or people who do less hands-on or shift work.  Many bus drivers die before they reach 70 years of age.  Now they have been told they will not be able to receive their pensions until they are 68 and that this will cost them &euro;45 per week, according to SIPTU's research.  It is grossly unfair to say to members of the workforce, not least those who have worked in the most demanding jobs, that they will be penalised.  While they may apply to Dublin Bus, for example, to continue for another year if they are healthy enough, they have the right to retire after 40 years' service, and they may find themselves making the choice that they cannot afford to retire because they would be &euro;45 worse off per week.  Moreover, the age level is rising.  The issue has caused riots - near revolutions - in France, Germany and other countries.  We have the highest rate of increases in the retirement age in the entire EU, which is shameful.  Something needs to be done and the report needs to be examined.

Again, the qualifying conditions for recipients of jobseeker's allowance and supplementary welfare allowance for the fuel allowance are unfair.  For example, in order to qualify for the fuel allowance, a person needs to be in receipt of jobseeker's allowance for more than 390 days or 15 months.  For the sake of argument, if a worker becomes unemployed this winter, he or she will not qualify for the fuel allowance either this winter or next winter.  Potentially, he or she could miss out on payments for two winters, whereas someone who became unemployed earlier in the year or during the summer will only miss out on receiving the fuel allowance this winter but will qualify for it next year.  The way the conditions have been set up is unfair, particularly for persons who are very vulnerable.
