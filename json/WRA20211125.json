This will enable more carers with modest incomes to become eligible for the scheme, and those currently in receipt of a reduced payment may now receive a higher payment.<\/p><p>- I am also increasing the capital disregard from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000 for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance.  This will allow carers who have accumulated relatively modest savings, often to provide care for a loved one, without it impacting upon their carer's payment.<\/p><p>- For those with means on Disability Allowance I am increasing the general weekly means disregard from &euro;2.50 to &euro;7.60 which will increase the weekly rate of payment by up to &euro;5 per week, in addition to the general &euro;5 weekly increase in payment rates.<\/p><p>- Currently, Disability Allowance and Blind Pension recipients who are working see the first &euro;140 of weekly earnings fully disregarded, with the remainder between &euro;140 and &euro;350 assessed at 50% and at 100% above &euro;350.  I am raising the limit assessed at 50% to &euro;375.<\/p><p>- The income thresholds for the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance (BSCFA) for two parent households will be applied to lone parents.  This measure will enable a greater number of lone parent households to access the BSCFA which assists families with the costs of returning to school.<\/p><p>- Part of the qualification criteria for Fuel Allowance is a means test.  The amount of means allowed to qualify is the current maximum rate of State Pension (Contributory) applicable to the household size, plus &euro;100.

The Government mandated public health restrictions meant that the hundreds of thousands of employees and self-employed did not have alternative employment options.  Since then the number of PUP recipients has fallen dramatically from a peak of over 600,000 in May 2020 to just over 57,000 this week.  The numbers are continuing to reduce and have fallen by over 3,300 within the last week.<\/p>  <p>  The recent Government announcement does not provide for a re-imposition of business closures and represents a curfew in the night time industry.  Employers are encouraged to avail of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme to retain staff on their payroll at this time.  Other social welfare supports are also available, such as jobseeker's benefit. <\/p>  <p>  The plan to exit from PUP on a graduated basis over time remains in place.

The two main national strategies in this area are the National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS) and the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities (CES).  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth (D\/CEDIY) is the lead department with regards to both the NDIS and the CES.  <\/p><p>Delivery under the CES is underpinned by three-year Action Plans, as agreed by the Comprehensive Employment Strategy Implementation Group (CES-IG).  Currently D\/CEDIY are working with the members of the CES-IG to develop and agree the third (and final) action plan under the CES, for the period 2022-2024.<\/p><p>In addition, there are a number of other strategies that provide a framework for cross-departmental working and the development of services for people with disabilities.  Notably, these include the Roadmap for Social Inclusion (RSI) and Pathways to Work (PtW) strategies. <\/p><p>The Department of Social Protection (DSP) provides a wide range of both income and employment supports to assist jobseekers\/existing employees with disabilities, and employers seeking to hire a jobseeker (or support an existing employee) with a disability.  Improvements have been made to both the income and employment supports available resulting from measures introduced in Budget 2022, as follows:<\/p><p><i>Disability Allowance (DA) and Blind Pension (BP)<\/i><\/p><p>Both DA and BP are structured to support recipients to avail of opportunities to pursue their own employment ambitions, be that self-employment or insurable employment. <\/p><p>When an individual commences employment, they can avail of an income disregard of &euro;140 per week.  In addition, a 50% taper on earnings between &euro;140 and &euro;350 is also applied, i.e., 50% of earnings in this band are disregarded for the purpose of the means test.  Earnings above &euro;350 are assessed at 100%, i.e. for every euro earned above &euro;350 a euro reduction is applied.<\/p><p>Budget 2022 measure: <\/p><p>The following improvements have been announced as part of Budget 2022:<\/p><p>1. An increase of &euro;25 in the earnings threshold above which means is fully assessed, from &euro;350 to &euro;375 per week, for both the Disability Allowance and Blind Pension.<\/p><p>2. An increase in the general weekly means disregard entry point for Disability Allowance from &euro;2.50 to &euro;7.60.  Currently the first &euro;2.50 of weekly means is disregarded for Disability Allowance.  The effect of this measure will be to increase the weekly rate of payment by up to &euro;5.10 per week for DA recipients who have means.  This increase also has the effect of bringing the general weekly disregard for DA in line with that of BP.<\/p><p>These measures take effect from June 2022.<\/p><p><i>Extension of Grants Supporting the Employment of Persons with Disabilities<\/i><\/p><p>The Department provides a wide range of employment-related supports, for jobseekers\/employees with disabilities and employers.  These include delivery of the State&rsquo;s public employment service (PES) - which is delivered through the Departments nationwide network of Intreo centres and by contractors, such as Local Employment (LES) and Employability providers, delivering services on its behalf.<\/p><p>The Department recognises the additional challenges some jobseekers with disabilities may experience in securing and maintaining employment, and so contracts for the provision of &lsquo;EmployAbility&rsquo; services to help address this.  In 2021, the Department contracted with 24 companies for the delivery of EmployAbility services in 31 locations.<\/p><p>Access to these service providers is through referral; a jobseeker, with a disability, who is working with their Intreo Case Officer or LES Mediator may be referred to an EmployAbility service provider if it is agreed that the jobseeker would benefit from the type of services and support provided.  Employability providers deliver a supported employment model of services for jobseekers with disabilities.  Jobseekers work with a job coach who provides both pre-employment and in-employment support and assistance.  Providers also deliver a recruitment and job matching service for employers.<\/p><p>Budget 2022 measure:<\/p><p>Three grants, currently available through Intreo, are to be made available also through Employability providers in the contracts to be entered into, with additional monies having been provided, for 2022.  The three grants are:<\/p><p>1. Workplace Equipment\/Adaptation Grant<\/p><p>Where a person with a disability has been offered employment, is in employment or is self-employed (in the private sector) and requires a more accessible workplace or adapted equipment to do the job, s\/he or the employer can apply for a grant towards the costs of adapting premises or equipment.  A maximum grant of &euro;6,350 is available towards the cost of adaptations to premises or equipment.  Applications in excess of this sum may be considered on an individual basis up to a maximum of &euro;9,523 if specialist training for assistive technology is required.<\/p><p>2. Job Interview Interpreter Grant <\/p><p>A jobseeker who is deaf, hard of hearing or has speech impairment and is attending job interviews in the private sector, may apply for funding to have a sign language interpreter or other interpreter to attend interviews.  A three-hour period for each interview can be funded, the amount of the grant payable is based on an hourly fee which may vary.  A person may have several interviews arranged and can apply for funding for each (there is no limit to the number of interviews a person can attend with an interpreter).  Funding is also available to cover the cost of an interpreter to assist a person during the induction process, when he\/she starts work with a private sector employer.  A maximum of three hours interpreter support is available, to be utilised by the person as he\/she feels is needed.  Both the interview interpreter funding and in-employment interpreter support funding, for induction, can be provided.  In addition, the grant can also be used to cover travel costs for the interpreter &ndash; the cost of public transport or, if not available, a set rate per kilometre is applied. <\/p><p>3. Personal Reader Grant <\/p><p>A person employed in the private sector who is (or is becoming) blind or visually impaired, and who needs assistance with job-related reading, can apply for a grant to support them to employ a personal reader.  The amount of the grant payable is based on an hourly fee paid to the reader, in line with the current minimum wage, for an agreed period - for a maximum of 640 hours per year. <\/p><p>Wage Subsidy Scheme<\/p><p>The Wage Subsidy Scheme is targeted at private sector employers and is aimed at encouraging the employment of people with disabilities through the provision of financial incentives (a wage subsidy).  The subsidy is delivered in three strands:<\/p><p>Strand I subsidy is a general subsidy for any productivity shortfall in excess of 20% for a person with a disability, in comparison to a colleague without a disability.  The rate of subsidy is &euro;5.30 per hour and the amount of the subsidy is based on the number of hours worked.<\/p><p>Strand II subsidy is payable when an employer employs three or more people with a disability who are supported by a WSS Strand I payment.  Strand II is intended to cover the additional supervisory, management and other work-based costs relating to these employees.  This top-up payment is a percentage of the Strand I subsidy and is based on the overall number of employees with a disability employed under Strand I.  It ranges from an additional 10% of wage subsidy for 3 to 6 employees with a disability to a maximum of 50% of wage subsidy for 23+ employees with a disability. <\/p><p>Strand III subsidy enables employers who employ 25 or more workers with a disability on the Wage Subsidy Scheme to be eligible for a grant of up to &euro;30,000 per year towards the expense of employing an Employment Assistance Officer to support these employees.<\/p><p>Budget 2022 measure: <\/p><p>The WSS base subsidy paid to employers, who employ people with a disability, will increase from &euro;5.30 to &euro;6.30 per hour from January 2022. The new rate is a substantial contribution to the employer&rsquo;s wage costs.

While the vast majority of those displaced have already returned to work since the easing of public health restrictions earlier this year, I am acutely conscious that many individuals still in receipt of State income supports will require assistance to return to employment, to reskill and to find new jobs.  It is vital we provide these services so as to ensure that the labour market scarring effects on those workers displaced by COVID-19 is minimised. <\/p>  <p>  It was with this core objective in mind that Government published its new employment services strategy, &lsquo;Pathways to Work 2021 &ndash; 2025&rsquo;, in July.  This strategy, which represents Government&rsquo;s overall framework for activation and employment support policy, aims to assist those whose jobs have been lost due to COVID-19 to return to the workforce, along with those who were unemployed prior to the pandemic and those facing higher barriers to employment.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the Pathways to Work strategy, my Department has enhanced the developmental capacity of the services it provides to jobseekers. <\/p>  <p>  For example, the strategy commits to assign 150 Job Coaches to expand the capacity of the Public Employment Service and Intreo Centres.  These Job Coaches, 98 of whom are currently in place, will undertake 1-to-1 interviews with jobseekers and advise them on the range of employment options and supports available, taking their specific needs and circumstances into account.  Coaches may also refer jobseekers for other interventions such as education \/ training where appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the tailored advice and referrals provided by Coaches, &lsquo;Pathways to Work&rsquo; takes a number of steps to offer jobseekers opportunities for upskilling and reskilling in order to facilitate their transition into employment in new sectors (or occupations).  This is particularly the case where there is restricted demand for labour in those sectors in which individuals had previously worked.<\/p>  <p>  The developmental supports offered by my Department under Pathways to Work include, but are not limited to:<\/p>  <p>  - A new paid Work Placement Experience Programme (WPEP), which is a 6 month, 30 hour per week voluntary work experience programme, to provide 10,000 unemployed people with the opportunity to build valuable on-the-job experience by the end of 2022.  The programme, which encompasses an accredited training and mentoring element, is designed to further enhance the potential of participants for progression and to help them re-engage with the job market.<\/p>  <p>  - Increased funding for the Back to Education scheme which leads to second and third level qualifications, with a target of increasing participation in education programmes to 7,700.  <\/p>  <p>  - Funding 50,000 additional places in further and higher education, including via Skills to Compete, Skillnet Ireland, Springboard+ and the Human Capital Initiative.<\/p>  <p>  - Support for 50,000 long-term unemployed people to commence in Further Education and Training provision by 2025.<\/p>  <p>  - An increase in the total number of new apprentice registrations to at least 10,000 per annum by 2025, in line with a commitment in the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025.<\/p>  <p>  - An increase in the maximum value of the Training Support Grant available via Intreo from &euro;500 to &euro;1,000 to help over 12,500 jobseekers per annum access relevant and accredited training programmes.<\/p>  <p>  - The provision of an extra 3,000 places on State Employment Schemes, including Community Employment, to support long term unemployed people, and those facing the greatest barriers in the labour market, get back to work. <\/p>  <p>  While the Strategy is still in its early stages of implementation, by delivering on the commitments set out in Pathways to Work, and by further enhancing the developmental capacity of the services provided by my Department and Intreo, it is our ambition to ensure that workers displaced by COVID-19 will have the supports they need to re-enter the workforce.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500072#WRB04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Eligibility","counter":129,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500072#WRB04800"},{"type":"question","counter":130,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[57934\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500072#WRB04900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she will consider reviewing the fact that those in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment and illness benefit are ineligible for fuel allowance; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1520","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":131,"content":"<p>The Fuel Allowance is a payment of &euro;33.00 per week for 28 weeks (a total of &euro;924 each year) from October to April, to 369,000 low income households, at an estimated cost of &euro;300 million in 2021.

There is not a single typical &lsquo;cost of disability&rsquo;, rather there is a spectrum from low additional costs to extremely high extra costs of disability, depending on the individual circumstances of the person with a disability.  Additional costs of disability go across a number of areas of expenditure including housing; equipment, aids and appliances; mobility, transport and communications; medicines; care and assistance services and additional living expenses.<\/p>  <p>  The report has been received and my Department has been considering it in detail.

The Commission was an independent body comprised of knowledgeable and experienced academics, pension experts, members of civil society and representatives of workers and employers.  The Commission has completed its work and its report was published on 7th October 2021.  The Commission's Report, its Technical Sub-Committee's working papers, and submissions made to the Commission are available on the Commission&rsquo;s website, pensionscommission.gov.ie.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission&rsquo;s Report is a comprehensive report that takes account of an assessment of various analyses of population, labour force and expenditure projections; an examination of international approaches; and responses to an extensive consultation process.  It has unambiguously established that the current State Pension system is not sustainable into the future and that changes are needed, and it has set out a wide range of recommendations in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The report has been referred to the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands and to the Commission for Taxation and Welfare for their views.  I understand that both the Chair of the Commission, Ms. Josephine Feehily and the Chair of its Technical Sub-Committee, Ms. Roma Burke met with the Joint Committee on 17th November 2021.  Officials from my Department also attended this meeting. <\/p>  <p>  In the interests both of older people and of future generations of older people, the Government intends to consider the comprehensive and far reaching recommendations in the Commission&rsquo;s Report very carefully and holistically.  My officials will work over the coming months to examine each of the recommendations.  They will consult across Government through the Cabinet Committee system.  I think it is really important that we complete that work before reaching conclusions.  I intend to bring a recommended response and implementation plan to Government by the end of March 2022.  <\/p>  <p>  The State Pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  It is extremely effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.  This Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case for current pensioners, those nearing State Pension age and today&rsquo;s young workers including those who are only starting their careers. <\/p>  <p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500073#WRC01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Procurement Contracts","counter":151,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500073#WRC01600"},{"type":"question","counter":152,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[58002\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500073#WRC01700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the strategy for the procurement of public employment services; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1602","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":153,"content":"<p>The current procurement of public employment services follows extensive consultations by my Department with the existing service providers and employee representatives over the last number of years.

The family home is never assessed as part of the means test, regardless of who is the legal owner. <\/p>  <p>  Both DA and BP are structured to support recipients to avail of opportunities to pursue their own employment ambitions, be that self-employment or insurable employment. <\/p>  <p>  When an individual commences employment, they can avail of an income disregard of &euro;140 per week.  In addition, a 50% taper on earnings between &euro;140 and &euro;350 is also applied, i.e., 50% of earnings in this band are disregarded for the purpose of the means test. Earnings above &euro;350 are assessed at 100% i.e. for every euro earned above &euro;350 a euro reduction is applied.<\/p>  <p>  Income is assessed on an annual basis, and then divided by 52 to ascertain a person&rsquo;s weekly means.  The means assessment is intended to reflect the income the person may reasonably be expected to receive during the coming 12 months.  Where this is not ascertainable otherwise, the income for the last 12 months can be taken as a guide, allowing for any factors which it is known will vary.  Assessing a person&rsquo;s income in this manner takes account of the fact that some people&rsquo;s income is irregular, and they will earn more during some periods than others. <\/p>  <p>  The conditions attached to payment of Disability Allowance and Blind Pension are consistent with the overall conditions that apply to social assistance payments generally.  This system of social assistance supports provides payments based on an income need with the means test playing the critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; be that illness, disability, unemployment or caring.  <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that measures introduced, in Budget 2022, will see increases to the above as follows:<\/p>  <p>  1. An increase in the earnings threshold above which means is fully assessed - of &euro;25, from &euro;350 to &euro;375 per week - for both the Disability Allowance and Blind Pension.<\/p>  <p>  2. An increase in the general weekly means disregard entry point for Disability Allowance from &euro;2.50 to &euro;7.60.  Currently the first &euro;2.50 of weekly means is disregarded for Disability Allowance.  The effect of this measure will be to increase the weekly rate of payment by up to &euro;5.10 per week for DA recipients who have means.  This increase also has the effect of bringing the general weekly disregard for DA in line with that of BP.<\/p>  <p>  These measures take effect from June 2022.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above, the Department also provides the Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) scheme for those whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependents.  This scheme includes Exceptional Needs Payments, Urgent Needs Payments and SWA Supplements (heat, travel and dietary supplements).  These means tested payments may be made to help meet essential expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income.  <\/p>  <p>  The Department regularly reviews its supports and payments schemes to ensure that they continue to meet their objectives, while any proposed changes have to be considered in an overall policy and budgetary context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500074#WRD00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":188,"content":"<p>Question No. 73 answered with Question No. 56.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":190,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[57598\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500074#WRD00700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the specific social protection measures that will be funded in 2022 from the increase in the rate of carbon tax; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1594","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":191,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government is committed to ensuring that increases in the carbon tax will be progressive.  This means protecting the most vulnerable in society from the impacts of the tax.  In 2020; the ESRI examined the options available to offset the impacts of a carbon tax increase on low income households. <\/p>  <p>  In light of this research, the Government has committed to very significant increases in a targeted package of social protection supports in Budget 2022, which will offset the impact of the increased carbon tax on low income households. <\/p>  <p>  The specific measures are: <\/p>  <p>  - An increase to the Qualified Child Payment of &euro;2 per week for children under 12 and &euro;3 per week for children aged 12 and over;<\/p>  <p>  - An increase in the Living Alone Allowance of &euro;3 per week. People living alone are often the elderly or people suffering from a disability who are at higher risk of poverty.  These groups are also likely to have higher energy needs than other households;<\/p>  <p>  - An increase to the Fuel Allowance of &euro;5 per week.  This will compensate a broad range of lower income households for the additional energy costs they are likely to incur, due to an increase in the carbon tax.  This measure will be combined with a broadening of the threshold for Fuel Allowance eligibility and an increase in the income allowed for the means test that is applied to applicants.  The increase in the rate of payment was effective from Budget week.<\/p>  <p>  - An increase in the income threshold for the Working Family Payment of &euro;10 per week.

The Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025, launched by my colleague, Minister Harris earlier this year, includes a bursary support scheme to be established for participants from disadvantaged groups, including lone parents, people with disabilities, Travellers and Roma.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that there are also specific employment supports in place for people with disabilities such as the EmployAbility service, the reasonable accommodation fund for employers which can provide workplace adaptation and employee retention grants, and the wage subsidy scheme among others. <\/p>  <p>  The above initiatives also build on the measures that are already in place in my Department, such as earnings disregards in means assessments for the one-parent family payment and disability allowance schemes.<\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500074#WRD04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":224,"content":"<p>Question No. 89 answered with Question No. 28.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cybersecurity Policy","counter":225,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500074#WRD04200"},{"type":"question","counter":226,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[57134\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500074#WRD04300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the measures in place regarding cybersecurity, including the mywelfare.ie platform at her Department, given the substantial number of customers her Department has and the increasing provision of online services; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1562","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":227,"content":"<p>My Department is a major user of Information Technology for the provision of customer services.

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance under the Household Benefits scheme at an estimated cost of &euro;195 million in 2021.   <\/p>  <p>  The Government values the role of carers very much and it is for this reason that they receive significant income supports from my Department.  In addition to Carer&rsquo;s Allowance or Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, carers receive additional support in the form of Free Travel and Household Benefits (for those who live with the person for whom they care) and the annual Carer's Support Grant in respect of each person for whom they care.   <\/p>  <p>  Since 2013, the payment of half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance does not preclude a person from qualifying for Fuel Allowance.  If a person is in receipt of a qualifying non-contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance then they are deemed to have satisfied the means test and Fuel Allowance is payable subject to all remaining criteria being satisfied.  If a person is in receipt of a qualifying contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, then the value of the half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance will be assessed in the means test for Fuel Allowance.  <\/p>  <p>  Following the announced &euro;20 increase in allowable means in Budget 2022, a fuel applicant and members of his\/her household may have a combined assessable income of up to &euro;120 a week above the appropriate rate of State Pension Contributory and qualify for a payment.

It is important to note that entitlement to these supports is generally not contingent on the nature of the illness or disability but on the extent to which a particular illness or disability impairs or restricts a person&rsquo;s capacity to work.  This Department spent a total of &euro;4.7 billion on illness, disability and caring payments in 2020. <\/p>  <p>  In March of last year, under the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 (No. 1) and subsequent regulations, the Government provided for entitlement to Illness Benefit for persons who have been diagnosed with Covid-19 or are a probable source of infection with Covid-19. <\/p>  <p>  The rate of payment of this enhanced Illness Benefit payment in respect of Covid-19 is higher than the normal maximum personal rate for a limited period.  This enhanced benefit is payable for 2 weeks where a person is isolating as a probable source of infection of Covid-19 and up to 10 weeks where a person has been diagnosed with Covid-19.  <\/p>  <p>  The measures were designed to ensure that where a registered medical practitioner or a HSE medical officer diagnoses a person with Covid-19 or identifies them as a probable source of infection of Covid-19, the person can comply with medical advice to isolate, while having their income protected.

As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Statistics Office's latest release on Recorded Crime Detection, published earlier this month, identifies the percentage of crimes recorded by Garda&iacute; in 2020 that had been deemed &lsquo;detected&rsquo; by 2 September 2021. A crime is considered detected when a suspected offender has been identified and sanctioned for the crime.<\/p>  <p>  The figures provide a sound baseline on which to measure policing performance going forward. As we all know, during 2020 the public health crisis continued to influence the needs of our communities, and this resulted in a change in the demands on policing. Crime types are increasingly more complex and can require resource-intensive investigations, but throughout 2020 the Commissioner and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remained committed to protecting people from harm in public, private and virtual spaces.<\/p>  <p>  The release provides an overview of the crimes reported to Garda&iacute; and the figures show  considerable variations in the proportions of the different types of crime incidents which were detected.<\/p>  <p>  Garda&iacute; are achieving significant successes in a range of crime categories and should be commended for their efforts. In comparison to the detection rates for crimes committed in 2019 at this stage after their occurrence, there have been welcome increases in detection rates in 2020 for a number of offence groups, including homicide offences at 82.1% (up over 16 percentage points on 2019 incidents at this time last year), attempts or threats to murder, assaults, harassment and related offences at 37.7% (up over 4 percentage points), burglary at 22.4% (up over 7 percentage points) and theft at 36.2% (up over 3 percentage points), as well as public order offences at 86.4% (up over 2 percentage points).<\/p>  <p>  However, there were markedly lower detection rates for sexual offences.  The 2020 figures reflect a rate of one in ten crimes detected to date (10.3%). <\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the updated figures for 2019 suggests that there is an increase in detection for sexual offences over a longer period following reporting of the crime, with the percentage of detection of such offences recorded in 2019 increasing from 12% in September 2020, to over 20% by September 2021. This reflects the fact that sexual offence cases can be more complex and take more time to go through the Court system. <\/p>  <p>  Reforming our criminal justice system to make sure victims feel confident and secure in reporting these crimes, that Garda&iacute; have the tools to pursue perpetrators, and that the Courts deal with these cases as quickly as possible, is a top priority for me as Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500076#WRF02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"question","counter":307,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[57994\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500076#WRF02800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of incidents of drink spiking reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Cork city and county in recent months; the number of incidents reported nationally; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1521","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":308,"content":"<p>Spiking a person&rsquo;s drink or spiking someone by injection are obviously very serious offences.

As Minister, I play no role in these independent functions.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that identifying incidents which involve drink spiking for statistical purposes is dependent on the use of keywords in the incident narrative. I am further advised that a search was carried out on the PULSE system for incidents reported between 1 January 2021 and 21 November 2021 which include any of the following terms in the narrative or investigation notes: &ldquo;spike&rdquo;, &ldquo;spiking&rdquo; or &ldquo;date rape&rdquo;.  <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that this search indicates that, as of 21 November 2021, there have been 46 crime incidents recorded nationally this year. 25 of these incidents specifically refer to syringes or needles.

Fewer than 10 of these incidents relates to incidents of drink spiking recorded in the Garda Divisions of Cork City, Cork North and Cork West. As the Deputy may be aware, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service does not typically report on details where there are fewer than 10 incidents in a given period, as there is a risk, due to the sensitive nature of the information, that offenders or victims may be identified if the information were to be released.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that figures are operational and liable to change and are based on a reported date using data obtained from PULSE. <\/p>  <p>  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 has been widely recognised as a landmark piece of legislation dealing with consent and exploitation in sexual activity. For the first time, it set out in statute what consent actually means - a free and voluntary agreement between people to engage in sexual activity.<\/p>  <p>  The 2017 Act amended the Criminal Law (Rape) Amendment Act 1990, to set out certain circumstances where consent is impossible, such as when a person is asleep or unconscious, or if they are so drunk or intoxicated that they are in no position to consider the activity and make up their mind.<\/p>  <p>  The commitment of this Government to combatting domestic, sexual and gender based violence and to supporting victims is reflected in the funding allocated under Budget 2022, with a total of &euro;13m allocated to the Department of Justice in this area. This represents an increased allocation of &euro;5.35m and will enable the roll out of specific awareness raising and training programmes to combat domestic, sexual and gender based violence. It will also provide additional supports to NGOs and specific domestic violence intervention programmes, and it will support a number of front-line activities.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be interested to note that a national public awareness campaign, led by my Department, around the meaning and understanding of consent in the context of sexual relationships will be launched in the new year. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500076#WRF02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Closed-Circuit Television Systems","counter":309,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500076#WRF03000"},{"type":"question","counter":310,"qnumday":133,"qnumall":"[58038\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500076#WRF03100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans for the expansion of Garda CCTV in County Carlow in order to deter criminal activity; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1511","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":311,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for managing and controlling generally the administration, budget and business of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which includes responsibility for Garda CCTV.

I am further informed that, while there are no plans at this time to expand the current Garda CCTV schemes, the schemes are being reviewed by the Garda National Community Engagement Bureau (GNCEB).<\/p>  <p>  In addition to schemes operated by the Garda&iacute;, section 38 (c) provides for community CCTV schemes in collaboration between local authorities\/community groups and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

A number of actions have been taken to maximise processing capability.

Since its inception, the Bureau has been at the forefront of fighting organised crime in this jurisdiction &ndash; disrupting the activities of criminal gangs through the removal of their ill-gotten gains - and has been recognised as a world leader in asset investigations, tracing and forfeiture. <\/p>  <p>  The Bureau works closely with Garda&iacute; and all law enforcement agencies at national and international levels and continues to focus its efforts on targeting assets deriving from all types of criminal conduct. The Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2005 makes provision for the Bureau to seize assets that were generated in foreign jurisdictions. This Act enables the Bureau to cooperate fully with other international asset recovery agencies.<\/p>  <p>  In summary, there must be an &ldquo;asset&rdquo; and there must be &ldquo;evidence of criminal conduct&rdquo; for the Bureau to commence an investigation and take action pursuant to the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996, as amended.<\/p>  <p>  In saying this, if a criminal is showing signs of wealth\/living beyond their means, the Bureau can commence an investigation and action may be taken under the Revenue Acts and\/or Social Welfare Acts, in the absence of assets. The Bureau utilises the Garda Divisional Assets Profiler network to identify criminals who show signs of wealth and who appear to be living beyond their legitimate means. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that CAB recently published their annual report for 2020. Some of the notable recent actions in 2020 include in excess of &euro;4.2 million being returned to the Exchequer and thirty-one new proceeds of crime applications brought before the High Court. During 2020, a total of forty five individuals and corporate entities were assessed under the provisions of the Tax Acts, resulting in a total tax figure of &euro;10.447m.<\/p>  <p>  The Bureau serves to make Ireland a more hostile environment for the generation of proceeds of crime and sends a strong message to criminals and to local communities that profiting from crime will simply not be tolerated. In doing so, the Bureau targets lower to middle tier criminals, in addition to Organised Crime Groups.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, CAB is accounted for in the Justice Vote.

The dedicated Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau is now led by a Detective Chief Superintendent.

Both the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Cyber Crime Bureau continue to engage with telecommunications service providers regarding online scams and the identification of the persons involved in them. <\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to note that Cyber Satellite hubs have also recently been established in Cork, Galway, Mullingar and Wexford. These hubs are engaged in cybercrime forensics, investigations and support roles.<\/p>  <p>  Combatting and preventing fraud and related cybercrime falls under the remit of several Departments and Agencies.

This campaign involved Community Garda&iacute; and Crime Prevention Officers around the country providing information to local communities on how to avoid falling victim to such scams. This included local information events, as well as the normal engagement Garda&iacute; have with their communities. There were also dedicated radio advertisements broadcast nationally as part of the campaign.<\/p>  <p>  Cooperation with our EU and international partners remains a key part of Ireland's response to cybercrime and online scams. Ireland is also committed to ratifying the Council of Europe Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, the first binding international treaty on cybercrime, when the necessary legislative requirements have been fulfilled. My Department is currently drafting a general scheme of a Cybercrime Bill which will give effect to those provisions of the Budapest Convention not already provided for in Irish law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500076#WRF05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Personal Injury Claims","counter":331,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500076#WRF05200"},{"type":"question","counter":332,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[57917\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500076#WRF05300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will report on the operation of the personal injuries guidelines under the Judicial Council Act 2019; if she will consider legislative changes to monitor the passing on of benefits to consumers; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1462","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":333,"content":"<p>I am very much aware of the difficulties faced by many small businesses and consumers in relation to the cost and availability of insurance.

Work is ongoing on drafting of the Bill while we await pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill, with a view to its publication by the end of February 2022. In parallel, the Family Justice Oversight Group are working to develop a new family justice system.<\/p>  <p>  We have also published the General Scheme of the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill which will replace the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board with a new Commission, and established a Judicial Planning Working Group to work on judicial numbers over the medium term. <\/p>  <p>  On the issue of gambling reform, we recently published the General Scheme of the Gambling Regulation Bill, bringing us closer to the establishment of a Gambling Regulator. The Gaming and Lotteries (Amendment) Act 2019 also came into effect in December 2020.<\/p>  <p>  We have introduced strong measures to tackle the cost of insurance, including bringing into operation new personal injuries guidelines and enacting the Perjury Bill to establish a statutory criminal offence for perjury.<\/p>  <p>  Strengthening the safety of all communities is a cross-Government priority and we have established three pilots of Local Community Safety Partnerships (in Dublin&rsquo;s North Inner City, Longford and Waterford) which will inform the roll-out of the new Community Safety model nationwide. We have also published an implementation plan and established an implementation board to deliver on the recommendations of the Drogheda Scoping Report, which outlines 70 actions to improve community safety and wellbeing in Drogheda through greater co-operation by State agencies and others.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will know, we are making strides in providing greater supports to victims of crime, and combating domestic, sexual and gender based violence and have published and begun to implement Supporting a Victim&rsquo;s Journey, our plan to implement the recommendations of the O&rsquo;Malley Review.  <\/p>  <p>  We have published plans for a revised National Referral Mechanism for victims of human trafficking, recognising the role of other state bodies and NGOs in addition to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in identifying and referring victims, and we are drafting legislation to put this on a statutory footing. We have also put in place additional practical supports for victims including a cultural mediator project and additional grant supports for victims, and published the Smuggling of Persons Bill.<\/p>  <p>  We have enacted Coco&rsquo;s Law, the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act. We have recently published draft legislation to strengthen the post-release monitoring and management of sex offenders. We have also secured Government approval to reform the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme and are now working on legislation to place a new scheme on a statutory footing. In addition, we have established the new statutory parole board and commenced the parole act, which increases the time those serving life sentences must serve from 7 years to 12 years before they are eligible to be considered for parole.<\/p>  <p>  To support young people and divert them away from crime, a new Youth Justice Strategy 2021-2027 was launched and is being implemented; we have established an Anti-Social Behaviour Forum to bring forward proposals to tackle the issue of anti-social behaviour (including subgroups examining the misuse of scramblers and quadbikes, and knife crime) and have published the General Scheme of the Criminal Justice (Exploitation of Children in the Commission of Offences) Bill.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of developments in the immigration area, an end-to-end review of relevant international protection processes by a multi-disciplinary team from my Department has now been completed and published. We have announced draft proposals for a scheme to regularise thousands of undocumented migrants in Ireland and introduced a temporary system to enable citizenship applicants to complete their naturalisation process by signing a statutory declaration of loyalty.<\/p>  <p>  Of course it is important to note that all the above mentioned milestones and achievements are just a snapshot of the substantial programme of work being delivered on by my Department. We continue to work with our agencies and partners across the sector to receive feedback and ensure that the targets set out in the Plan are met. Justice Plan 2021 is the first in a series of annual action plans to actualise my priorities as Minister and deliver on the Department&rsquo;s strategic goals. <\/p>  <p>  In August, my Department published a mid-year report outlining the progress on Justice Plan 2021 which is available at:<\/p>  <p>  www.justice.ie\/en\/JELR\/Justice-Plan-2021-Mid-Year-Progress-Report.pdf\/Files\/Justice-Plan-2021-Mid-Year-Progress-Report.pdf<\/p>  <p>  I look forward to publishing an end of year progress report on Justice Plan 2021 in early 2022. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500077#WRG02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Policy","counter":356,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500077#WRG02300"},{"type":"question","counter":357,"qnumday":149,"qnumall":"[57951\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500077#WRG02400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will report on progress on a scheme to regularise undocumented persons; if she will consider time while documented as reckonable time to be eligible for the scheme; if the scheme will be subject to ministerial discretion for regularisation of individual applications or be given as a right if criteria are met; if time while undocumented counts towards reckonable time for citizenship applications; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1522","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":358,"content":"<p>The Government committed to introducing new pathways to status regularisation within 18 months of its formation.

The programme, which was developed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in partnership with the National Family Support Network (NFSN), responds to the needs of people who use drugs and family members who may be subject to the threat of drug related intimidation and has been implemented on a national level since 2013. <\/p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regard drug-related intimidation as a hugely serious issue which impacts significantly on communities throughout Ireland.

Insofar as possible, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na offers confidentiality and provides practical personal security and safety information and advice in relation to particular threats or instances of intimidation, along with information on appropriate drug support services for the individual in the family who is accruing drug debts, while also providing information regarding the process involved in making a formal complaint.  <\/p><p>The Deputy will also be aware of the new Youth Justice Strategy 2021-2027. This strategy includes a commitment to develop the work of the Youth Diversion Projects (YDPs) to include targeted work with &lsquo;harder-to-reach&rsquo; young people. This includes young people heavily involved in crime and anti-social behaviour, for whom there are little supports and interventions available in practice, unless they are before the courts, in which case they may be under the supervision of the Probation Service. The strategy also prioritises early intervention work, including with younger children who are assessed as being at serious risk. Both of these cohorts may include children at risk of recruitment by crime gangs.<\/p><p>The development of this work within the YDP network will be supported by the Research Evidence into Policy, Programmes and Practice (REPPP) project at the School of Law in the University of Limerick (UL). The REPPP project has also led on the production of the &ldquo;Greentown Report&rdquo;, which studied the influence of criminal networks on children in Ireland, and was published in December 2016. The REPPP project is a strategic research partnership between UL and the Department of Justice.<\/p><p>The Greentown Report identifies crime networks as a separate and plausible risk factor underlying criminal offending by certain children. It outlines how the influence of criminal networks increases the level of offending by a small number of children and entraps them in offending situations. <\/p><p>The Greentown Report recommended the design of a programme to include interventions with children and their families to help them withstand the influence of criminal networks. The REPPP project team implemented a bespoke process to produce a model for an Irish evidence-informed intervention programme. This pilot has been designed with the input of leading international expertise on crime and criminal networks, together with Irish scientific, policy and practice expertise in child protection and welfare, drugs and community development. The programme is managed jointly between my Department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the University of Limerick.<\/p><p>The pilot applications of the Greentown programme, developed by the REPPP project, commenced in two locations in 2020 and will run for three years. The learning from these pilots will then be incorporated into mainstream YDP practice. This specially designed intervention programme was developed with international expert advice to tackle coercive control of children by criminal groups which entraps them in offending situations. Funds are already available for the initial pilots from the Dormant Accounts Funds, with a total of &euro;4.2m allocated over three years. <\/p><p>The implementation of the Greentown pilot programme is part of the strategic objectives of the Youth Justice Strategy 2021-2027. This implementation process began with the establishment of the Governance and Strategy Group, and the Youth Justice Oversight Group. Both groups are chaired by my Department, which will provide oversight arrangements for youth justice initiatives, including the Greentown pilots, to ensure that there is a cohesive response in practice to the needs of particular cohorts of children and particular communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500077#WRG04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domestic Violence","counter":374,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500077#WRG04100"},{"type":"question","counter":375,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[57738\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500077#WRG04200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her views on the introduction of new criminal legislation to tackle domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.","asker":"1566","askee":"1502"},{"type":"question","counter":376,"qnumday":164,"qnumall":"[57821\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500077#WRG04300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her views on the introduction of new criminal legislation to tackle domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.","asker":"1510","askee":"1502"},{"type":"question","counter":377,"qnumday":171,"qnumall":"[57790\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500077#WRG04400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her views on the introduction of new criminal legislation to tackle domestic, sexual and gender-based violence; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1523","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":378,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 155, 164 and 171 together.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputies will be aware, the Government has considerably strengthened the law and structures which target domestic violence, as part of the second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2016-2021.  <\/p>  <p>  Central to this is the landmark Domestic Violence Act 2018 which came into force on 1 January 2019 and which, among other things, introduced the offence of coercive control. Putting the offence of coercive control on a statutory footing was an important step in recognising the effect of non-violent control in an intimate relationship.  <\/p>  <p>  The introduction of these measures also supported Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the Istanbul Convention, the Council of Europe Convention on the prevention and combating of violence against women and domestic violence. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputies will be aware, domestic violence covers a broad spectrum of behaviours ranging from non-physical behaviour such as harassment, to physical behaviour such as assault and sexual violence such as rape. Violence in a domestic setting is a criminal offence and such behaviour is provided for in the Non-Fatal Offences against the Persons Act 1997. Sexual violence is also a criminal offence, as is intimidating behaviour such as threats to kill or cause serious harm. <\/p>  <p>  Another important provision contained in the Domestic Violence Act 2018 allows an intimate relationship between a victim and perpetrator to be regarded as an aggravating factor in sentencing for a wide range of offences, including those under the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act. <\/p>  <p>  Our laws in supporting victims of domestic and sexual crimes have also been significantly strengthened by the enactment of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 which introduced a statutory definition of consent. In addition, The Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017, provides for a wide range of measures and services to protect and inform victims during the progress of their case through the criminal justice system. <\/p>  <p>  In February of this year, the Oireachtas enacted Coco&rsquo;s Law, or the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act. This legislation creates two new offences which criminalise the sharing or threat to share intimate images without consent. Threatening to share intimate images is often employed as a form of coercive control in relationships and this legislation ensures we now have appropriate punitive measures in place to challenge such behaviour. <\/p>  <p>  I can also inform the Deputies that a scoping exercise for a new Sexual Offences Bill has been completed and work has started on drafting the Heads of a General Scheme of a Sexual Offences Bill. This is on foot of recommendations contained in the O'Malley Review to examine what reforms might be introduced to protect victims of sexual violence during the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences. <\/p>  <p>  Earlier this month I announced planned new legislation to strengthen the management and monitoring of sex offenders in the community. The Sex Offenders (Amendment) Bill 2021 includes a number of amendments to the sex offenders register notification requirements, including a prohibition on convicted sex offenders engaging in certain forms of employment. <\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputies that my Department keeps all legislation under review on an ongoing basis. <\/p>  <p>  Lastly, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is continuously improving its specialist services in this area, to respond effectively to the needs of victims. Divisional Protective Services Units  with specifically and specially trained officers responsible for investigations, including engagement with victims, have been rolled out nationwide. They support the delivery of a consistent and professional approach to the investigation of sexual and domestic crime. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500077#WRG04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Court Accommodation","counter":379,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500077#WRG04600"},{"type":"question","counter":380,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[57736\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500077#WRG04700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of plans to build a new county town-type courthouse in Bray, County Wicklow; the progress made to transfer the vacant former courthouse on Boghall Road, Bray; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1625","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":381,"content":"<p>Under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts, including the provision of accommodation for court sittings, is the responsibility of the Courts Service which is independent in the performance of its functions.<\/p>  <p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has provided me with the following update. <\/p>  <p>  The Government's revised National Development Plan 2021 -2030 includes a number of Courts Service capital building projects to be completed during the period of the plan including the Hammond Lane Family Law complex and the provision of further new or refurbished courthouses in cities and county towns where facilities remain sub-standard, including in Bray. <\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Courts Service that the priority project for the period up to 2025 is the proposed new Family Law complex in Hammond Lane.

The legislation is an important step in the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the agreed measures to address the legacy of the troubles on the island of Ireland and to support the victims of the conflict and their families. In addition to enhancing the co-operation being provided to ongoing Coroners&rsquo; Inquests in Northern Ireland into historical deaths, the legislation further underpins the Government&rsquo;s commitment to full co-operation with the framework of measures set out in the Stormont House Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  Also, in September 2015, the Government signed an International Agreement with the British Government on the establishment of the Independent Commission for Information Retrieval (ICIR).  The ICIR will be a cross-border institution which will be established to receive information on troubles-related deaths and to prepare a report on the circumstances of the death for the families of the victims.  The development of proposals for legislation to establish the ICIR in this jurisdiction is being progressed, but the ICIR will require legislation to be enacted in both jurisdictions with parallel provisions in order for it to come into effect, which is presenting a particular difficulty at the current time.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, efforts to advance the Stormont House Agreement legacy provisions have been affected by the political stalemate in Northern Ireland which lasted until January of last year and by the UK Government&rsquo;s recent command paper on legacy published in July which represents a radical departure from the Stormont House Agreement. <\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, this Government remains committed to the Stormont House framework as the way forward on legacy issues, and where the British Government are proposing significant changes to the framework, we have made clear that these must be discussed and agreed by both Governments and the parties to the Northern Ireland Executive.

However, there are a number of related legislation projects being progressed in my Department including the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Powers) Bill which will streamline and strengthen Garda powers generally and the Criminal Justice (Exploitation of Children in the Commission of Offences) Bill, which will outlaw the grooming of children into crime.  <\/p>  <p>  In June 2021 the Government approved the general scheme of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Powers) Bill. In line with a recommendation of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, the Bill will provide a clear and transparent statutory basis for the existing police powers of search, arrest and detention, supported by statutory codes of practice. As well as bringing together and streamlining the existing powers, the Bill will also strengthen them in some respects. <\/p>  <p>  In January 2021 I published the general scheme of the Criminal Justice (Exploitation of Children in the Commission of Offences) Bill. The Bill will, for the first time, create specific offences where an adult compels, coerces, induces or invites a child to engage in criminal activity, including drug related crime.  While current law already provides that an adult who causes or uses a child to commit a crime can be charged and convicted as the principal offender &ndash; meaning they can be punished as though they committed the crime themselves &ndash; it does not recognise the harm done to a child by drawing them into a world of criminality.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na tackles organised criminal activity through a range of targeted measures designed to disrupt and dismantle the operations of criminal organisations. Specialist units involved in tackling organised crime, including the Armed Support Unit, the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GNDOCB), the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, and the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB), are enjoying continuing significant success in disrupting drug trafficking and the supply of illicit drugs by organised crime groups.<\/p>  <p>  The work of the GNDOCB is supported by Divisional Drugs Units, which tackle drug-related crime on a local basis throughout the country, in collaboration with other law enforcement partners and all Garda&iacute; working in local communities. Divisional Drug Units are now established in every Garda Division. In 2020, the GNDOCB seized &euro;36.7 million worth of illicit drugs, 23 firearms, 2,131 rounds of ammunition, and &euro;8 million in cash and made 228 arrests.<\/p>  <p>   The continued cooperation with other jurisdictions is of vital importance to tackling transnational organised crime, including drug trafficking, and targeting the illicit proceeds generated by drug-related crime. Ongoing liaison between our national police service and other law enforcement agencies, via Europol, has led to a number of successful joint operations in recent years. <\/p>  <p>The Deputy will be aware that the Department of Health leads on Government policy in the area of drugs, and this policy is guided by the national drugs and alcohol strategy \"Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery - a health led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017-2025\". This strategy represents a whole-of-Government response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland. While the implementation of the strategy is led by my colleague, the Minister for Health, the strategy includes actions for all stakeholders, including my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  <\/p>  <p>The strategy recognises the need for a balanced health-led approach - reducing demand, while also reducing access to illegal drugs, and is aimed at reducing the number of people criminalised for the possession of drugs for personal use. While this strategy supports the vulnerable people who use drugs, it is also matched with strengthened enforcement measures across government to tackle the supply of illegal drugs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500078#WRH05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pardons","counter":453,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500079#WRJ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":454,"qnumday":182,"qnumall":"[58001\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500079#WRJ00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the latest up-to-date position in relation to efforts to pardon a person (details supplied) who was wrongly hanged in 1895; if she will prioritise the continuation of the process already under way in order that they will be pardoned and closure can be given to their relatives; if she will provide an updated timeline regarding the future process; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":455,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, a local group gathered a considerable amount of material relating to this case, and I know the Deputy has taken a very close interest in this application.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will also be aware, in early 2020, the then Minister for Justice and Equality engaged an expert on nineteenth century trial law in Ireland for their expert opinion on the safety, or otherwise, of the conviction.

However, I am assured that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of policing priorities and crime trends, to ensure their optimum use. <\/p>  <p>  I am pleased that Budget 2022 reflects the commitment of the Government to enhancing community safety and that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources to be an effective and trusted policing service.<\/p>  <p>  The budget provided by Government to the Garda Commissioner continues to increase to unprecedented levels, with an allocation of &euro;1.952 billion for 2021 and over &euro;2 billion in funding in Budget 2022. Indeed since 2016, the budget for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has increased by some &euro;500m, or approximately 33%. This has enabled 3,340 new Garda&iacute; to be deployed, as well as continued investment in modern equipment. In addition, over 800 Garda&iacute; have been redeployed to front line policing work through the recruitment of Garda staff. <\/p>  <p>  I am delighted that Budget 2022 includes funding for the recruitment of 800 new Garda recruits and 400 Garda staff in 2022 - a further additional 1,200 personnel.

The organisation's capacity will be further strengthened by the recruitment of additional Garda staff, including to specialist roles to support the investigation of crime and enhance the management of the organisation.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are 14,298 Garda members as at 31 October 2021.

In determining the allocation of resources local and national crime trends and workloads, policing arrangements and operational strategies, minimum establishment statistics, local population and trends, geographical area and size, and transfer applications, including welfare\/personnel issues and concerns, are taken into account in the context of the requirements of all Garda divisions nationwide.<\/p>  <p>  To ensure the continued level of delivery of policing services within Garda divisions, local and senior Garda management are also consulted during the allocation of personnel and are responsible for the specific deployment\/assignment of duties being undertaken at divisional level.

NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the challenges to the delivery of the NBP due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has faced a range of other challenges due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre to the home in a rural environment. These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract. This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-baselines milestones for 2021. Work is underway to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond. This has resulted in some changes to timeframes for connection for end users. <\/p>  <p>  The network rollout for the National Broadband Plan is divided into 227 Deployment Areas (DAs) across the country.\u00a0 These are typically an area of approximately 25km in radius and in total they cover 96% of Ireland&rsquo;s landmass. The architecture of the network design is specifically based on the design of the NBI network coming from the eir exchanges or\u00a0the metropolitan area networks (MANs). It is based on an engineering design that allows NBI to get to every premises as quickly as possible working within the confines of how fibre networks are built. <\/p>  <p>  Each DA creates a &lsquo;fibre ring&rsquo; which is essential to ensure reliability, robustness and resilience. Critical to the success of the network, NBI&rsquo;s fibre rings are built with back-ups, ensuring that in the event of one fibre cable being disrupted, the whole network continues to perform.\u00a0 Each fibre ring that NBI deploys is designed in a way that is non-discriminatory, meaning that as the rollout progresses, it may\u00a0pass relatively urban areas at the same time as passing\u00a0some of the most remote premises within the intervention area. The design will utilise existing infrastructure to a very significant degree.<\/p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 12 November, 389 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCP&rsquo;s are installed in County Cork at Ballydaly Community Hall, Aubane Community Centre, Mealagh Valley Community Centre, Courtbrack Community Centre, Laharn Heritage Centre, Ballindangan Community Centre, Clogagh Community Hall, Aghabullogue Community Centre, Castletownkenneigh Community Centre, The Old Schoolhouse, Bere Island Heritage Centre, Col&aacute;iste Phobal Cl&eacute;ire, Lissavard Community Centre, Whitechurch Community Centre, Glash Community Centre, T.O. Park Labbamollaga and Sherkin Island Community Hall. <\/p>  <p>  Templebrady National School, Ballycroneen National School, Clogagh National School, Educate Together Carrigaline, Ringaskiddy Lower Harbour National School, Scoil\u00a0 Naomh Fionan Na Reanna, Ballygarvan National School and Shanbally National School have been installed by NBI for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500080#WRK01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1479"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Infrastructure","counter":531,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500080#WRK01900"},{"type":"question","counter":532,"qnumday":208,"qnumall":"[58067\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500080#WRK02000","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the reason poles were erected opposite Loughquittane Lake in Killarney by National Broadband Ireland (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":533,"content":"<p>We are exploring the background to this case\u00a0for our own purposes.\u00a0 The issue involves 2 poles in private land (wayleave permission granted)\u00a0deemed by NBI not to require\u00a0S.254\u00a0licences, i.e. it is exempt development.\u00a0\u00a0Exploring the validity of that view with\u00a0external experts.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500080#WRK02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1479"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Waste Management","counter":534,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500080#WRK02200"},{"type":"question","counter":535,"qnumday":209,"qnumall":"[58075\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500080#WRK02300","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if he has received correspondence regarding the issue of waste waivers in the past three months.","asker":"1514","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":536,"content":"<p>My officials have advised that\u00a0the Department\u00a0has received one enquiry from a member of the public and\u00a0two enquiries from members of this House in the last 3 months requesting an update on\u00a0measures to support\u00a0persons with long-term incontinence with respect to the disposal of medical incontinence wear; the matter has also been\u00a0the subject of five Parliamentary Questions in this period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500080#WRK02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1479"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Climate Action Plan","counter":537,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500080#WRK02425"},{"type":"question","counter":538,"qnumday":210,"qnumall":"[58110\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500080#WRK02450","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the estimated amount Ireland has paid in fines in 2019, 2020 and to date in 2021 for missing climate action targets; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This ensures there will be no sudden end to the EWSS and also provides clarity and certainty to business. <\/p>  <p>  The following are the broad parameters of this extension:<\/p>  <p>  - The current arrangements, including the enhanced rates of subsidy, will remain in place until November 30 2021;<\/p>  <p>  - For December 1 2021 to February 28 2022, the original two-rate subsidy of &euro;151.50 and &euro;203 will apply;<\/p>  <p>  - For March and April 2022, a single flat rate of &euro;100 will apply and the reduced rate of Employers&rsquo; PRSI will be reinstated for these two months;<\/p>  <p>  - Businesses availing of the EWSS on 31 December 2021 will continue to be supported until 30 April 2022. The scheme will close to new employers from 1 January 2022. <\/p>  <p>  To address the specific point in relation to sole-traders, subject to meeting the requisite conditions, a sole-trader&rsquo;s business may be a qualifying employer for the purpose of the scheme, the same as is the case for any other employer. As was the case under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), sole-traders are not able to claim the EWSS in respect of their own employment as they are not employees &ndash; and further, may not necessarily be paid via the payroll system unlike proprietary directors who are obliged to have PAYE operated on any payments made to them personally.<\/p>  <p>  Since the introduction of EWSS there has been regular and, where necessary, detailed engagement between my Department and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth (D\/CEDIY), who have policy responsibility for the childcare sector.  Analysis undertaken by D\/CEDIY informed the approach taken with regard to the childcare sector. Childcare businesses will continue to benefit from the EWSS exemption until end April 2022. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that analysis by D\/CEDIY estimates that the value of EWSS to the sector at the enhanced rates is &euro;34 million per month, &euro;22 million per month at original rates and &euro;11 million at the flat rate.  That Department estimates that the cost to the sector of operating in line with the public health guidance is &euro;12 million per month.<\/p>  <p>  As announced by my colleague, Minister O&rsquo;Gorman, it is intended to put in place a transition fund between May and August 2022, which early learning and childcare providers can access. From September 2022, a major new funding stream will be introduced, to support providers in meeting their operating costs in return for a commitment that fees to parents will not increase. Therefore, I am satisfied that a coherent approach has been taken as regards the exit strategy for EWSS and the introduction of the new funding stream for the childcare sector.  <\/p>  <p>  Since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Government has adopted a proactive and dynamic approach to supporting businesses and individuals insofar as possible during this challenging time. <\/p>  <p>  As regards the EWSS and the current circumstances referenced in this question, the Government continues to monitor developments closely and will consider if any response is required at an appropriate time. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500080#WRK04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Medical Certificates","counter":571,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500080#WRK05000"},{"type":"question","counter":572,"qnumday":222,"qnumall":"[58045\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500080#WRK05100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide clarity as to the establishment of a review group on foot of legal advice received in relation to primary medical certificates; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":573,"content":"<p>The Disabled Drivers &amp;amp; Disabled Passengers Scheme provides relief from Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT on the purchase and use of an adapted car, as well as an exemption from motor tax and an annual fuel grant.<\/p>  <p>  The Scheme is open to severely and permanently disabled persons as a driver or as a passenger and also to certain charitable organisations.

The first allocations under the LSSIF were announced in January 2020 and thus far, approximately &euro;86.4m has been awarded to 33 different proposals.  The priority in the short term is to advance all of those projects. As it is now over 18 months since the first allocations were made, and in view of the issues faced by grantees as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is timely to review progress on all projects. My Department is engaging with all grantees in this regard. The timing of any new call for proposals is also being considered and it is expected that the review will be completed shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500081#WRL01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1475"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","counter":599,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500081#WRL02000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Schemes","counter":598,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500081#WRL01900"},{"type":"question","counter":599,"qnumday":231,"qnumall":"[58195\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500081#WRL02000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if his attention has been drawn to a company (details supplied) that is leasing homes long-term to local authorities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1453","askee":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":600,"qnumday":239,"qnumall":"[58196\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500081#WRL02100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if a person can choose to enter into a mortgage to rent scheme through their local authority or through a subletting agreement through a private company.","asker":"1453","askee":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":601,"qnumday":240,"qnumall":"[58198\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500081#WRL02200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of long-term lease agreements entered into with a company (details supplied) by local authority in tabular form.","asker":"1453","askee":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":602,"qnumday":243,"qnumall":"[58202\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500081#WRL02300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the reason his Department is sanctioning mortgage to rent leasing with a company (details supplied).","asker":"1453","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":603,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 231, 239, 240 and 243 together.<\/p><p>The Mortgage to Rent (MTR) scheme introduced in 2012 is targeted at supporting households in mortgage arrears who have had their mortgage position deemed unsustainable by their lender under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP); agree to the voluntary surrender of their home and are deemed eligible for social housing support.  The property in question must also meet certain eligibility criteria. The concept of the scheme is that a household with an unsustainable mortgage goes from being a homeowner to being a social housing tenant. The borrower surrenders their property to their lender who sells it to a MTR provider which can be either an Approved Housing Body (AHB) or since 2018 a private company, Home for Life Ltd.  The AHB or local authority (in the case where the property is sold to a private company) becomes the landlord and the borrower remains in the property as a tenant paying a differential rent to the landlord based on his or her income.  <\/p><p>To the end of September 2021, 1497 households with unsustainable private mortgages have completed the MTR scheme since its introduction nationally in 2013.  The 1497 households in the scheme represent 2460 adults and 2091 children who have remained living in their homes and communities.  There are currently 850 active cases being progressed under the scheme.<\/p><p>A review of the MTR scheme in 2017 taking account of capacity within the AHB sector given that sector's role in delivering ambitious targets around new social housing supply, also recommended that alternative funding options, including the off-balance sheet potential of private institutional investment, be explored in order to allow the MTR scheme to deliver at scale.  An Expressions of Interest (EOI) Request issued in 2017 inviting parties from the private sector to express their interest in participating in a new alternatively funded long-term MTR lease model.  The outcome from the EOI process is that a new MTR alternatively funded lease model was announced in 2018 with Home for Life Ltd. as the participant from the private sector.<\/p><p>Under this alternatively funded model, Home for Life Ltd. purchases properties from lenders subsequent to their voluntary surrender by borrowers that meet the MTR eligibility criteria and then enters into a long-term 25 year lease arrangement with the local authority in whose area the property is situated for a defined term at an agreed rent, thereby enabling the borrower to remain living in their own home under a tenancy agreement with the local authority.  Home for Life Ltd. is also responsible for managing and maintaining the property on behalf of the local authority in accordance with the lease requirements.  The number of MTR cases completed by Home for Life Ltd. broken down by local authority area is detailed in the attached table.<\/p><p>Where an eligible borrower is proposed for the scheme by their lender, the MTR provider that their case will be assigned to depends on a number of factors:<\/p><p>- if a particular MTR provider has an agreement with the lender to purchase properties in which case the property will be assigned to the MTR provider concerned;<\/p><p>- where no such agreement exists, the Housing Agency will invite MTR providers to express an interest in a property and will assign the property to the MTR provider who expresses an interest;<\/p><p>- if both an AHB and Home for Life express an interest in the property, the lender will inform the borrower and the borrower may choose the MTR provider;<\/p><p>- if more than one AHB expresses an interest in the property, the Housing Agency will assign the property to an AHB by way of a random selection process.<\/p><p>Regardless of who the property owner is under the MTR scheme, AHB or Home for Life Ltd., the local authority is obliged to meet the housing needs of social housing tenants indefinitely and beyond the term of the applicable lease arrangement. <\/p><p>AHBs are an integral part of the MTR scheme and their participation in the scheme has enabled and continues to enable a significant number of borrowers to remain in their homes as social housing tenants.<\/p><p>The inclusion of an MTR provider from the private sector has facilitated more individuals and families staying in their homes.  Given the sizeable cohort of borrowers still in long-term mortgage arrears, all the MTR providers participating in the scheme are needed in order to meet the demand for the scheme. In all scenarios, my Department and the Housing Agency are focused on meeting the long-term housing needs of the greatest number of households in unsustainable mortgage arrears. <\/p><p>The Programme for Government and Housing for All includes a commitment to strengthen the Mortgage to Rent Scheme and ensure that it is helping those who need it<i>.  <\/i>Building on the significant improvements already made to the scheme since 2017, my Department is currently working closely with the Housing Agency and key stakeholders to identify any further improvements required to the scheme.  As set out in Housing For All, the review of the MTR scheme is scheduled to be delivered in Q4 of this year and I expect to be in a position to make an announcement shortly. <\/p><p><b>Table: MTR cases completed by Home for Life to Q3 2021<\/b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Local Authority<\/th>       <th>Complete<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow County Council<\/td>       <td>15<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan County Council<\/td>       <td>8<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare County Council<\/td>       <td>17<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork City Council<\/td>       <td>13<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork County Council<\/td>       <td>29<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal County Council<\/td>       <td>9<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin City Council<\/td>       <td>21<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Fingal County Council<\/td>       <td>27<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway City Council<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway County Council<\/td>       <td>10<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry County Council<\/td>       <td>10<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare County Council<\/td>       <td>30<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny County Council<\/td>       <td>19<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois County Council<\/td>       <td>17<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim County Council<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick City and County Council<\/td>       <td>23<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford County Council<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth County Council<\/td>       <td>29<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo County Council<\/td>       <td>16<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath County Council<\/td>       <td>35<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan County Council<\/td>       <td>7<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly County Council<\/td>       <td>20<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon County Council<\/td>       <td>8<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo County Council<\/td>       <td>11<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>South Dublin County Council<\/td>       <td>20<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary County Council<\/td>       <td>32<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford City and County Council<\/td>       <td>31<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath County Council<\/td>       <td>22<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford County Council<\/td>       <td>26<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow County Council<\/td>       <td>27<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Grand Total<\/td>       <td>546<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500081#WRL02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authorities","counter":604,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500081#WRL02500"},{"type":"question","counter":605,"qnumday":232,"qnumall":"[58061\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500081#WRL02600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 362 of 28 September 2021, the status of the review of the position in relation to the filling of the post of the chief executive of Galway County Council on a permanent basis; when the review will be completed; the person or body that is carrying out the review; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":606,"content":"<p>I refer to Parliamentary Question 356 of 2 November 2021.

Under Housing for All, the focus is on increasing social housing through new build, with a reduced reliance on the leasing and acquisition of homes. As such long-term leasing will be phased out by the end of 2025 and thereafter no new homes will be delivered through long-term leasing. There will also be a limited number of social homes delivered through acquisitions, with current projections limiting acquisitions to 200 new social homes per annum. <\/p>  <p>  The Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP) supports the delivery of social housing by providing financial support to local authorities for the leasing of houses and apartments.

The military coup, which began on 24\/25 October, represents a major setback to this transition. <\/p><p>The military leadership&rsquo;s violent crackdown on the country&rsquo;s civilian and civil society leadership, mass detention of protestors, attacks on medical personnel and facilities, and methodical dismantling of transitional institutions are utterly unacceptable. The actions of the military, both army and former militia leaders and signatories of the Juba Peace Agreement, have put in jeopardy the hard-won transition, and the legitimate wishes of the Sudanese people for freedom, peace, justice and inclusive development. They also have worrying implications for peace and security in the region more broadly. <\/p><p>Sudan&rsquo;s democratic transition is too important to fail, for the people of Sudan, and for the stability of the Horn of Africa region as a whole. The release and reinstatement of Prime Minister Hamdok on 21 November must be accompanied by an immediate halt to violence and repression, and the freeing of all civilian leaders and political detainees. Telecommunications must also be fully restored. Credible discussions can then commence on a way forward which honours the demands of the Sudanese people for freedom, peace and justice and puts the country back on the path to democracy.<\/p><p>Ireland welcomed the decision of the African Union (AU) last month to suspend Sudan from AU activities until &ldquo;the effective restoration of the civilian-led Transitional Authority&rdquo;. We are also closely following efforts by the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary General, Volker Perthes, in Khartoum, and the EU Special Representative for the Horn of Africa, Annette Weber, to engage with Sudanese and regional stakeholders.<\/p><p>Ireland supported a strong Security Council Press Statement on 28 October condemning the coup, and was unequivocal in denouncing the action by Sudan&rsquo;s military leaders at two Security Council meetings on Sudan, most recently on 11 November. We continue to keep further Council action under consideration as the situation unfolds, including through the three Sudan-focused mandates over which the Council presides: UNITAMS (UN Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in Sudan), UNISFA (Interim Security Force for Abyei) and the Sudan sanctions regime. <\/p><p>  Ireland has also supported a strong EU response. High Representative Josep Borrell issued a statement on 26 October on behalf of the 27 EU Member States warning of serious consequences if the move to dismantle the transitional government was not reversed.  The situation was also discussed by Ministers at the Foreign Affairs Council on 15 November.<\/p><p>On 19 November in the wake of the killing and injury of over 100 peaceful protesters in Khartoum, Minister Coveney issued a statement condemning the reckless and unlawful actions of the coup leaders and undertaking to consider what further measures might be taken to protect and reset the path to democratic transition, and to maintain peace and security. <\/p><p>Ireland is ready to consider further restrictive or financial measures, including under the EU&rsquo;s Global Human Rights sanctions regime, while keeping in mind the increasing humanitarian needs on the ground. Ireland joined calls for a Special Session of the Human Rights Council on Sudan on 5 November where we commended the courage of the Sudanese people and urged the military authorities to fully respect the rights of peaceful assembly.<\/p><p>  As the crisis evolves, my officials, including through our Embassy in Nairobi accredited to Sudan, will continue to closely monitor the situation and work with our partners for a cohesive collective response, and for a restoration of the democratic transition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500082#WRM01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1573"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Northern Ireland","counter":654,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500082#WRM01900"},{"type":"question","counter":655,"qnumday":251,"qnumall":"[57967\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500082#WRM02000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has had recent contact with his counterparts in the Northern Ireland Executive and in the British Government in relation to the unacceptable proposal by the British Government to introduce a statute of limitations which would end all criminal investigations and prosecutions in relation to the perpetration of serious crimes during the era known as the Troubles; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":656,"content":"<p>We have strongly communicated our position on this issue to the British Government and will continue to do so, and to caution in the clearest terms against any unilateral action.<\/p>  <p>  It has been the consistent position of the Government that the Stormont House Agreement provides a balanced and comprehensive framework to address the painful legacy of the Troubles based on the principles of truth, justice, rule of law and reconciliation. Progress on its implementation is crucial, for families and victims and for society as a whole. It was agreed in 2014 by both Governments and the political parties after intensive negotiations, and it should be implemented.<\/p>  <p>  Where the British Government propose significant changes to the Stormont House framework, these must be discussed and agreed by both Governments and the parties to the Northern Ireland Executive. Only through a collective approach can we hope to deal with these issues comprehensively and fairly and in a way that responds to the needs of victims, survivors and society. <\/p>  <p>  Following a meeting of the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference on 24 June, we agreed to begin an intensive process of engagement with the British Government and the Northern Ireland parties to find an agreed way forward. Discussions began in July and since then, officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs have met a broad range of stakeholders. Importantly, this process has engaged fully with victims&rsquo; representatives. The intention is to find an agreed way forward that will allow implementing legislation to be introduced in both the UK and Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The proposals published by the British Government on 14 July for a &lsquo;Statute of Limitations&rsquo;, ending criminal investigations and prosecutions relating to Troubles-related incidents, as well as inquests and civil litigation, have caused significant upset, shock and concern. They represent a very radical departure from the Stormont House Agreement and we do not accept them as the basis of a way forward. It is important to say that there has been a clear message from victims groups throughout this process that this cannot be the way forward. It has also been strongly and publicly opposed by all the parties.<\/p>  <p>  I have engaged regularly with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Brandon Lewis, who is leading for the British Government on these proposals, including a meeting in person on 3 September in relation to the ongoing legacy engagement process.

Updated guidance for schools on Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools was provided at the end of May following the work of an expert group that carefully considered the role of ventilation in managing COVID-19. A copy of the guidance is published on the Gov.ie website. <\/p>  <p>  The over-arching approach in the guidance is for schools to have windows open as fully as possible when classrooms are not in use and partially open when classrooms are in use. <\/p>  <p>  The guidance outlines that Carbon Dioxide (CO2) monitors can play a part in providing a useful general indication that areas\/rooms may not be adequately ventilated. They can enable occupants to become familiar with the impacts of activities, outdoor weather and window openings on levels of good ventilation. The provision of portable CO2 monitors provides schools with the flexibility to focus their use to those rooms where most beneficial to inform strategies for optimising ventilation in the school. <\/p>  <p>  Schools that identify inadequate ventilation in a room can utilise their minor work grant (for minor improvements) or apply for emergency works grant assistance to address ventilation enhancements on a permanent basis.

As such, the cost of works needed may vary.

Under the special educational needs model, NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Details of planning and the student response to interventions are recorded on the Student Support File and the teacher may then wish to consult with their assigned psychologist. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. This system is in line with international best practice and allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. <\/p>  <p>  Parents\/guardians should engage with the Principal of their child&rsquo;s school or the school&rsquo;s SET co-ordinator to discuss their child&rsquo;s needs.  In September 2017 a new model to support pupils with special educational needs in our schools was introduced.  The new model differs significantly from the old Resource Allocation Model, in that Special Education Teacher allocation is now frontloaded into schools to support children with special educational needs. This model differs from the previous system whereby pupils were allocated a prescribed number of resource teaching hours on the basis of a named disability. The new model gives schools the capacity to respond to individual needs in a flexible way and pupils do not have to have a psychological assessment, or a diagnosis of a disability, in order to access Special Education Teaching.   This means that those with highest level of need can access the highest level of support within the school in a timely manner. <\/p>  <p>   In the first instance I would advise that this child&rsquo;s parents should consult with the school&rsquo;s principal to discuss the supports in place to meet their daughter&rsquo;s needs and their daughter&rsquo;s response to those interventions.  Following this, and if appropriate, consideration may be given to a consultation with the assigned NEPS psychologist.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500083#WRN01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","counter":709,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500083#WRN01400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment","counter":708,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500083#WRN01300"},{"type":"question","counter":709,"qnumday":269,"qnumall":"[58133\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500083#WRN01400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she will outline the provision of funding she has made in the event that she is required to fund a full allowance of the pandemic unemployment payment in December 2021 and the first six months of 2022.","asker":"1489","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":710,"content":"<p>It is estimated that over &euro;4 billion will be spent on the Pandemic Unemployment Payment in 2021.<\/p><p>The 2022 allocation for PUP is &euro;75 million and is based upon Government Decisions made to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500083#WRN01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Register Office","counter":711,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500083#WRN01600"},{"type":"question","counter":712,"qnumday":270,"qnumall":"[58044\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500083#WRN01700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she will ensure the General Register Office issues marriage paperwork to a couple (details supplied) without further delay.","asker":"1596","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":713,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that an application for recognition of a foreign divorce was submitted to the General Register Office (GRO) in respect of one of the parties to the proposed marriage. <\/p><p>Where a person is granted a divorce abroad this must be examined to determine if it is entitled to recognition under Irish law.

Processing of pension claims depends on the individual nature of applicants&rsquo; circumstances.  It is also dependent on the completeness of applications received and the availability of the required information.   Further investigation may be required before notification of decision where the applicant has been self-employed, where they have been in public sector employment or where they may have social insurance recorded in another country.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500084#WRO00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals","counter":762,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500084#WRO00800"},{"type":"question","counter":763,"qnumday":287,"qnumall":"[58182\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500084#WRO00900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of social welfare appeals being determined on a weekly basis; the number of appeals arising each week; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":764,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements. <\/p><p>I am advised by the Chief Appeals Officer that in 2020 a total of 23,664 appeals were registered and 26,790 were finalised.

Prior to Covid-19, the seasonally adjusted youth unemployment rate for 2019 averaged approximately 12.5 percent.  Following the onset of the pandemic, the CSO&rsquo;s &quot;COVID-19 adjusted&quot; monthly youth unemployment rate, which includes all those in receipt of the PUP, increased dramatically, peaking at almost 70 percent in May 2020. <\/p><p>In recent months, on foot of the loosening of public health restrictions, youth unemployment rates have declined significantly. According to the latest data from the CSO, the &quot;COVID-19 adjusted&quot; youth unemployment rate for October 2021 was 11.1 percent while the standard youth unemployment rate for October 2021 was 9.1 percent. Therefore, a reasonable estimate of the current underlying youth unemployment is between 9 and 11 percent, meaning youth unemployment rates have fallen below 2019 levels.<\/p><p>In recent weeks the rapid decline in the number of young persons in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment has continued. As of November 23<sup>rd<\/sup>, there are just over 4,300 under 25's in receipt of the PUP, down from 9,870 at the start of October. At present, under 25&rsquo;s account for approximately 7.5 percent of all current PUP recipients. This compares to over 25 percent in early June. <\/p><p>Additionally, there are there are just under 17,200  under 25's on the Live Register as of the week ending November 21<sup>st<\/sup>. Therefore, the total number of under 25's in receipt of Live Register and PUP income supports is around 21,500.<\/p><p>While much progress has been made, I will continue to monitor youth unemployment levels carefully over the coming weeks and months. Under Pathways to Work, the Government's new employment services strategy, launched last July, my Department has put in place a wide range of measures to assist unemployed young people back into employment, education or training. Some of the key measures that will help young people include: <\/p><p>- 4,000 places ring-fenced for young people on the Work Placement Experience Programme.<\/p><p>- 1,000 additional Community Employment and T&uacute;s places set aside for young people. <\/p><p>- Providing 50,000 further education and training places.<\/p><p>- 8,000 additional places on the JobsPlus recruitment subsidy- with the subsidy being available, on an earlier basis than normal, to employers when they recruit young people.<\/p><p>- Targeting 10,000 apprentice registrations per year by 2025.<\/p><p>- Extending the Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme, which provides financial supports for employers who register apprentices to a national apprenticeship, to end 2021.

pension system already provides significant recognition to those whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, often to raise families or in a full-time caring role.<\/p>  <p>  This is provided through the award of credits and\/or the application of the Homemaker&rsquo;s Scheme (under the Yearly Average method for payment calculation) and\/or the application of HomeCaring Periods (under the Aggregated Contribution Method, also known as the interim Total Contributions Approach).  <\/p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory), the maximum personal rate for which is &euro;237 (over 95% of the maximum rate of the contributory pension).  This rate of payment does not include rent allowance, household benefits or fuel allowance which they may also be entitled to.  Alternatively, if their spouse is a State pensioner and they have significant household means, their most beneficial payment may be an Increase for a Qualified Adult, based on their personal means, and amounting up to 90% of a full contributory pension. <\/p>  <p>  The Pensions Commission was established in November 2020 to examine the sustainability of the State Pension system and the Social Insurance Fund, in fulfilment of a Programme for Government commitment.  The Commission was an independent body comprised of knowledgeable and experienced academics, pension experts, members of civil society and representatives of workers and employers.  The Commission has completed its work and its report was published on 7th October 2021.  The Commission's Report, its Technical Sub-Committee's working papers, and submissions made to the Commission are available on the Commission&rsquo;s website, pensionscommission.gov.ie.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission&rsquo;s Report is a comprehensive report that takes account of an assessment of various analyses of population, labour force and expenditure projections; an examination of international approaches; and responses to an extensive consultation process.  It has unambiguously established that the current State Pension system is not sustainable into the future and that changes are needed, and it has set out a wide range of recommendations in this regard.  These recommendations include enhanced provisions for long-term carers (in excess of 20 years), full transition to a Total Contributions Approach and allowing a person to continue to pay social insurance contributions past State Pension Age to improve their record for State Pension Contributory purposes.  <\/p>  <p>  The report has been referred to the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands and to the Commission for Taxation and Welfare for its views.  I understand that, in this regard, both the Chair of the Commission, Ms. Josephine Feehily and the Chair of its Technical Sub-Committee, Ms. Roma Burke met with the Joint Committee on 17th November 2021.  Officials from my Department also attended this meeting. <\/p>  <p>  In the interests both of older people and of future generations of older people, the Government intends to consider the comprehensive and far reaching recommendations in the Commission&rsquo;s Report very carefully and holistically.  My officials will work over the coming months to examine each of the recommendations.  They will consult across Government through the Cabinet Committee system.  I think it is really important that we complete that work before reaching conclusions.  I intend to bring a recommended response and implementation plan to Government by the end of March 2022.  <\/p>  <p>  The State Pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  It is extremely effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.  This Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case for current pensioners, those nearing State Pension age and today&rsquo;s young workers including those who are only starting their careers. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500084#WRO02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Registration of Births","counter":780,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500084#WRO02600"},{"type":"question","counter":781,"qnumday":293,"qnumall":"[58208\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500084#WRO02700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she will provide a list of the current average waiting times for the registration of the birth of a child in each county, in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1514","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":782,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that the HSE is responsible for the day-to-day delivery of civil registration services.<\/p><p>My Department, through the General Register Office, has made enquiries with the HSE who have advised that there are no backlogs in registering births with the exception of the Eastern Registration Areas.

This will be achieved by increased visible policing, particularly at key locations, and further maximising the impact of that visibility. The Operation will also focus on community and stakeholder engagement.  <\/p>  <p>  I am also informed that Operation Hurdle has been established in the Wicklow Division each year since 2012 to target the theft of Christmas trees in the period between the end of October and Christmas.

While this strategy supports the vulnerable people who use drugs, it is also matched with strengthened enforcement measures across government to tackle the supply of illegal drugs. Sustained action by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has continued unabated throughout the current pandemic, bringing significant convictions and ongoing seizures of drugs, firearms and ammunition.<\/p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that on 2 July 2021, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na commenced an enhanced national anti-drugs strategy, Operation Tara, which has a strong focus on tackling street-level dealing throughout rural and urban Ireland.

Various forms of rehabilitative training within the prison system continue to be made available to all prisoners, including first time offenders.  <\/p>  <p>  A range of programmes including education, vocational training, healthcare, psychiatric, psychological, addiction counselling, welfare and spiritual services are provided with the aim of offering purposeful activity to all those in custody while serving their sentences.<\/p>  <p>  There is a clear commitment to enhance sentence planning through Integrated Sentence Management and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes.  The Joint Irish Prison Service\/ETBI Education Strategy 2019 - 2021 sets out a commitment to the provision of broad based education provision and includes supporting integration and sentence planning. Education in prisons is delivered in partnership between the Education Training Boards and the Prison Service and a broad and flexible curriculum is provided. A top priority for the Service is ensuring support for those with literacy problems, and to this end, peer mentoring programmes are active in all prisons.<\/p>  <p>  The guiding principles which underpin the prisons' work and training service provision are to make available work, work-training and other purposeful activities to all those in custody.  Activities are chosen to give as much variety as possible and also to give opportunities to acquire practical skills which will help secure employment on release.  Work Training Officers have been appointed and assigned to areas such as catering, laundry, industrial cleaning and industrial skills.<\/p>  <p>  The Prison Service has also been expanding the number of accredited courses and opportunities available to prisoners in Work Training in recent years. Enhanced partnership arrangements with accrediting bodies such as City and Guilds; the Guild of Cleaners and Launderers; Cleanpass and the centralising of coordination and quality assurance arrangements have enabled the Prison Service to extend the number of available courses and activities with certification to people in custody. Significant progress in prison education has also been made in physical education, in the provision for higher education, in the arts and in preparing people for release. <\/p>  <p>  The \"Working to Change Social Enterprise Strategy - 2021-2023\" sets out my Department&rsquo;s direction for supporting employment options for people with convictions by simultaneously working to remove systemic barriers so that people can make sustainable changes. It builds upon a solid foundation of employment supports already in place across the criminal justice sector and is a collaboration between the Prison and Probation Service and my Department.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Psychology Service proactively targets specific cohorts of prisoners including violent offenders with over two year sentence, as well as 18-24 year olds in custody. Assistant Psychologists focus  primarily on mental health and sentence management work with prisoners and are tasked with engaging and motivating this cohort of prisoners, who are committed to custody on a sentence of one year or more and who do not have a post-release supervision order to develop a sentence plan and to engage in appropriate interventions.<\/p>  <p>  The Probation Service have joined this initiative by engaging in assessments with those 18-24 year olds who have post release supervision orders. The strategic objective is to have a multi-agency approach to offender management and rehabilitation from pre to post imprisonment in order to reduce re-offending and improve prisoner outcomes. This forms a central part of the Prison and Probation Service Joint Strategic Plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500085#WRP02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Measures","counter":843,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500085#WRP03000"},{"type":"question","counter":844,"qnumday":315,"qnumall":"[58166\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500085#WRP03100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the extent to which racism and hate speech or hate mail continue to be targeted as an offence in need of urgent attention; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":845,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware  that the Government is fully committed to the fight against racism, prejudice and bigotry, and strongly condemns the actions of those who abuse and attack others because of their own prejudices against a person&rsquo;s religion, ethnic origins, sexual orientation or any other part of their identity as a human being.

There is also a constitutional presumption in favour of the granting of bail as, under Irish Law, a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty.  The presumption that a person is innocent until proven guilty has traditionally been considered by the courts to prohibit pre-trial detention except where it appeared that the accused person, if released on bail, was likely to evade justice by absconding or interfering with witnesses or evidence.   <\/p>  <p>  In the light of concerns at the increase in the incidence of offences committed while on bail, a referendum took place in 1996 on a proposed amendment to the Constitution to allow the courts to refuse bail where there are grounds for believing that the accused will commit serious offences while on bail. The referendum was passed and section 2 of the Bail Act 1997 gave effect to this constitutional amendment which permits the courts to refuse bail to a person charged with a serious offence where refusal of bail is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  Subsequent to this, the law on Bail has been strengthened on three occasions, specifically in the Criminal Justice Act 2007, the Criminal Justice Act 2015 and the Criminal Justice Act 2017.   <\/p>  <p>  As previously conveyed, I can inform the Deputy that Garda authorities advise that the amended bail laws have proven to be effective and have assisted An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling the threat of organised crime.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has also supported An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in addressing the threat from organised crime gangs through the introduction of legislative measures such as:<\/p>  <p>  - The Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2016 which provides additional Garda powers for the immediate seizure of assets suspected of being the proceeds of crime to prevent them being disposed of;  <\/p>  <p>  - The Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act 2014, providing for the establishment and operation of the DNA database providing Garda&iacute; with links between people and unsolved crimes;<\/p>  <p>  - The Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, introduced to protect the justice system from being subverted by criminal groups, including potential intimidation of juries.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500085#WRP03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"question","counter":850,"qnumday":317,"qnumall":"[58168\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500085#WRP03700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the extent to which recidivism is evident in the context of various levels of offences; the groups most seriously affected; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":851,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, the Central Statistics Office regularly publishes both prison and probation re-offending statistics on their website www.cso.ie. <\/p><p>The Prison Re-offending Statistics measure the level of recorded re-offending by offenders who received a custodial sentence following their release from prison.

As Minister, I have no role in this independent function. I am assured however that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review, in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, to ensure their optimum use.<\/p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Garda authorities that as of 31 October 2021, the latest date for which figures are available, there are 426 Garda Members assigned to the Kildare Division. This is an increase of 36.5% since the end of 2015, when there were 312 members assigned to the Division.  I am further advised that the overall strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is 14,298 sworn members of all ranks, an increase of over 11.5% since the end of 2015 .<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased that Budget 2022 reflects the commitment of the Government to enhancing community safety and that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources to be an effective and trusted policing service.<\/p>  <p>  The budget provided by Government to the Garda Commissioner continues to increase to unprecedented levels, with an allocation of &euro;1.952 billion for 2021 and over &euro;2 billion in funding in Budget 2022. Indeed since 2016, the budget for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has increased by some &euro;500m, or approximately 33%. This has enabled 3,340 new probationer Garda&iacute; to be deployed, as well as continued investment in modern equipment. In addition, over 800 Garda&iacute; have been redeployed to front line policing work through the recruitment of Garda staff. <\/p>  <p>  I am delighted that Budget 2022 includes funding for the recruitment of 800 new Garda recruits and 400 Garda staff in 2022 - a further additional 1,200 personnel.  This planned increase in the number of Garda members and staff is designed to deliver significant growth in operational policing hours nationwide and improved public safety and services to the public generally.<\/p>  <p>  Redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and support roles will also continue next year, thus allowing highly trained Garda&iacute; to focus on frontline policing duties.  The organisation's capacity will be further strengthened by the recruitment of additional Garda staff, including to specialist roles to support the investigation of crime and enhance the management of the organisation.<\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have advised that a recruitment plan for 2022 is currently being developed to manage the recruitment processes for Garda members and Garda staff roles.  Implementation will of course be dependent on public health guidelines but I very much hope it will be possible to maximise the intake to Templemore next year. I understand there are a number of successful candidates still to be called from the last competition but I am delighted to confirm that a new Garda Trainee competition is also being planned for early next year.  <\/p>  <p>  Both the Garda Commissioner and I are particularly keen that the new competition will focus on the need for greater diversity among rank and file Garda&iacute; and we would encourage all those with an interest in joining the organisation to consider doing so.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500085#WRP04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prison Service","counter":855,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500085#WRP04200"},{"type":"question","counter":856,"qnumday":319,"qnumall":"[58189\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500085#WRP04300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of usable cells in each prison and overall across the State;

No information on notifications received under the Act will be released until after that report has been laid.<\/p>  <p>  The State Claims Agency hosts the National Incident Management System (NIMS) which is the principal source of national data on incident activity for the Irish public health service. Under the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2000 State authorities are obliged to report adverse incidents promptly to the State Claims Agency (SCA). This allows the SCA, in conjunction with State authorities, to identify and analyse developing trends and patterns and to work with the State authorities concerned to develop and implement risk mitigation strategies. It is also important in the investigation of any subsequent claim.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500086#WRS01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":877,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500086#WRS01400"},{"type":"question","counter":878,"qnumday":326,"qnumall":"[58070\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500086#WRS01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons over 18 years of age who are awaiting first-time intervention for occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, physiotherapy and psychotherapy in CHO 8, by individual area, in tabular form;

The dental care is provided by independent dental practitioners who have a contract with the HSE.

Regretfully, the COVID-19 pandemic caused the roll-out of the Policy to be delayed and the proposed review of the DTSS contract to be deferred.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, there has been continued engagement between my officials, the HSE and the dental community throughout the pandemic on infection control measures, guidelines for safe dental practice, and ensuring that dental professionals were included in the high-risk group for early vaccination. This sustained engagement was with a view to ensuring that a safe satisfactory service could be continued for the eligible population.<\/p>  <p>  I have acknowledged that there is a need for a substantive review of the DTSS and have given a commitment that the review would be undertaken.

The Taskforce was convened in September 2019, to improve health outcomes and health experiences for women and girls.<\/p><p>  Significant activity is currently underway to enhance the supports available to women through the menopause. Minister Donnelly announced his commitment to establish dedicated specialist menopause clinics across Ireland on the 10th of September. These clinics will form a core part of a new approach to menopause care for women in Ireland and will be supported by enhanced community and primary care supports as well as the publication of targeted and trusted sources of information for women experiencing menopause.<\/p><p>  The first phase of change will include the development of a dedicated specialist menopause clinic, in the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street this year. The clinic will be multidisciplinary supported by GPs with a certified special interest in the area of menopause and clinical nurse\/midwife specialists. In addition to seeing women who meet the clinical criteria for referral to the service, the clinical team will also provide advice and guidance to GPs in the community to support the effective management of menopausal symptoms for women closer to home within primary care. Further details on this announcement can be found here:<\/p><p>www.gov.ie\/en\/press-release\/bf7d4-minister-for-health-announces-a-new-approach-to-menopause-care-for-women-in-ireland\/<\/p><p>Funding for a further three specialist menopause clinics were announced within Budget 2022.<\/p><p>Additional activity underway and planned in the area of menopause includes:<\/p><p>- GP training is a key aspect of women receiving the best care through menopause. The Irish College of GPs are active members of the Women's Health Taskforce and continue to be engaged on how women's health can be better considered within the primary care setting. Relevant activity includes the collaboration between ICGP and the British Menopause Society to develop training in menopause management, which is currently in place; a recent ICGP Women&rsquo;s Health Webinar on menopause and endometriosis which was held in June 2021 and had 1567 attendees; and a GP Education course which was established in September 2021 in the area of Community Gynaecology Course which includes menopause as a topic. Funding has been provided through the Women's Health Fund to develop a 'quick reference guide' for GPs on the menopause, to support primary care provision in this area. The Minister has outlined his support for a new ICGP post of Clinical Lead for Women&rsquo;s Health in General Practice, the first such post in Ireland. This is currently being progressed and will enable the development of a comprehensive life-course approach to women&rsquo;s health in General Practice.<\/p><p>- A number of health topics relating to women's health, including menopause, have recently been updated and are now live on the HSE A-Z. This information is an important first step towards delivering enhanced information and education on menopause. A public information webinar on the menopause is scheduled for November 29th 2021. <\/p><p>  - A civil service webinar on 'Menopause at work' was held on October 18th, and further HR training to better understand the challenges and solutions for supporting women in their menopause journey within the civil service will be held on November 30th.  The Healthy Workplace Framework is due to be published in the coming months. Following publication, an Implementation Group will be established with responsibility for developing an action plan. A representative from Women&rsquo;s Health will be included on the Implementation Group to ensure the needs of women in the workplace are incorporated. This has particular reference to increased awareness of menopause within the workplace.<\/p><p>  In addition to the activity outlined above, menopause will continue to be a priority for the Women's Health Taskforce for 2021 and 2022. Hormone replacement therapy, and in particular the cost of hormone replacement therapy, has been highlighted by women as an area they would like further attention on. Further research is required to understand the cost and benefit of such a development. This will be considered when planning for further menopause activity to take place in 2022. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500087#WRT01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Healthcare Infrastructure Provision","counter":949,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500087#WRT02000"},{"type":"question","counter":950,"qnumday":350,"qnumall":"[58194\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500087#WRT02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the application by Children's Health Ireland for funding to increase capacity in Crumlin and Temple Street hospitals; the timescale for a decision on this application; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":951,"content":"<p>As the Health Service Executive is responsible for the delivery of public healthcare infrastructure projects, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly in relation to this matter. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500087#WRT02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Birth Certificates","counter":952,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500087#WRT02300"},{"type":"question","counter":953,"qnumday":351,"qnumall":"[58209\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500087#WRT02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide a list of the current average waiting times to obtain a first-time birth certificate for a child, in each county, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1514","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":954,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500087#WRT02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Register Office","counter":955,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500087#WRT02600"},{"type":"question","counter":956,"qnumday":352,"qnumall":"[58210\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500087#WRT02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the nature of the contractual relationship between organisations (details supplied) and the HSE.","asker":"1514","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":957,"content":"<p>The General Register Office (Oifig An Ard-Chl&aacute;raitheora) is the central civil repository for records relating to births, stillbirths, deaths, marriages, civil partnerships and adoptions in Ireland. <\/p><p>The General Register Office (GRO) operates under the aegis of the Department of Social Protection and has responsibility for the administration of the Civil Registration Service in Ireland. <\/p><p>As the Deputy's question relates civil registration services, he should redirect his question to the Minister for Social Protection for reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500087#WRT02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":958,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500087#WRT02900"},{"type":"question","counter":959,"qnumday":353,"qnumall":"[58211\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112500087#WRT03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to a development proposal by the National Orthopaedic Hospital, Cappagh for greatly expanded paediatric services, which are estimated could be provided within a year, in view of the excessively long children's waiting lists for surgery; if he will give urgent consideration to this proposal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":960,"content":"<p>National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh is Ireland&rsquo;s major centre for Elective Orthopaedic Surgery.

My priority as Minister for Health, and that of this Government, is to improve waiting times for all patients accessing hospital treatment. Reducing the paediatric orthopaedic waiting list remains a priority within that.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years there has been an increased investment in paediatric orthopaedics, which has enabled improved access to surgery and outpatient appointments. In 2018 CHI (previously the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group) was provided with an additional &euro;9 million in funding to address paediatric orthopaedic waiting lists, including the provision of scoliosis services. This funding is recurring and has been provided in the base HSE allocation each year since 2018 to fund orthopaedic services.<\/p>  <p>  The additional funding supported the recruitment of approximately 60 WTEs in 2018 and 2019 to enable the expansion of paediatric orthopaedic services. The posts relate to the multi-disciplinary team at diagnosis, pre-assessment, during surgery in theatre, and post operatively. The posts included a number of grades and specialties, including Consultants, Registrars, Radiographers, Clinical Nurse Managers, Staff Nurses, Physiotherapists, Occupational Therapists, and associated administrative posts. <\/p>  <p>  Most recently. a new Orthopaedic Consultant with a special interest in neuromuscular conditions was appointed to Temple Street in September, which should enable the use of additional theatre capacity and support additional capacity as part of the Cappagh Kids programme. <\/p>  <p>  As part of CHI&rsquo;s paediatric orthopaedic service, children with the most complex needs are treated at Crumlin and Temple Street. The National Orthopaedic Hospital at Cappagh provides additional capacity for the treatment of less complex orthopaedic patients, including routine scoliosis procedures. In terms of the provision of Spina Bifida services, CHI have advised my Department that the majority of children under 16 years of age in Ireland with Spina Bifida attend CHI at Temple Street. During 2021 CHI at Temple Street doubled capacity from 2 Multidisciplinary(MDT) clinics to 4 MDT outpatient clinics per month. The Spina Bifida MDT clinics involve clinicians and specialties in Neurodisability, Neurosurgery, Orthopaedics, Urology, Occupational therapy, Physiotherapy, Neuropsychology, Medical Social worker, and Clinical Nurse Specialists. <\/p>  <p>  CHI has advised the Department that this capacity increase is expected to provide each child with an annual review and will reduce the waiting time for follow up appointments. These clinics are based around a child-focused, enablement approach to disability. Patients see the above clinicians on the same day allowing for a shared and collaborative approach to care.<\/p>  <p>  CHI have further confirmed that ultimately, all children in Ireland with Spina Bifida will access the MDT service in the new children&rsquo;s hospital when it opens as part of the new paediatric model of healthcare services across Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  This Government remains committed to improving access to hospital appointments and procedures. For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors.

To aid recognition and management of those affected, the WHO has recently through a global consensus process proposed a working clinical case definition of Post COVID-19 syndrome occurring 3 months from the onset of COVID-19, with symptoms that last for at least 2 months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. Common symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, cognitive dysfunction and others which generally have an impact on everyday functioning. Symptoms may be new onset, following initial recovery from an acute COVID19 episode, or persist from the initial illness. Symptoms may also fluctuate or relapse over time. However, the WHO notes that this definition may change as new evidence emerges and our understanding of the consequences of COVID-19 continues to evolve.<\/p>  <p>  Patients with persistent symptoms following COVID-19 infection may be followed up by their GP or in hospital settings as clinically appropriate.

Significant time and resources continue to be devoted to dealing with the backlog and this is beginning to have the desired effect.<\/p><p>We have issued on average 118 licences per week in the last 12 weeks. This means that licences are issuing at nearly double the rate of applications received during this period and every week means a net reduction in the number of licences on hand.

As regards felling licences, we have issued over 830 private felling licences.

My Department has placed a contract for the regulatory review with report due by end February, 2022.  It will review the existing statutory framework for the licensing of forestry activities in relation to environmental and public participation obligations in order that practical advice can be provided to the Department on how to work more efficiently within the existing legal framework. <\/p><p>In addition, an independent Systems Analyst is conducting an end-to-end process review with a view to licensing process improvement has  recently completed an interim report on this work.<\/p><p>There has been significant work carried out on all other aspects of Project Woodland  and some of these, along with the process and regulatory review, will inform the setting of definitive timelines for the delivery of forestry licences which has been raised by SEEFA.

In support of this, it is worth noting that under the CSP, direct payments remain  eligible to be made on areas afforested.<\/p><p>In conclusion, I recognise the momentum and progress made under Project Woodland and the increased momentum in terms of licences issued.
