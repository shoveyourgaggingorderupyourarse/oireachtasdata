Broadly speaking, for the majority of projects the times are currently being met.  Of the 15 projects, five are being led by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, of which four projects were dependent on acceptance of the pay agreement and of associated recommendations of the Public Service Pay Commission, which has now occurred.  The fifth project, the review of pay structures, is a medium-term project being led by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The remaining ten projects are being led by my Department, of which eight are up and running as follows.  The review of technical pay, R2, is well advanced with an initial priority for the Air Corps, the Naval Service and the Communications and Information Services Corps, CIS.  This was to be focused on one group but I insisted that we prioritise the three areas in which we have the most challenges, namely the Air Corps, the Naval Service and the CIS.  Maybe if the Deputy thinks I should take one of them out, he will tell me which one.  The project on the incentivised long service pay arrangement is progressing well.  A draft report has been prepared and is currently under consideration with the Department of Defence and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Project R5 is nearing completion.  Project R6 is progressing well and is on target for completion next year.  Project R7 is on target and significant research is ongoing through the Defence Forces mental health and well-being working group.

If the Minister of State and his team are not meeting the outcomes around retention initiatives that are listed in the specific timelines referenced in the pay commission process, the delays will result in bigger retention difficulties for our Naval Service, Army and Air Corps.

The Minister of State can say that the reviews are ongoing and things are broadly on track but that is just nebulous nonsense.  People are still leaving.  The rate of attrition and the exodus are still ongoing and we have collapsing structures that have not changed since the outcome of the pay commission report.  If the Minister of State wants a bit of praise about it, fine, but the outcome is that we are heading towards 8,000, which is far away from the target of 9,500.

The Defence Forces are fully funded for 9,500 personnel.  This has led to reduced operational availability in certain areas.  This continues to be closely monitored and managed and safety remains a key priority for me.<\/p>  <p>  The report of the Public Service Pay Commission on retention and recruitment in the Permanent Defence Force has been accepted by Government.  It contains a broad range of recommendations to address recruitment and retention difficulties, some of which will provide immediate benefits to members of the Defence Forces.  Immediate measures include a 10% increase in military service allowance, the restoration to pre-Haddington Road levels of certain specific Defence Forces allowances, the restoration of premium rates for certain weekend duties and the return of an incentive scheme to address pilot retention issues in the Air Corps.  These measures, which will cost approximately &euro;10 million per annum, have been accepted by the Permanent Defence Force representative associations and are in the course of being implemented.  In addition, the report provides for an examination of pay structures in the PDF and the identification of other retention measures, which will be progressed within the framework of the public service stability agreement and future public sector pay negotiations.  The report also contains a range of other recommendations aimed at improving workforce planning, recruitment and conditions of service in the PDF.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has prepared a detailed implementation plan setting out timelines and objectives to deliver on the pay commission&rsquo;s recommendations.  Under my direction, this work is being prioritised by civil and military management.  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 provides for increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the agreement.  The increases due to date under the agreement have been paid to members of the Defence Forces, the most recent being a 1.75% increase on annualised salaries from 1 September 2019.  Further increases in pay are scheduled in 2020.

The military authorities have assured me that they have responded to all requests for EOD support made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

Ireland does not have any relationship with the FCAS programme, which I understand is a programme operating outside the EU.  Ireland does have a relationship with other EU member states in regard to the development of defence capabilities within the treaties as part of the European Defence Agency, EDA, and permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, which we signed up to recently. The EDA is focused on assisting member states in improving defence capabilities through European co-operation.  The EDA affords EU member states the opportunity to keep track of best practice in modern technology in the development of capabilities, and supports greater efficiency and competition in the European defence equipment market.  The primary reason for Ireland's participation is to support the development of Defence Forces capabilities for peacekeeping and international crisis management operations.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is involved in a number of EDA projects, including maritime surveillance, cyber, counter-IED, satellite communications and military search.  Participation in all of these projects was approved by D&aacute;il Eireann.  Ireland is also involved in the EDA Smart Blue Water Camps project.  This is a water management project that aims to address environmental concerns with regard to water usage on military bases.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is participating in two PESCO projects, namely, the European Union Training Mission Competence Centre and the upgrade of maritime surveillance.  These projects relate to the ongoing development of Defence Forces capabilities for peace support and crisis management operations. <\/p>  <p>  The establishment of PESCO represents a further development in EU co-operation in support of international peace and security under the Common Security and Defence Policy.  Under PESCO, member states come together in different groups to develop and make available additional capabilities and enablers for peacekeeping and crisis management operations.  Joint projects should also drive down the costs of developing and procuring capabilities.<\/p>  <p>  Within the EU, it is accepted that defence and security comprise a national competence and that any decisions, including any deepening of EU co-operation, require unanimity.  Through our participation in initiatives such as the EDA and PESCO, Ireland continues to have a strong and equal voice on defence issues within the EU institutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110700006#D02500","speaker":"1365"},{"type":"speech","time":1573124400,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the reply.

The works have now commenced.  Work on the upgrading\u00a0and refurbishment of the existing accommodation for 80 personnel in blocks\u00a01 and 2 at Cathal Brugha Barracks has\u00a0also commenced.

Members of the Permanent Defence Force also cannot become members of a trade union.  To compensate for these limitations, a range of statutory redress mechanisms is available to serving members, including the redress of wrongs, an Ombudsman for the Defence Forces and a conciliation and arbitration scheme for members of the Defence Forces.<\/p>  <p>  In 2017, the European Committee of Social Rights, in a non-binding ruling, upheld the prohibition of the right of military personnel to strike but concluded that Ireland was in violation of Article 5 of the European Social Charter on the grounds of the prohibition against military representative associations from joining national employee organisations and in respect of Article 6.2 of the charter regarding the right to bargain collectively.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the basis for this complaint predates a number of significant Government initiatives.  With regard to collective bargaining, the Permanent Defence Force representative associations were afforded equal standing to other public sector trade unions and representative associations during the negotiations which led to the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020.  The findings of the European Committee of Social Rights were considered as part of an independent review of the conciliation and arbitration scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force, which was completed last year.  One of the recommendations from that review was that the official side should, with the consent of the Minister, engage in discussions with ICTU to explore the practicalities of a PDF representative association forming association or affiliation with ICTU, while giving due consideration to any likely conflict that might arise between such an arrangement and the obligations of military service.<\/p>  <p>  Association with ICTU poses complex questions for the Defence Forces from a legal, operational and management perspective.  I asked my officials to examine this matter further and defence management, both civil and military, has engaged in discussions with ICTU.  Defence management has met the Permanent Defence Force representative associations, the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers and the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association to discuss this matter.  I have also discussed the matter of ICTU affiliation or association with RACO and PDFORRA.  I am aware of PDFORRA's long-standing desire to affiliate with ICTU.  I am also aware that RACO has a conflicting position on this matter.

I recently visited the Curragh Camp with other members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence.

A number of issues arose.  The review of pay is a key consideration.  Even members who do not want to leave the Defence Forces referred to the extra stress and strain being placed on them as a result of the loss of personnel in their units.

That is at the heart of whatever we decide to do.  I do not think there is any fear of soldiers ever engaging in a green flu protest or striking.  It is not in their nature or in the oath they take.  When I say that there has been a failure in public sector pay talks, that is not a slight on the representative bodies.  The structure is wrong.  Some have suggested that we could have an independent pay review.  That would again leave the Defence Forces outside the room when everybody else was talking, which would be a mistake.  The idea of soldiers being treated the same as everybody else and being at the heart of the pay talks is key.

The White Paper provides that these reviews are to have a three-yearly cycle, with every second review being more comprehensive in nature and styled a strategic defence review.  The White Paper specified that the first in this new cycle of reviews would be a White Paper update.<\/p><p>A joint civil-military working group formally commenced work on the White Paper update in July 2018, as laid down in the White Paper, and work on the update is now complete.  The completion of the update was led by me, while the process was managed by a high-level joint civil-military steering group.  Beneath this, a working group comprising civil and military representatives has worked in support of the steering group.<\/p><p>The process undertaken to carry out this update looked at three broad strands.  The first of these strands was a security environment assessment.  An interdepartmental and inter-agency defence and security environment assessment group was established to review and update the security environment assessment.  The work of this group was led by the Department of Defence and also comprised representatives of the Departments of the Taoiseach; Justice and Equality; Foreign Affairs and Trade; and Communications, Climate Action and Environment; as well as the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This was done in order to situate appropriately the defence policy response in terms of the lead or supporting roles that defence plays.<\/p><p>The second strand dealt with progress on White Paper implementation.  Since publication of the White Paper, a total of 95 separate projects have been identified for completion over a ten-year period.

In this spirit, I met with members of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence, on 5 March 2019 in regard to both the White Paper update and the process of establishing the fixed cycle of defence reviews.

There is a serious concern that all of the commitments mentioned in the White Paper have taken a complete back seat since the Minister of State published the Public Service Pay Commission report, and there is a complete information vacuum for the representative associations.  The Minister of State has given little detail about what the outcome of the White Paper update is.  Will he publish it?  Many of the remarks he made at the Oireachtas committee were that he is reviewing the White Paper, and there is this ongoing review nonsense that he mentioned previously.

All of the elements of public service broadcasting, as an ethos, are important parts of this equation that are sometimes taken for granted, particularly by the Government.  We read late last night that RT&Eacute; plans to save &euro;60 million over the next three years by imposing a range of cuts, including 200 staff redundancies.  That is not good enough, and it would not be good enough for anybody in any organisation, that those redundancies were notified to staff through media leaks late last night.  RT&Eacute; is under substantial financial pressure as a result of reduced advertising income, changes in viewership patterns, online trends and global changes.  There has been a substantial lack of engagement from the Government about RT&Eacute;'s funding model and about licence fee evasion.  Rather than dealing with the challenges faced by RT&Eacute;, the Government is constantly trying to kick the can down the road.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland's licence fee evasion rate of 14% is the highest in Europe.  It results in a loss of approximately &euro;25 million a year.  Another 11% of households do not pay the licence at all, which accounts for a further &euro;20 million.  The T&aacute;naiste is familiar with this information.  It is not new to the Government.  The members of the Government and its predecessor have stuck their heads in the sand.  They have discussed the proposed broadcasting charge lengthways and sideways without making a decision, in the full knowledge of the challenges being faced by our entire media industry.  They have said they will make a decision in five years' time.  The Government has been procrastinating on changing this country's defamation laws, which are regularly described by outside independent experts as having a chilling effect on the way Irish print and broadcasting media do their work.  As a result of the Government's inertia, inaction and head-in-the-sand approach, RT&Eacute; has announced that there will be 200 redundancies, its presence in Limerick will be downgraded, some of its assets will be sold, the pay of all staff will be frozen indefinitely and the pay of top earners will be reduced by 15%.  I have read in the past few minutes that the Government is focusing on cutting the pay of top presenters while ignoring the 200 redundancies and the indefinite pay freezes that are to be imposed on those on the lowest incomes.<\/p>  <p>  The cuts in RT&Eacute; are in addition to those in other media organisations.  Virgin Media announced 60 cuts last week.  All of our newspaper groups are announcing regular job cuts.  The independent broadcasting sector is operating on a shoestring because of the lack of a coherent and cohesive Government policy that would defend the media as it faces the challenges I have mentioned and would defend public service broadcasting in general.  We must defend an independent media that asks hard questions and provides information.  We want such a media, but we will not pay for it.  When was the Government informed about RT&Eacute;'s plans?  Has the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, met RT&Eacute; management and board members?  Is the T&aacute;naiste interested in preserving and promoting an independent media, with public service broadcasting as a key part of it, or will he continue to keep his head in the sand while the media industry dies?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110700012#K00800","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"speech","time":1573128000,"counter":174,"content":"<p>It is appropriate that I begin by mentioning that one of my brothers works in RT&Eacute; and has been involved in the restructuring plans that have been publicised today.  It is important for me to say that for the record.<\/p>  <p>  In my view, public service broadcasting is more important than it has ever been.  Independent objective reporting of domestic and international affairs is absolutely crucial for any functioning democracy.  We must recognise that the landscape in which broadcasters operate is undergoing a transformation, which is giving rise to new challenges for the Government and for RT&Eacute; in terms of the need for reform.  Audiences are transitioning away from traditional platforms and are increasingly accessing content online through digital media.  Additional funding has been provided to RT&Eacute;.  Additional funding of &euro;10 million was allocated to the broadcaster between 2018 and 2019.<\/p>  <p>  In August, the Government accepted the recommendations of the working group on the future funding of public service broadcasting regarding the reform of the TV licence fee collection system.  As a result, TV licence fee collection will be put out to tender when the enabling legislation - the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2019, which recently passed Second Stage - is enacted.  This will allow a five-year contract for the service to be put in place, thereby giving the successful bidder an opportunity and an incentive to invest in a collection system that reduces evasion levels, which are far too high.  According to the official figure I have seen, the current evasion rate is 12.83%.  This does not compare well with other countries.  The Government has agreed that at the end of the five-year contract period, the licence fee should be replaced by a device-independent broadcasting charge, which will take account of technological change and will enable the sustainable funding of public service content in the longer term.  That is welcome.  It is not appropriate to continue to pay for public service broadcasting into the medium term by imposing a charge or a licence fee in respect of television ownership.  We know that at least 10% of homes do not have televisions.  People in those homes watch content online on tablets, iPads and computer screens.<\/p>  <p>  We are adapting from a public policy perspective and from a funding approach perspective.  It is important to say that even though RT&Eacute;'s commercial income decreased significantly during the recession - by &euro;100 million, from &euro;250 million to &euro;150 million - it was in a position to break even in 2013 and 2014.  Its commercial revenue has been largely stable since then.  It remained at approximately &euro;150 million between 2013 and 2018.  Licence fee revenues increased from &euro;179 million to &euro;189 million over the same period.  RT&Eacute;'s operating costs increased by approximately 11% during that period.  We will play our part from a policy point of view.  We expect RT&Eacute; to evolve and to make the decisions that are necessary to respond to dramatic changes in consumer approaches to media.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110700012#K00900","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1573128000,"counter":175,"content":"<p>Nothing the T&aacute;naiste said is new.

Lying in bed week after week is detrimental to his physical and mental well-being, while this man could be back in his own home with a minimum amount of home help.  Another of my constituents is a woman with stage 4 cancer.  Her family has been repeatedly told that no home help hours are available to her.<\/p>  <p>  I know hundreds of others in a similar position to these patients.  This is just the tip of the iceberg with regard to people looking for new home help hours.  These people need help with everyday simple tasks such as getting out of bed, washing, dressing, attending to personal care, feeding and taking medication.  The most basic things that we all take for granted are being denied to these vulnerable people.<\/p>  <p>  I have heard from home helps throughout the country that the situation is at crisis level such that where an existing home help goes out sick, no replacement home help is available and many elderly and vulnerable are forced to stay in bed and wait until the home help returns while receiving a basic level of care from a kind-hearted neighbour who is untrained to look after a vulnerable person with special care requirements.  This embargo completely contradicts everything the Government has said about supporting community-based care and helping people to remain in their homes for as long as possible.  It also contradicts the principles of Sl&aacute;intecare whose focus is on shifting care from the acute sector to the community.<\/p>  <p>  In my constituency I know of several cases of elderly people who are being placed in residential care because their families cannot provide the care they need without home help support.  These people could stay at home under a modest HSE home care package among their family and friends in their own community at little cost to the State.  Instead, many have no choice but to go down the fair deal route, forcing people to end their days away from family and people they value most and at an enormous expense to the State.<\/p>  <p>  It is widely accepted that due to medical advances in the previous century, people are living longer, and therefore forward planning is vital to ensure people have a good quality of life, even in old age.  That includes enabling them to remain in their own homes for as long as possible with the provision of a home help as a basic support.<\/p>  <p>  While I acknowledge that 1 million extra hours were announced in the budget, that is a quarter of what is needed to clear the backlog that has built up, and they will only become available in 2020.  I ask the Government to lift the embargo on new home help hours.  Will the T&aacute;naiste instruct the Minister, Deputy Harris, to lift this embargo and give these vulnerable people the home help they need immediately as a matter of extreme urgency?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110700014#M00300","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1573129200,"counter":190,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue.

At the outset I said there had been a serious deterioration in the health service being delivered to the people during the lifetime of the Government.  Waiting lists are growing longer.  Every day I am fighting to get people off trolleys and given a bed in Cork hospitals.  SouthDoc services in parts of west Cork, particularly Castletownbere, have collapsed and SouthDoc in the rest of west Cork is on the verge of collapse.  People in pain waiting for hip and knee surgery are being left in pain.  People urgently waiting for cataract operations are left to go blind and this has all happened on the Government's watch.  The list of failures is endless and the people of west Cork and elsewhere feel the pain.  I have raised the issue of the lack of home help hours many times in the D&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>On 30 May last, I raised the issue of the embargo on new home help hours with the Minister of State with responsibility for older people but like the T&aacute;naiste he defended the Government line.  We read in the press in the past week that, while addressing a Home and Community Care Ireland conference recently, the Minister of State said he felt ashamed at the waiting list for home help hours.  By July of this year, the number waiting for home help hours had reached more than 7,300.  The home help service is in crisis.  Constituents of mine now tell me that people will not get home help if they are actively dying.  They have to be on a morphine pump to qualify for home help.  This is an outrage.  If we lived in a State where accountability was the norm, heads at the top would roll.  The 1 million hours in the budget is far too little far too late.

We need to continue to focus our investment and prioritise where it is needed most to make sure we have recruitment campaigns where there is pressure.  However, we also need to operate within budgets, otherwise parties in this House will rightly criticise the Government for dramatically increased Estimates at the end of the year for money that has not been accounted for.

It is a system that artificially inflates the market and is the single biggest transfer of public funds to private landlords in the history of the State.<\/p>  <p>  One aspect of this system that has worsened considerably in recent months is the processing times.  The delay in processing applications now averages nine weeks.  I will use Kildare County Council as an example.  It is now processing applications made in August.  This means that anyone who had found accommodation has to come up with the deposit, the one month's rent in advance, the October rent and now the November rent is due.  If that was totalled up for most parts of the country, it would amount to between &euro;6,000 and &euro;8,000.  HAP is paid to people who cannot pay the rents so it does not take a genius to figure out that this is a real problem and people are borrowing money, if they can do that.  The tenant and landlord are effectively in limbo.  If someone fails to pay the rent after securing a tenancy, the landlord has the right to issue a 14 day notice to pay the rent or consider the tenancy terminated.  I have spoken to genuine landlords and letting agents who do not want to be issuing notices to quit but cannot forgo two or three months of rent with little chance of its being backdated.  This is a very serious issue.  Fair is fair.  One letting agent told me that if he advertised a property in Kildare or west Dublin, he would expect to receive between 150 and 160 emails within 24 hours.  Of those, 70% would potentially be HAP tenants.  The people who are not HAP tenants have a better chance of getting the accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  There is a very real legal implication where there is a clear failure of Government policy.  Once people are deemed eligible for HAP, they are deemed to have had their housing need met and are removed from the social housing waiting list.  In the meantime, if their application is not processed in a timely fashion and their tenancy is legally terminated as a result, they are effectively homeless and have lost their place on the housing waiting list.  Is the T&aacute;naiste aware that this significant issue will add to the number of people becoming homeless?  This is the origin of some of that homelessness and it has to be addressed urgently.  What is the Government doing or going to do about this? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110700015#N00300","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1573129800,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I would like to talk to the Deputy in a bit more detail about some of the problems she has just outlined.  I am very familiar with HAP tenancies.  I was a Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government when we saw a shift away from rent allowance towards HAP because it provided more security of tenure for tenants and also more security and consistency for landlords as they were dealing with local authorities for payments rather than directly with tenants.  It also had more flexibility for tenants in terms of the support that local authorities could give.  Last year, 17,926 people moved into HAP.  It is a big part of social housing supports right now.  We will see an extra 10,000 social housing units coming into the stock of social housing this year and over time we will see less reliance on the private rental market to accommodate people who cannot afford to find accommodation themselves and more reliance on providing them directly with social housing.  As we build up our social housing stock, we will continue to rely on the private rental market.  We have to try to implement a model that gives as much certainty to tenants as possible and as much consistency as possible to landlords too.  That is what HAP attempts to do and does it reasonably well.<\/p>  <p>  If there are delays taking place or there are problems in HAP that create vulnerabilities, in particular for tenants, I would be interested in hearing about them.  The Government is not stuck to one approach.  We are constantly adapting and amending and trying to improve social housing provision through all the different ways we do that.  If there are details of problems in County Kildare, the Deputy can feed them through to me if she wants and I will certainly talk to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and we will try to address it, if there is a genuine concern that needs a policy response. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110700015#N00400","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1573129800,"counter":198,"content":"<p>I used Kildare as an example.

When HAP was introduced the resources were allocated to an agency in Limerick that would pay the amount to the person approved.  Approval happens at local authority level and that is where the delay is.  Either there are not enough resources or they are not being allocated to this.  I am seeing people evicted and taken off the housing list who become homeless.  I am not the only one.  I do not expect that I am some sort of a magnet for these cases.

We have an overreliance at the moment on the private rental sector for social housing solutions but that reliance is shrinking each year as we build up our social housing stock, which will increase by more than 10,000 this year and probably closer to 12,000 next year.  We are seeing dramatic investment.  Our housing budget for next year is, I believe, &euro;2.63 billion.  It has increased dramatically over the past four or five years because housing is needed and is a priority for Government.

However, will the Government review these new regulations with a view to rural-proofing them in such a way that new guidelines will not be detrimental to small schools in rural communities?

Those polling orders will be signed immediately thereafter, so people can get their poster teams at the ready for the by-elections that are about to get under way.<\/p><p>Frances Fitzgerald will be an enormous loss to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  A politician of renown, I was aware of Frances's commitment to social justice and equality before I entered politics.  She has served both her constituents and the people of Ireland with distinction.  Prior to being elected as a Deputy, she demonstrated her commitment to helping people in need in her career as a social worker and family therapist, working with inner-city communities in both Dublin and in London.  Recognised for her trailblazing work on equality, Frances served as the chair of the National Women's Council of Ireland from 1988 to 1992.  Her continued and relentless progression of the principle of inclusivity earned her the title of European Woman of the Year in 1992, the same year that she was first elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.<\/p><p>Frances's achievements in her parliamentary career range from serving as Leader of the Opposition in Seanad &Eacute;ireann to being a member of Government and T&aacute;naiste.  She has been at the centre of some of the most radical reforms undertaken in public life, including helping to establish the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in 2011, where she pioneered a number of groundbreaking reforms, including the comprehensive reform of our child protection and welfare systems.  She oversaw the successful children's referendum in 2012.  As Minister for Justice and Equality, she not only radically reformed the laws regarding sexual exploitation and sexual abuse of children but also introduced legislation for the holding of the marriage equality referendum, which saw Ireland become the first country in the world to vote in a referendum to introduce an equal right to civil marriage for same-sex couples in its Constitution in May 2015.  As Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, she established a Brexit loan scheme for small and medium-sized businesses, and worked to build new trading relationships and agreements abroad, which are critical to Ireland's future after our UK neighbours leave the European Union.  She was, as a Cabinet colleague, incredibly supportive of my own work as Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.<\/p><p>Knowing the central role that Ireland plays on the European stage, Fine Gael has a long history of sending experienced and capable politicians to represent us in the European Parliament.  I know that Frances will serve the people of Dublin with distinction over her term as an MEP.  The people of Lucan and Clondalkin have had the benefits of a Government party Deputy representing them, and I believe it is imperative that they retain this, because there are challenges before us in housing, education, and transport.  These challenges can only be met by a responsible, progressive and principled politician, someone, I believe, in the mould of Frances Fitzgerald.  There will be stiff competition, of course, as this by-election has some very fine candidates from all political parties and none seeking to secure the public support to serve in this House.  I hope this campaign will be fair and respectful, as our democratic process demands it.  The forthcoming by-election will give the people of Dublin Mid-West the opportunity to select someone to continue the work of Frances Fitzgerald and to build on her significant legacy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110700019#R01100","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1573132200,"counter":268,"content":"<p>I and my party agree with the motions to move the writs for the by-elections to be held at the end of November.

Billy was first elected to this House in 1997 until July of this year.  He was first elected to the Seanad in 1993 and served there until 1997.

The Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government of the day contended in the High Court that the court case and the court adjudicating on this matter would tear asunder the provisions of the Constitution.  Thankfully, the High Court found in my favour and against the Government of the day, stating that it was the ongoing failure of the Government to move the writ for the Donegal South-West by-election that offended the terms and spirit of the Constitution and its framework for democratic representation.  As you know, a Cheann Comhairle, I went on to win that by-election, and I can say that I like by-elections.  They are something that I look forward to.<\/p>  <p>  By-elections are an important part of our democracy.  While it is high time that this Government was put out of office and a general election called, these by-elections are important.  Sinn F&eacute;in will be fighting to win in all of these constituencies.  We have an excellent slate of candidates that have already been selected.  We have Councillor Thomas Gould in Cork North-Central, Councillor Mark Ward in Dublin Mid-West, a former mayor of South Dublin County Council, Councillor Ann Graves in Dublin Fingal, and Councillor Johnny Mythen in Wexford.<\/p> <p>All four are top-class activists who work day in, day out to stand up for ordinary people and deliver for their local communities.  They will, no doubt, provide first-class representation in the D&aacute;il.  I send them my best wishes and look forward to campaigning with them in the weeks ahead.<\/p> <p> There is no substitute to talking to voters on the doorsteps.  That is where we all get the real sense of where people are at.  I am aware that far too many are struggling.  There are families barely scraping by.  They are burdened by out-of-control living costs, sky-high rents, excessive childcare costs and rip-off insurance premiums.  These people have a voice here in the D&aacute;il in that they have Sinn F&eacute;in, a party that wants to give workers and families a break.  They have in Sinn F&eacute;in a party that stands up for ordinary people and delivers for local communities.  That is the basis on which we will be seeking a mandate in the by-elections.  It is to give people an alternative to the failed politics of Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il and the failed experiment that is the so-called new politics.<\/p> <p> The past three and a half years have seen a housing and homelessness crisis spiral out of control.  We have two parties that are wedded to failed policies and are doing nothing to improve circumstances for far too many ordinary workers and families.  We need to get back into a position in which the State and local councils are building homes.  Today we see again that the health service is in perpetual crisis.  Crime is spiralling out of control in both urban and rural areas.  Sinn F&eacute;in will take a fundamentally different approach to the conservative alliance of the two parties that control this place in tackling these issues, which affect ordinary people and communities.  We want to give people, including workers and families, a break.  To do so, it means helping renters and reducing rents by up to &euro;1,500 per year.  It means reducing the cost of childcare by an average of &euro;100 per month per child.  It means providing two free general practitioner visits for every person without a medical card so nobody will delay in going to a doctor because of worries about the cost.  It means ending the rip-off that we see with insurance premiums.  We would do all this along with tackling the serious issue of climate change.  One of the measures we propose is the introduction of free travel on public transport for passengers aged between five and 18.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in is the only party seriously committed to Irish unity.  While the other parties pay lip service to this issue, we want action.  We want preparation for unity, and that preparation must begin now.  An all-Ireland forum on Irish unity should be convened without delay to make the transition to a united Ireland a success for all who share this island, for our economy and for our public services.  We want a referendum on Irish unity and we want to win it.<\/p> <p> These by-elections are an opportunity for voters to vote for positive change.  I will appeal, today and over the coming weeks, to the people of Cork North-Central, Dublin Mid-West, Dublin Fingal and Wexford to vote for Sinn F&eacute;in, to vote for strong candidates and to make their voices heard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110700019#R01700","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573132800,"counter":275,"content":"<p>I welcome the moving of the four by-election writs today.  The Labour Party has four excellent candidates in the by-elections: Councillor John Maher in Cork North-Central; Councillor Duncan Smith in Dublin Fingal; Councillor Joanna Tuffy, a former Member of this House, in Dublin Mid-West; and the current Mayor of Wexford, Councillor George Lawlor, in my constituency, Wexford.<\/p><p>The four by-elections move us one step closer to getting rid of the current Government and allowing for real change.  I have said before that I do not have confidence in the current arrangements.  The Government has failed to deliver on affordable housing.  It presided over a shocking waste of public money on the national children's hospital and the national broadband plan.  It plans to give &euro;3 billion of the public's money to a private company rather than keep the broadband network in public ownership.  It has failed to address the shocking way in which women were treated by successive medics and officials in the CervicalCheck scandal.  It allowed State enterprises such as Bord na M&oacute;na to wither rather than invest in them and give them a new lease of life in the era of climate change.  Now it has failed to support the national broadcaster, RT&Eacute;, despite the Labour Party's proposal six years ago to fix the television licence system to sustain public broadcasting at the heart of our democracy.<\/p><p>The Government has failed.  It has no plan on poverty and no plan to reduce the cost of living, and it still finds money to give tax cuts to top earners.  Fianna F&aacute;il has supported the Government so I have no confidence in its being any different.  The four by-elections are not a choice between a Fianna F&aacute;il candidate and a Fine Gael candidate, as will be said by some.  That is no choice at all.  In the general election we last held, fewer than half of the voters opted for Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael.  In these four by-elections, the real choice will be between progressive candidates who will bring about real change and conservative candidates who will maintain the <i>status quo<\/i>.  If one looks at the 2016 election results in detail, one sees an interesting pattern.  In Cork North-Central, the combined vote for Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, Identity Ireland and Renua Ireland was 24,694.  The remainder was 26,480.  In Dublin Fingal, the combined conservative vote was 28,456 while the remainder was 31,932.  In Dublin Mid-West, the conservative vote was 18,366 while the remainder was 24,768.  In my constituency, Wexford, the combined conservative vote was 35,814, compared with 35,847 for the remainder.  In all these constituencies, the votes for Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael combined were less than the alternative.  Therefore, the conservative parties do not have an automatic right to win these by-elections.<\/p><p>The Labour Party is significantly different from the other parties.  I would like to reach out to all who want to build an alternative, including the progressives and the independents.  This will be the first step in an historic choice.  I sincerely hope that the opportunity will be grasped by the electorates in the four constituencies.  I know all the constituencies well.  I know all of the four candidates the Labour Party will have fighting in each constituency very well indeed.  I know my constituency, Wexford, best of all.  I am confident that in each of these battlegrounds, there will be a significant vote for change.  It will be the mark of a change of Government in the future.

In Cork North-Central, Solidarity will stand Councillor Fiona Ryan.  Do not estimate the righteous anger of those who see more than 600 people on hospital trolleys today, at a time when there are more than 10,000 nursing vacancies thanks to the Government's HSE recruitment freeze.  Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il have created a society in which 4,000 children have been made homeless, yet 3,000 others became millionaires last year.  The Government defends a capitalist market in which 100 corporations are responsible for more than 70% of carbon emissions.  It turns its back on a just transition and instead loads carbon taxes on the backs of working people.<\/p>  <p>  Councillor Fiona Ryan is the only elected female representative on Cork's north side.  She is the youngest elected representative contesting this by-election but, most important, she is the only elected representative contesting it who is a socialist.  Like the People Before Profit candidate in Dublin Mid-West, she offers an alternative to all the other parties, which, to one degree or another, bow before the altar of the capitalist market.  She finds herself in agreement with both Mr. Bernie Sanders and Mr. Jeremy Corbyn that a fair society, a society free from the rule of the profiteers, would have no billionaires and no one living in poverty.<\/p>  <p>  While campaigning on all issues that affect workers, women and young people, Solidarity will strive to make mental health a genuine issue in this by-election.  In the United Kingdom, 13% of the health budget goes towards mental health services.  In this country, the proportion is a mere 6%.  That is wrong.  It leads to great distress and loss of life and it must change.  Mental health is a complex issue.  Many factors are at play.  Who could deny, however, that precarious work, precarious housing and educational stresses are not major factors?  Who could deny that a system that puts profit before the needs of people is not a major driver of the mental health crisis in this society?  We aim to make this a real topic of conversation in Cork North-Central and beyond in November.

As a nurse, she knows only too well the challenges for nurses in this country but also the challenges facing the health system.  Some people come to activism by accident and others by choice or necessity when there is something wrong and they want to correct it.  They are not inspired to sit on these seats but to change things that they know are wrong in society.  There are many things wrong in society, especially in the context of housing, the health service and the direction in which Ireland is going.  Kellie is a fantastic person.  She is not a politician.

Her constituency of Donegal Fingal has certainly missed her.  I apologise, that was a mistake.  The constituency is Dublin Fingal.

Dean believes that our problems will not be solved by those who created them and has set out to work on that basis in everything he does.  He believes that short-term fixes when issues come to crisis point merely put a plaster on a gaping wound.

Deputy Pringle announced that Councillor Dean Mulligan is standing for Independents 4 Change in the by-election in the Dublin Fingal constituency.  Ruth Nolan will also stand for Independents 4 Change in the Dublin Mid-West constituency.  They both support the Right2Water movement's policy principles of the Right2Change.  The latter are ten human rights policies on water, jobs, decent work, housing, health, justice, education, democratic reform, equality, sustainable environment and natural resources.  Those human rights demands challenge establishment politics in Ireland and in Europe.  Ruth Nolan has a record of being an active trade unionist and a community critical activist all her life.  She is one of the key organisers of the Right2Water campaign in the South Dublin County Council area and she was also very involved in the movement to repeal the eighth movement.  A number of years ago, among many issues on which Ruth Nolan campaigned, she introduced a motion to South Dublin County Council to introduce reverse vending machines for cans and plastics.  She had the foresight to do that to challenge the waste created by plastics and cans in the area.  Following her tenacity and determination Repak put in place 13 vending machines throughout the area.  The people of Dublin Mid-West have a genuine opportunity now to vote for a real alternative and a genuine class and climate change fighter.  Ruth Nolan is an alternative to the \"Lanigan's Ball\" politics of this D&aacute;il played out by the establishment parties of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael whereby Fianna F&aacute;il steps out and Fine Gael steps in and then Fine Gael steps out and Fianna F&aacute;il step in again.  She is also an alternative to those parties who want to join in that dance and be coalition partners with those two establishment parties.  She is an alternative to that and she will stand with working class people in her community.  I hope she does very well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110700021#T00500","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1573133400,"counter":283,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Rural Independent Group, I welcome the Government's moving of the four by-election writs today.  It provides the people of Cork, Wexford and the Dublin constituencies a chance to show how the Government has failed the people.  In recent weeks and months many in west Cork thought that we would be facing a general election.  The people to whom I spoke were hungry for a general election because they have a message to send to the Government.<\/p>  <p>  We have a health crisis where millions of euro have disappeared into a hole in the ground.  That has left people without any home help service.  Others are left on lengthy waiting lists.  People are in pain who need hip and knee procedures.  People going blind need cataract procedures.  The SouthDoc service is collapsing around us.  More than 600 people are on hospital trolleys.  Such day-to-day issues cause enormous concern to people in the constituency of Wexford, Cork North-Central or the two Dublin constituencies.  The Government will fact those issues when they face the people in Cork South-West.<\/p>  <p>  Beef farmers are on their knees and have no one to fight for them.  Fishermen are struggling and are worried about their future.  Little or no money was allocated to the farm sector in the budget, all because of Brexit.  Only a lick and a promise was given to the fishing sector on the premise that if it happens, it happens and if it does not there may be a little compensation for fishermen to tie up their boats at the pier.<\/p>  <p>  School transport in west Cork is in a disastrous state, with young children left on the roadside.  Nobody is willing to resolve ongoing issues even though parents were informed they were resolved.  An announcement was made on the rural regeneration fund during the week but not one brown cent was allocated to the constituency of Cork South-West, which is sensational.  It is the second time running that no brown cent was allocated to the Cork constituency.  The third time the fund was rolled out, one project crossed the line.  The Government is sending a clear message to my constituency, which is not having a by-election.  It will send the Government a very clear message because very angry groups have been in contact with me in the past 24 hours asking why the constituency of Cork South-West is being continuously neglected when it comes to rural regeneration funds.  Surely be to God projects such as the one in Schull where &euro;500,000 has been spent qualifies in some manner for funding.

No matter how many advertisements one produces or efforts one makes, this is a serious issue.  The Government has removed them so there are now no registrars.  All of these people throughout west Cork and elsewhere, who had done Trojan work for a pittance, are gone.  The Government then wonders why people are not registered and voting.  The Government is the cause of that because it is not encouraging it from the ground up.  If the Government looks at the budget, it will see that these registrars cost a pittance.  It has decided to remove them and not give people their democratic right.  I could talk about homeless figures and such but I will not speak too much.

The issues being raised are issues that people will not want to give this Government a vote of confidence in, including health, traffic and housing.  It goes across the spectrum, including people being embarrassed about having to ask their parents to help, people having to stay at home for a long time and hidden homelessness.  The question of whether water is safe to drink came up, understandably in the current context.  The cost of living is something that people are acutely concerned about.  Those are the issues that I heard about on the doorsteps.<\/p>  <p>  Governments tend not to win by-elections except in very specific circumstances because the public view them as a second string election that give people a great deal of freedom to express the discontent that they feel, which so manifestly exists.  There tends to be low turnout in by-elections and we all need to encourage people to get out and vote.  I won a by-election in 2005 when Charlie McCreevy went off or was packed off to Europe, however one wants to look at it.  There were two by-elections on that day, with the other being in Meath.  The result came as a significant surprise to the political establishment.  Childcare was an issue for many young families in the commuter belt.  As a result, &euro;1,000 was allocated in respect of children under the age of five.  That was followed by the early childhood care and education, ECCE, year, which has been expanded to have a second year, which is a good initiative.  The public put that issue on the agenda.<\/p>  <p>  These by-elections represent a unique opportunity for people to have a say and to put items on the agenda that are not coming to the fore to the extent that they need to.

This will be the marker that will determine the kind of agenda that will be set for the general election.

I had the opportunity to similarly address the Seanad on 24 September last and to listen to the views of Senators on the report.  It was an interesting and wide-ranging discussion and I have no doubt Members in this House would also like to get their views on the record about this report.  I repeat my acknowledgement of and thanks for the work that has gone into the preparation of the report and the accompanying Bill by the 23 members of the group.  I also again thank Senator Michael McDowell for chairing the group.<\/p>  <p>  Before I comment on the report, I will give a quick reminder of the background and context that have brought us to this point.  First, the Government is committed to Seanad reform.  In order to progress that commitment, an independent working group on Seanad reform, chaired by Dr. Maurice Manning, was established in December 2014.  The principal focus of that group was on possible reforms of the Seanad electoral system and the manner in which it carries out its business within the existing constitutional parameters.<\/p>  <p>  The group published its report, known as the Manning report, in 2015, together with an accompanying Bill.  The key electoral reform recommendations in the Manning report were as follows: that the majority of Seanad seats would be elected by popular vote in a \"one person, one vote\" system; that this principle would be extended to include Irish citizens in Northern Ireland and those living overseas who hold a valid Irish passport; provision for online registration of voters and downloading of ballot papers; and a greater role for the Seanad in the scrutiny, amendment and initiation of legislation.<\/p>  <p>  A conservative estimate of the electorate under these arrangements is some 5.3 million people.  Since the publication of the Manning report, the Seanad has had a number of opportunities to discuss Seanad reform, including statements on the Manning report in July 2015.  A further opportunity arose in June 2016, when Senator McDowell, with a number of other Senators, introduced the Seanad Bill 2016, a Private Members' Bill based on that prepared by the Manning group.  However, it was apparent during the course of those discussions that while we had consensus on the need for change, we still did not have broad consensus on the detail of that change.<\/p>  <p>  Against that background, and with the agreement of all sides in the Seanad, the Seanad reform implementation group, chaired by Senator McDowell, was established.  Its main terms of reference were to consider how to implement the recommendations of the Manning report and whether any variations to those recommendations were needed.  The group was also asked to provide the text of a Bill to implement its proposals.  One of the features of the report is the lack of consensus among the group.  The report sets out different statements of position from members of the group who had dissenting views.  These range from re-examining the constitutional provisions in regard to the Seanad, with the aim of achieving more meaningful reform, to having an electorate composed only of residents in the State.<\/p>  <p>  Today's statements arise from the Government's consideration of the report and its wish to reflect on the position of the Oireachtas before taking any further steps.  Therefore, I am here very much to listen to the views of Members on Seanad reform.<\/p>  <p>  The group has not proposed any change to the widening of the electorate at Seanad elections from what was recommended in the Manning report.  The proposal to widen the electorate includes extending the franchise at Seanad elections to Irish citizens in Northern Ireland and those living overseas who hold a valid Irish passport.  The Government is proposing to hold a referendum to extend the franchise to citizens outside the State for presidential elections, and the relevant constitutional amendment Bill was published recently.  That referendum could serve as a useful barometer of the views of our existing electorate for extending the franchise in this way.  My view is that we should await the outcome of that referendum before proceeding with extending the franchise for Seanad elections.<\/p>  <p>  Turning now to the variations to the Manning recommendations proposed by the implementation group, the first of these is a proposed change to the number of Seanad Members who would be elected by the public.  The group now proposes that 34 of the 60 seats be directly elected from the five vocational panels, whereas Manning had recommended 36.  The group also proposes that 15 seats be elected from an electoral college of Deputies, outgoing Senators and elected county and city councillors.  This is two more than the 13 seats recommended in Manning.<\/p>  <p>  I am interested in the views of Deputies on the vocational panels, and there was a divergence of views in the most recent Seanad debate on this issue.  Is changing the number to be elected by the public and by elected Members, as proposed, satisfactory?  Are there more fundamental questions to be asked, for example, whether the panel structure, which was introduced with the Constitution in the late 1930s, is fit for purpose?  Do the proposed reforms of the panel system go far enough?<\/p>  <p>  I note that the implementation group supports the proposal in the Manning Bill for a single six-seat university constituency, the franchise for which would be extended to other institutions of higher education apart from the National University of Ireland and Dublin University.  This would give effect to the 1979 referendum on this point.  However, I also note with interest that the group did not have a consensus on this proposal.  An alternative proposal was recommended by some members of the group to divide the university constituency into three sub-panels, each of which would elect two Members.  Again, I am interested to hear the Deputies' views on that point.<\/p>  <p>  The implementation group proposes to depart from the Manning recommendation concerning the downloading of ballot papers by voters.  This recommendation removes existing doubts around the integrity of Seanad elections being compromised by the use of Internet or other technology.  My own view is that I agree with the implementation group on this point and I agree with the report where it concludes that we should tread carefully in the harnessing of technology in the context of the electoral process.<\/p>  <p>  As I mentioned, under the Manning proposals, a conservative estimate of the number of persons who would be entitled to register and vote in Seanad elections is some 5.3 million.  This figure is based on estimated numbers prepared by my Department in its publication, \"Voting at presidential elections by citizens resident outside the State\", which examines options for extending the franchise to citizens outside the State at a presidential election.  The implementation group does not propose any change to the electorate for Seanad elections proposed in the Manning report, so we are broadly looking at the same numbers.  There is no doubt about the operational and logistical challenges in dealing with such a large number of postal ballots, so careful planning and adequate resources would be needed.  It is also worth restating that widening the franchise for Seanad elections in this way means that the franchise in the State for Seanad elections would be wider than it is for D&aacute;il elections.<\/p>  <p>  The implementation group upholds the Manning recommendation that a separate register of Seanad electors should be established and maintained by a new Seanad electoral commission.  However, we estimate that nearly two thirds of those who would be entitled to be on the Seanad register are already on the register of electors maintained by local authorities.  The group puts forward the argument that having a separate register that requires voters to voluntarily apply for inclusion on the Seanad electoral register would mean that the register would largely be populated by members of the electorate who have demonstrated an interest in participating in Seanad elections.  This, the group argues, would reduce costs and limit the potential for voter fraud because there would be fewer unwanted or unused ballot papers in circulation.  The group anticipates that, under these arrangements, rather than there being a rush to register, the growth of the register would take place gradually.  The group also anticipates that the number of Irish citizens in Northern Ireland, as well as those living outside the State, who would exercise their right to register would be much lower than the total number entitled to register.  However, I am not entirely convinced by that argument as it is quite likely that the uptake to register at a Seanad election could be very high in Northern Ireland, and the same could be said for Irish citizens resident in the State.  I believe it is important that we design a system of electoral reform that accommodates the full potential electorate, rather than some anticipated reduced uptake of registered electors.<\/p>  <p>  I am also not convinced that having parallel registers, one for Seanad elections and one for all other elections, is the right approach, particularly in light of the work which is well advanced in the Department to overhaul and modernise the register of electors.  This is something that would require very careful examination.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the establishment of a Seanad electoral commission, this was originally proposed as an interim measure pending the establishment of an electoral commission.  However, work is well under way in my Department to prepare the general scheme of an electoral commission Bill.  An electoral commission will, therefore, be up and running sooner than previously thought, which means a Seanad electoral commission may not, and I believe would not, be necessary.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of other Seanad electoral reform proposals that still need to teased out more fully, and I will touch on one or two of these.  For example, it is proposed that when applying for inclusion on the register of electors, a voter would choose the constituency in which he or she would vote at Seanad elections.  This could give rise to some constituencies having significantly more voters relative to others and relative to their respective numbers of seats.<\/p> <p>As far as I can see, the implementation group's Bill does not make any provision for balancing constituencies.  How can this be achieved in a practical and manageable way?  I also note that there is provision in the text of the implementation group's Bill to place a limit on the period a person has been resident outside of the State in order to qualify to be registered at a Seanad election.  This would certainly limit the overall number of electors based overseas.  Obvious questions need to be addressed.  What period do we think would be fair?  How would it work in practice?  For example, how would we know for sure how long a person has been resident outside of the State?  Again, these issues need further consideration.<\/p> <p> There is no doubt but that a reformed Seanad electoral system as proposed would involve significantly increased costs.  I welcome the suggestions made by the implementation group to minimise costs where possible.  These include the use of ordinary post rather than registered or prepaid post and the combined candidate election literature rather than separate items of literature for each candidate.  We must bear in mind, however, that ballot papers and combined election literature would need to be sent to a significantly higher number of electors than is currently the case, so the costs would inevitably be significantly higher than at present.<\/p> <p> The Manning report recommends a number of non-statutory reforms to the way in which the Seanad conducts its business.  These could be implemented by the Seanad at any point, and the Seanad could consider doing so at the earliest opportunity.  Examples of such reforms include arrangements for Seanad scrutiny of reports from committees dealing with EU matters; debates on committee reports on EU matters being opened and closed by a Chairman or rapporteur or any member of the relevant committee nominated for that purpose; and regular scheduling of committee reports to improve the effectiveness of the House as well as the level of attention given to this work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110700023#Z00400","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573135200,"counter":308,"content":"<p>Does the Minister of State need much more time?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110700024#AA00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1573135200,"counter":309,"content":"<p>I just need about another minute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110700024#AA00300","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1573135200,"counter":310,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

The report points out, however, that vocational panels are not evident in the way in which debates are structured in the House.  Greater prominence could be given to the panels by periodically scheduling special debates on broad themes related to them.  Speaking arrangements could prioritise Senators elected to the relevant panels.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that we have not quite reached a consensus on Seanad reform proposals.  The Government wants to pursue consensus by working with Members of this House and the Upper House.  Today's debate provides a welcome opportunity for a conversation on electoral and non-electoral reforms of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I look forward to hearing the views of Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110700024#AA00500","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1573135200,"counter":312,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his very candid views on this topic.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the report of the Seanad reform implementation group as I was a member of the group, which met between May and November of last year.  When I looked at the filing cabinet this morning to refer to the documents and saw the number of lever arch folders we had amassed during that period, it just reminded me of the huge amount of documentation we pored over, examined and researched.  All the members of the group took their work extremely seriously.  The report was published on 19 December last year yet it has taken until now, nearly a year later, for this debate on the reforms proposed to take place.  I wondered whether it would ever happen at all.<\/p>  <p>  I pay tribute to Senator McDowell and all the officials for their work.  It was highly unfortunate that one member, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, ended up on the committee.  How a senior member of the Cabinet came to sit on this working committee I do not know, but his appearance for the vote for the chair was insightful in that it was about the only appearance he made over the course of seven months.  The election was won by Senator McDowell.  One can draw one's own conclusions from that.  We never saw the Minister again.<\/p>  <p>  One of the big driving forces for the group was to see the Seanad reform actually take place and to forge a link with the ordinary citizens of this country.  Nobody doubts the huge amount of work and extremely important legislative scrutiny conducted by Senators but, equally, nobody can deny there is a huge personal disconnect between the public and the Upper House because of its very narrow electoral base.  The Manning report, which was the base document for our group, and implementation of which is part of the Government's own programme, focused on the reforms necessary to the Seanad.  As a party, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows, Fianna F&aacute;il fully believes in reforming the Seanad and is committed to doing so.  Indeed, it was one of the only parties at the time of the referendum to seek the reform of the Upper House when others advocated abolishing it.  Their form of reform was the knife.  Thankfully, the people, in their wisdom, did not listen to them, but it is important that the Government listens to the people now in order that we might see real change.<\/p>  <p>  The implementation group agrees that 34 of the 60 seats from five vocational panels, as well as the institution of higher education seats, be directly elected by the people and that 15 seats be retained for an electoral college of Deputies, outgoing Senators and councillors.  What a change this would be, particularly when one considers that, at present, 43 of the 60 Senators are elected from the votes of just 1,167 people, namely, our councillors, Members of the D&aacute;il and outgoing Members of the Seanad.  Like the Minister of State, I served as a councillor.  I did so for 17 years.  Councillors value their votes and choose good, decent men and women to represent us in the Upper House.  However, I ask the House to imagine the engagement we could create with the people by moving the election of Senators from the hands of 1,167 people to the hands of the people of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I listened carefully to what the Minister of State said.  It is important to point out that the Seanad reform proposals do not seek to create a mini D&aacute;il because we will still have the vocational panels.  I was interested in the Minister of State's views on the vocational panels.  They are highly important in this regard in not creating a mini D&aacute;il because people would still have to qualify as candidates on these panels with the relevant expertise.  This would produce a different kind of debate in the Upper House.  We would have a very different scenario in terms of the people who would then present themselves for election and the scale of the electorate.  The Minister of State touched on this.  The scale of the battle to get elected might frighten some existing Senators and potential new Senators, but we debated this anticipated scale of the Seanad electorate at length at the committee, taking advice from people such as Dr. Maurice Manning and former Senator Joe O'Toole and experts such as Dr. Theresa Reidy.  In the report, we made the following point: \"It is anticipated that rather than there being a rush for inclusion in the Seanad electoral register, the growth of the Seanad electoral register will take place gradually over time and pro-active measures may need to be taken [...] to promote awareness and encourage registration.\"  When we refer to the need to encourage registration, this does not strike me as involving a mad rush of people to get onto the electoral register.  The report continues: \"In addition, when registering to vote in future D&aacute;il elections and local elections, voters may be asked if they wish to also register to vote in Seanad elections and if so, to merely indicate their preferred constituency.\"<\/p>  <p>  I argued at the time for the Seanad election to take place on the same day as the D&aacute;il election and that the panels of those running would be affixed to the wall as people came in such that they would be able to review it.  I pressed this point.  I know there were issues as to how the Constitution sets out the timeframe and so forth, but I thought it was worthy to boost participation in the Seanad election on the day.  It is also noteworthy that for the 2016 general election there were 3.3 million registered voters yet only 2.1 million people opted to cast their votes.<\/p> <p>At the time of the referendum on the eighth amendment of the Constitution, there were approximately 3.2 million registered voters but only 1.2 million people cast a ballot.  In the presidential election last year, approximately 3.4 million people were registered but only 1.4 million people cast a vote, while some 2 million did not.  As parliamentarians, we need to engage with the public in order to reverse this decline in voter participation which is mirrored in many democracies across the globe.  Seanad reform, through expanding the franchise, would be one such move.  <\/p> <p> The report anticipates that the number of Irish residents who apply to be registered and vote in a Seanad general election would be far lower than the number of people who participate in D&aacute;il elections.<\/p> <p> The extension of the vote to Irish citizens abroad presents an opportunity for Ireland to enable its emigrants to maintain a meaningful link with their home country.  The statistics presented by Dr. Theresa Reidy from UCC on this subject suggest it is not anticipated that there will be a mass influx of votes that could skew an election.  It would be a steady base.  We looked at various countries when we were examining this issue.  <\/p> <p> The Minister of State expressed fears and said he remained unconvinced that the number of potential voters in the North and abroad would not skew votes in the South.  What international expertise and documents did he use to formulate that opinion?  Over the course of the seven months, we examined numerous countries and looked at the trends over a series of elections and, if anything, there was a high engagement at the start and a tail-off after that.  There is a body of work to help ensure interest is maintained when the franchise is extended abroad and to Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p> Senator McDowell, in presenting his report last December, stated that the Bill should be introduced to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann rather than into the Seanad and that reform of the Seanad is not a matter best left to the initiative of the unreformed Seanad but is a matter on which the will of the people, as expressed through the D&aacute;il, should be ascertained and implemented.  I agree with that and ask the Minister of State to act swiftly on this.  I look forward to continued debate on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110700024#AA00600","speaker":"1218","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573135800,"counter":314,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to debate this issue and take part in contributions and statements on the report of the Seanad reform implementation group.<\/p>  <p>  I do not think the Minister of State will disagree when I say that there have been far too many reports on Seanad reform, none of which has been implemented to any significant degree, if at all.  We could all wallpaper our living rooms with the number of reports that have been done on Seanad reform.  There has been a debate on Seanad reform in both Houses of the Oireachtas for every week that I have been on the planet which is a considerable amount of time.  We have had any number of debates on Seanad reform in this House and the Seanad.  There was a call for a debate on Seanad reform almost every week when I was a Senator and yet nothing was ever done.<\/p>  <p>  It is interesting that this report comes from the Manning report in 2014.  We have a history of doing reports, not agreeing with everything that is contained in them, and then setting up a working group to look at the report that was done.  We then do not agree with the conclusions of the working group which was looking at a report with which we do not agree.  We have not, for whatever reason, got to a point where we can implement reforms on which we agree but we do not have to agree on everything to initiate reform.<\/p>  <p>  People want reform.  I supported abolition of the Seanad at the time of the referendum, although not without giving the matter a great deal of thought.  The only reason I supported abolition at the time was that the option of reform was not on the ballot paper.  We were given a straight proposition to either support the Seanad as it was or support its abolition.  However, much of the commentary around that referendum was about reform.  Many people who were arguing that people should vote to retain the Seanad were arguing that we retain it, reform it, make it work, make it more democratic and inclusive, bring it closer to people and make it a second Chamber that would actually work for citizens.<\/p>  <p>  The one thing that comes up in all of these debates on political reform, whether reform of the D&aacute;il or Seanad, is that no one likes to give up power.  This Government has been in power for the past four years and is still in power despite any amount of commentary around when an election might take place, mainly because the Government does not want to give up that power.  It is the same with reform of the D&aacute;il.  The Executive does not want to cede power to the D&aacute;il, the D&aacute;il does not want to cede power to the Seanad and neither House of the Oireachtas or any Department wants to cede power to local government.  We go around the houses and around in circles on reform of local government, the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.<\/p>  <p>  Behind all of those reports and despite differences that exist between different parties, reports and working groups, some basic things can and should be done.  These require legislation.  The Government has said in the past that the Opposition can bring forward legislation but it is, in the first instance, primarily the responsibility of the Government to do that.  There has been controversy this week about how many Bills are stuck with money messages and opposed by the Government.  The Government can deal with this by bringing forward legislation that deals with some of the areas on which there is consensus and agreement.  That would be a starting point.  The areas of difference can be addressed separately and I will get to that in a few moments.  <\/p>  <p>  The reforms Sinn F&eacute;in wants would require further constitutional change.  I can understand the reluctance of the Government to go back to the people on Seanad reform because it got what the Taoiseach described at the time as a wallop on the issue.  It is somewhat understandable that the Government does not want to go back to the people.  Having said that, we argued at the time that it would have been better if the option of a reformed Seanad had been put to the people, rather than the straight proposition of abolition.  We would be in a better position if that had been done.  However, the decision by the people to reject the simple proposition of abolition is not an excuse for refusing to go back to the people.  We could reasonably say that, having gone away and reflected on the referendum result, we acknowledge the will of the people to keep the Seanad and are now offering a reform proposition that goes beyond the scope of the Manning report and the working group, which precluded any findings that would encroach on constitutional reform.  There needs to be constitutional reform if we want to do away with the elitist nature and some of the undemocratic elements of the Seanad.<\/p>  <p>  Either deliberately or unintentionally, the Minister of State in the past expressed a view that Sinn F&eacute;in had dissented from the report.  Sinn F&eacute;in put forward a supplementary opinion on the report to the effect that we wanted it to go further but it was not possible to do so under the terms of reference of the working group.  We wanted to see constitutional reform, an issue I will address shortly, but, notwithstanding that, we are happy for many of the recommendations of the working group to be legislated for in order that there is at least some degree of reform.  It would not be good for either House of the Oireachtas to go back to the people and for the term of both Houses to end without any reform, given that we had a referendum.  It would not be good if we simply carried on regardless with the same arrangements and with no reform at all.<\/p>  <p>  One of the constitutional changes we looked for was the abolition of the Taoiseach's nominees.  I understand this provision is in place to ensure the Government of the day has a majority in the Seanad.  In recent times, however, when the Government has not had a majority or has been close to not having one, the house of cards has not fallen down.  We could easily do away with the Taoiseach's nominees.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has also called for Seanad elections to be held on the same day as the general election so that candidates would have to choose which House they wanted to serve in.<\/p> <p>If candidates have to choose what House they want to serve in, the Seanad will no longer be a House where aspiring politicians like me can spend a bit of time before getting elected to the D&aacute;il.  Equally, many people who fail to get elected to the D&aacute;il end up going back to the Seanad.  I say this not with a sense of irony, but in all sincerity as someone who used the Seanad as best I could before I found myself in this Chamber.  It would be better if we were very clear on the respective roles of the two Houses of the Oireachtas.  If the elections to both Houses took place at the same time, people could choose which House they want to serve in.<\/p> <p> We want the requirement for postal votes to be abolished and provision to be made for equal gender representation.  Seanad reform gives us a good opportunity to deal with gender representation in the Oireachtas.  Nominating bodies, panels, list systems and other methods should be used to make provision for representation from traditionally marginalised groups in society.  Having said that, we would be quite happy to see the recommendations made in the report we are discussing being implemented as soon as possible, even before Sinn F&eacute;in enters Government and initiates constitutional reform at some point in the future.  I do not think we are going to get such reform from the Government party that got what it described as a \"wallop\" the last time it proposed reforms in this area.<\/p> <p> I would like to ask a few simple questions.  Will the Government initiate legislation on this issue?  I am not sure how many months it has left in office.  There has been a great deal of speculation about the date of the next general election.  Regardless of when it takes place, does the Government intend to introduce legislation?  Will returning Seanad election candidates go back to their respective constituencies without having achieved any reform?  That would be a sad day for the reform of both Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p> When we critique Government plans, budgets or policies, it is often suggested by the Taoiseach or one of his Ministers that we have no policies of our own, even though we have such a policy in almost every case.  I do not know how many times we have heard this accusation being made in the D&aacute;il Chamber, often unfairly and for political purposes.  I suggest that the Government is guilty of having no policy in this instance.  It is saying it does not agree with the recommendations in the report, but it has not brought forward its own vision of a reformed Seanad.  The Government cannot, in all conscience, criticise the report and refuse to accept its findings while at the same time proposing to sit on its hands for another five or ten years, during which time more reports on Seanad reform will probably be produced and more implementation groups will probably be formed.  It has no vision of its own.  The Government should bring forward a vision.  When we see what its vision is, we can decide whether to support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110700025#BB00200","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573136400,"counter":316,"content":"<p>We are having another debate on Seanad reform, but we want to see action rather than more debate.  Like other speakers, I have participated in these debates before.  I was a Member of the Seanad from 1993 to 1997 when Maurice Manning was the Leader of the House.  His group produced a report.  Subsequently, Senator McDowell's group produced a report.  The Minister of State has said calmly today that he would like to hear our views.  He should know my views and those of Deputies Cassells and Cullinane because we represent political parties that are represented in the Seanad.  The views of the three parties were expressed during the debate in the Seanad.  I am quite happy to debate the matter in the D&aacute;il as well.  I absolutely support the view that was espoused by Labour Party Senators in the Seanad and in a written report to the Manning group on 22 January 2015.  Our position remains largely the same.  I would like the Government to give a commitment during this debate that action will be taken.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to mention some of the most important principles that apply to this issue.  It seems from what we have heard from Deputies Cassells and Cullinane that there is a great deal of agreement among political parties on what should be done.  We need to see action from the Government.  I have some questions for the Minister of State.  Will the Government make some decisions on the implementation of the Manning and McDowell reports?  We argued in the Seanad that a timeframe for the implementation of these changes was needed.  Such a timeframe is still needed.  Does the Government intend to decide on a set of reforms that will be implemented in advance of the next Seanad election?  Is it the Government's view that the general 130-page report which was submitted by Senator McDowell before Christmas is the basis for these changes?  Does the Government accept the conclusion that the franchise for voting on the panels in Seanad elections should be opened to all Irish passport holders overseas, as well as people in Northern Ireland?  We agree that this would be appropriate.  When can we expect decisions to be made?  Those are the major questions.  There is general agreement on the open franchise issue.  The Seanad has a role.  Obviously, it has a constitutional role.  We are in favour of changing the Constitution, but we want to see change implemented now.  That is important.<\/p>  <p>  The role of the Seanad is primarily to act as a check and balance on the D&aacute;il.  It also gives a platform for a variety of voices on a variety of issues.  Its role is constitutionally different from that of the D&aacute;il.  We need to ensure it can perform its role effectively.  The main issue about the extension of the franchise is that we have to operate within the Constitution as its stands.  That is why we have five panels.  The Labour Party group has suggested that the powers of nomination could be extended beyond the existing nominating bodies.  This could be done without constitutional change.  For example, we could provide for popular nomination by 500 people who are on the Seanad electoral register.  That would be another option for nomination.  That proposal is worth considering.<\/p>  <p>  The most important proposal, apart from the universal franchise proposal, is one that has been espoused by the Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in speakers during this afternoon's debate.  I refer to the proposal that the Seanad election take place on the same day as the D&aacute;il election.  Article 18.8 of the Constitution provides that \"A general election for Seanad &Eacute;ireann shall take place not later than ninety days after a dissolution of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann\".  Our party group has proposed that legislation be agreed to provide that a Seanad election by secret postal ballot would take place on the same day as the D&aacute;il election.  We suggest that such legislation would prohibit a candidate from running in both elections, thereby breaking the direct link between D&aacute;il elections and Seanad elections.  Even though many of us in this Chamber were in the Seanad first, or spent time in the Seanad after being in this Chamber first, most of us will agree that this is not a good way for the system to operate.  We recommend that the Seanad election take place on the same day as the election for the D&aacute;il.  It would be constitutionally permissible.  It would require some thought about how we define postal elections, but that can be done within the parameters of the Constitution.  It would ensure the Seanad does not continue as a mini D&aacute;il.  It would break the direct link between D&aacute;il and Seanad elections.<\/p>  <p>  I have mentioned the main issues.  I would like to comment on a couple of points that were made by the Minister of State.  He referred to variations between the two reports, but I believe they are quite minor.  It is now proposed that 34 of the 60 seats be directly elected by the five vocational panels, whereas the Manning report recommended that 36 seats be elected by those panels.  Similarly, it is now proposed that 15 seats be elected from an electoral college of Deputies, outgoing Senators and elected county councillors, which is an increase of two on the number of seats that the Manning report recommended be filled in this way.  I do not think there should be any delays on the basis of these minor variations between the two reports.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the university constituencies, the Labour Party would support the concept of a single six-seat constituency that would include all higher education institutions.  It is well beyond time for such a change to be implemented.  It is completely undemocratic that only certain universities have nominating rights in this regard.  We are also making a suggestion to ensure certain people do not have an extra vote.<\/p> <p>I or any other graduate of those universities can vote on the five vocational panels as well as the university panel.  We are suggesting that persons entitled to vote on a university panel would have to choose between that panel and one of the other appropriate panels such that they would not have an extra vote.  It is a minor point but it makes sense.<\/p> <p> We also proposed a focus on a gender balance.  There is already a mechanism for political parties to nominate candidates for election to the D&aacute;il and it should be possible to design a system that would focus on gender balance in the Seanad.<\/p> <p> My remarks very much reflect the comments of Labour Party Senators and our written proposals to the working group.  My main message is for the Government, please, to get on with it and not have any more consultation or debate.  There has been too much consultation on this issue.  We need to see reform.  To go into the next Seanad election without change would do no service to that House or politics in Ireland.  I hope the Government will be able to act after this debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110700026#CC00200","speaker":"1325","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573137000,"counter":318,"content":"<p>I would prefer to retain the current system rather than embark on implementing the findings of this report.  I represented the Independents 4 Change technical group on the Seanad reform committee.  I strenuously objected to the main proposals in the draft Seanad Bill, which I believe are unworkable, unwieldy, prone to manipulation by wealthy vested interests and fundamentally not in the interests of developing Irish democracy.<\/p>  <p>  On page 21 of annex 4 of the report 4 I set out my views in a statement of position.  In it, I recall that from the start of the group&rsquo;s proceedings I had expressed my opposition to the recommendations of the working group on Seanad reform published in 2015 and also known as the Manning report.  Ironically, I was a teenager in Professor Manning&rsquo;s politics class when I first visited Seanad and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I was struck by the vibrant debate we witnessed between some of the great men and women of the era in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, with many dynamic speakers.  I was then very disappointed to walk to a mostly deserted somnambulant Seanad which had all the atmosphere of an old boys&rsquo; club.  Likewise, when I regularly visited the Seanad as a Deputy with visiting classes of schoolchildren and constituents, my view that the Seanad should be abolished steadily hardened.  For example, in May 2003, I wrote to Mr. Peter Finnegan, our current Secretary General of the Oireachtas, who at that time was secretary of the then Committee on Procedures and Privilege sub-committee on Seanad reform, and urged that the Seanad should be abolished as it was a totally undemocratic, unrepresentative and failed institution.  I added that if the Seanad was reformed into a truly democratic body, it would be a rival to the D&aacute;il or function as a second D&aacute;il and issues about the appointment of Ministers from the Seanad and financial and other powers would surely follow.<\/p>  <p>  I have always acknowledged the outstanding contributions of some Senators through the years, such as my former colleagues in the Labour Party like Joe Costello, the late Pat Upton, Michael D. Higgins, Mary Robinson and Senator Ivana Bacik.  Distinguished Independents such as Senators Norris, Ruane, Higgins, Black and Dolan also immediately spring to mind.  I also closely follow the contributions of Senators Ged Nash, Kevin Humphries and Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;n.  Many outstanding Senators were subsequently elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, or in one instance to the Presidency, or should have stood for D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.<\/p>  <p>  I was opposed to the austerity Government under Deputy Enda Kenny and former Deputy, Eamon Gilmore, cutting the size of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and producing more huge multi-seat constituencies.  The current significant expenditure on Seanad &Eacute;ireann - &euro;10.3 million directly for 2020 in the three-year Oireachtas spending envelope - would be much better spent on elected mayors and executives for our major cities instead of relying on bureaucrats, which would greatly enhance democratic local government.  Alternatively or additionally, the money could be put towards a larger D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann with a possible representation of one Deputy per 25,000 population, which would result in 20 additional Deputies.  In general, Deputies are very good value for money.  In my D&aacute;il speech on the Thirty-Second Amendment to the Constitution (Abolition of Seanad &Eacute;ireann) Bill in 2013, I estimated the full cost of the Seanad to be &euro;20 million per annum or &euro;100 million over a full Oireachtas term.  The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission&rsquo;s three-year budget framework 2016-18 gives a direct Seanad spending outturn of more than &euro;26 million for that period.<\/p>  <p>  In my statement of position on page 21 of the implementation group report, I referred to an amendment I proposed which was very brusquely and unfairly ruled out of order by the chairperson of the group, Senator Michael McDowell.  The key section of my amendment declared: \"the Seanad Reform Implementation Group is of the view that Seanad &Eacute;ireann cannot be reformed as a truly democratic chamber within the terms of Articles 18 and 19 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann\".  In other words, constitutional change is required.  It continues: \"The Implementation Group consequently recommends to the government to propose amending the Irish constitution to permit the direct election of sixty senators by all Irish citizens resident in Ireland.  Such an amendment will stipulate that Senators be elected alongside and on the same franchise as members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann representing geographical constituencies closely aligned with contemporary D&aacute;il constituencies with approximately one senator elected with each three TDs.\"  It concluded by asking the current Oireachtas to legislate to permit the content of the amendment to be put to the Irish people on the day of the local and European elections a few months ago.<\/p>  <p>  I devised the amendment because large parts of the draft Seanad Bill 2018, which is included in the report, are undemocratic and hastily conceived nonsense.  Chapter 3 of the draft Bill is the most problematic and downright unworkable.  It extends the Seanad franchise for 34 seats not just to those with Irish citizenship in Northern Ireland but to all Irish citizens living outside the State and, by implication, all those entitled to Irish citizenship.  Up to 50 million people in the UK, USA, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and elsewhere could, if they so chose, vote for the election of 34 Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  The organisation of such a voting register and electorate would be a logistical nightmare and open to incredible manipulation and abuse.  The soothing words in section 6 of the report about this voting register, such as there only being 813,000 current passports in circulation, do nothing to ameliorate these concerns.  A few years ago, the former Deputy Eamon Gilmore was unable to tell me how many Irish passports were in circulation - it could be far more than 1 million.  I presume they are all outside Ireland.  Likewise, the comments in the report of Senator McDowell, who should know better, on ordinary postal voting, which he terms entirely practical, are woefully poorly researched.  Is he not aware of the longstanding controversy in the courts on the delivery of fixed charge notices for penalty points?  The Leas Cheann-Comhairle is certainly aware of it, as are most Deputies.  Serious abuses in postal voting in the UK and elsewhere have been discovered.  In some cases, people were brought into a room and signed their voting papers together, led by the local branch of a political party.  The cumbersome and ludicrous voting system envisaged in this report would not survive a single Seanad election.  It is pointless for Senator McDowell and others to compare the overseas voting registers of hugely populated democracies such as the UK, France or the US with the situation which this report and draft Bill would create in Ireland.  The domestic voter registers of such larger countries hugely outweigh votes from their citizens abroad, as for example in the case of the United States, whereas Ireland&rsquo;s history of emigration, with 8 million or 9 million people emigrating within 60 or 80 years, has created a vast worldwide diaspora of which we are very proud, but which is much larger than our domestic population.  Senator McDowell&rsquo;s claim that there is no likelihood of some massive or overwhelming imbalance on the register has no basis in reality.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, I agree with the majority of the implementation group that there should be a single third level constituency of six Senators for graduates of all third level institutions.<\/p>  <p>  In my statement of position on page 21 of the report I refer to my support for the proposal for a unicameral Irish legislature in the Thirty-Second Amendment to the Constitution which was very narrowly defeated by 51.7% to 48.3% on a turnout of less than 40% on 4 October 2013.  Had a more popular Government been in power, the amendment would have been easily carried.  Abolition of the Seanad was supported by the Labour Party, Sinn F&eacute;in, Fine Gael, the Socialist Party and many Independents.  Indeed, 15 D&aacute;il constituencies voted to remove the Seanad from the Constitution.  In 2013, I pointed to the exemplary democracies in unitary states similar to Ireland which had abolished delaying and pointless second chambers or never had such institutions.  These states include Denmark - I once sat in the former Danish Senate, which is now the room for its Social Democrats, its equivalent of the Labour Party - Sweden, Norway, Finland, Greece, Portugal, New Zealand and a significant number of other countries.  I argued that in those countries, the people are effectively the second house and any available resources are correctly applied to very strong local and regional government structures.  In my statement of position I reiterated my view that the Manning report, the report of the Seanad reform implementation group and the draft Seanad Bill 2018 establish five potentially massive and unwieldy Seanad constituencies with unknown registration and election costs and dangers, as well as the very real possibility of favouring wealthy candidates.  I noted, &ldquo;Even the single six seat University Constituency has potentially many hundreds of thousands of an electorate.&rdquo;<\/p> <p>Up to the current D&aacute;il, the Oireachtas has been largely controlled by the Executive of the day and the Seanad historically had little input into legislation going through the Oireachtas.  I accept that in the current unique D&aacute;il and Seanad, with the confidence and supply agreement between the minority Fine Gael Government and Fianna F&aacute;il, there has been more scope for legislative and other initiatives on the part of Members of both Houses.  Even Senator McDowell concedes, in the letter to the Taoiseach which accompanies this report, that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann can override the Seanad irrespective of the Seanad&rsquo;s make-up after 90 days on any legislative matter.  Therefore, very fundamental questions remain about the efficacy of an expensive second Chamber in any small unitary state.<\/p> <p> This woolly, cumbersome and ill-thought-out report before us cannot and should not be implemented.  It is a very expensive recipe for disaster.  The Chairman should not have ruled out my amendment A.  I favour an early second referendum on such a proposal just as I hope our British friends will have their early second referendum on the European issue and they will actually remain in the European Union.  If, however, the Seanad cannot be abolished, the only responsible workable and democratic option is for our people is to elect all 60 Senators by universal franchise on the same day as and in similar constituencies to a D&aacute;il election.<\/p> <p> Even the statement of position on page 23 of the report by our four Fine Gael colleagues, Senators Byrne, Paddy Burke, Buttimer and McFadden, reflects the great unease of many of the members of the implementation group on this report&rsquo;s proposals and a feeling on their part that it would be better to leave the current Seanad structure alone rather than embark on the type of Mad Hatter proposals championed by Senator McDowell.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110700027#DD00200","speaker":"1361","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573137600,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies who have contributed.  I again thank those who participated in the group and Senator McDowell, who chaired it.  I also acknowledge the former Senator, the late Feargal Quinn, who was very involved in the referendum campaign and who was also an outstanding Member of the Upper House for many years.<\/p>  <p>  This is the first discussion on Seanad reform to take place in the D&aacute;il during my time in the office I hold.  Senators - at least one of them is seated at the back of the D&aacute;il Chamber now - were adamant that the report should be discussed by the D&aacute;il at the earliest opportunity.  I acknowledge what Deputy Cassells said about it being a year since the report was published.  For six months, I have been asking the Business Committee to have the debate and I am glad we have had the opportunity to engage in it this evening.  Even having this discussion highlights the lack of unanimity that exists, contrary, in particular, to what Deputy Jan O'Sullivan said.  Any proposals we introduce which change our electoral system and the nature of our democracy are by their very nature ones that should not be taken lightly.  We have seen more evidence today that there is a complete lack of unanimity at least as to how we should proceed.<\/p>  <p>  I want to address specific issues that Deputies raised.  Deputy Cassells spoke in support of reform, strengthening the link between the Seanad and the public.  The latter is a proposal with which I agree.  The Deputy also supports the vocational panel system.  I served two terms in the Seanad having been elected via the Agricultural Panel.  My issue with the vocational panel system is that it bears no resemblance to the actual activity as things stand of the Seanad.  Many party spokespersons in the Seanad were not elected via that particular vocational panel at all.  It was just a mechanism that qualified people could use to be elected but was not reflected in how the Seanad necessarily acted.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies Cassells and Jan O'Sullivan suggested that the Seanad be elected on the same day as the D&aacute;il.  The report states that it would be neither practical nor desirable to hold the Seanad election on the same day as that for the D&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110700028#EE00200","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1573137600,"counter":321,"content":"<p>I accepted that at the time.

In other words, it is not sufficient to state that just because a group believes that not everybody who is entitled to register will do so, it will be possible to avoid administrative problems when it comes to the compilation of an electoral register.  The starting point should be that the maximum number of people should engage in the process, and that is what we should be about facilitating.  I understand the Deputy's point to the effect that it might be a more gradual process in reality.  However, we cannot legislate for a House of the Oireachtas being elected on the basis that only a quarter of the people entitled to vote will actually register to do so.

There are chunks of it that I accept, including the need to implement the 1979 referendum result.  I certainly accept the provisions of the Manning report and those in this report which suggest that the Seanad can reform the way it conducts its own business.  Deputy Cullinane and, to an extent, Deputy Broughan expressed the view that if the Seanad is to continue, it must be through constitutional referendum rather than on the basis of the current parameters.

I have asked the HSE how many patients are being kept on chairs and on floors and I have been informed that it does not keep an account of that, which is also unacceptable.

There were clear warnings, not just in the most recent report but in a series of reports from the commission, that there are serious problems in the psychiatric unit at University Hospital Waterford.  It found that residents&rsquo; general health needs were not monitored and assessed in line with their appropriate and specific needs, that physical examinations were inadequate, that residents did not have access to a supply of appropriate emergency personnel and that the unit was not clean, hygienic and free from offensive odours.  We have since found out that there are people sleeping on floors, there is overcrowding and patients are given a blanket or a chair.

I do not know where he is.<\/p>  <p>  I thank each of the Deputies for raising this very important issue.  The Department of Health is aware of the issue and officials in the mental health unit have been in constant communication with the HSE to monitor the situation.  The 44-bed department of psychiatry is the designated approved centre for acute inpatient services for the counties of Waterford and Wexford, serving a catchment area of 265,000.  It is acknowledged that the acute bed numbers in Waterford are below the national average and there can, at times, be issues of over-capacity.  Over the October bank holiday weekend, unprecedented demand on the service put significant pressures on the department of psychiatry in Waterford.  This included ten involuntary referrals.  By comparison, there were 21 in the entire previous quarter.<\/p>  <p>  The department of psychiatry in Waterford too immediate steps to address the over-capacity issue, including using acute beds in alternative HSE areas, private placements and specialist rehabilitation beds in long-stay centres.  There are currently 43 patients in the department of psychiatry at University Hospital Waterford and considerable efforts are ongoing to manage the demand on the service and where appropriate, discharge planning to community mental health teams and facilities.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the allegations made by an employee in the media, I assure all the Deputies that the Department takes patient safety and health care very seriously.  In that context, the mental health unit has asked the HSE to investigate these allegations and report back.  The HSE has assured the Department that the situation is being constantly monitored by both local and national mental health service management and the new clinical director for the department of psychiatry, who started this week, is expected to further assist in overall clinical management. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE, in conjunction with University Hospital Waterford, is in the process of reviewing the existing department of psychiatry to assess long-term options to increase capacity.  They will keep the Department of Health informed of any developments in this regard.  The Minister of State, Deputy Daly, will also be meeting Deputy Browne next week to discuss this issue.  A total of &euro;39 million has been added to the mental health budget for 2020, increasing the annual allocation to &euro;1.026 billion.  This represents an increase of over &euro;315 million since 2012.  This funding will help in the continued improvement and development of mental health services.  Funding alone is not enough.  We also need to consider how we deliver services and how we can reduce demand for the specialist mental health services.  In this regard, the HSE is introducing a number of digital mental health initiatives that are being driven by the Department of Health.  These include telecounselling and telepsychiatry reports. <\/p>  <p>  A pilot has been undertaken in the Wexford-Waterford region and will provide remote psychiatric consultations for the child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS.  Greater use of the technology available to us will help to deliver services at as early a stage as possible and will help to ensure that mild mental health issues are dealt with before they become more serious.  These initiatives exemplify the serious intent of the Government to progress and improve mental health services not just in Waterford but throughout Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110700029#FF00800","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1573138800,"counter":333,"content":"<p>The fact the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health could not even give a reason as to why he is not here is totally unacceptable.

The Mental Health Commission found that the Waterford department of psychiatry had a mere 57% compliance rate this year.  The alternate unit nearby, St. Luke&rsquo;s in Kilkenny, was prosecuted in the criminal courts for patient neglect.  This shows the lack of care provided across the south east.  There was nothing in the HSE&rsquo;s capital plan this year for the provision of new units in the south east.  There is a mention of a business case.  Where is the healthcare or moral case?

A gang war has been going on for some years in Drogheda.  Despite the welcome efforts and supports which the Garda and the Minister for Justice and Equality have put in place, we had a second gangland killing this very week.  It shocked and appalled everybody in our area.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the commitments given by the Garda Commissioner and the Minister for Justice and Equality to our community.  They have personally visited the areas in question.  Not only that, but they have provided significant additional resources to the Garda in Drogheda to fight this appalling level of crime.<\/p>  <p>  Due to the excellent work of the Garda, some of the criminal activity has been displaced and moved into the county area of south Louth.  This week, sadly and appallingly, it moved into a built-up fine estate in east Meath.  The people in east Meath are concerned because the Garda actually patrolled the estate in question half an hour before an assassination by a criminal gang of a rival criminal gang member.  What the people want is increased resources in the east Meath area.<\/p>  <p>  One concern is that the population of east Meath has grown exponentially.  As the Acting Chairman knows, up to 10,000 people now live in the area between Julianstown and Drogheda which used to be a sparsely populated rural area.  The Garda station there is physically inadequate.  There are 18 garda&iacute; based there, two of them sergeants.  They have no operational room and it does not have sufficient opening hours.  We need a new Garda station there.  I was in communication with the Garda Commissioner some weeks ago about this matter.  I do not expect the Minister to give me an answer on that today.  However, the issue is presenting a difficulty.  The nearest official control centre for the Garda in east Meath is Ashbourne which is many miles away.  The Garda station in Drogheda is closer.<\/p>  <p>  I raised this issue with Garda chief superintendent, Christy Mangan, on Monday, the day before this assassination took place.  He told me that there are protocols in place and cover for east Meath is provided by Drogheda Garda station which is in the Louth division, as and when the seriousness arises.  The people in the community of east Meath are not clear on this issue.  We need a statement from the Minister and the Garda Commissioner on this.  I know the Garda Commissioner is coming to a joint policing committee in the east Meath area shortly.<\/p> <p>Perhaps, when it is appropriate, the Minister will visit the area, as he did Drogheda, to reassure residents that he is doing his best.  We need increased physical presence in terms of Garda.  The Minister will be aware that the Garda Commissioner is due to visit the area.  <\/p> <p> The fight against crime is never-ending and drug crime is a significant and serious issue in Drogheda but An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is winning.  There is no doubt but that increased pressure in terms of policing, the Armed Response Unit and CAB is making is mark, but we need more.  As recently as Monday last, Superintendent Christy Mangan in Drogheda made an application for the retention of the current resources into the future.  I am not suggesting there is any doubt in this regard, but there was a serious question raised about the matter earlier in the week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110700030#GG01100","speaker":"1329","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573139400,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Fergus O'Dowd for again raising this matter.

I acknowledge his leadership in the area and I echo his appeal to anybody with any information on this matter to contact An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at the incident room in Ashbourne Garda station or the Garda confidential line I800 666 111.<\/p>  <p>  More generally, I am aware of the concerns of the people in the area referred to by Deputy O'Dowd and of the constituents of County Louth, which is also the constituency of the Acting Chairman, Deputy Breathnach.  I can assure the people of Drogheda and east Meath that neither the Government nor An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will permit a small number of individuals to continue to put local communities in fear for their safety.  <\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach and I visited Drogheda over the summer and we were both very impressed by the robust response which has been put in place in the region by the Garda authorities under Operation Stratus, which consists of high visibility patrols and checkpoints, days of action, covert policing initiatives and the targeting of specific parties engaged in fued-related criminality.  This operation, supported by divisional and district uniformed and plain-clothes personnel and, in particular, the roads policing unit, community engagement and public safety personnel, detective drugs and crime units, the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau and the emergency response unit.  The Garda has made important progress in tackling the threat of organised crime and they work closely with colleagues in other jurisdictions in investigating the supply of drugs and guns.<\/p>  <p>  I remind Deputies that co-operation with relevant agencies and intelligence-led policing is producing significant results in the fight against organised criminality in Drogheda and elsewhere.  For example, last week garda&iacute; attached to the Garda National Drugs and Organised Bureau intercepted a commercial haulage vehicle in Dundalk and recovered cannabis herb with an estimated value of &euro;3.2 million, subject to analysis.  Two men were arrested and investigations are continuing.  Against this background, the Government has made unprecedented resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of &euro;1.76 billion this year, plus &euro;92 million in capital investment, which is a 50% increase in capital funding on the allocation for 2018.  Provision for next year has increased to &euro;1.882 billion, as well as capital investment of &euro;116 million, which is a further 26% increase.  As Garda numbers are increasing, we are on track to meet the Government's target of an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 by 2021.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the work of Chief Superintendent Christy Mangan and his team in Drogheda and Louth.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the full support of the Government in its ongoing work and we are providing record resources to enable it to perform its critical role in difficult and challenging circumstances, as outlined by Deputy Fergus O'Dowd.  The purpose of this funding and the Government's support for police reform is to ensure the best possible policing services are provided across the country and, in the context of this debate, Drogheda and east Meath.<\/p>  <p>  I again thank Deputy Fergus O'Dowd for raising this important issue this evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110700031#HH00200","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1573139400,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister's comments and his continued affirmation of support for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in particular Chief Superintendent Christy Mangan and his team and Superintendent Fergus Dwyer who is also very active in this area.  The people of east Meath want public awareness of the increased co-operation between the two divisions.  Crime knows no boundaries and for criminals who want to target particular people for money, or an enemy, there are no barriers.  There are equally no barriers between the two police services but there is an administrative issue, but I acknowledge this is a matter for the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, not politicians.  The people of east Meath need a public initiative or a statement from the Garda Commissioner regarding the co-operation of services in relation to this issue and an assurance that all available resources will be deployed.  There is a need for additional resources because of the displacement of crime, particularly into east Meath.  The level of Garda activity in Drogheda is high but, unfortunately, this has displaced some criminal activities.  Both of the assassinations-murders related to this fued took place outside of the town of Drogheda, although that is not to suggest there were not attempts in this regard within the town as well.<\/p>  <p>  I reiterate that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is winning this battle but it needs our continued support.

I trust it is an operational issue that will be dealt with positively by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Over the past three years, and due to Government funding, the Garda strength in the northern region has increased to approximately 1,500.  I take this opportunity to assure the Acting Chairman, Deputy Breathnach, and Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, who raised this issue, that this figure includes, for example, the 25 new Garda assigned to Drogheda in June by the Garda Commissioner.  There are now more than 150 additional garda&iacute; deployed in the northern region, as compared with the position two years ago.  I trust that this will continue in the context of further garda&iacute; coming on stream from Templemore over the next few weeks.  I visited Drogheda and I met some of the 25 new garda&iacute;.  I have seen their enthusiasm, ambition and expertise and I acknowledge their work.  They are supported by approximately 160 Garda staff in the region, which has increased by almost 35% over the past three years.  The increase in Garda staff means that garda&iacute; can be redeployed from administrative duties to operational policing duties where their experience can be utilised to best effect.  Significant financial resources are being made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The efficient use of these resources, including the deployment of personnel, are matters which are, by law, for the Garda Commissioner.

His mother Lucia, father Jim and his family have continued to lobby for an independent public inquiry.  In June of last year, this House endorsed their wishes and democratically came to the view that an independent public inquiry was necessary.  The Seanad did the same the following February.  Then negotiations opened in terms of the appointment of Judge Haughton.  The Minister allowed the family to discuss the terms of reference with Judge Haughton and they had their input into it.  The family members were encouraged by that and felt, with their additions and amendments to the terms of reference given by the Department, that the terms of reference were adequate to cover an investigation into the night of that event, the previous charges brought against the driver of the car, the conduct of the Garda, the conduct of the courts, the conduct of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, and so on.  Then their hopes were dashed.  All of the suggestions made to improve the terms of reference have been rejected by the Minister's Department.  I find that very difficult to take, given the fact that all of the evidence in respect of this has been collected, dated and put in perfect order by Lucia O'Farrell in the interest of uncovering what happened her son Shane and in the interest of justice and protecting their right to have a public inquiry, which is supported democratically by the wishes of the majority in this House.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister and his Department are about to embark upon an inquiry that will not answer the questions that are relevant to the full inquiry that Lucia O'Farrell is asking for.  Will the Minister re-examine the submission made by Judge Haughton?  Will he re-examine the submission made by Lucia O'Farrell?  Will he expand the terms of reference to include all of the issues that are of public concern contained in this case where Shane O'Farrell died?  If he does not, he will be ignoring the democratic wishes of this House.  I feel that if he refuses to change the terms of reference, he should bring the terms of reference that he is suggesting back into this House so that we can debate them and suggest amendments where we feel the issue is not being addressed.  If the Minister has respect for Shane O'Farrell's family and respect for this House and its wishes, surely he must feel obliged to bring the terms of reference back for a fuller debate.  In answering the call for an independent public inquiry and having the terms of reference expanded, it will shine light on the system that needs to be reformed and corrected if we are not going to have another case similar to that of Shane O'Farrell and all of what happened to him and his family in the course of the investigation of that death.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110700032#JJ00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1573140000,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the input of Deputy McGuinness in this sad and tragic case.  I thank him for allowing me the opportunity to update the House on developments.  I want to make it very clear that there is no conspiracy here.  There is no cover-up here.  I want to uncover the truth and the facts as much as any other Deputy in this House.  That is why I am pleased to have the opportunity to clarify a number of issues that have arisen in the public domain.  First, as I have said in reply to parliamentary questions and other fora, the terms of reference of the scoping exercise being conducted by Judge Gerard Haughton have been finalised.  While the terms of reference for the scoping exercise are focused, they allow for review of the issues intended.  I want to assure the Deputy that there is no intention on my part to limit in any way or curtail the scoping exercise.  Second, as Judge Haughton has been asked to make an initial report by mid-November, I am expecting to receive that interim report in the very near future.  I expect that Judge Haughton will, in that interim report, set out for me the expected timeframe for completion of the scoping exercise he has been charged with.  I want to be very clear that Judge Gerard Haughton, a man of integrity and honour who has been on court benches for many decades, is independent of me and is free, as I said to him at the outset and as I confirmed by way of parliamentary question.  I make it clear to Deputy McGuinness again now that Judge Gerard Haughton is free to make any recommendation he deems fit, including the setting up of any form of statutory or non-statutory inquiry or investigation.  Indeed, should Judge Haughton recommend an inquiry of whatever type, I have asked him to provide draft terms of reference for such an inquiry in order to ensure that there is no element of greater delay involved here.  I hope those points clarify any concern or confusion which may have arisen.<\/p><p>I want briefly to address the question of the terms of reference of Judge Haughton's scoping exercise in some detail.  As the Deputy will appreciate, in establishing the scoping exercise itself and in determining its terms of reference, I have been guided by legal advice from the Attorney General.  In advance of finalising the terms of reference, the most recent advice available to me and my Department recommended more focused and specific terms of reference to take account of the Supreme Court's decision in the case of Shatter <i>v.<\/i>Guerin, a judgment with which Deputy McGuinness will be particularly familiar.  Notwithstanding this requirement to amend the original draft terms of reference, it is important to say clearly that there is no impediment or obstacle in respect of Judge Haughton and his position to make any recommendation he deems fit in respect of any future inquiry.  Furthermore, the O'Farrell family is free to make any representations to Judge Haughton in relation to any matter it would wish to see inquired into in any future inquiry.<\/p><p>As I have said, Judge Gerard Haughton is an experienced and respected judge.  He is also most dedicated to the work he has been asked to undertake.  He is free to make any recommendation he sees fit in respect of this matter.  I know, as Deputy McGuinness has said, which I appreciate, that he has been engaging with the O'Farrell family.  I hope that this engagement would continue.  For my part, I am as anxious as anybody to make progress on this matter but as Minister for Justice and Equality I must endeavour at all times to act clearly within the law and that is what I am seeking to do in this most sensitive and tragic case.  I look forward to receipt of Judge Haughton's initial report.  I should have it before the end of this month.  I would be happy to engage further with Deputy McGuinness and others at that time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110700032#JJ00300","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1573140000,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I would welcome that but I am confused by the reply the Minister has given.  I did not mention conspiracy or cover-up: I never mentioned that.  Nor did I question Judge Haughton or his integrity or anything else about the judge.  The Minister seems to defend something that has not been presented to him as an argument.<\/p> <p>The family has said to me, and I wrote it down, that subsequent to Judge Haughton having met it, he submitted terms of reference to the Department on 24 April 2019.  The family respects these terms, which go some way to reflect the motion passed in the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  That is what it has said but it also said that the Department has rejected Judge Haughton's terms of reference, and narrowed the original terms of reference which the Department had proposed in February 2019.  It has removed reference to Shane and to the family's right, under human rights, to ensure an effective investigation into the unlawful killing.  To date, the State has failed in its obligations in that regard.  It further said that it has removed consideration of the prosecution of Shane's case, which was the first thing for consideration by the Department in the February terms of reference.  It removed any consideration of the coroner's inquest into Shane's death, in which serious irregularities emerged.  It removed any investigation into the previous prosecutions of the accused, despite him being in breach of multiple counts of bail when he killed Shane.  It limited the judge's in taking into account of the outcome of reports prepared, being reports which in the family's view are deficient in many ways, rather than having a review carried out of the investigation behind these reports, as originally envisaged in the terms of reference.<\/p> <p> The family engaged with the Minister and with Judge Haughton and is deeply dissatisfied with the manner in which this is progressing.  I appeal to the Minister, based on the vote taken in this House, to please re-engage with Lucia O'Farrell and her family and with Judge Haughton.  Please respect the type of inquiry that was asked for, which was a public, independent inquiry.  There is too much at stake here.<\/p> <p> We will learn a great amount from this case if we allow the judge full scope to deal with every single aspect outlined by Lucia O'Farrell.  It will benefit the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110700032#JJ00400","speaker":"1248","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573140600,"counter":353,"content":"<p>I agree with Deputy McGuinness that all those concerned, in particular, the family in question, would engage fully with Judge Haughton.

That does not, however, get Sofia any kind of passport or official identification.  Their daughter remains stateless and as a result, they are unable to return home to Ireland or to travel anywhere else that involves a hard border.  This is a clear violation of Articles 7, 21, 24 and 45 of EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and Articles 3, 7 and 8 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Chid.  She has fallen through the legislative cracks of all these countries, rendering her illegal in every country.  They have applied for Spanish citizenship, which is going nowhere at the moment.  Both are now at the end of their wits and are truly concerned for Sofia's safety on so many levels, not least because she has no photographic identification saying who she is, thus, in reality, she does not exist.  This is a very frightening reality for any parent.<\/p>  <p>  We also know that the Minister, Deputy Harris, confirmed recently that he would be signing off on the pertinent regulations of the Child and Family Relationships Act 2015 which will recognise two mothers on a birth certificate from 2020.

Can the Department and the Minister exercise discretion and compassion in this instance?  This is literally looking for travel documents to allow this child to return to Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Sofia is stuck in a legal limbo which is not of her making and which none of us expected when we passed the Child and Family Relationships Act.

I hope that we will be in a position, if not this evening, but certainly at some early date, to chart a future path which will allow for advice towards a resolution.  It would not be appropriate for me at this stage to share personal details in relation to any person or their family, but I would, for the purposes of this debate be pleased to address the broader issues raised by the Deputies and, specifically, the entitlement to Irish citizenship of children born to same-sex couples.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Act 2008 that has been referred to sets out the legislative framework within which the passport service processes all applications for passports.<\/p> <p>Pursuant to section 7 of that Act, a passport cannot be issued unless the Minister is satisfied the person is an Irish citizen and satisfied as to the identity of the person.  Citizenship, as Deputies will be aware, is governed by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, which is under the responsibility of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Legislative measures in regard to citizenship do not fall within the remit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  They do fall within the remit of the Passport Service.  In this context, the service has received a number of applications from same-sex married couples seeking to obtain Irish passports for their children born abroad and, in giving due consideration to these applications, has raised a number of issues in regard to both citizenship and guardianship with the relevant Departments and the Office of the Attorney General.<\/p> <p> I would like to set out the current legislation.  Section 7 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, addresses citizenship by descent and provides that a person is an Irish citizen from birth if at the time of his or her birth either parent was an Irish citizen, although an additional requirement of registration is imposed in respect of children born outside the State of Ireland where the Irish citizen parent was also born outside the island of Ireland.  The Passport Service has received legal advice that states that, for the purposes of the 1956 Act, a parent is understood to mean either the mother or father of the child.  For the purposes of Irish law, the mother of a child is the person who gives birth to the child or a female adopter of the child.  In general, the father is the person identified as the genetic father of the child or a male adopter.<\/p> <p> The Passport Service has received passport applications for children born outside the State to same-sex couples where one member of the couple is an Irish citizen and the other is not.  The question arises as to whether, under the current legislation, where the Irish citizen is neither the birth mother nor the genetic father, or alternatively the male or female adopter of the child, the child qualifies for Irish citizenship by descent.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade sought advice on its understanding of the 1956 Act from the Office of the Attorney General, which recommended that confirmation should be sought from the Department of Justice and Equality.  The Passport Service has sought clarification on this and other related matters, including the effect on citizenship of Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, once commenced in May 2020, from the Department of Justice and Equality. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will issue passports in accordance with any legislative changes on commencement.<\/p> <p> While I will not get into the detail of any personal case in the House, I will bring today's debate to the attention of all appropriate colleagues in my Department and the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Health, which may also have certain responsibilities in this regard.  I assure the Deputies that my officials are working closely with officials from other relevant Departments to ensure this matter is clarified as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110700033#KK00500","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573141200,"counter":359,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

The witnesses were chosen to represent those areas in particular where the arts continue to be most vulnerable.  These pertain to governance, the Irish language, education, music, society, and festivals.  The witnesses, along with our society at large, were all in agreement that the arts do matter.  That being the case, the committee wished to ask why the arts are still marginalised and often shoved to the side and away from the mainstream when it comes to funding, educational programming, workers' rights and wider society in general.  The committee learned a lot from its deliberations and from the presentations it received.<\/p> <p>During its deliberations we learned how strong people are who are working in the arts, how difficult it can be to set up and access funding programmes and how the arts are still inaccessible to large tranches of society in Ireland today.<\/p> <p> I will now focus on the committee's engagement on the topic.  The report we are discussing reflects the several themes that were discussed as part of the committee's deliberations.  They are governance and funding in the arts, the arts and education, music in Ireland today, the arts for all, national arts festivals, the Creative Ireland programme and why the arts matter, with general observations.<\/p> <p> In its first meeting on the topic in January of last year, the committee heard from representatives from the Arts Council as well as the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht on governance and funding in the arts.  The committee discussed what could be done to strengthen the protections that exist for those working in the arts sector.  The second meeting took place in February 2018 and discussed the theme of arts in education and subsequent meetings between February and the end of 2018 looked at the following topics: music, arts in society, arts festivals and the Government's culture-based Creative Ireland programme.  Four Irish organisations were also invited to present to the committee.  The strong message that we heard was that an Ghaeilge should be central, but it was disappointing to hear that is not the case currently.  In the final meeting of the committee on The Arts Matter, which took place in January of this year, members heard from contemporary artists, to discuss more generally why the arts really matter.  The witnesses expressed the view that while the cultural and artistic legacy of Ireland continues to be present, it is threatened by a world that has become more virtual and artificial.<\/p> <p> All these meetings allowed the Oireachtas joint committee to gain a deeper and broader understanding of the Irish arts sector and the challenges it faces.  Discussions with representatives of Departments and agencies involved in administering and funding the arts highlighted a need for a deeper commitment at policy level to longitudinal research in arts participation.  That would provide real evidential data on the impact of the creative arts for all of society in building informed strategies to meet the needs of a changing society.<\/p> <p> The report's recommendations reflect the main priorities of those from the arts sector who presented to the committee.  These concerned, in the main, stronger commitment at Government policy level, greater arts officer presence across more local and regional areas, ample funding for arts funding bodies, initiatives in education, access to the arts for all, stronger arts strategies for the Irish language, arts education from an early age and improved tax incentives to assist those wishing to contribute to the arts.  A total of 28 recommendations are set out in this report, under the following headings: Government policy, education, an Ghaeilge, young people, society, access and arts festivals.<\/p> <p> I wish to place on record some of the report's key findings, which reflect the main priorities of those from the arts sector who presented to the committee.  There is a need for commitment at Government policy level to longitudinal research in arts participation, which would provide real evidential data on the impact of the creative arts for all of society in building informed strategies to meet the needs of a changing society.  Another recommendation is to restore staff and funding to arts funding bodies, representative organisations and individual artists to 2008 and 2009 levels.  A further recommendation is to provide a new examination of models of intervention throughout the primary and secondary school cycles that will result in stronger art literacy in order that the contribution of artists to education can be further understood, valued and acknowledged.  Immediate steps should be taken by the Department of Education and Skills to establish a more structured approach to music education partnerships guaranteeing that all children receive a quality music education regardless of their socioeconomic background or the part of the country in which they grow up.<\/p> <p> The three key Departments with responsibility for the arts, namely, the Departments of the Taoiseach; Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht; and Education and Skills, should adopt a joined-up approach in the development and implementation of the Arts Council's Creative Youth plan by setting up a development unit, or support for a similar resource.  That is something I feel very strongly about, especially given my previous work as an arts education officer for Cavan and Monaghan Education and Training Board.  The first time two Departments worked collaboratively was when the high-level implementation group was first brought together and the arts in education document was produced.  That was the Minister's Department and the Department of Education and Skills.  We see the fruits of that now in what is being delivered through the Creative Schools projects right across the country.  Artists are going into schools and working along with art teachers instead of the old way of expecting primary and secondary school teachers to be masters of all trades and to deliver everything.  That was not possible and it was not fair to the students or the professional artists who are eager for work.  I have always made the point that there is a wonderful opportunity for them, in particular through the education and training board sector.  There are 16 education and training boards across the country and they provide a useful vehicle for the Department to engage with and continue to roll out creative skills.<\/p> <p> Another recommendation related to the need to encourage much stronger co-ordination of arts festivals to facilitate programming and administration in enticing authors to attend and in recruiting volunteers.  I thank all those who appeared before the committee for the valuable insights it gained over the course of its engagement on this topic.  The report highlights the issues raised and the recommendations contained in it set out how these might be addressed.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110700034#LL00600","speaker":"1271","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573141800,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak to the motion and I thank Deputy Niamh Smyth for introducing it.  We are all in agreement that arts and culture are of the utmost importance in the life and well-being of our country.  I share the objectives of the Oireachtas joint committee to develop the arts and cultural sectors.  Arts can be a great driver of social change and they confer great benefits on society in general.  I also welcome The Arts Matter report.  I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for their work in completing a comprehensive narrative based on the wide-ranging consultations they undertook over a 13-month period.  I note the report is informed by the committee's consultation with witnesses called before the committee from Departments, State agencies, arts and culture organisations, Irish language organisations and educational institutions.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's recognition of the importance of the arts is underlined by its commitment to double spending on culture, heritage and the Gaeltacht by 2025.  Total funding in the Department for the arts and culture sector will increase by 2% in 2020 from &euro;189 million to almost &euro;193 million.  Primary support for the arts is delivered through the Arts Council and it has increased in recent years.  Arts Council funding will reach &euro;80 million in 2020.  That is an increase of &euro;5 million or 6.7% over 2019.  Capital funding of &euro;1.2 billion has been earmarked for culture, heritage and the Irish language in accordance with my Department's ten-year capital plan, under Project Ireland 2040.  That includes investment of &euro;460 million in Ireland's national cultural institutions and &euro;65 million for cultural and creativity infrastructure nationwide.  Work on the National Library of Ireland and the National Archives has already commenced, while other projects are progressing, including a new &euro;4.7 million capital investment scheme for arts and culture centres across the country.  The cumulative impact of the funding increases is testament to the commitment to double Government spending in the arts and culture sector.<\/p>  <p>  I will address the 28 recommendations in the committee's report under the seven broad headings, which are Government policy, education, the Irish language, young people, society, access and arts festivals.  Deputy Niamh Smyth referred to the first recommendation which relates to Government policy.  It recommends undertaking \"longitudinal research in arts participation, which would provide real evidential data on the impact of the creative arts for all of society in building informed strategies to meet the needs of a changing society.\"  A working group has been established to research and commission a report on the establishment of a strategy for the Irish language and the arts.  Members of the group include representatives from my Department, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, Eala&iacute;n na Gaeltachta, TG4, the Arts Council and Foras na Gaeilge.<\/p>  <p>  Recommendations 2, 6, 7 and 8 relate to areas dealt with by my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, whose officials are engaging with my Department on a range of programmes, including the Creative Ireland programme and the decade of centenaries.<\/p>  <p>I understand from the Minister that the school curriculum at primary and post-primary levels provides a broad, balanced approach to the range of subjects for study.  His Department also supports activity outside of schools which includes the non-mainstream music education bursary and significant funding for Music Generation.<\/p> <p> Recommendation 2 seeks greater representation of local authorities and local authority arts officers in the 16 education and training boards, ETBs.  As part of the Creative Ireland programme, I understand the Department of Education and Skills is piloting local creative youth partnerships in three ETBs, Kerry, Laois-Offaly and Limerick-Clare.  The purpose of these partnerships is to establish networks which enable information sharing and collaboration between local creative youth service providers, including local authorities, to bring about better use of existing resources, practices and initiatives in each ETB area.<\/p> <p> The Creative Ireland programme has provided a platform for the Department of Education and Skills to further embrace arts and creativity and provide new ways for children and young people to engage with and be exposed to the arts.  The programme builds on the 2015 arts in education charter which was agreed between my Department and the Department of Education and Skills.  My Department has regular contact with the local authorities and arts officers through a number of channels which are critical to the Creative Ireland programme.<\/p> <p> Recommendations 3 and 4 seek the restoration of staff and funding to arts funding bodies, representative organisations and individual artists to 2008 or 2009 levels.  I remind the House that the 2009 allocation to the Arts Council was &euro;73.3 million.  This compares with the 2019 allocation of &euro;75 million and the 2020 allocation of &euro;80 million.  Since the Taoiseach's commitment to double funding of the arts was announced in December 2017, the annual allocation to the Arts Council has been increasing, which can be regarded as significant progress.<\/p> <p> The Creative Ireland programme works with many Government Departments and agencies to ensure that culture and creativity are embedded right across Government policy and given due prominence, thus addressing recommendation 9's call for cross-Government actions.  Using these three guiding principles of creativity, collaboration and transformation, the programme works across Government and has made significant progress.<\/p> <p> With regard to education, recommendations 10, 11, 12 and 13 relate to music education.  I understand from the Minister for Education and Skills that, as part of the school curriculum at primary and post-primary levels, students are offered a range of artistic subjects to study, including music.  At post-primary school, students are being given more freedom in their areas of study through the new framework for the junior cycle.  New specifications in music and visual art are designed to provide more freedom in letting students study what they find interesting.  The transition year programme, which is taken by more than 70% of all students, offers broad scope for students to explore and engage in arts-related areas, especially music.  At leaving certificate level, students can continue to study music and art.<\/p> <p> Programmes of professional development for teachers help to develop and augment their capacity to deliver the arts in classrooms.  This includes teacher-artist partnership in primary schools, where artists visit schools to work with teachers who they have collaborated with during the summer break.  At post-primary level, the arts in junior cycle initiative offers professional development for teachers to support innovative and imaginative ways of engaging with the arts and learning in the junior cycle curriculum.  The Department of Education and Skills provides significant funding for Music Generation.  As part of the Creative Ireland programme and the national expansion of the Music Generation programme, five new music education partnerships have been established this year in Kerry, Kildare, Longford and Tipperary.  In addition, the non-mainstream music education bursary is supported by the Department of Education and Skills for organisations to apply for annually.  The bursary has been valued at &euro;100,000 for the past three years.<\/p> <p> With regard to the Irish language, tuigim go maith t&aacute;bhacht na n-eala&iacute;on mar a bhaineann siad leis an nGaeilge.  Recommendations 15, 16, 17 and 18 relate to the funding of artists and arts organisation working in the Irish language.  Eala&iacute;n na Gaeltachta  Teoranta is an organisation set up specifically to fund the Irish language arts.  It is jointly funded by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, the Arts Council and the Department to promote the development of the contemporary and the traditional arts in the Gaeltacht.  It provides services and grant schemes to support the development of arts organisations and individual artists as well as initiatives that help build the capacity of and infrastructure for the arts in the Gaeltacht.<\/p> <p> Recommendations 14, 19 and 20 relate to policies in the Gaeltacht division of my Department.  An example is the grant of up to &euro;325,000 made by my Department to Eala&iacute;n na Gaeltachta to promote a programme of activities in the traditional arts for young people throughout the Gaeltacht over the 2018 to 2019 school year, which addresses a commitment in the five-year action plan for the Irish language.  A working group has been established to research and commission a report on the establishment of a strategy for the Irish language and the arts.  Members of the group include representatives from the Department, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, Eala&iacute;n na Gaeltachta, TG4, An Comhairle Ealafon and Foras na Gaeilge.  This research will cover a comprehensive audit of what is currently available, the various organisations operating in this domain and the access and services available to the public.  It will cover an audit of the education, training and development opportunities from preschool to postgraduate and adult education available in the sector; an assessment of the economic, social and linguistic impact of the arts on the Irish language; and an audit of the current and potential sources of funding available for the language-based arts.<\/p> <p> With regard to young people, recommendations 21 and 22 speak to the need for a separate production award and a commissioning process for artists with disabilities to create new work for children, young people and their families as well as implementation of the Arts Council's creative youth plan.  I note Deputy Smyth's acknowledgement of the merits of creative youth.  Through this plan, which falls under the Creative Ireland programme, my Department is working in partnership with the Departments of Education and Skills and Children and Youth Affairs and the Arts Council.  A working group meets regularly to ensure the commitments under Creative Youth are being met.  This is a very successful forum and it is also used to discuss new and innovative approaches to the arts, creativity and education.  In addition, an expert advisory council, chaired by Dr. Ciar&aacute;n Benson, has been established to guide the direction of creative youth and to assist the working group.<\/p> <p> Other programmes being delivered as part of Creative Ireland are designed to help further develop arts and culture in schools.  This is being done through the creative schools and creative clusters programmes.<\/p> <p> As recommendation 23 relates to tax legislation, it is a matter for the Minister for Finance.  The recommendation suggests amending tax legislation to allow tax benefits for private citizens who donate to arts organisations.  Under Section 1003 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, private citizens can obtain tax relief for donations to the State of items of significant cultural value.  In 2018, cultural works to the value of &euro;4.4 million were donated to the State.  The implementation of this tax incentive is under review.  Other existing tax reliefs for arts, culture and film include the artists tax exemption scheme under section 195 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Film tax relief is available under section 481 of the Act and the Film Regulations 2019.<\/p> <p> With regard to access, recommendations 25 and 26 relate to universal access.  The arts are for everyone, so must therefore be accessible to everyone.  The Arts Council funds organisations such as Disability Ireland to provide audio description and captioning for the hard of hearing.  It also funds touring and usually provides the resources for the receiving house to hire in audio description and caption technical material as well as for any conversion required.<\/p> <p> Recommendation 26 calls for a network of performance venues where audio description, captioning and Irish Sign Language could be made available, as well as suggesting parameters for the provision of access at commercial arts venues.  I fully intend to continue to work with all stakeholders on this to make accessibility to the arts a cornerstone of departmental and Government policy.<\/p> <p> Recommendations 27 and 28 relate to new work and stronger co-ordination of arts festivals.<\/p> <p>The council has a significant festival support programme for more than 150 festivals every year.  It also allocates funding to larger festivals such as the Dublin Theatre Festival, Babaro Children's Festival, Kilkenny Arts Festival and Waterford Spraoi.  I would like to acknowledge the other governmental stakeholders, such as the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and F&aacute;ilte Ireland, in regard to the promotion of festivals around the country.<\/p> <p> I hope I have given a flavour of the significant advances made by the Government in the arts in the five months since the publication of the Oireachtas committee report and, indeed, before that, and I very much welcome all the work that has gone into this report.  The Government will continue with significant investment across the arts, delivering ongoing dividends in the industry in line with the overall objectives of Project Ireland 2040.  I again thank the committee members for their work in preparing this report.  The arts can play a critical role in enriching the lives of all the people of Ireland and it is right that we, as Oireachtas Members, reflect on how best we can support those opportunities for engagement with the arts for the greatest number of people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110700035#MM00200","speaker":"1243","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573143000,"counter":368,"content":"<p>I thank the committee and the committee secretariat.  I had the luxury of being Chairman of the committee when it finalised the report, although I was not Chairman when it was initiated.  It is very a valuable piece of work, in particular in regard to the insights we gained from the artists and those who came before the committee, and their wisdom is reflected in the report, which should be read as widely as possible.  Some of the recommendations are quite simple and can be delivered straightaway, as some have been, which I welcome and acknowledge.<\/p>  <p>  I will focus on two areas, namely, recommendations 3 and 4.  Recommendation 3 states: \"Restore staff and funding to arts funding bodies, representative organisations, and individual artists to 2008-09 levels.\"  Although the Minister said there has been some move towards that restoration, Arts Council funding in 2008 was &euro;82 million and this year it is predicted to be &euro;80 million, and while that is welcome, it does not take account of the significant inflation involved.  We are going in the right direction but, at this stage, we need to be back to those levels because, if we are not, it is very difficult for those funding bodies to deliver fully on their programmes or to imagine other programmes beyond them.  This, therefore, is a key desire. <\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 4 states: \"Release a substantial part of funding promised by the Taoiseach in December 2017 when he reaffirmed Government&rsquo;s commitment to double funding of the arts over a seven year period.\"  We have not seen that to date but the seven years is not yet up and, hopefully, he will not be Taoiseach for the full seven years, although we will let the electorate decide that.<\/p>  <p>  One of the key findings of a recent survey by the Theatre Forum was that more than one third of artists and creative practitioners earn less than the minimum wage, with 74% of performing artists and creative practitioners relying on other sources of income.  If that is the case, it means we do not get the full benefit of their art production because they are distracted by having to work to earn a living and pay the bills.  Four fifths of the jobs they are working in are precarious jobs, which means it is difficult for them to plan and means they are always trying to figure out where the next buck is coming from.  It also means they will always have difficulty trying to pay mortgages or to have the sources of income required for them to have a home and have the stability that is needed to be an artist in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  There was much discussion at the Theatre Forum about how artists are placed front and centre at many State events and tourism initiatives.  That is pageantry without substance if we chronically under-fund artists and do not create the opportunities for them to have a secure income.  There is a long way for us to go before artists in this country would answer ,\"Yes\", if asked whether they have a secure and stable income.  This is one of the areas we should concentrate on.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach committed to doubling arts funding over seven years and, three budgets later, the funding has increased, which I accept.  However, funding for culture has increased by 17.5%, which is a long way from an increase of 100%.  We have a long way to go and, hopefully, that can be acted on and delivered within the timeframe he set out, or earlier, if possible.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister will be aware, we are near to bringing arts funding bodies to pre-recession levels yet we continue to lag behind our European counterparts.  Even in regard to the target for the Arts Council, we spend much less on culture in GDP terms than many of our European counterparts.  While the Government remains consistent in stating this is the commitment, that does not fully ring true when one examines the budget and how it is delivering for artists who are struggling to make ends meet.  Without painters, dancers, performers, musicians, writers and storytellers, there will not be film, television and radio, although perhaps after yesterday, we will have difficulty with RT&Eacute; anyway.  There will be nothing on the stage, nothing on the walls, nothing to attract the many people who come to Ireland to enjoy our culture and nothing for communities to enjoy.  There is no culture without the people and, specifically, no culture without artists.  That is why the arts matter, a point I will return to shortly. <\/p>  <p>  I referred to film and actors.  Based on our committee deliberations, I know a report was produced on the film industry which made several recommendations, some of which have never been acted upon, although that was not the fault of the Minister in one instance.  Nonetheless, we need sustainable jobs and we need to invest in the future.  We need to encourage, nurture and promote art for the benefit of all whether in film or theatre.  Artists need to benefit in order that society, our young and not so young, as well as tourists, can benefit.  The Exchequer benefits from all of that, as was clearly outlined to us in Theo Dorgan's piece, which I hope to quote before I conclude. <\/p>  <p>  While I am not an artist or musician, I come from a family of musicians, artists, sculptors and publishers, so I have an understanding of those who have suffered the consequences of not having a wage.  Friends of the family struggled with their art and struggled with having no funds for periods of time, so I know how difficult that is.  I also know of artists and musicians who left our shores and we did not benefit from their imagination for many years until they returned, although in some cases they did not return.<\/p> <p>We therefore need to try to ensure we encourage, or find mechanisms to encourage, those who can earn a living in order that we value the arts.  In so doing, we will say the arts matter.  If the arts matter, we must ensure we protect them.<br\/><br\/>I return to what Theo Dorgan said in the report:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe artist is one of us, and their gift to us is the generous and necessary work they do in cultivating, exploring and demonstrating, day in and day out, the unstoppable and exhilarating power of the imagination.  It is very much to our shame that while we profit from the work of these artists, while we glory in the achievements, we are content that most of them are ruthlessly condemned to live in poverty. <\/blockquote> <p>He went on to explain in a very enlightening way why the Department should respect and value artists a lot more.  He offers us one example:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe Indecon Report of 2011 tells us that, of the &euro;68 million assigned to the Council [that is, the Arts Council] that year, &euro;47 million came straight back into State coffers as PAYE, PRSI and VAT from organisations kept in being with the aid of Council grants.  The difference is &euro;21 million, so that represents the State's investment [in the Arts Council].  The return to the economy directly attributable to the work done by those organisations, and the artists whose work they showcased and employed, was &euro;148 million.  So you give me 11 and I give you back 148 &mdash; tell me, in those circumstances, would you offer me double the next year, treble [the income]? <\/blockquote> <p>There is a lot more in the report.  I ask the Minister with responsibility for arts, culture, heritage, the Gaeltacht and whatever else you are having for dinner to ensure that the Minister for Finance in particular and those in Revenue look at the Indecon report and this report to see the value of investment in artists and the arts.  They get such investment back on the double, treble and more.  Any investment in the arts pays us dividends, as a society at least, but if we are to bring it down to the brass tacks of finances, it also gives a much larger return than the return on many of our other investments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110700037#OO00200","speaker":"1305","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573143600,"counter":370,"content":"<p>The title of the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is The Arts Matter.  Politicians are quick to say they believe the arts matter whenever the issue is discussed, but when one actually looks at the level of support the State gives to the arts, it suggests that in reality the political system does not think the arts matter.  It does not treat the arts as if they matter because the level of funding for the arts is abysmal.  There is no gainsaying this.  The level of funding in this country is well below the EU average which, as people in this Chamber well know, is 0.6% of GDP.  In Ireland we are talking about 0.1%.  Considering how this country's international reputation at every level rests to a very significant extent on our achievements in the arts - poetry, literature, theatre, music and other art forms - this is a pretty serious indictment of the political system's lack of commitment to the arts.  As Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh intimated, and as others here have said before, people are very quick to jump into photographs with artists, to turn up for the big press occasions and to go to the high-profile events.  The level of support given to the arts, however, is abysmal and the plight of the artist is even more abysmal.<\/p><p>The levels of poverty and precariousness and just the struggle to survive among artists in this country are extreme and do not suggest that the political system really thinks artists and people who work in the arts, including theatre, literature and film, the latter of which I will discuss and have discussed on many occasions, matter when it comes down to brass tacks.  The facts in this regard are stark and were fairly well aired by Theatre Forum earlier this year in the D&aacute;il arising out of its survey, which told us that 80% of people surveyed exist in a precarious state of employment.  They do not know from job to job whether they will have another job.  How do they get mortgages?  How can they even be sure they will be able to pay their rent?  What about healthcare?  Of course, artists are not the only people in precarious situations; precarity in employment and lack of income and employment security are huge problems in many sectors.  However, the arts is very much one such sector, in which 80% of workers, according to the people surveyed, were in a precarious position.  Of PAYE jobs in the performing arts, 60% pay less than average industrial earnings, with the survey finding that the annual wage of two thirds of those surveyed was under &euro;23,000.  The artists, the people who work in the creative field and in the arts generally, are treated very badly.<\/p><p>Just before I got up to speak, I was scribbling down something that was sent to me.  It gives an indication of one particular sector.  I have made the point again and again that the Government needs to take quality employment seriously.  I have argued that film funding, which amounts to &euro;80 million per year, and more if Screen Ireland is added in terms of tax relief, be conditional on giving real rights to workers in the film industry.  I will quote to the House three clauses from a contract for a film crew member working on a film being made now, a film that will almost certainly be in receipt of section 481 tax relief.  This is what film crew have to put up with:<\/p> <blockquote> \tClause 10: Your working hours will vary depending upon the needs of the film as the company shall notify you from time to time.  On each date on which you are required to provide your services you agree to make yourself available to service the requirements of a normal ten-hour shooting day plus one hour for lunch or a continuous 9.5-hour day with half an hour for lunch. <\/blockquote>  <p>This is in black and white and a clear breach of the Organisation of Working Time Act.<\/p> <blockquote> \tClause 5: The provisions of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977-2007 shall not apply to any termination of your engagement, consisting only of completion of specified purpose. <\/blockquote>  <p>One cannot do this.  One cannot tell people that the Unfair Dismissals Act does not apply to them, but this is what one must sign up to to get a job in the Irish film industry.  These films are funded by and completely dependent on public money.  The contract goes on:<\/p> <blockquote> \tYou will have no entitlement to be paid your salary during a period of your absence due to illness except at the discretion of the company. <\/blockquote>  <p>This is another clear breach of workers' entitlements.  These are the sorts of contracts flying around in the Irish film industry.<\/p><p>What are we going to do about this?  I have been talking about this for two years.  The people who publicly came out and blew the whistle on this have been effectively blacklisted out of the industry.  That is what is going on and nobody seems to want to do anything about it.  It is a case of not upsetting the applecart.  It must stop.  That is the film industry but, of course, that is just one example of the general contempt with which artists, performers and other people working in the arts are treated.<\/p> <p>What can we do about that?  In the area of film, let us do what the Indecon report of 1995 said we should do.  If we are going to put a lot of public money into the Irish film industry, it should be directed towards creating companies of scale.  State aid to the arts is absolutely necessary and should, in my opinion, double or significantly increase.  EU directives on state aid to the arts clearly state that it must be given on condition of creating viable companies of scale with a permanent pool of employees.<\/p> <p> Lest anyone tries to throw dust in people's eyes, I want to stress that, when I or workers in the arts refer to a permanent pool of employees, that does not mean that those workers expect to be employed 365 days a year even if there are no films being made or work to be done.  That is not what they are saying and it is not what I am saying.  Those workers should not be in a completely precarious position from project to project.<\/p> <p> Everybody accepts that there is a project-to-project character to work in film and many of the arts, but workers should carry over some rights and entitlements from one production to another, particularly when the employers are often the same from one project to another and are in receipt of large amounts of public money.  People who work in the arts should not be in a constantly precarious position when the same producers are getting money again and again but setting up different designated activity companies, DACs, to shield themselves from any responsibility for their employees.  That is what is going on.  Producers are telling the Government to give them money on which they can claim tax relief because they will create quality employment.  When workers ask those producers for their rights, they are told that the producer is not the employer and that the worker is employed by a DAC that does not exist anymore because it finished when the previous film did.  That is unacceptable.<\/p> <p> I have focused on the issues in the film industry that reflect a more general problem.  We could employ thousands of artists, performers, writers and so on, give them a living income that would let them pursue their creative endeavours and ask them in exchange to work in education, mental health and schools for a number of days or weeks per year.  That way the artists would give something back to and enrich different sectors of our society in the areas of mental health, community projects in disadvantaged areas and so on.  In exchange, those artists would get a living income so they would have some sort of security of employment that would allow them to pursue their arts and live a proper existence where they could pay their rent and maybe get a mortgage and so on.  The artists are the people who produce the arts sector.  If we do not treat them properly, we are not acting on the principle that the arts matter.<\/p> <p> I appeal to the Minister to recognise those points and honour the artists, creative workers and people who work in those industries, including shooting crews.  They deserve respect and proper treatment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110700038#PP00200","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573144200,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to share a few brief thoughts on this report in this debate.  I welcome the report and it is important that focus is placed on the arts and the supports that are required in terms of funding, Government structures and regulatory frameworks and how they all might work together to support everything from our small town or village festivals right through to professional artists and all the difficulties that attend to their livelihoods.  It is a positive report but we must go further and begin to implement some of the actions outlined within.  We must come up with further avenues for funding and support.<\/p><p>I have a particular hat on because I have an interest in research policy in general.  The following applies to the arts as much as it does to history, economics, geography and other humanities subjects.  There can sometimes be a tendency for Government policy to support research that is perceived as being commercially valuable or useful and that has a particular outcome in product development, be that a new widget, microchip or a new business process approach.  It is every bit as valuable, if not more, that we invest in discovery research and frontier activities, be that a new artistic endeavour, historical manuscript or piece of archaeology, because those not only broaden the depth of human knowledge but also broaden the mind.  A student who has successfully mastered the creative arts and humanities, who can take a history problem and apply creative thinking to why one particular side won or lost a battle, go far beyond the dates, facts and figures involved, and apply a creative analysis, is well equipped to deal with the challenges that life might throw at him or her in any walk of life.<\/p><p>I recently attended my local university, the National University of Ireland, Maynooth.  The president of that college, Dr. Philip Nolan, told me about a student who had pursued a PhD in graphic novels.  I remember the <i>Batman<\/i>and <i>Arkham Asylum<\/i>graphic novels although I have not read them for some time.  This particular student conducted a PhD study in the art of the graphic novel.  That might have appeared to be an arcane cul-de-sac of knowledge to pursue, but that student was headhunted by Google or another of the large tech firms because the labyrinthine processes that could navigate and describe a graphic novel turned out to be very apt for navigating the World Wide Web and the processes, loops and nodes that intersect within the Internet.  That is proof that we find productivity and output, including commercial output, in unexpected quarters and it is always worthwhile advancing the font of human knowledge, advancing ourselves, and improving our educational attainment and the discovery process.  It is worth funding that.  It is worth funding for its own sake.  There is a commercial metric that is sometimes applied too bluntly by the Government, but even using that base criteria, we can find that unexpected outcomes flow.<\/p><p>I am delighted to see some recommendations in the report around small town and village festivals.  We all know the main streets in our local towns and villages, particularly our provincial main streets, are suffering.  There are empty buildings in many cases and there are issues such as rates, rents and parking.  There is a litany of issues that I will not go into now.  Our main streets must be rediscovered and become new places that we imagine in different ways.  Retail Ireland has coined the expression &quot;weekend experience, midweek convenience&quot;.  That means that our old main streets may not be the shopping centres and malls of the past or the places to get a pound of sausages or a pint of milk on a Wednesday evening, but they may instead become places where people congregate on a Saturday afternoon, a Friday night or a Sunday morning.  They could be a part of a coffee shop culture whereby people gather to exchange views and debate in a public square.  That is hugely supported by the development of festivals.<\/p><p>I was privileged to be involved as chair of the Midsummer Arts Festival when I was the mayor of Naas.  That was an example of how we helped the rejuvenation of Naas town by putting a festival on the map one weekend a year.  Many other groups put festivals on in the same town at different points on the calendar.  We have seen success in the likes of Kilkenny, Galway and D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  Many towns have taken this and run with it and have far more esteemed festival traditions than we have at present in Naas.  We aspire to that because it is a formula for rejuvenation and reinventing our town centres as cultural hubs and as places to meet, gather, congregate and engage in cultural activities.  I am delighted to see that specifically called out in the report as a recommended outcome.<\/p><p>The Minister and committee should examine how the funding models flow for those festivals because it is not always transparent or apparent how to attain funding and get support for those festivals.  There are multiple potential different agencies to approach, including the Arts Council and others, but it is not always clear, coherent or consistent how one particular festival can draw down funding when another cannot.<\/p><p>I commend the report and my colleague, Deputy Niamh Smyth, who has been to the fore in working on the committee, the report and the recommendations therein.  I also commend the rest of the committee and I wish the report and its implementation every success.  I look forward to further consideration and, I hope, when the Midsummer Arts Festival is convened next summer, we will have funding to draw down and supports in place as a result of this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110700039#QQ00200","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1573144200,"counter":373,"content":"<p>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this report.  I commend the Chair, the committee and my colleague, Deputy Niamh Smyth, who is passionate about the arts and the benefits they can bring to society and all of our communities.  There were nine meetings of the committee and it came to the conclusion that arts do matter.  They matter hugely in our society and country.<\/p> <p>If the Government agrees that this is the case, the Minister should commit to the implementation of the 28 excellent recommendations contained in this report.<\/p> <p> The arts enrich all of our lives.  People sometimes tend to think of the arts in the abstract, but they should not do so.  Creativity is fundamental to every one of us and to every part of the lives of every human being.  The capacity to imagine, to create and to explore must not be taken away from us.  We often see this incredible capacity in children and young people.  If it is unfortunately not nurtured, it has no place to strive and thrive.  We must ensure it is nurtured.<\/p> <p> The arts enable and empower us to reach our human potential.  Those who do not have an opportunity to explore the creative parts of themselves are losing out on a big part of life.  I put it to those who might not accept this argument that they cannot ignore the economic benefits of the arts.  The 2009 Indecon report, which assessed the economic impact of the arts in Ireland, absolutely showed what those benefits are.  While the arts are valued, there has been a lack of commitment and investment.  If the State is to realise fully the potential of the arts, its statements of support for the arts must be backed up by the investment of public moneys.  It was interesting to read in The Arts Matter that when Ms Garry Hynes spoke at the committee about the need for the Government to increase arts funding across the board - we all acknowledge that the arts are underfunded - she put it slightly differently by suggesting that the Government should \"be funding its own citizens to make art in its own country\".  I could not agree more that arts funding is needed in communities and societies.  It is shocking that a third of all performers earn less than the minimum wage and that 74% of our actors rely on other income.<\/p> <p> The forms of creativity and culture that are contained within the arts are absolutely essential to our well-being.  They give us different ways of looking at the world.  They have a huge societal value.  Deputy Lawless spoke about our festivals, which are of great importance for our communities, for our sense of place and for our sense of pride.  Equally, I am thinking about the tools that our theatre groups and our youth theatre groups, including Kildare Youth Theatre, which is based in Newbridge, and Griese Theatre Company, which is based in Ballitore, have given to young people as they try to navigate their lives.  They explore many topical societal issues, for example relating to sexuality, direct provision, immigration and domestic violence, through the form of theatre.  I have been to see a number of productions in which young people have collaborated and improvised to use the arts as a means of discussing what is important to them, including the societal issues they want and need to be concerned about.  The arts are helping to give them a voice and helping them to work through some of their thoughts and concerns.  The opportunity to do this on a European and global level, as Peter Hussey has done with Kildare Youth Theatre in a number of European countries, is invaluable for our young people as they seek to navigate the challenges of the world.<\/p> <p> The arts are an incredible gift that we love to talk about outside of our country.  The legacy of our poets and writers is absolutely incredible.  As we acknowledge and embrace the achievements of such people, it is equally important to help our struggling artists, poets and writers.  The arts officers in our local authorities are really good and have a great knowledge of their subject.  Every arts officer I know is passionate about the arts.  In particular, I would like to mention Lucina Russell and her predecessor, Mary Lenihan.  To be honest, they have worked miracles with the small amount of funding that has been made available to them.  They have helped us to embrace our culture and to create our own culture.  Culture changes all of the time.<\/p> <p> I would like to speak about amateur dramatics.  Given that 74% of our actors need to have another form of income, it is no wonder that amateur drama is thriving and doing so well.  It gives opportunities to people who might love to pursue a career in the acting world, but absolutely cannot do so.  The amateur drama scene is absolutely incredible.  I was reared on it as a child.  The week-long drama festival was the highlight in Rathangan every year.  It gave us an opportunity to listen and learn about other places and other worlds.  For one week a year, we had a chance to see how people in other parts of Ireland and other parts of the world were living, thinking and exploring the world.<\/p> <p> When my father was 27, he wrote a play called \"Straws in the Wind\", which was performed at the time.  He loved the world of the arts and the world of poetry.  He also applied his creative arts to politics.  Fifty years after his play was performed, a friend of mine, Mario Corrigan, who is the local archivist in Kildare County Council, contacted me to say he had found newspaper clippings about it.  As my father had just passed away a few months earlier, we felt that putting on his play once again would be a wonderful way of celebrating his passion for the arts.  A local drama group put on the play for three nights in our newly refurbished community centre, which my father had played a fundamental role in organising and getting the funds for.  One of my brothers played one of the parts in the sell-out production, which raised funds for the community centre.  As my father's child, I watched and listened along with my family and indeed the community.  It was an incredible way of looking back on how our society had been 50 years previously.  Basically, the play is about the impact of industrialisation on a rural agricultural village.  There were many lessons we could learn from the play about the continuing impact of such changes on small towns like Rathangan.  The play was also about the impact of change on a family.  It was a wonderful way of viewing my father's thoughts on fatherhood because there is a strong father in the play.  I was a baby when the play was written and my sister was a month old.  Another nine children came after that.  It was amazing for all 11 of us, and for my mother, to see my father's thoughts on stage.  I mention all of this as an illustration of the importance of the arts at an amateur level.  The arts can give us a snapshot of a moment in time and an opportunity to record what is happening within a community, a family and a society.  Being able to look back on the production of this play has given us a deep insight into ourselves and those who have gone before us.<\/p> <p> The recommendations in this report are excellent.  Fundamentally, the arts matter hugely.  The arts are about ourselves, promoting ourselves and listening to ourselves.  I hope the Minister takes very seriously the recommendations that have been made by the committee.  An opportunity was missed in last month's budget.  We absolutely need to take these recommendations on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110700039#QQ00300","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573144800,"counter":375,"content":"<p>I will try to deal with some of the contributions of Deputies.  I appreciate the comments they have made.  I am delighted to inform Deputy Smyth that the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, through Creative Ireland and the Department's Gaeltacht division, is supporting Eala&iacute;on na Gaeltachta and the Irish-language arts policy.<\/p> <p>That kicked off last week with advertisements on TG4.  Submissions are currently being sought from the public.<\/p> <p> The Deputy also mentioned the creative schools project, an initiative of Creative Ireland.  As she is aware, it is administered through the Arts Council and is going from strength to strength.  Some 300 schools across Ireland are involved, with a particular focus on DEIS and special schools.  As she stated, we are building on the work of others, including ETBs and the arts in education charter.<\/p> <p> The Deputy also referred to restoring Arts Council funding to 2009 levels.  I am glad to confirm that Arts Council funding in 2020 will exceed 2009 levels.

There is a distinction to be drawn in that regard.  One must bear in mind the &euro;1.2 billion in capital investment.  I acknowledge Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh's comments regarding the doubling of arts funding.  The Taoiseach made that commitment and I want to see it happen.  I see no reason for it not to happen.  As Deputies are aware, there have been difficult circumstances this year due to Brexit but we are on the right trajectory, as I stated yesterday in the House.<\/p><p>Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh asked about the theatre sector report, as did Deputy Boyd Barrett.  I do not wish to engage in a statistical debate on the matter but according to CSO statistics earnings in the sector grew by 3.3% in 2018, in line with the increase in earnings across the country.<\/p><p>Deputy Boyd Barrett raised issues relating to employment conditions in the audiovisual industry.  He also raised them yesterday in the House.  I know it is an issue about which he is passionate.  He will be aware that it is currently the subject of an examination by the Workplace Relations Commission.  That is not to say there are no challenges which we must consider.  Certainly, the situation he described seems to be exploitative and should be reported to Screen Ireland because, if his information is correct, it is not something which could be stood over.  I do not wish to comment on any particular film producers but the situation he described should not happen.  If it has happened, we should not stand for it and it should be sorted out.<\/p><p>I point out to Deputy Lawlor, who has left the Chamber, that the Arts Council has a memorandum of understanding with the Irish Research Council to allow it to work with PhD graduates.  I agree there is a dearth of research in the broad culture policy arena.  The Creative Ireland programme supports a new online digital repository for arts in education research which was launched in October of this year.<\/p><p>Deputy Lawlor referred to festival funding.  As Deputies are aware, there are three primary sources for such funding, namely, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Arts Council and my Department.<\/p><p>It was lovely to hear about Deputy O'Loughlin's father and large family all being involved in amateur dramatics.  As she may know, for the first time in more than a decade, in this year's budget the Department was able to provide funding of &euro;250,000 to amateur dramatic and musical societies.  That is an acknowledgement of the work they do.  I agree with the Deputy that they are embedded in each community, locality and constituency.  Many people go on from them to further their acting and musical career and we wish to support such societies.  I was very pleased to be able to do so.<\/p><p>As Deputies are aware, artists' salaries are not the responsibility of the Department.  On this matter there is a principle of keeping an arm's length between the Department and the Arts Council, which independently decides what each artist and arts organisation receives.  Ultimately, it is for the Arts Council to stipulate whether there is a minimum wage.<\/p><p>I appreciate Deputy O'Loughlin's comments on Youth Theatre Ireland.  Peter Hussey, to whom she referred, has much experience in that area.  Creative Ireland also supported the national amateur drama final in County Clare, which was a great success.  <\/p><p>I thank the committee for producing this very comprehensive report.  I very much welcome its publication.  It is an important contribution to policy deliberation in the sector.  As I stated, the arts should be imbued in the fabric of Irish society.  All present are <i>ad idem<\/i>in that regard.  On my travels, I have seen how culture and creativity in the arts play such an integral and pivotal part in other countries.  This country punches far above its weight in terms of talent and output.  We are doing all we can in this area.  I reassure every Deputy who is present or went to the trouble of compiling or working on the report that I am endeavouring to do everything I can to support the arts.  I enjoy the arts and they are of great importance for the individual and collective well-being of all members of society, no matter what their age.  I will try to continue to support the arts as best I can.  We have made significant progress through the years, particularly through the Creative Ireland programme, the increases in Arts Council funding and the matters to which I made reference yesterday in the House such as the Per Cent for Art scheme which had not been looked at since 1997 and goes a long way towards helping artists and also, it is hoped, the aesthetic around various institutions, buildings and possibly street art which will enhance everybody's lives from visual and economic perspectives.<\/p><p>The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, and I worked on the social welfare scheme which has been extended.  It is a positive signal to artists.  Deputy Boyd Barrett and others have made reference in the House to the precarious position in which artists may find themselves.  We must try to support them in any way we can.  I am endeavouring to do so and to find mechanisms whereby I can support them.  Obviously, we do not want artists to have to avail of social welfare but, if they do they will, at least, be provided with a year in which they will not be subject to normal labour activation measures and will be able to work on their art.  That is important.<\/p><p>I will continue to reflect on the recommendations made in this significant report.  A large amount of work has gone into it.  It was helpful for various agencies, Departments and witnesses to appear before the committee and have their say.  Many of them are well known in the industry and it is important that they are listened to because they are at the coalface of this matter and know the challenges intimately.  I thank Deputies for their contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110700041#SS00300","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1573145400,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her reflections on the contributions in respect of the report.  Music generation is one of the projects that have been happening across the country for several years.  Cavan and Monaghan ETB was one of the more recent ETBs to successfully come on board in that regard.  Having spoken to some of the project workers there, I know that it is slow to get off the ground but they are engaging with Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann.  It is important to highlight the wonderful work done by Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann across the island through engaging with small communities.  It does phenomenal work with children through lessons and Fleadh Cheoil na h&Eacute;ireann which takes place in various towns and  brings an economic benefit to those localities and counties.  Music generation offers the opportunity to have such an impact.  I know the Minister cannot fund every organisation but it is welcome to see it being pursued by Cavan and Monaghan ETB.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister will remember that at a recent meeting of the committee I asked whether she would engage with the local arts and education partnership of Cavan and Monaghan ETB.  It was disappointed not to receive funding from the Department in the most recent round of funding for arts education.  I told the Minister that I knew that from a professional point of view it is doing wonderful work.  I asked the Minister to engage with Joanne Brennan, its arts education officer.  If such engagement with the partnership is not under way, I ask that the Minister or her officials facilitate it because the partnership could learn from the reason for its application being unsuccessful, while the Department could learn from what the partnership has been doing extremely well for many years.<\/p>  <p>  It would be remiss of me not to mention Dr. Katie Sweeney.  She has done terrific work on the arts in education portal which has brought arts education providers, schools, creative artists and teachers in contact with each other and opened up a world for people who may have previously been working in silos.<\/p> <p>That is a welcome development in the delivery of arts education in our schools and communities.  It gives arts professionals the opportunity to link with schools and ETBs, thereby providing an opportunity for employment for them.  As many of my colleagues mentioned, the hard fact is that professional artists will most likely have spent four years doing a degree in NCAD, Crawford College of Art and Design, Limerick School of Art and Design or any of the wonderful colleges that provide fantastic third level education but when they come out, what is there for them?<\/p> <p> A number of months ago we attended the Theatre Forum presentation.  The artists came from many different disciplines, including visual, performing and literary arts.  They told harrowing stories about what life is like.  They are essentially self-employed.  They face challenges such as lack of childcare and lack of healthcare.  They face an abysmal future in respect of owning a home.  That particularly affects artists working in urban areas, such as Dublin, Limerick and Cork.  Living in those cities is essential for them to deliver their work.  It is a catch-22 and a vicious circle.  They must be in urban areas to be able to engage with other practitioners and galleries and to participate in the arts community.  It is isolating for artists living in more rural parts, such as Cavan and Monaghan, where they are limiting their opportunities.  The artists who want to progress and develop their careers must live in urban areas.  However, increasingly because of high rents and their inability to get a mortgage, they are being pushed further out, thereby limiting their work opportunities.<\/p> <p> Regarding their working conditions, childcare is a major problem for them as is healthcare.  On professional development and making progress, sustainable employment is not always possible for them.  If they are thinking about having a family and owning their own home, some artists leave this particular career path because they can never go to the bank and provide the financial back-up that banks now require for people to get mortgages.  We need to take a hard look at how to address that issue.<\/p> <p> Many of my colleagues mentioned the amateur arts.  The Arts Council has a specific role to ensure professional artists get the professional support and access to developing their careers.  For those in amateur arts, there are many drama festivals, as Deputy O'Loughlin mentioned.  I am thinking of Shercock Drama Festival, Maudabawn Drama Festival and Cavan Drama Festival.  They can be the glue that hold communities together.  In some cases, people might not otherwise know their own neighbours.  Rural communities are good at having drama groups.<\/p> <p> They have interactions with other community groups across the country through one-act drama festivals.  They go on a circuit and provide great entertainment for many audiences.  We need to see if there is a way of nurturing and supporting that.  Communities get together to provide meals and accommodation for them when they arrive.  The Arts Council cannot support that because it has a different remit.  We should also look at how we can support amateur drama groups and others in visual arts, which are very important.<\/p> <p> Yesterday representatives of Free Market appeared before the Joint Committee on Rural and Community Development to talk about their research.  Departmental officials will be well aware of the research Free Market has done in small towns.  They are the small-town champions and they have done magnificent research.  Voluntary groups such as Castleblaney regeneration committee are doing phenomenal work to try to ensure they are at the forefront grasping any funding opportunity that the Department presents.  Free Market is a group of artists, curators, architects and planners who come from a creative background and who have much to offer with their knowledge and experience.  They presented hard evidence at yesterday's committee meeting and I commend them on their work.<\/p> <p> While the Joint Committee on Rural and Community Development is a different committee, it is amazing how they all link into each other.  The message we got from the Free Market representatives is that various Departments are trying to do the same thing.  We need a research-based team such as Free Market in some third level institution.  Community groups in towns and villages could go to such a research-based organisation and identify the size of the town and the challenges they face.  The organisation could then show them a model that is working well and how to apply for funding.  Volunteers would not become exhausted reinventing the wheel trying to do the same thing other community groups might have been doing for the past ten years.  The representatives of Free Market presented hard research.  They gave the example of single Scottish town partnerships that work well.  A conversation is taking place between the Departments with responsibility for housing, local government, arts and transport.  This Parliament needs to move towards the model Free Market presented to the joint committee.  I encourage the Minister to sit down with the representatives of Free Market.  I compliment Ms Miriam Delaney and Mr. Laurence Lord who presented at yesterday's committee meeting.  They have done invaluable research from which we can all learn.<\/p> <p> I thank my colleagues on the committee who sat through numerous meetings.  I particularly thank those who made presentations to the committee.  All the artists, performers and literary artists who came in appreciated the opportunity to be heard and to have their concerns and challenges raised.  It is now incumbent on us to do something about them and to implement the recommendations in the report.  I am sure I speak for all my colleagues in saying the Minister will have cross-party support in delivering as many of these recommendations as we can.  I thank the Minister and my colleagues for attending today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110700041#SS00400","speaker":"1271","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1573146000,"counter":381,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1573146000,"counter":382,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 5.50 p.m. until 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 12 November 2019.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
