The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention, the contract for which was signed in November last with National Broadband Ireland (NBI). The NBP network will offer users a high speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 500Mbps from the outset. This represents an increase from the 150Mbps committed to under the Contract. The deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years. As of\u00a027 October, design work is complete or on-going in target townlands across 25 counties and steady progress is being made with over 118,000 premises surveyed to date. This activity is increasing week on week and NBI expects to have completed some 120,000 surveys by the end of the year.<\/p><p>Given that the contracted delivery of the National Broadband Plan State led intervention is over a 7 year period and the nature of the works involved in delivering a fibre telecommunications network, it is not possible to provide a detailed timetable on a Townlands basis.

In\u00a0Clare, I\u00a0can advise that surveys\u00a0have commenced in the areas of Cratloe, Ballycannan, Ballyglas and Cloghrea and further surveys are due to commence in the areas of Kilkishen before the end of this year. <\/p><p>This activity involves physically walking the routes and documenting images, notes and measurements of the poles, cables and underground ducts in each area. This is informing design solutions for provision of the fibre network. This detailed design is then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with eir for the area, where eir ensure any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose. It is also used to initiate works with the subcontractors deploying the actual fibre in the area. The laying of fibre should commence shortly with the first fibre to the home connections expected around December in Cork. <\/p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network.

The legislation provides that the employer must be able to demonstrate that they are operating at no more than 70% in either the turnover of the employer&rsquo;s business or the customer orders received by the employer by reference to the period from July to December 2020 compared with the same period in 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  There is additional flexibility in the application of the turnover test to allow employers to take account of potentially sudden changes in turnover on a month-to-month &ldquo;opt-in\/opt-out&rdquo; basis.  Under the legislation, an employer is required to carry out a review of their turnover each month and confirm that they are still eligible for the scheme.  At the same time, there is no cut-off deadline for access to the scheme, so if there is a reduction in turnover later in 2020 because of an unexpected reduction in business activity or a sudden change in business circumstances the employer may be entitled to make a claim for that future period.  <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the EWSS contains sufficient flexibility to take account of changes in business circumstances and is targeted at employers across all sectors who are most in need of support.  <\/p>  <p>  For those who may not be eligible for the EWSS, I would draw attention to the comprehensive package of other business and employer supports that have been made available since the July Stimulus Plan and Budget 2021 - including the Covid Restriction Support Scheme (CRSS), the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400075#WRC00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":77,"content":"<p>Question No. 41 answered with Question No. 39.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":78,"content":"<p>Question No. 42 answered with Question No. 38.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Medical Certificates","counter":79,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400075#WRC01200"},{"type":"question","counter":80,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[34007\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400075#WRC01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when assessments will recommence for applications for primary medical certificates; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1508","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":81,"content":"<p>The Disabled Drivers &amp;amp; Disabled Passengers Scheme provides relief from VRT and VAT on the purchase and use of an adapted car, as well as an exemption from motor tax and an annual fuel grant.

In order to qualify for relief an organisation must be entered in the register of charitable organisations under Part 3 of the Charities Act 2009, be engaged in the transport of disabled persons and whose purpose is to provide services to persons with disabilities.<\/p><p>In order to qualify for relief the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate (PMC) issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate (BMC) issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other criteria apply in relation to the vehicle and its use, including that the vehicle must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.<\/p><p>The terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 set out the following medical criteria, and that one or more of these criteria is required to be satisfied in order to obtain a PMC:<\/p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; <\/p><p>- be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; <\/p><p>- be without both hands or without both arms; <\/p><p>- be without one or both legs; <\/p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; <\/p><p>- have the medical condition of dwarfism and have  serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.  <\/p><p>A Supreme Court decision of 18<sup>th<\/sup>June found in favour of two appellants against the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal's refusal to grant them a PMC.

The medical officers who are responsible for conducting PMC assessments need to have assurance that the decisions they make are based on clear criteria set out in legislation.

The three main retail banks assured the T&aacute;naiste, Leo Varadkar T.D., Minister McGrath and me at meetings in July that they were considering applications and mortgage drawdowns from customers on the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) on a case by case basis and that they are taking a fair and balanced approach. <\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), which replaced the TWSS, is to support employers by helping them to continue trade as they deal with risk arising from COVID-19, and this puts employers in a position to retain key staff and ensure the viability of businesses and firms.  <\/p>  <p>  In respect of the approach of regulated mortgage lenders on new mortgage lending, the Central Bank has advised that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. If mortgage applicants have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application, they should in the first instance contact their lender directly on the matter.<\/p>  <p>  However, within the parameters of the regulatory framework, as set out below, the decision to grant or refuse an individual application for mortgage credit is a commercial decision to be made by the regulated entity. Also a loan offer may contain a condition that the lender can withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is also a commercial decision for the lender.<\/p>  <p>  The European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which is necessary, sufficient and proportionate. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.<\/p>  <p>  Where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.<\/p>  <p>  If a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated firm is dealing with them, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm. If they are still not satisfied with the response from the regulated firm, they can refer the complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400075#WRC01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Unions","counter":86,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400075#WRC01900"},{"type":"question","counter":87,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[34118\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400075#WRC02000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of staff in the registry of credit unions by division of units within the registry; the way in which this has changed since the commencement of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1576","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":88,"content":"<p>The Central Bank has informed me that the number of staff in the Registry of Credit Unions is currently 52, allocated across the following activities:<\/p><p>- Supervision<\/p><p>- Intervention &amp;amp; Restructuring<\/p><p>- Policy Framework \/ Regulatory Approvals<\/p><p>- Business Model Engagement<\/p><p>- Operations<\/p><p>The majority of staff are engaged in supervision and intervention and restructuring activities.<\/p><p>In 2012 there were 48 staff allocated across the following areas:<\/p><p>- Supervision<\/p><p>- Intervention &amp;amp; Restructuring <\/p><p>- Policy Framework<\/p><p>- Financial Analysis<\/p><p>- Operations<\/p><p>A dedicated Business Model Engagement unit was established in 2016, to engage on business model development from a regulatory perspective.  <\/p><p>Since 2019, the Financial Analysis function has been relocated within the Central Bank&rsquo;s Risk Analysis, Data Analytics &amp;amp; Reporting Division.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400075#WRC02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":90,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400075#WRC02300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Stations","counter":89,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400075#WRC02200"},{"type":"question","counter":90,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[34119\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400075#WRC02300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if the Garda station in Spiddal, County Galway will be refurbished and provided with updated facilities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1576","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":91,"content":"<p>I can confirm that the Office of Public Works (OPW) are liaising with Garda Estate Management on options regarding the replacement of an end-of-life prefabricated unit at Spiddal Garda Station.  <\/p><p>Indicative costs have been provided and the OPW awaits final confirmation to proceed from Garda Estate Management.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400075#WRC02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1494"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":93,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400075#WRC02600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":92,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400075#WRC02500"},{"type":"question","counter":93,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[34017\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400075#WRC02600","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if she will reconsider the exclusion of minor and under 20s championship games from level 5 restrictions; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1499","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":94,"content":"<p>In line with the Government-approved &ldquo;Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19&rdquo; during the period of application of the current Level 5 restrictions all matches and other sporting events must cease.

In the absence of these examinations, every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The process of national standardisation, which forms a key part of the Calculated Grades process, was applied to the information provided by schools in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard.  In order to be fair to the class of 2020, the teacher judgements made at the level of the school had to be adjusted so that a common national standard was applied. It was inherent to the system of calculated grades that school estimates would be subject to adjustment through this standardisations process.  <\/p>  <p>  These adjustments resulted in the school estimates of subject percentage marks staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The standardisation process operated on the premise that the school estimates should only be adjusted through the standardisation process where there was credible statistical evidence to justify changing them.  <\/p>  <p>  A standardising process happens every year and would have happened in 2020 had the Leaving Certificate examinations been run as normal.  In the system of calculated grades, the standardisation process applied uniformly across all subject and levels and school types.  The degree to which mark changes occurred related to the degree of over or underestimation in the school estimates for each subject and each level.  This means that some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced marks changes from the teacher estimates leading to grade changes in one or more of their subjects.  <\/p>  <p>  Following standardisation, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade which was provided to students on 7 September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade.  <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, it is not accurate to state that student(s) were downgraded, or upgraded, through the standardisation process.  Rather the grade that was awarded following the standardisation process is the grade for the 2020 Leaving Certificate (Calculated Grades).  <\/p>  <p>  The overall data on school estimated marks showed that there was a very significant rise in estimated grades against what would normally be achieved nationally. This level of grade increase based on the school estimates would have been unrealistic. For example, based on the school data, there would have been 13.8% H1 grades this year when in a normal year it is approximately 5.8%. Even with the standardisation process the rate of H1s this year is over 9%.    <\/p>  <p>  While some students will be disappointed at the results they have achieved, this is the case every year when the Leaving Certificate results are published. It may be more difficult for students to understand when they see the estimated mark from the school. <\/p>  <p>  The appeals process for Calculated Grades was open to students who were disappointed with the Calculated Grades they received in one or more subjects. Students unhappy with the outcome of the above process could invoke a separate process to have their appeal reviewed by independent Appeals Scrutineers. These scrutineers are independent of my Department. The independent Appeals Scrutineers will check to ensure the correct procedures were followed throughout the appeals process. The scrutineers will have access to the records and documentation considered in the appeals process.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, students had the option to register to sit the 2020 written Leaving Certificate exams which are due to commence on 16 November. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400076#WRD03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":157,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400076#WRD03300"},{"type":"question","counter":158,"qnumday":70,"qnumall":"[33996\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400076#WRD03400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the average number of close contacts a positive case of Covid-19 has in a school setting (details supplied).","asker":"1486","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":159,"content":"<p>The Health Protection Surveillance Centre and the HSE have published guidance for managing potential cases of COVID-19 in educational settings, which includes the testing strategy within an educational facility &lsquo;Schools Pathway for COVID-19, the Public Health approach&rsquo;   <\/p><p>When a positive Covid-19 cases arises that is connected to a school community, either a staff member or a student the HSE Department of Public Health will liaise directly with schools if the case of COVID-19 was in the school during the infectious period.

This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School.<\/p>  <p>  These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019\/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020\/21 school year as a contingency measure. As the loss of learning through school closures will have affected students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place will play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. The adjustments were arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC) and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders.  <\/p>  <p>  These changes to the national assessment arrangements have been made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. <\/p>  <p>  The State Examinations Commission (SEC), which has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations, intends to operate the 2021 state examinations as normally as possible, with appropriate contingency built in, in line with prevailing public health advice. It is not intended that there would be any change to the length of the written examinations. For subjects where the SEC issues project briefs during the 2020\/21 school year, the intention is to issue these at least four weeks earlier than normal. For subjects with course work completion dates typically late in the school year, schools will be asked to submit this coursework two weeks earlier than normal as a contingency measure. In this context teachers are being encouraged to plan and undertake these projects as early as possible in the programme of study. <\/p>  <p>  Other documents published by the Department to support the return to school include Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education and Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers. These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning.  All documentation published is available on www.gov.ie\/backtoschool<\/p>  <p>  The www.gov.ie\/backtoschool site also contains information on wellbeing supports for Leaving Certificate students.  This includes a series of supports on managing wellbeing, coping with uncertainty and managing stress and anxiety, developed by the National Educational Psychological Service, to support students. The webpage has links to more individualised support for students to access, should these be needed. My Department worked with the Department of Health and the HSE to ensure the most appropriate services and resources are clearly signposted for students.  <\/p>  <p>  Promoting the wellbeing of school communities has been a fundamental element of my Department&rsquo;s overall plan to support a successful return to school as we continue to manage the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. We know that most students have been happy and relieved to get back to school, reconnect and prepare to re-engage with learning.

This allocation of SNAs is to meet the care needs of pupils in 2021 and will enable the establishment of new special classes, creation of new places in special schools, support children in mainstream classes and the transition to the new allocation model for the 2021\/22 school year.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently 16,969 SNAs allocated to schools. The Budget 2021 increase to 18,000 SNAs posts represents an increase of increase of 70% in the number of SNAs provided since 2011 at which point 10,575 SNAs were available.<\/p>  <p>  A new model for allocating SNAs to primary and post primary schools for students in mainstream classes only was to be introduced in the 2020\/21 school year as part of the phased roll out of the School Inclusion Model (SIM).  In light of the ongoing Covid-19 crisis the Frontloaded Allocation Model for SNAs was deferred until the beginning of the 2021\/22 school year.<\/p>  <p>  Further advice will issue in the course of the 2020\/21 school year on the introduction of the frontloaded model with effect from September 2021. This will outline the overall approach, including the professional development and other supports to be made available for schools and teachers.<\/p>  <p>  The change to a new allocation model was recommended by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in policy advice published in May 2018 entitled the \"Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme &ndash; a new School Inclusion Model to deliver the right supports at the right time to students with additional care needs&rdquo;.  <\/p>  <p>  The Review highlighted the important role SNAs play in assisting students with additional care needs to attend school and acknowledged that the scheme is greatly valued by parents, students and schools.  There is evidence of an enduring loyalty and a strong attachment between many schools, students, parents and SNAs.  <\/p>  <p>  The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs. While SNAs are very much valued in the provision of care support, the Review recommended that a more broadly based set of supports was required including therapeutic supports.  <\/p>  <p>  Under the new model the allocation of SNAs for mainstream classes to primary and post primary schools will be based on the school profile used for the allocation of Special Education Teachers and will not be based on an annual application process, this means that schools will have certainty around their SNA allocation going forward, and it will enable schools to engage SNA&rsquo;s on contracts of employment for a longer duration than is currently possible. SNA will then have more certainty around their tenure of employment and the new model does not change their roles and functions. <\/p>  <p>  The Review also referenced SNA training. Among the recommendations was the introduction of a national training programme for SNAs currently employed in our schools. Following a public procurement process, University College Dublin (UCD) School of Education, in conjunction with UCD School of Nursing, Midwifery and Health Systems, were selected to develop and deliver this important educational initiative. UCD&rsquo;s wide-ranging experience and expertise will enable the delivery of a broad-ranging and high-quality programme. This programme will begin in January 2021 with 500 participants in the first year. Priority is being given to SNAs working in School Inclusion Pilot Schools.<\/p>  <p>  This major educational initiative will enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life. For some SNAs, this programme may present the first opportunity in recent times for them to engage with the theory and research based best practice underlying their role. There is no cost to serving SNAs working in schools. This course is fully funded by the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400077#WRE01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":198,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400077#WRE01800"},{"type":"question","counter":199,"qnumday":85,"qnumall":"[34129\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400077#WRE01900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if drama students are permitted to attend in person their educational facility that will allow them pre-record their speciality piece as they seek a place in third-level education for that given speciality in view of the fact that this process would normally be face to face in the UK but due to Covid-19 a video recording in lieu of in person is permitted.","asker":"1566","askee":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":200,"qnumday":86,"qnumall":"[34130\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400077#WRE02000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the basis on which performing arts exam students, vocational students, pre-professional students or recreational students are excluded from training in level 3 restrictions; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1566","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":201,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 86 together.<\/p><p>My Department has published a suite of helpful guidance for the safe and sustainable operation of schools.

It is also available to self-employed people whose income from self-employment ceased or reduced as a direct consequence of the pandemic to the extent that they would be available to take up full-time employment. <\/p>  <p>  The Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment is payable where a person was an employed contributor in the week immediately before he or she ceased to earn an income from the employment concerned. Similarly, a self-employed person must have been in insurable self-employment in the week immediately before the date on which their self-employment income ceased or reduced.

Firstly, legislative change is required by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth which has responsibility for parents leave policy.  This legislation needs to be carefully prepared and drafted before being brought through the Oireachtas, given that it extends a statutory leave entitlement that, in addition to benefitting workers, has implications for employers.<\/p>  <p>  It will also be necessary for parallel amendments to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended) to be drafted and brought through the Oireachtas to provide the legislative basis for the extended payment of benefit.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, significant changes are required to the Department's systems to administer this extension, including the provision of retrospective entitlement.  This work needs to be undertaken in such a way that is does not compromise existing supports in an environment where there are unprecedented levels of demand on the Department&rsquo;s services due to Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  The extra weeks of leave will be made available as soon as the necessary legislation which is being drafted by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is enacted. <\/p>  <p>  Once the new application and payment system goes live in April, my Department will then process and issue benefit payments - to include backdated payment of benefit as appropriate - in respect of Parents Leave taken from the date of enactment.<\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400077#WRE04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment","counter":223,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400077#WRE04400"},{"type":"question","counter":224,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[34131\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400077#WRE04500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the current position regarding self-employed persons such as taxi drivers working and claiming the pandemic unemployment payment; the changes announced in budget 2021 in respect of this situation; when these new provisions will be implemented; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

However, as with other policy and legislative reforms, interested parties are welcome to make submissions on this matter.<\/p>  <p>  The position with regard to gazumping is that instances normally arise where a non-enforceable agreement for the sale of property at a particular price is reached between a vendor and intending purchaser but subsequently the vendor refuses to complete a formal contract and sells the property to another purchaser for a higher price. The non-enforceable relationship between the original parties is preserved by use of the term \"subject to contract\". <\/p>  <p>  The problems associated with gazumping were examined in detail by the Law Reform Commission in its 1999 \"Report on Gazumping\" (LRC 59-1999). The Commission noted that delays arising between the conclusion of negotiations and completion of the formal contract were usually for the benefit of the intending purchaser, e.g. to ensure the availability of funding for that property, or to ascertain if there were any legal difficulties in relation to the title. The Commission concluded that the only practicable reforms were to improve the information available to intending purchasers and to regulate the terms according to which booking deposits are paid and accepted. It did not recommend any specific legislative reforms to the legal framework within which gazumping occurs.  <\/p>  <p>  The Property Services Regulatory Authority, which was established under the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011, published a detailed &ldquo;Guide for Users of Property Services Providers in Ireland\" which explains the legal position in relation to gazumping and related matters such as payment of deposits and signing of contracts. The Guide is available on the Authority's web site (www.psr.ie). <\/p>  <p>  I would also like to advise the Deputy that the Property Registration Authority (PRA) is responsible for registering ownership of land in the State. This statutory function is conferred on the PRA under the Registration of Deeds and Title Acts 1964 and 2006. These Acts make provision for the making of more detailed statutory rules setting out the procedures to be followed when registering land. Statutory responsibility for the PRA, and land registration policy, now rests with the Minister and Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400078#WRF03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Refugee Status","counter":272,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400078#WRF04100"},{"type":"question","counter":273,"qnumday":114,"qnumall":"[34122\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400078#WRF04200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of applicants under the Irish Refugee Protection Humanitarian Admissions Programme in each year; the number of applications which were successful, rejected and still in process; the reason for rejections; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":274,"content":"<p>The Irish Refugee Protection Programme Humanitarian Admission Programme (IHAP), announced in May 2018, is part of the Government's plan to realise the full commitment of 4,000 persons agreed under the first phase of the IRPP in September 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The programme allows holders of an international protection status in Ireland, (i.e. refugees with Convention or Programme Refugee status), holders of Subsidiary Protection grants, and Irish citizens, to make a proposal to me to bring to the State their family members who are nationals of one of the top ten major source countries of refugees as identified by the UNHCR Annual Global Trends Report. <\/p>  <p>  IHAP received proposals for inclusion in the programme within defined periods or &lsquo;windows for submissions&rsquo;.

I am further informed that the Data Protection Officer in my Department investigated the circumstances surrounding the missing USB stick and the outcome of that investigation was subsequently notified to the DPC.  <\/p>  <p>  The investigation found that: <\/p>  <p>  - Despite a thorough search of both premises the missing USB stick was not located.<\/p>  <p>  - An Post indicated that no USB stick was identified in their Recovery\/Reclaim Unit.<\/p>  <p>  - The USB stick in question was an INTEGREL Courier USB key with hardware encryption.

In circumstances where the USB stick&rsquo;s technical protection measures (i.e. encryption) rendered the data unintelligible, there was no reason to notify the data subjects.

The central focus of the response to COVID-19 has been to control the spread of the virus in so far as possible to protect those who are most vulnerable from infection, as well as protecting against causes, situations, circumstances, and behaviours that may lead to the spread of COVID-19.<\/p>  <p>  Sustained communication and interagency cooperation also remain central to the response to COVID-19. The State&rsquo;s responsibility to respond to the public health emergency created the need for the HSE to set up a structured nursing home support system in line with NPHET recommendations.  This package of supports has been a critical intervention in supporting the resilience of the sector in meeting the unprecedented challenges associated with COVID-19. Guidance, PPE, staffing, serial testing, infection prevention and control training, accommodation and financial support have been provided to the nursing home sector, both public and private. In addition, multi-disciplinary clinical supports are in place at CHO level through 23 COVID-19 Response Teams as well as outbreak control teams responding to outbreaks.  <\/p>  <p>  It remains a legal obligation that every provider ensures that the number and skill mix of staff within its nursing home is appropriate having regard to the needs of the residents and the size and layout of the nursing home concerned. HIQA has published a regulatory assessment framework of the preparedness of designated centres for older people for a COVID-19 outbreak. Under this framework the provider should ensure that they have contingency plans in place, that their contingency plan is based on national guidance from the HSE, HPSC and Government and that it is reviewed regularly to include clear contingency arrangements, including,  to establish surge capacity and arrangements to address potential staffing shortage. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, as part of a package of support measures for nursing homes, a COVID-19 Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme was established.  This opened for applications on 17th April 2020. The core concept of the scheme is that the State will provide additional funding to those nursing homes that require it, to contribute towards costs associated with COVID-19 preparedness, mitigation and outbreak management.

It aims to allow society and businesses to be able to operate as normally as possible, while continuing to suppress the virus. The Plan is framed to account for periods during which there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied. Each level outlines what is permitted for social or family gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services. <\/p><p>As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. For this reason, we are all asked to be extra careful when socialising and working with others. For now, we must act like we have the virus to protect those around us from infection.<\/p><p>The number of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the Government Framework are based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible.<\/p><p>It is advised to socialise safely and within the capacity limits. These various limits in the Levels are all designed to reduce the number of households mixing with each other and cut down the virus&rsquo;s chances of spreading into more homes. <\/p><p>The Deputies should note, that the numbers should not be considered a target - they are the maximum recommended number. It&rsquo;s always safer to meet less people, less often, for less time. If we do this, we have a better chance of keeping to the lower Levels in the Framework, and continuing to keep businesses, schools, and healthcare services open, while also protecting the most vulnerable. <\/p><p>The &lsquo;Framework for Restrictive Measures in Response to COVID-19&rsquo; in the provides for restrictions on gatherings of people indoors given the higher risk associated with these types of activities and sets out when it is considered that religious services can take place with protective measures (Levels 1 and 2) and when they must move online (Levels 3,4 and 5). Weddings and funerals are exceptions and can continue at every level with limited numbers. <\/p><p>Churches and other places of worship can remain open for private prayer. It is also important to note that at all levels, Ministers of Religion are permitted to travel to perform a service on-line, to minister to the sick, and conduct a funeral or wedding ceremony.  The relevant regulations relating to Level 5 restrictions are S.I. 448 of 2020 (Health Act 1947 (Section 31A - Temporary Restrictions) (COVID-19) (NO. 8) Regulations 2020).<\/p><p>Throughout the pandemic, the Government has sought to implement these measures on the basis of guidance as opposed to regulations wherever possible. It should be noted that holding a religious gathering is not a penal offence. <\/p><p>I and my Cabinet colleagues recognise the immense sacrifices that are being made be people across the country at this difficult time. I know that that includes many people who are affected by their inability to attend church in the way they have been used to. However, there has been significant engagement and solidarity from the Catholic Church and other Faiths at all stages throughout this pandemic to ensure the protection of individuals and communities from COVID-19. Indeed, as the Deputies will be aware, the Taoiseach met with the leaders of the Catholic Church last week to consider the range of issues relating this matter.<\/p><p>Finally, the Deputies will wish to note that comprehensive guidelines are in place to ensure that religious services can take place safely when<b><\/b>they recommence: <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400079#WRG00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":289,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400079#WRG00500"},{"type":"question","counter":290,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[33967\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400079#WRG00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the funding available for community mental health services that do not receive funding through the HSE or other Government Departments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1469","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":291,"content":"<p>There are several mechanisms whereby community voluntary organisations can seek funding.

I am therefore working with my Government colleagues to ensure that we are providing the most appropriate supports to help sustain carers in their caring role. To this end, my colleague Minister Butler in her capacity as Minister of State with responsibility for Mental Health and Older People, held a roundtable with family carers on 15th September to hear about their experience as carers and how we can best support them in their caring role, in particular, given the challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.<\/p><p>It should be noted that under the existing National Carers' Strategy, a range of measures have been introduced or extended by my Department to support family carers in recent years.

The National Development Plan provides for the addition of the full 2,590 beds by 2027.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the current COVID-19 Pandemic response, the HSE advised on 22 June 2020 that an additional 324 acute beds have opened since March, bringing the current total of acute beds in the system to 11,597. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) agreed to support the marginal costs of funding additional beds to the end of December 2020 at a cost of &euro;24 million. The HSE confirmed 197 of those beds had opened as planned. <\/p>  <p>  This winter is expected to be particularly challenging due to the presence of Covid-19 and the uncertainty around the level of Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 healthcare demands. The Department of Health is working with the HSE to increase acute capacity in hospitals throughout the country to meet this and other health demands. Government allocated &euro;236 million revenue and &euro;40 million capital expenditure as part of Budget 2021 to fund additional acute beds on a permanent basis. This funding will provide, by the end of 2021, an additional 1,146 acute beds. <\/p>  <p>  A proportion of these beds will be funded as part of the HSE&rsquo;s Winter Plan 2020\/21. The Winter Plan aims to provide additional health service capacity across a range of services. Initiatives comprise additional acute and community beds to increase acute capacity, help reduce admissions and facilitate egress. <\/p>  <p>  At the start of the year, permanent adult critical care capacity in Ireland stood at 255 beds, according to the National Office of Clinical Audit. This included 204 Level 3 ICU beds and 51 Level 2 HDU beds.  As part of the initial response to the pandemic, funding was provided for an additional 40 adult critical care beds in March 2020 as well as two paediatric beds. The HSE has advised that between 280 and 285 critical care beds are currently open, with the number open any given day subject to fluctuation in respect of available staff and other operational considerations. <\/p>  <p>   Where necessary, the number of critical care beds can surge beyond the baseline of 280-285 as part of an emergency response. However, it is essential to understand that the use of surge capacity for critical care is necessarily tied to a reduction of services in other areas of the hospital. Moreover, the clinical advice is clear that the greater the reliance on surge ICU capacity, the greater the clinical risk with potential impact on patient outcomes.<\/p>  <p>   Our critical care units have coped well so far, largely due to the fact that the curve was flattened successfully in early stages. As a result, our outcomes for Covid patients in ICU have compared well with other jurisdictions including the UK.<\/p>  <p>   Budget 2021 will allocate funding totalling &euro;52m in 2021 to critical care. This will retain, on a permanent basis, the 42 critical care beds put in place on a temporary basis this year and add significant new capacity. Funded adult critical care beds will increase to 321 by end 2021, an increase of 66 over the baseline number of 255 funded beds in 2020. Funding for 2021 will also include money to allow for the development of a workforce plan as well as education initiatives to grow the critical care workforce.<\/p>  <p>  This represents a significant step towards achieving the recommendations in the 2018 Health Service Capacity Review which found that an additional 2,100 inpatient acute beds were required, in a reform scenario, by 2031. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400079#WRG03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Tests","counter":320,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400079#WRG03700"},{"type":"question","counter":321,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[34031\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400079#WRG03800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the measures the HSE has established for testing and tracing in relation to Covid-19; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1625","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":322,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400079#WRG03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":323,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400079#WRG04000"},{"type":"question","counter":324,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[34032\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400079#WRG04100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if targets have been established for the provision of ICU care for Covid-19 infection cases; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1625","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":325,"qnumday":133,"qnumall":"[34033\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400079#WRG04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the metrics established in order to measure the progress and performance of the HSE towards achieving targets for the provision of ICU care for Covid-19 infection cases; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1625","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":326,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 132 and 133 together.<\/p>  <p>  Critical Care occupancy, particularly regarding Covid-19 patients, is closely monitored by the Department of Health and the HSE, with reports published on a daily basis on the HSE's website. <\/p>  <p>  At the start of the year permanent adult critical care capacity in Ireland stood at 255 beds, according to the National Office of Clinical Audit.

Funding can be provided towards the cost of project development, including for technical or expert assistance.
