This is very good news because people need and want to be back at work.  Their enthusiasm to return was demonstrated last year when 400,000 went back to work as restrictions were lifted.  Workers do not want to be on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  They, and indeed all of us, hope such supports will be required and necessary only for the shortest possible time.  The reality is that, come September, some people will still be locked out of work due to public health restrictions.  Among them will be those in aviation, hospitality and events, those whose jobs depend on international travel and those in many other sectors.  That is why the Taoiseach's decision to start cutting the PUP by instalments of &euro;50 from September is premature and deeply unfair.<\/p>  <p>  It has always been understood that when the Government stops people from going back to their place of employment, for good public health reasons, it has a responsibility to support them.  It seems now, however, that the Government has chosen to pull the rug from under the workers.  I heard a woman on the radio last week who said she remained locked out of work despite the reopening.  She described her experience and said that for the first six months of lockdown, her family availed of the mortgage break and that when that went, the family tapped into their savings.  Now that money is gone too.  How on earth is it fair to say to this woman or thousands of workers like her who will not be back at work in September and may not be allowed back until next year that their supports are going to be cut?  The Taoiseach is walking away from his responsibility to these workers and their families.  He will cut their income, in effect, by one third.  That is absolutely huge.  It is the difference between them just getting by for the next few months and not doing so.<\/p>  <p>  For the vast majority, the need for the PUP will fall away naturally as sectors reopen.  That is what the evidence tells us but the Taoiseach's decision to cut the PUP ensures those who remain locked out of work will be made poorer.  They still have to pay their mortgages, rent, childcare fees and utility bills but they will be abandoned by the Government when they are at the end of their tether.  What happened to \"We are all in this together\", as was the slogan of the Government?  The Taoiseach promised no cliff edge but cliff edges mean nothing to those who are relying on every single euro.  To slash payments by &euro;50 a go is devastating when workers are prevented from working.  <\/p>  <p>  What the Taoiseach now proposes is a mirror of the plan he wanted to introduce in January but it was the wrong approach then and it is the wrong approach now.  His approach to this matter sends out a signal that the recovery he envisages is one that is unfair and leaves people behind.  Let us not go down that road again.  I ask the Taoiseach not to press ahead with these cuts and to ensure that full support will remain in place for those workers who are prevented from going to work for as long as they are prevented from doing so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100003#A00200","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1622552700,"counter":7,"content":"<p>First of all, I agree with the Deputy in terms of the good news in recent weeks that people are returning to work in considerable numbers.  We have been in a position to do this through our management of the pandemic and though a successful and efficiently run vaccination programme which is having a dramatic impact on the severity of illness in society from the virus and on reducing death and hospitalisation and numbers in intensive care.  The efficient national vaccination effort is enabling us to return to economic growth and recovery and to bring people back to work.<\/p>  <p>  What we announced today in terms of extending the schemes is a continuation of that economic recovery story.  We have fulfilled our commitment in terms of not having a cliff edge.  The employment wage subsidy scheme supports 315,000 workers.  We are extending that to Christmas.  The whole idea is to support enterprise and to enable enterprises that retain jobs to stay viable and keep jobs going in the economy.<\/p>  <p>  We are doing the same with the Covid-19 restrictions support scheme extension with enhanced restart payments of three weeks at a double rate.  This will be significant for people in hospitality, for example, and in other sectors.  This significant restart grant really gives people a fighting chance not only in maintaining the employment they have maintained under the supports they have got from Government but by increasing employment in the coming weeks.  We know that more and more people will come off the pandemic unemployment payment during the summer months.  We are extending the pandemic unemployment payment out to September.  Then, gradually, we are easing out of that up to February 2022.<\/p>  <p>  We are not just doing that.  All of that is in parallel with an unprecedented work activation programme with substantial funding being allocated to reskilling training programmes, upskilling programmes, education places, increased apprenticeships and increased internship programmes.  There will be more placements available in the public service for many people and investment in research to create a new approach and new orientations within the economy.  We will use the funding we are receiving from the recovery and resilience fund in Europe not only to invest in the human capital side and in people but also to create new jobs in retrofitting and public transport.  This is what we are going to do with the railway project for Cork, which will be significant in terms of leveraging other economic and employment opportunities there.  That is one example.  Another is the new facility in Beggar's Bush.  The new Department building there is a pathway finder building.  It will be state-of-the-art in terms of emissions reduction and so on.  This is an imaginative programme designed to prepare the country for recovery in the coming period and to start growing jobs in new sectors like the green economy and digital transformation.  It is about giving the supports to aviation that are required and about clarity in direction of travel in terms of the reopening of international travel and the events industry.  Significant supports are in place for musicians under the music entertainment business assistance scheme.  This will support musicians in wedding bands or those who perform in smaller live venues.  We are initiating a basic income pilot scheme for artists.<\/p>  <p>  This is a significant comprehensive agenda ultimately with a view that by 2024 we will have 2.5 million people in jobs.  That will exceed the numbers of people in employment before the pandemic.  The broader objective of Government is to create opportunities for people to return to work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100004#B00100","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1622552700,"counter":8,"content":"<p>Be that as it may, the Taoiseach will acknowledge that come September there are workers who will not be returned to work and who will not be in a position to get back to work.

Yet, the Government is choosing to cut the supports that these workers and their families rely on.  Everybody wants to get back to work as quickly as possible.  However, the State and the Government have to make provision for the section of workers who will not have returned by September or even during the course of this year, including workers in aviation, events and hospitality.<\/p> <p>It is wrong and unfair to punish those workers who cannot return to work because of a public health emergency.  I again put it to the Taoiseach that the fair thing to do is for this Government to tell every worker that we want them to return to work quickly and safely but also to support them for as long as they cannot return to work because of the public health emergency.  I invite the Taoiseach to do that rather than to cut the very support these people need to survive and which they will need through September.

Will the Taoiseach address the issue of people who have lost their jobs as a result of the Covid pandemic?  He has repeatedly promised that there will be no cliff edge when it comes to the withdrawal of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, yet today he has announced that there will be such a cliff edge.  No matter what level of restrictions are in place across the country in September, payments will be reduced by &euro;50.  A further reduction of &euro;50 will occur in November and a final reduction of &euro;50 in February.  In total, this amounts to a massive 40% cut to an already meagre payment.  This is the very definition of a cliff edge.  The Government has chosen an arbitrary date and determined to cut people's payments, no matter what the public health advice is at that time and no matter what jobs are or are not available.  These payments are a lifeline for hundreds of thousands of people whose jobs were casualties of the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  Experience tells us that, when businesses reopen, people will go back to work.  They do not want to remain on the PUP longer than they have to.  Last year, 400,000 people closed their PUP claims once the economy partially reopened.  Since this payment was introduced more than a year ago, just 3,000 complaints have been made to the Department of Social Protection by employers alleging that staff were reluctant to return to the workforce.  That is 3,000 out of more than 600,000 people, or 0.5%.  The Department has also clarified that the vast majority of those 3,000 cases did not involve any misclaiming.  Why then has the Taoiseach done what he has sworn he would not do?  Why has he created a cliff edge for those in receipt of this payment, a cliff edge which will undoubtedly lead many more into poverty?<\/p>  <p>  As the economy opens up over the summer months - a reopening that everyone in this House hopes will be very successful - the numbers in receipt of the PUP will significantly reduce naturally.  There is no evidence that this payment is being abused or that people are preferring to claim the PUP rather than return to work.  Despite this, the Taoiseach's Government has introduced a cliff edge in September, when there will be an initial 15% cut which, as I have said, will grow to 40%.  A reduction of that magnitude will cause serious financial problems for those people who can least afford it.  It has been a very tough year for everyone but especially for those who have been forced out of their jobs because of the pandemic.  They have now been told by this Government that their meagre income will be slashed in September, even if the business in which they work has not reopened.<\/p> <p>This announcement will cause serious stress and anxiety among a large cohort of people, many of whom are barely keeping their heads above water.  Why has the Government broken its promise and introduced a cliff edge for the PUP?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100005#C00500","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622553300,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I disagree fundamentally with the Deputy.  We have not introduced a cliff edge.  The opposite is the case.  We have extended the PUP to September, following which there will be a phasing out of it out to next February, which will be second anniversary of the introduction of the payment.  By then the payment will have been in place for two years.  It was originally introduced for 12 weeks.  That was the original timeframe the then Government put in place for the PUP.  The pandemic has lasted much longer than that, obviously. <\/p>  <p>  We want to create employment opportunities for people.  I agree 100% that people want to work.  There is no suggestion by Government or anybody that there is any abuse of the payment.  Rather, we are saying that we now have to reorientate the economy and reallocate and target resources for growth and for economic recovery.  That means creating substantial funding for work placement programmes, training programmes, education and higher education.  For example, we want to create new jobs in retrofitting in the private sector in private housing, but also in the public sector through direct grants.  We will need skill sets to enable us to do that comprehensive programme for retrofitting across the country in terms of our housing stock.  People will have to retrain and reskill to do that type of work.<\/p>  <p>  Likewise, a substantial allocation will be provided for the re-wetting of bogs.  There will be new opportunities in the economy.  It is about what we do now as we emerge from the pandemic and people naturally come off the PUP, as they will, and are, in significant numbers.  It should be remembered that all the while we are supporting workers in employment as well through extensions of the employment wage subsidy scheme and the Covid restrictions support scheme.  The orientation of the plan is to support workers to retain the jobs they are in and are currently being subsidised and to give companies a fighting chance to retain those jobs and enhance them, and, by enhancing them, recruit people.  <\/p>  <p>  I will make one final point.  Deputy McDonald made the point that Government has stopped people from going to work.  The Government has not stopped anybody from going to work; the Covid-19 virus has stopped people from going to work and it caused the most severe and rapid recession since the wars across the world.  Government has responded comprehensively to this pandemic and in a very effective way.  We have underpinned income and jobs to the best of its ability and we will continue to do that, but we are moving into a new phase in economic recovery.  That new phase involves the targeting and allocation of resources that can create new opportunities in new sectors of the economy, and, crucially, more support for sectors, such as aviation, tourism, the arts and live events, in the coming months, which is what we are doing in the allocation of resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100006#D00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1622553300,"counter":16,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach spoke about other sectors.

He is saying to them that they can sustain a cut of 40% in their already low income.  The Taoiseach will know from the studies that have been done that the basic social welfare payment is not sufficient to maintain any kind of life of dignity, yet the Government, by its actions, is forcing those people onto the breadline.  What is the justification for cutting people's incomes by 40% when many of the jobs that were lost will not be reinstated by next February?  We hope many new jobs will be created, but it is undoubtedly the case that there will be still high levels of unemployment among those people who have lost their jobs.

I sincerely hope that was not a pun and that the plan will succeed.  I have been quite critical of some of the Government measures.  The Taoiseach has never taken any responsibility for some of those measures and has always said it is because of Covid that this, that or the other has closed.  On the other hand, he has said we have fared better than other countries.  He has taken the credit but not the downside.<\/p>  <p>  I have long argued that I would have preferred to see fewer restrictions on society and the economy generally and more targeted interventions.  One area in particular that needed targeted interventions was the nursing home sector and, in fairness, the Government provided the temporary assistance payment scheme, TAPS, for the sector.  However, we are learning now that in conjunction with the measures the Government is announcing, it is simultaneously taking away that temporary assistance to nursing homes.  I accept that the scheme is temporary but, equally, it is essential.  The threat in general has not subsided and the threat has not subsided for nursing homes in particular.  We know congregated settings are a risk, whether that be direct provision centres, where there was an outbreak in Ennis last week, meat factories, where there are continuing risks and outbreaks or, indeed, nursing homes.  There was an outbreak very recently in Marymount nursing home in Cork, in the Taoiseach's constituency, notwithstanding that all the staff and residents are vaccinated.<\/p>  <p>  Continuing measures are necessary in nursing homes and in congregated settings more generally.  If that is not funded through the TAPS, how will it be funded?  We all accept that we cannot go back to the situation as it was before and that there had to be a change in practices in nursing homes.  I very much welcome that change.  The committee I chaired recommended a systemic change away from reliance on nursing homes towards care in the community.  In conjunction with that committee, the previous Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, set up a nursing home expert panel.  The Government has not implemented any of the recommendations of the committee I chaired or the expert panel, yet, at the same time, it is taking away the supports nursing homes currently have to introduce safer practices.  How are nursing homes to pay for this?  If not through the TAPS, will there will be an increase in the amount they are paid through the fair deal scheme?  We all accept that greater measures have to be taken and those measures must be paid for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100007#E00200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1622553900,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  We will have to agree to disagree in terms of the issue around the imposition of restrictions in society.  The measures we have taken overall have resulted in fewer deaths in Ireland and less severe illness than in other countries that took a different approach.  Ultimately, the role of Government is to protect lives and public health to the very best of its ability.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the nursing homes scheme, and the TAPS in particular, the first point I have to make is that the results from the vaccination programme have been very significant in terms of nursing homes, with a reduction almost to the point of elimination of severe disease in nursing homes, among both staff and residents.  The serial testing is revealing that and new protocols for visiting nursing homes have been introduced as a result.<\/p> <p>That has been very positive and needs to be acknowledged.  The Government has allocated very substantial resources under TAPS.  It provides contributions to nursing homes towards the cost of maintaining isolation rooms and provided a one-off contribution towards temporary visiting infrastructure during winter 2020.  Over 6,675 claims have been processed and approved since 10 May.  Approximately &euro;93.9 million in direct financial support will be provided to the sector in 2021, with &euro;42 million provided so far.  That is a very substantial allocation of resources.<\/p> <p> In addition to TAPS, the HSE has provided other enhanced measures to support nursing homes and their residents in the context of Covid-19: the Covid response teams, access to PPE and oxygen, support for staff accommodation, access to training and the serial testing programme.  As Deputy McNamara will know, priority vaccination was provided to nursing homes and the uptake has been extraordinary.  I think it is at nearly 99%.  The strong vaccine effect is very evident in the nursing homes, with huge reductions, as I have said, in the numbers of cases and outbreaks and in mortality.<\/p> <p> Essentially, we are now into a different phase of the pandemic as we speak.  The vaccination programme is having an impact.  There are consequences to that as we move forward and allocate resources in a more targeted manner.  Again, the Government will be there to support nursing homes.  At the time of the introduction of TAPS, our nursing homes were in a far different position in respect of Covid-19.  The outbreaks that were occurring are no longer occurring at all or in no way to the same extent or frequency.  TAPS was part of a wider suite of supports.  We should now evaluate and take lessons from the pandemic as to how in the medium term we can ensure a more supportive environment for nursing homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100007#E00300","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622554200,"counter":22,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach did a good job of outlining what TAPS supported, and I welcome that, but how will that be supported now?

Notwithstanding the high take-up of vaccines, there are still outbreaks, unfortunately.  They are fewer in number and their consequences are lesser, I accept, but we need to avoid the outbreaks and their consequences.  The Taoiseach talked about lessons being learned.  We will have to look at the spread of Covid-19 in healthcare settings and congregated settings.  I think a tribunal will have to be considered to look at the earlier deaths in nursing homes in particular and whether people were sent home or sent into nursing homes from acute hospitals with Covid.

Families and communities the length and breadth of the country have been affected by suicide.  It is important to continue to raise awareness and to speak openly about mental health.  That is important within our education curriculum and outside of our education curriculum.<\/p>  <p>  The Connecting for Life strategy is Ireland's national suicide reduction strategy.  It aims to reduce suicide and self-harm rates across society and in priority groups.  We have the National Office for Suicide Prevention within the HSE.  It was established to co-ordinate suicide reduction efforts around the country and to implement the strategy.  Funding has increased on an annual basis, but it is not just about funding alone.  It is about the proper delivery of services and co-ordination.  Suicide prevention funding would have gone up progressively from about &euro;3 million ten years ago to about &euro;13 million or so now.  Also, the National Office for Suicide Prevention works with the non-governmental and community sector in particular and with the HSE in an advisory role.  About 20 partner non-governmental organisations are involved and 54% of the funding would go to those non-governmental organisations - groups like Pieta House, the Samaritans, Suicide or Survive and the Family Resource Centres.<\/p>  <p>  It has been a while coming, but about 24 of the 26 emergency departments now have access to a mental health professional at all times, I am informed, through liaison mental health services based in acute hospitals or the national clinical programme for the management of self-harm in emergency departments.<\/p> <p>That is important.  In addition, prior to the pandemic, community mental health teams provided access to a seven-day per week mental health service.  This is still in place and available for existing mental health service users in a blended format in compliance with Covid-19 restrictions.  The seven-day telehealth service includes the crisis text line 50808, <i>yourmentalhealth.ie<\/i>, the information line 1800111888 and NGO partners' online supports.  <br\/><br\/>Access and traffic to all of those services has increased during the Covid-19 period and we have an extra obligation to do more now during this period and its aftermath to support people, and young people in particular.  That is why an education and well-being initiative, as part of funding that was allocated in the return of schools during the Covid-19 period, is focusing on the mental well-being of young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100009#G00200","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622554800,"counter":30,"content":"<p>The main message to get out of this debate is that no one should ever need to feel alone.  It is making the connection between the person who is at a critical time in his or her life and making it easier for him or her, whether that is through the local GP, calling the Samaritans, or calling a friend, but also accessing the services that are there that the Government is funding.  It is about making a person feel in this country that there is no need to feel lost or alone.  You can put up your hand, dial your phone or call out for help and that help is there.<\/p>  <p>  Every one of us, and especially politicians because we are quite simply dealing with so many people every day of the week, should be looking out for people&rsquo;s mental health as well as for all of the other aspects of their lives that we try to positively impact upon.  We should be on our guard because if by doing our work properly we can save any people going through the torture and anguish that is suicide, it would be a job very well done.  It is an onus and responsibility that each of us have, which we should take very seriously and conscientiously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100010#H00200","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1622554800,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I agree 100% with what the Deputy said.  We always have to watch out for the vulnerabilities in others and be alert and aware.  As he said earlier, we should be open in talking about mental health and about suicide but also in letting people know, which I consistently say to young people, that they should be kinder to each other.  In life, people should be kinder to each other than is often the case and the Deputy referenced that in his earlier remarks.  It is very important in a group or crowded setting to be very conscious that not everybody may be happy at a given, particular point in time or in a good position.  We then have to provide supports in the access to GPs, community health teams, or a mental health professional within the community, which the Deputy has referred to.<\/p>  <p>  My view, having been in the Department of Health quite some time ago, is we need to continue to strengthen the community health teams across the length and breadth of the country.  In speaking to some senior psychiatrists and to people who have been involved in mental health service provision for years, they felt that we were overly institutionalised as a country, overly focused on the acute phase of mental illness and less so on the community side.  We need to build up strong community mental health teams.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100010#H00300","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1622554800,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach and I also thank Deputy Healy-Rae for raising that important issue.

Will the Taoiseach agree to go on &euro;350 if he thinks it should be cut?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100016#Q01000","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1622557500,"counter":139,"content":"<p>We are extending the pandemic unemployment payment out to September and then gradually easing out of that into February of next year.

We are aware that some local authorities across the country still operate an any-bag, any-bin policy and that some private operators incinerate all waste collected from the black bin, the blue bin, or even the brown bin.  Practices across the public and private sectors are in direct conflict with the Government's current roadmap for waste planning and management, limited as that plan is.  There are firm commitments to the circular economy, yet the mass production of unnecessary plastics by very profitable companies continues.

While we sit here debating the greater things in life, we rarely think of the centrality of workers in our society.  We rarely think of them as a resource that could make our society much more efficient.  In this regard, what does the Taoiseach think of the F&oacute;rsa campaign for a four-day week, F&oacute;rsa being the trade union leading the campaign?  How might Ireland use a four-day week, as Spain is doing, to become one of the first countries in the world to lead a trial that would show how the associated work practice changes could have a double-whammy impact in that they would improve both the environment and levels of equality?  The four-day week would improve the environment because, as studies have shown, changing to a four-day week can help to reduce emissions.  It would improve our equality agenda because studies have shown that where a four-day week is implemented, fathers and partners, particularly men in relationships, can play a more caring role, a role that women are normally forced to play.

The Four Day Week Ireland coalition has highlighted how moving to a four-day week could reduce carbon emissions by up to 16% while also improving people's work-life balance and mental health.  It is an important demand raised by the trade unions and the environmental movement and it constitutes an important part of the eco-socialist green new deal that we advocate.  Earlier this month the T&aacute;naiste said the four-day week was not something his Department was even considering.  Are the Taoiseach and his Department considering it?  If not, will they?  Too often, tackling climate change is presented as being a matter of eco-austerity, greenwashing, new taxes on workers and cutting back on people's living standards but it does not have to be, and must not be, that way.  Instead, an eco-socialist approach is about raising the quality of people's lives and tackling climate change together, transforming people's lives for the better and avoiding the climate catastrophe that is on the way.  The demand for a four-day week without loss of pay is a perfect example of the approach.

Some of the reasons for consternation and blaming young people are outrageous and wrong.  Young people have suffered so much over the past 18 months.  We have a genuine issue in that we are telling everyone to enjoy an outdoor summer but we need to prepare for it, not just in Dublin.  Luckily enough, I come from near Lough Derg on the River Shannon.  Ms Maura Boyle of Larkin's in Garrykennedy was on to me about the volume of people down enjoying the area at the weekend.  It is fantastic.  It is a question of the level of waste left behind by some people.  It is very difficult at times for some people because bins may be full and children and everything else may need to be managed.  Across the country, in both urban and rural areas, as we face another bank holiday weekend, we do not need to close streets or anything like that.  That just pushes people in other directions.  We need to ensure, as my colleague Senator Bacik said eloquently earlier, we need more bins, more benches and more bogs for people.  We need them pretty rapidly for an outdoor summer.  We can all be safer and it can be enjoyed more.  Local authorities need to provide them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100017#R00500","speaker":"1610"},{"type":"speech","time":1622558100,"counter":184,"content":"<p>Local authorities need to respond.  I agree with Deputy Kelly on that.  We are successfully reopening society and the economy.  The vaccination programme is making that possible, as is the adherence of the vast majority of people to guidelines for a prolonged period of time, which has had the desired impact of suppressing the virus or keeping it at reasonable levels.  The vaccination programme, in particular, has reduced ill health and mortality and kept hospitalisations at a reasonable level.  The number of intensive care unit admissions is down.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the preparation for outdoor activity, particularly for young people, outdoor facilities must be provided proactively by local authorities.  Some local authorities have been very proactive regarding the pedestrianisation of streets.  They have accelerated their pedestrianisation programmes.  The Ministers responsible for tourism and housing, Deputy Catherine Martin and Deputy Darragh O'Brien, respectively, have provided funding for outdoor facilities so both establishments and councils can enhance the public space for people.  That is the way to go.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Gannon's point that local authorities have been particularly effective.  They have to make a decision based on the allocation and resources they get.  With regard to biodiversity officers, I encourage their appointment.  I would have been at the forefront of the appointment of archaeological officers in my time on the council.  The appointment of a biodiversity officer is a key appointment.  Most local authorities are embracing biodiversity.  It is the cumulative impact of all the little things we do regarding biodiversity that will have the biggest impact.  The wild garden that is being developed on Leinster House lawn, as opposed to the manicured lawn, is delightful to see.  That is the type of initiative we need across the country.

How would all of this be facilitated?  In politics we will be a long way before we get to a six-day week, never mind a seven-day week.  There is a five-day week at the moment.  There have been moves to try to improve working hours and so on.  The remote working strategy is being promoted by the Government and will be legislated for to facilitate reduction in carbon emissions so workers will not have to go on a five-day basis into the town or city or wherever.  Where possible, they can do some of the work at home.  There is a great deal of work to be done to flesh out the proposal that has been put forward by the Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100018#S00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1622558700,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I am afraid we are not going to get to the three rounds of questions because of the time.

The report contained recommendations for the social and economic regeneration of Dublin's north east inner city.  The report has been further supplemented by the publishing of the next strategic plan, which runs from 2020 to 2022.  Both documents are available on the Dublin north east inner city, NEIC, website.<\/p><p>In June 2017 an independent chairperson was appointed by Government to the NEIC programme implementation board.  Members of the board include representatives from relevant Government Departments and agencies, business and the local community.  The board is assisted in its work by six subgroups: enhanced policing; maximising educational training and employment opportunities; family well-being; enhancing community well-being and the physical landscape; substance use misuse and inclusion health; and alignment of services.<\/p><p>The board and its subgroups continue to meet on a monthly basis to oversee and progress the implementation of the Mulvey report and the NEIC strategic plan.  Officials from the Department of the Taoiseach work closely with the board, the subgroups and the dedicated programme office based in Se&aacute;n MacDermott Street.  The chairperson of the board reports to an oversight group of senior officials chaired by the Secretary General of my Department.  This group, which has met 11 times to date, ensures strong and active participation by all relevant Departments and agencies and deals with any barriers or issues highlighted by the board.  The Cabinet committee on social affairs and equality provides political oversight of the NEIC initiative.  The Government is committed to supporting and investing in the north east inner city community and ensuring the board has the necessary resources to achieve its targets and fulfil its ambition.  To this end the Government has made available &euro;6.5 million in funding for the initiative in 2021.<\/p><p>I will set out some highlights of what the initiative has delivered to date in 2021.  There is strong support, both financial and otherwise, for the recently launched north inner city local community safety partnership.  There is an increased Garda presence in the area with the Garda community support van supporting a focus on community policing, particularly throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.  A Garda project focused on drug-related intimidation continues to have positive benefits.  Funding has been provided for the training of local garda&iacute; and local community-based practitioners in addressing domestic violence and child protection issues.  There is the ongoing roll-out of the P-TECH initiative in secondary schools - the pathways in technology programme - in the NEIC area.  A highly successful work experience programme in flash mentoring has been delivered for second level students in the NEIC.  Funding has been provided to develop an adult and community education strategy for the area.  Substantial funding has been provided for a community case management team that will work with the most vulnerable and high-risk families in the area.  The funding of a dedicated parenting support co-ordinator post has been provided.  There is funding to provide access to fast-track counselling for children and young people in the area.  A significant investment has been made in a bespoke sport, recreation and well-being programme for the area.  Dedicated community events and arts programmes have been funded for 2021.  A full-time intercultural development co-ordinator is employed for the area.  Funding has been provided for a recovery case manager and recovery coach internships.  We have seen the continued operation in the NEIC of Ireland's first social inclusion hub.  Funding is provided for a homeless case management team.  Funding is provided for a residential stabilisation programme.  Funding is provided for the City Connects programme.  Funding is provided to the local early learning initiative and the refurbishment of the swimming pool on Se&aacute;n MacDermott Street.  Finally, there is a multidisciplinary team of psychologists, occupational speech and language therapists.  I will read the rest into the record.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>Funding is provided to support the SWAN detached youth programme.  A green ribbon project has been rolled out with an environmental clean-up and litter prevention measures in partnership with local residents.  There has been the purchase of almost 500 laptops and devices to support students in NEIC schools with home learning through the worst of the pandemic.<\/p><p>In 2021, some &euro;1 million of the &euro;6.5 million NEIC budget has been allocated to the social employment fund, through which 55 posts have been filled in community projects providing childcare, youth services, elder care, cultural and environmental services.<\/p><p>This responsive and innovative initiative has been widely welcomed within the community.<\/p><p>The programme implementation board will continue to implement the remaining actions set out in the Mulvey report and the NEIC strategic plan 2020-22 as well as adopting a greater focus on long-term sustainable outcomes which operate in an integrated framework and add value to the existing service infrastructure.  Progress reports on the NEIC initiative are available on the NEIC website for 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020.<\/p><p>The Government remains committed to supporting and investing in the north east inner city community and ensuring the chairperson and programme implementation board have the necessary resources to help to make the area a better place to work and live.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100018#S00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1622558700,"counter":193,"content":"<p>Of course the neglect and poverty in the inner city of Dublin, as in other inner city and other areas throughout the State, is not accidental.  It has happened on the watch of successive Governments and is in fact the consequence of bad policy, as the Taoiseach knows.<\/p>  <p>  To create the brighter future to which the Taoiseach referred, it is imperative that we invest in our children and in early education.  That is what I wish to raise with the Taoiseach today.  Early education providers in Dublin's north inner city have been adversely affected by the new national childcare scheme.  In fact, up to 80% of children attending the early learning settings that cater for the most disadvantaged children are now in difficulties because of this new scheme.  The viability and sustainability of these centres is under question.  The parents of children attending these services are currently unemployed.  Therefore, the subvention is reduced.<\/p>  <p>  The providers in the inner city have raised these real concerns with the Department.  They have spent months trying to resolve this issue.  Their single wish is to ensure that children in the inner city, especially the most disadvantaged children, have access to early education.  Yet, they have found no solution.  They have suggested the implementation of a DEIS model to sustain these children.  I implore the Taoiseach to intervene on the matter and not allow these children to be failed again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100018#S00900","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1622558700,"counter":194,"content":"<p>The north east inner city task force has done extraordinarily good work but there is more work to be done.  How much is the Taoiseach engaged in the programme of implementation?  Has the Department or the Taoiseach been briefed on whether the Rutland Street School community hub project has gone to tender yet?  When is work expected to start?  If the Taoiseach is engaged, he will be able to reply and answer that.  The plans for this were announced in 2016.  It is now five years later.  It was originally believed that it would be funded by central government but now much of it is from the resources of the council.  There are numerous competing projects, as the Taoiseach can appreciate.  Is it being funded under the urban regeneration fund?  If not, why not?<\/p>  <p>  The Labour Party has called for a Mulvey-style commission or task force on the north side of Dublin and another in Drogheda.

We do not believe we can simply police our way out of crime alone.  We agree that the plan put in place some years ago had some merit but it needs a great deal of work.<\/p>  <p>  It seems from the evidence that this Government's commitment needs to be renewed.  A task force or Mulvey-style commission would really help to deal with many of the ingrained problems in the area.

Yet, in the Mulvey report, sport seems to be the great omission.  The Taoiseach read out the list of funding initiatives but there is little that pertains to sport.  There are two great soccer clubs in the north inner city, Sheriff Youth Club and Belvedere FC.  Both play on an astroturf pitch in Clontarf.  The pitch is completely outdated.  The pitch has a lifespan of approximately seven years but it has been at the grounds now for 11 years.  It is outdated and needs investment.  That needs to happen.  There is no GAA club currently in the north inner city.  That is something we need to factor in to our considerations because there is a great desire for GAA in the north inner city.  It is in the shadows of Croke Park.  The local boxing club in the heart of Dublin 1 applied for a grant for female changing facilities some weeks ago.  Those involved were turned down.

Other supports are going into the area.  I refer to the SWAN Youth Service, the detached youth work programme and the Green Ribbon Project, through which environmental clean-up and litter prevention measures are being rolled out.  I refer also to the purchase of almost 500 laptops and devices to support students in north-east inner-city area schools with the home learning that has been ongoing during the pandemic.  A sum of &euro;1 million has been allocated to the social employment fund, through which 55 posts have been filled in community projects providing childcare, youth services, elder care and cultural and environmental services.  These measures have been broadly welcomed.<\/p>  <p>  I will address some of the issues that have been raised.  With regard to the Rutland Street School site, Part 8 planning approval was granted by Dublin City Council in October 2019 and an enabling works contract to the value of &euro;780,000 was completed in 2019.  This was a lead-in contract to assess structural loading, asbestos volumes and so on in advance of main contract works.  Tender documents for the main construction contract were issued in July 2020.  The main construction contract for the Rutland Street School redevelopment is in the final stages of the public procurement process.  Following completion of restricted procedure stage 1 in the fourth quarter of 2020, a number of shortlisted firms were invited to submit tenders for stage 2.  Evaluation of these tender submissions is currently under way and it is anticipated that this process will be completed in the coming weeks.  That is good news for this particular development.  I agree with Deputy Gannon.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputy Kelly made the point that we need to create area-based partnerships such as that created in the north-east inner city elsewhere.  I have tasked my Department to work with the Cabinet subcommittee on social affairs to identify a number of areas of disadvantage or areas with particular challenges for which to prioritise supports.  This was the approach of the old revitalising areas through planning, investment and development, RAPID, programme which we created years ago when I was last in government.  The idea is that clubs and organisations in those communities are to be given higher ratings when applying for funding.  This would mean that Corinthians Boxing Club, for example, would be more highly prioritised.  I will ask the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media to look at the area of boxing because some clubs need support both in making applications and in making sure that they are successful in getting the supports they urgently need in partnership with local authorities, the county and city councils.  Such clubs do great work.  <\/p>  <p>  I would like the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media to work with Dublin North East Inner City and with the sporting groups in the community in respect of soccer, GAA, which the Deputy mentioned, and other sports.  This is where investment should go.  I have no difficulty in working with Government to provide capital investment in these areas for sporting facilities, particularly AstroTurf pitches and so on in inner-city locations.  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to childcare, I will speak to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in respect of investment.  There has, however, been sustained investment in childcare in inner-city areas.  There has also been sustained investment in education.  Going way back, I  was involved in providing funding for Larkin Community College.  There has been consistent engagement and support.  I take the point made in respect of housing.  I will engage with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, with regard to the issues pertaining to childcare.  More generally, housing has a role to play in the revitalisation of the area.  In addition to supporting the existing community, we have to work to ensure that younger generations can aspire to housing within the community.  We have to work to refurbish existing housing stock and to create new housing provision in the area.  The early years are important but, as I pointed out in my earlier reply, I am very committed to the provision of multidisciplinary supports from physiotherapy to speech and language therapy and occupational therapy for children.  A multidisciplinary team-based approach is vital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100019#T00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements","time":1622559300,"counter":202,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100019#T00250"},{"type":"question","time":1622559300,"counter":203,"qnumday":10,"qnumall":"[28339\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100019#T00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his latest engagement with the social partners.","asker":"1550","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1622559300,"counter":204,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[26235\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100019#T00400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his most recent engagements with the social partners.","asker":"1610","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1622559300,"counter":205,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[28066\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100019#T00500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his recent engagements with the social partners.","asker":"1466","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1622559300,"counter":206,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[29779\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100019#T00600","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his most recent engagements with the social partners.","asker":"1478","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1622559300,"counter":207,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[29782\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100019#T00700","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his most recent engagements with the social partners.","asker":"1628","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1622559300,"counter":208,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[29785\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100019#T00800","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his most recent engagements with the social partners.","asker":"1486","askee":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1622559300,"counter":209,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 15, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  The Government recognises the importance of regular and open engagement with all sectors of society.

This is particularly important as we face the enormous challenges ahead, including climate action, digital transition, disruption to the labour market and housing.<\/p>  <p>  There are many different fora in place for these conversations, including the National Economic Dialogue, the National Economic and Social Council, various sectoral groups and initiatives such as the citizens' assemblies.  There is also regular bilateral engagement at official and ministerial level, of which I am very supportive.<\/p>  <p>  As committed to in the programme for Government, a social dialogue unit has been established within the economic division of my Department.  Its initial focus is on supporting and enhancing engagement with the social partners, including through existing mechanisms such as the labour employer economic forum, LEEF, which deals with labour market issues.  LEEF helped ensure useful discussions between Government, employers and trade unions during the Covid-19 pandemic and I chaired the most recent meeting in February where, along with Brexit and Covid-19 issues, we discussed ways to strengthen social dialogue and engagement with civil society and representative groups.  A further meeting of LEEF will take place shortly.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, I met with the environmental pillar on 21 May, and will meet with the community and voluntary pillar and the farming and agriculture pillar in the coming weeks, to discuss how social dialogue can be strengthened and to exchange views on issues pertaining to those particular sectors.

I want to know what the Government, which provides Aer Lingus with State support through the EWSS, intends to do to protect these workers and to prevent assaults of this type on living standards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100020#U00200","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1622559900,"counter":215,"content":"<p>Last week, I questioned the T&aacute;naiste about the double rent hike facing renters this July as landlords attempt to impose two year's worth of rent increases in one fell swoop, which is allowed under the legislation introduced by the Government.  The T&aacute;naiste seemed genuinely surprised and unaware that this was possible and he said that it was not the Government's intention to allow for such percentage increases in rent.  Will the Taoiseach and the Government bring forth this month the emergency legislation needed to stop this happening?  For the average renter in Dublin, an 8% rent increase would be an increase of &euro;140 per month, an incredible amount of money that is unaffordable for many, especially considering the cuts coming down the line in terms of the PUP.  We should be extending the rent freeze.  We should be taking action to bring rents down.  At the very least, we need emergency legislation to stop this double rent hike happening.  If the Government refuses to do that, People Before Profit will bring forward legislation and we will make sure that it is a major issue in the by-election in Dublin Bay South.

I agree with the points he made.  We discussed this earlier in the House.  Again, it is a key issue, particularly in terms of young people.  Any supports we can give, we will give.  We will work with the Deputy and others in respect of that particular issue.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Kelly raised a number of issues.  We will work with the Deputy's party in respect of the Organisation of Working Time (Reproductive Health Related Leave) Bill 2021 in relation to supporting those who have gone through the trauma of miscarriage.  On statutory sick pay, the Government is examining the issue and is positively disposed to such a scheme.  Work is ongoing in that regard.  This question was on the social dialogue and on the leave programme.  We have made considerable progress on a number of fronts.  This is an issue on which we want to make progress.  We have work to do in regard to the living wage as well, which is provided for within the programme for Government and also in terms of other initiatives that we can take and lessons that we can learn from the pandemic in regard to sick pay, illness benefit more generally and supporting workers more broadly into the future.  <\/p>  <p>  On the new national childcare scheme, I reiterate what I said earlier, that is, significant and substantial resources have been provided to childcare providers during the pandemic and that will continue.  Our aim is to provide for children in very disadvantaged settings and to provide good quality childcare for children in those environments.  That has been the commitment of the Minister and of the Government during the Covid-19 pandemic.  As we emerge from Covid-19 we want to establish a strong, supportive situation for childcare and for the early years sector.  The most important years in the development of any child are the formative development years when children learn an awful lot that is key to their development.  We will work on that.  <\/p>  <p>  On the wider issue of the EWSS and the supports we provide, from which companies like Aer Lingus have benefited significantly, last week we had a number of Deputies in the House saying that the Government was not providing supports to aviation or to the airlines.  The reality, of course, is that through EWSS and other supports Government has provided substantial supports to employers to keep employees working and to keep their companies viable so that when the reopening and the restart happen they will be in a position to retain that employment and to grow the numbers working in those companies into the future.  That is the raison d'&ecirc;tre of the supports that we have introduced for businesses.  Up to 315,000 workers are currently being supported by EWSS.  Many more have been supported over the last two years, but currently the number of workers being supported is 315,000.  More workers are being supported through the Covid restrictions support scheme and other schemes introduced by Government.  We will continue to do that.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to proposals from a particular private sector company, the Government has made clear to the companies it supports that it expects all agreements to be honoured.  There are industrial relations mechanisms in place to facilitate resolution of any issues that employees might have with their companies.  We have made a number of things clear to companies in that respect.  In terms of aviation, we want connectivity, including regional connectivity.  We want flights operating again from Shannon Airport.  We want to see the return of early flights to London, transatlantic flights and flights from Cork.  We believe in strong regional growth and development and we have made that clear to Aer Lingus and to the airlines, both in terms of employment creation and FDI.  Under the urban regeneration development funding, the Government provided over &euro;1.2 billion for locations across the length and breadth of the country to build up the regional cities and to build up towns.  We will continue to do that.  There has to be reciprocation from companies given the nature of State support in terms of maintaining good pay and conditions for workers and the broader economic goals and objectives of Government in respect of a balanced economic development across the regions.  We have made that clear in any engagement we have had with companies, not just in aviation, but in other sectors as well.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is examining the situation with regard to the possibility of landlords doubling up in respect of rent increases, which we do not want to see happening.  As we speak, that situation is being actively considered by the Minister.  We will do what we can to support tenants through the legislation already enacted to protect people from eviction, to protect tenants in terms of security of tenure, to build more houses and make them available for people across the length and breadth of the country, to make sure that councils can get housing projects through planning and passed so that the housing can be built because there has been too much delay in some councils and, in my view, too much negativity and too many projects gathering dust for far too long.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100020#U00400","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1622559900,"counter":217,"content":"<p>There are only four minutes remaining, which leaves little time for the next group of questions.

It is brought forward following the disturbing escalation in the lengths the Belarusian authorities are willing to go to repress those critical of Alexander Lukashenko's leadership.  By coercively forcing a Ryanair aircraft to divert to Minsk under false pretences, they displayed a willingness to endanger the lives of passengers to detain someone whose views the regime does not like.<\/p><p>Ireland reacted to this incident swiftly and firmly.  At a meeting of EU leaders last week, the Taoiseach clearly communicated Ireland's view that a strong EU response was needed.  That response is now being delivered.  EU airlines have been asked to avoid Belarusian airspace, work has commenced on banning Belarusian airlines from EU airspace and actions are being taken to impose sanctions on those responsible for this dangerous incident.  Our concern must be for the protection of our citizens and the safety of international aviation.<\/p><p>Alexander Lukashenko holds no democratic legitimacy.  The Belarusian people have made that clear through their ten months of protests since the fraudulent presidential election in August 2020.  Ireland and the EU have rejected the result of that election and Mr. Lukashenko's secretive so-called inauguration.  We have repeatedly called on the Belarusian authorities to engage in a meaningful national dialogue with the political opposition and civil society, make needed reforms to the electoral process, and hold fresh elections that are free, fair and independently monitored.<\/p><p>Mr. Lukashenko maintains de facto control by ruling through fear.  Since coming to power in 1994, he has sought to deny the Belarusian people free choice in their political representation.  No election in Belarus since that time has been free or fair.  Frustrated by his leadership, the Belarusian people very clearly expressed their desire for change in the run-up to the August 2020 presidential election.  In advance of that vote, Mr. Lukashenko imprisoned his main political challengers and cracked down on protesters and civil society.  However, he underestimated the strength of the desire for democratic change among the Belarusian people.  In doing so, he clearly demonstrated his inability to recognise the winds of change.<\/p><p>He dismissed the challenge posed by the courageous women who took charge of the democratic movement.  Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Veronika Tsepkalo and Maria Kalesnikava inspired a mass democratic movement both at home and abroad among the Belarusian diaspora.  Ms Tsikhanouskaya, in particular, led this movement despite the imprisonment of her husband and threats from the authorities to take her children away.  Notwithstanding the obvious popularity of her campaign, the Central Election Commission was complicit in delivering a falsified election result that gave Alexander Lukashenko roughly 80% of the vote.  International monitors were not given sufficient time to send an election observation mission.  Due to widespread irregularities in the voting process, including ballot rigging, we will never know the true result of the election.<\/p><p>Hundreds of thousands of peaceful protesters took to the streets immediately following the result.  Rather than engage with the protesters, Mr. Lukashenko chose to deploy massive state violence against them.  Ireland and the EU strongly condemned this violence.  We were appalled by the mass arbitrary detentions, including of children, unexplained disappearances and loss of life, reports of torture, curtailments on fundamental freedoms, Internet shutdowns and much more besides.  Ireland reacted to these events promptly and publicly.  At meetings of the UN Security Council and the Human Rights Council, I made clear Ireland's deep concerns regarding the repression of the Belarusian people.  Ireland has been vocal in calling for an end to the violence and repression and we have repeatedly called for the immediate and unconditional release of all those unjustly detained, including hundreds of political prisoners.  I commend the many Oireachtas Members and Irish MEPs who have highlighted the cases of persons imprisoned for their political views.  I share their concern for the welfare of those detained.<\/p><p>Mr. Lukashenko has all but criminalised freedom of expression in his country.  Even the most trivial forms of dissent carry heavy costs and lengthy sentences.  The Belarusian Association of Journalists recorded 477 detentions of journalists and media workers in 2020 alone.  There has been an increase in restrictions on media outlets over recent months, including the blocking of access to independent news websites.  Ireland has strongly condemned the repression of independent media and attacks on journalists, bloggers and media workers.  They play a critical role in documenting human rights violations and challenging disinformation and state propaganda.  Promoting and defending the right to freedom of expression, media freedom and the safety of journalists is at the core of UNESCO's mandate.  Ireland supports the EU's call for UNESCO to react to the deteriorating situation.  At the UN, Ireland has supported joint statements expressing deep concerns regarding the use of Internet shutdowns and the situation faced by journalists and media workers in Belarus.  The Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, also conveyed Ireland's views during a meeting of UN Security Council members in January.  Ireland is fully committed to the protection and promotion of the freedom of expression.<\/p><p>In that connection, I wish to express my deep concern for the welfare of Roman Protasevich.  The coercive forced landing of a Ryanair aircraft travelling between EU capitals to detain Mr. Protasevich was utterly unacceptable and my Department has made our strong views known to the Belarusian Embassy in London.  Mr. Protasevich now faces a severe penalty solely for expressing views the Lukashenko regime does not like.  His companion, Sofia Sapega, was also detained simply for her association with him.  I reiterate Ireland's call for their immediate and unconditional release.<\/p><p>We reject the transparently false narrative of the Belarusian authorities regarding the now widely discredited bomb threat on board the Ryanair aircraft.  Last week, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, called for an urgent investigation into the incident by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO.  I welcome its agreement to undertake such an investigation.  It is important that those responsible for this outrageous attack on EU aviation security be held to account.<\/p> <p> The Belarusian people have endured a long term of repression under the leadership of Alexander Lukashenko.  Ireland shares the concerns of UN rapporteurs.  There have been 2,000 reports of human rights violations, including allegations of torture involving rape and electrocution, women human rights defenders have been persecuted and human rights work has been effectively criminalised.  We regret that the Belarusian authorities continue to deny the special rapporteur for human rights in Belarus access to the country in her official capacity.  This is essential to establishing the facts on the ground.  Ireland will continue to support her mandate until she has had the opportunity to complete her work fully.<\/p> <p> We have all seen the harrowing images of injuries sustained by those who were unjustly detained in the aftermath of the election.  We have seen security forces beat peaceful protesters in broad daylight.  Tragically, we have also witnessed a number of deaths in custody, including a children's art teacher and, most recently, other activists.  Yet we have not seen investigations into these abuses by Belarusian authorities.  One of the guiding principles of Ireland's tenure at the UN Security Council is ensuring accountability.  We are committed to promoting the rule of law and the upholding of human rights.  Central to this commitment is the fight against impunity.  It is clear that impunity breeds violence.  That is why Ireland and the EU have repeatedly called for transparent and independent investigations.  To that end, Ireland played a constructive role in extending the mandate of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to investigate human rights violations in Belarus, including possible gender dimensions.  The High Commissioner has begun the work of operationalising that mandate by hiring a team of international human rights experts.  The NGO-led International Accountability Platform for Belarus and investigations conducted in EU member states under the principle of universal jurisdiction will complement the work of the high commissioner's team.  Ireland fully supports all these efforts to ensure that those responsible for human rights violations are made accountable for their actions.<\/p> <p> Ireland also supports the recommendations of the OSCE's expert investigator, Professor Wolfgang Benedek, in his Moscow mechanism report.  This report found human rights violations to be massive, systematic and proven beyond any doubt.  The detailed recommendations in his report establish actionable steps to bring Belarus into line with its OSCE and international commitments and obligations.  I again urge the Belarusian authorities to implement those recommendations promptly.<\/p> <p> Sanctions are also important for international accountability.  In Belarus, 88 individuals and seven commercial entities have been sanctioned.  Following the recent Ryanair incident, it is clear we need to go further.  The EU will bring additional sanctions against those responsible for what has happened and is actively considering what form additional economic sanctions may take.  Ireland welcomes the EU's robust response and that of our like-minded international partners.  Lukashenko assumed he could silence opposition and wait out international concern as he has done in the past.  The EU has been clear, however, that there cannot be a return to business as usual under his leadership.  His fear of democracy and the political will of the Belarusian people are very clear now.  He has now delayed national local elections until 2023 and has made no meaningful attempt to reach out to the opposition or civil society.  Rather than make good on his promise of constitutional change as a precursor of his retirement, it seems he has focused on ensuring his family's succession in the event of his death.  The rhetoric and actions emerging from Belarus have threatened the peace and security of the European neighbourhood.  Belarusians deserve to have their democratic voice heard in free and fair elections, and Ireland will remain steadfast in calling for those elections and in supporting actions to bring accountability to those who have deprived the Belarusian people of their rights.<\/p> <p> I commend this broad motion to the House and, as I said at the start, I hope it will get universal support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100021#V00200","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622561100,"counter":221,"content":"<p>I add my support and the support of my party, Sinn F&eacute;in, to the motion.  I can only condemn in the strongest terms the act of international piracy committed by Alexander Lukashenko in Belarus.  The hijacking of a civilian aircraft to facilitate the arrest of a journalist is an absolute disgrace.  I am glad that the international community is prepared to act to ensure that this act will not go unpunished.<\/p>  <p>  It may be argued that when the Belarusian President, Alexander Lukashenko, gave the order to hijack this plane he was targeting not simply a journalist and the journalist's girlfriend but also, in effect, the entire Belarusian opposition.  We have long associated performative violence with the counter-insurgency tactics of colonial powers from the 19th century onwards, be they French, British, Israeli or whatever else.  The impact of performative acts of violence is well known.  Most usually it is intended as a moral lesson to be visited upon the watching audience as much as the unfortunate victims.  It is a tried-and-tested method of colonial policing, the practice of which has been taken up by authoritarian regimes globally.  It is the practice of striking terror in the hearts and fear in the minds of men and women who would dare to lend their support to the opponents of an authoritarian regime.  In the hijacking of the Ryanair plane, Alexander Lukashenko was attempting to send a message to all who oppose his government that there is no place safe from his reach.  It was a blatant act of aggression intended to silence legitimate dissent to the undemocratic actions of the Lukashenko government.  It was a message intended to convey the strength, dominance and reach of Lukashenko.<\/p>  <p>  In that regard, I have been struck, from the commentary I have witnessed since the hijacking took place, by the impact the event has had on members of the Belarusian diaspora, including some who reside in this State, and this is totally unacceptable.  The Irish Government, along with its EU counterparts, needs to offer reassurance to the members of the Belarusian diaspora who feel threatened by the acts of President Lukashenko.  We have a duty to protect the physical and emotional security of all on this island, particularly those who would be threatened by this act of international aggression.  A failure to do so would act as a measure of success for President Lukashenko and his intention of silencing the democratic opposition of the Belarusian people.  Lukashenko has attempted to increase pressure on the Belarusian opposition living abroad through the targeting of family members at home in Belarus.  This includes an incident which saw the detention of the grandparents and the sister's husband of a foreign-based Belarusian journalist.  International measures designed to curtail Lukashenko need to be extended to offer protection to the families of his opponents who remain within his reach.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that the EU was able to reach a unanimous decision on the important issue of voting to put in place sanctions against the Lukashenko government.  I wish to express my disappointment, however, that some eastern European members of the EU that have led out on the calls for action against the Belarusian government, which I repeat I and my colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in support, have singularly failed to apply the same rigorous criteria to the human rights abuses of other administrations in other parts of the world.  All our actions and decisions and our entire outlook, both here in the D&aacute;il and in the EU, must be predicated on the rule of international law.  When nation states are found guilty of breaking international law, they must know that they will face consequences commensurate with their crime without fear or favour.  International law is not a pick-and-mix; it must be applied rigorously and fairly.<\/p> <p> It is disturbing that a number of states can refuse to support the application of the rule of international law against Israel for its flagrant abuses of international law and persecution of the Palestinian people.  We can speculate as to what their reasons are.  It is correct that the EU will vote to impose sanctions against Belarus, but it is shameful that the EU persists in its refusal to impose sanctions against another state that continues to act in violation of international law, one that stands accused of the crime of apartheid and, in recent weeks, has been responsible for the murder of hundreds of civilians, including dozens of children.  The D&aacute;il has shown that it is prepared to stand against this oppression, but our Government must take up the mantle set before it by the Irish people and demand at EU level an equivalence under international law for all states guilty of human rights abuses.  While I agree with everything the Minister said, I agree with one part in particular, namely, that impunity breeds violence.  A perceived impunity has allowed Israel to perpetrate grave human rights abuses.  As a country, we must stand up for the rule of law internationally.  It is incumbent on us to take a lead on measures, not just against Belarus for breaching international law, but against all countries that do so, and that must include Israel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100022#W00200","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622561700,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I am pleased to support the motion.  What happened last month was like something one would see in a Netflix movie - a Ryanair aeroplane taking off from one European capital, heading north towards another European capital, and being subjected to an effective hijacking by a leader styling himself on a dictator.  In reality, it was the news.  A plane full of Europeans and Americans flying from Athens in Greece to Vilnius in Lithuania got MiGed to Minsk and Lukashenko and his onboard gang of KGB thugs got their priority passenger - a young journalist who was gathering intelligence and exposing corruption, tyranny and brutality in Belarus - all on the pretext of a threat from Hamas when what was happening in Gaza was utterly disgusting.  The screenwriters and plotters had all their political bases covered.  Politically, it was brazen, reckless and audacious.  No doubt, it has given ideas to those of a similar disposition or inclination.<\/p><p>All of us with children who are in their 20s feel the fear and distress of Mr. Roman Protasevich's parents and the sickening worry of his partner, Ms Sofia Sapega's family as they consider the immunity of impunity and <i>vice versa<\/i>being established in that part of Europe.  This did not just happen on our doorstep, but on one of our budget airlines, Ryanair.  At 33,000 ft with a fighter jet escort and a state's lie about a terror threat on board, the people inside the aeroplane were trapped and vulnerable.<\/p><p>I have constituents from Belarus who now live in north Kildare.  They are worried about their country and families and are anxious about Lukashenko's grip on their homeland.  At the same time, they have fierce pride and fear for the Chernobyl child with the strong ties to Roscrea, County Tipperary, Ms Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who has taken the place of her husband after the opposition leader and pro-democracy campaigner was jailed before the elections, joining more than 400 other political prisoners in a country that still has the death penalty and where political detainees are regularly tortured.<\/p><p>I welcome the swift and necessary international political moves against Belarus.  Unfortunately, they stand in stark contrast to the international tardiness in similar necessary action against Israel for its breaking of international law in Palestine against the Palestinian people, including 66 dead Gazan children.  I urge the international community to look at Belarus and Israel with the same political zeal.  We cannot come down hard on those who break international law in one country while tiptoeing around those who break it in another.  It is the law itself and the breaking of that law that matters, not who breaks it.  It cannot be a case of all eyes on Lukashenko but a blind eye turned to Netanyahu.  If it is, we are excusing and complicit in the breaking of international law.  I urge the Minister to remember this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100023#X00200","speaker":"1585"},{"type":"speech","time":1622561700,"counter":224,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion.

I send my solidarity to the people of Belarus, who are suffering under the Lukashenko regime.  In particular, I send my solidarity to Mr. Protasevich and his girlfriend, Ms Sapega.  It is clear that Mr. Protasevich's arrest was the object of the exercise.  It has been reported that there were several KGB agents on the flight.<\/p>  <p>  I commend the work of Belarusian exiles in applying pressure to companies like Rolls-Royce and British American Tobacco, which are seen as supporters of the regime.
