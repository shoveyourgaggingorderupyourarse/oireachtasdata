This is very good news because people need and want to be back at work.  Their enthusiasm to return was demonstrated last year when 400,000 went back to work as restrictions were lifted.  Workers do not want to be on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  They, and indeed all of us, hope such supports will be required and necessary only for the shortest possible time.  The reality is that, come September, some people will still be locked out of work due to public health restrictions.  Among them will be those in aviation, hospitality and events, those whose jobs depend on international travel and those in many other sectors.  That is why the Taoiseach's decision to start cutting the PUP by instalments of &euro;50 from September is premature and deeply unfair.<\/p>  <p>  It has always been understood that when the Government stops people from going back to their place of employment, for good public health reasons, it has a responsibility to support them.  It seems now, however, that the Government has chosen to pull the rug from under the workers.  I heard a woman on the radio last week who said she remained locked out of work despite the reopening.  She described her experience and said that for the first six months of lockdown, her family availed of the mortgage break and that when that went, the family tapped into their savings.  Now that money is gone too.  How on earth is it fair to say to this woman or thousands of workers like her who will not be back at work in September and may not be allowed back until next year that their supports are going to be cut?  The Taoiseach is walking away from his responsibility to these workers and their families.  He will cut their income, in effect, by one third.  That is absolutely huge.  It is the difference between them just getting by for the next few months and not doing so.<\/p>  <p>  For the vast majority, the need for the PUP will fall away naturally as sectors reopen.  That is what the evidence tells us but the Taoiseach's decision to cut the PUP ensures those who remain locked out of work will be made poorer.  They still have to pay their mortgages, rent, childcare fees and utility bills but they will be abandoned by the Government when they are at the end of their tether.  What happened to \"We are all in this together\", as was the slogan of the Government?  The Taoiseach promised no cliff edge but cliff edges mean nothing to those who are relying on every single euro.  To slash payments by &euro;50 a go is devastating when workers are prevented from working.  <\/p>  <p>  What the Taoiseach now proposes is a mirror of the plan he wanted to introduce in January but it was the wrong approach then and it is the wrong approach now.  His approach to this matter sends out a signal that the recovery he envisages is one that is unfair and leaves people behind.  Let us not go down that road again.  I ask the Taoiseach not to press ahead with these cuts and to ensure that full support will remain in place for those workers who are prevented from going to work for as long as they are prevented from doing so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100003#A00200","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1622552700,"counter":7,"content":"<p>First of all, I agree with the Deputy in terms of the good news in recent weeks that people are returning to work in considerable numbers.  We have been in a position to do this through our management of the pandemic and though a successful and efficiently run vaccination programme which is having a dramatic impact on the severity of illness in society from the virus and on reducing death and hospitalisation and numbers in intensive care.  The efficient national vaccination effort is enabling us to return to economic growth and recovery and to bring people back to work.<\/p>  <p>  What we announced today in terms of extending the schemes is a continuation of that economic recovery story.  We have fulfilled our commitment in terms of not having a cliff edge.  The employment wage subsidy scheme supports 315,000 workers.  We are extending that to Christmas.  The whole idea is to support enterprise and to enable enterprises that retain jobs to stay viable and keep jobs going in the economy.<\/p>  <p>  We are doing the same with the Covid-19 restrictions support scheme extension with enhanced restart payments of three weeks at a double rate.  This will be significant for people in hospitality, for example, and in other sectors.  This significant restart grant really gives people a fighting chance not only in maintaining the employment they have maintained under the supports they have got from Government but by increasing employment in the coming weeks.  We know that more and more people will come off the pandemic unemployment payment during the summer months.  We are extending the pandemic unemployment payment out to September.  Then, gradually, we are easing out of that up to February 2022.<\/p>  <p>  We are not just doing that.  All of that is in parallel with an unprecedented work activation programme with substantial funding being allocated to reskilling training programmes, upskilling programmes, education places, increased apprenticeships and increased internship programmes.  There will be more placements available in the public service for many people and investment in research to create a new approach and new orientations within the economy.  We will use the funding we are receiving from the recovery and resilience fund in Europe not only to invest in the human capital side and in people but also to create new jobs in retrofitting and public transport.  This is what we are going to do with the railway project for Cork, which will be significant in terms of leveraging other economic and employment opportunities there.  That is one example.  Another is the new facility in Beggar's Bush.  The new Department building there is a pathway finder building.  It will be state-of-the-art in terms of emissions reduction and so on.  This is an imaginative programme designed to prepare the country for recovery in the coming period and to start growing jobs in new sectors like the green economy and digital transformation.  It is about giving the supports to aviation that are required and about clarity in direction of travel in terms of the reopening of international travel and the events industry.  Significant supports are in place for musicians under the music entertainment business assistance scheme.  This will support musicians in wedding bands or those who perform in smaller live venues.  We are initiating a basic income pilot scheme for artists.<\/p>  <p>  This is a significant comprehensive agenda ultimately with a view that by 2024 we will have 2.5 million people in jobs.  That will exceed the numbers of people in employment before the pandemic.  The broader objective of Government is to create opportunities for people to return to work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100004#B00100","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1622552700,"counter":8,"content":"<p>Be that as it may, the Taoiseach will acknowledge that come September there are workers who will not be returned to work and who will not be in a position to get back to work.

Yet, the Government is choosing to cut the supports that these workers and their families rely on.  Everybody wants to get back to work as quickly as possible.  However, the State and the Government have to make provision for the section of workers who will not have returned by September or even during the course of this year, including workers in aviation, events and hospitality.<\/p> <p>It is wrong and unfair to punish those workers who cannot return to work because of a public health emergency.  I again put it to the Taoiseach that the fair thing to do is for this Government to tell every worker that we want them to return to work quickly and safely but also to support them for as long as they cannot return to work because of the public health emergency.  I invite the Taoiseach to do that rather than to cut the very support these people need to survive and which they will need through September.

Will the Taoiseach address the issue of people who have lost their jobs as a result of the Covid pandemic?  He has repeatedly promised that there will be no cliff edge when it comes to the withdrawal of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, yet today he has announced that there will be such a cliff edge.  No matter what level of restrictions are in place across the country in September, payments will be reduced by &euro;50.  A further reduction of &euro;50 will occur in November and a final reduction of &euro;50 in February.  In total, this amounts to a massive 40% cut to an already meagre payment.  This is the very definition of a cliff edge.  The Government has chosen an arbitrary date and determined to cut people's payments, no matter what the public health advice is at that time and no matter what jobs are or are not available.  These payments are a lifeline for hundreds of thousands of people whose jobs were casualties of the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  Experience tells us that, when businesses reopen, people will go back to work.  They do not want to remain on the PUP longer than they have to.  Last year, 400,000 people closed their PUP claims once the economy partially reopened.  Since this payment was introduced more than a year ago, just 3,000 complaints have been made to the Department of Social Protection by employers alleging that staff were reluctant to return to the workforce.  That is 3,000 out of more than 600,000 people, or 0.5%.  The Department has also clarified that the vast majority of those 3,000 cases did not involve any misclaiming.  Why then has the Taoiseach done what he has sworn he would not do?  Why has he created a cliff edge for those in receipt of this payment, a cliff edge which will undoubtedly lead many more into poverty?<\/p>  <p>  As the economy opens up over the summer months - a reopening that everyone in this House hopes will be very successful - the numbers in receipt of the PUP will significantly reduce naturally.  There is no evidence that this payment is being abused or that people are preferring to claim the PUP rather than return to work.  Despite this, the Taoiseach's Government has introduced a cliff edge in September, when there will be an initial 15% cut which, as I have said, will grow to 40%.  A reduction of that magnitude will cause serious financial problems for those people who can least afford it.  It has been a very tough year for everyone but especially for those who have been forced out of their jobs because of the pandemic.  They have now been told by this Government that their meagre income will be slashed in September, even if the business in which they work has not reopened.<\/p> <p>This announcement will cause serious stress and anxiety among a large cohort of people, many of whom are barely keeping their heads above water.  Why has the Government broken its promise and introduced a cliff edge for the PUP?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100005#C00500","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622553300,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I disagree fundamentally with the Deputy.  We have not introduced a cliff edge.  The opposite is the case.  We have extended the PUP to September, following which there will be a phasing out of it out to next February, which will be second anniversary of the introduction of the payment.  By then the payment will have been in place for two years.  It was originally introduced for 12 weeks.  That was the original timeframe the then Government put in place for the PUP.  The pandemic has lasted much longer than that, obviously. <\/p>  <p>  We want to create employment opportunities for people.  I agree 100% that people want to work.  There is no suggestion by Government or anybody that there is any abuse of the payment.  Rather, we are saying that we now have to reorientate the economy and reallocate and target resources for growth and for economic recovery.  That means creating substantial funding for work placement programmes, training programmes, education and higher education.  For example, we want to create new jobs in retrofitting in the private sector in private housing, but also in the public sector through direct grants.  We will need skill sets to enable us to do that comprehensive programme for retrofitting across the country in terms of our housing stock.  People will have to retrain and reskill to do that type of work.<\/p>  <p>  Likewise, a substantial allocation will be provided for the re-wetting of bogs.  There will be new opportunities in the economy.  It is about what we do now as we emerge from the pandemic and people naturally come off the PUP, as they will, and are, in significant numbers.  It should be remembered that all the while we are supporting workers in employment as well through extensions of the employment wage subsidy scheme and the Covid restrictions support scheme.  The orientation of the plan is to support workers to retain the jobs they are in and are currently being subsidised and to give companies a fighting chance to retain those jobs and enhance them, and, by enhancing them, recruit people.  <\/p>  <p>  I will make one final point.  Deputy McDonald made the point that Government has stopped people from going to work.  The Government has not stopped anybody from going to work; the Covid-19 virus has stopped people from going to work and it caused the most severe and rapid recession since the wars across the world.  Government has responded comprehensively to this pandemic and in a very effective way.  We have underpinned income and jobs to the best of its ability and we will continue to do that, but we are moving into a new phase in economic recovery.  That new phase involves the targeting and allocation of resources that can create new opportunities in new sectors of the economy, and, crucially, more support for sectors, such as aviation, tourism, the arts and live events, in the coming months, which is what we are doing in the allocation of resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100006#D00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1622553300,"counter":16,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach spoke about other sectors.

He is saying to them that they can sustain a cut of 40% in their already low income.  The Taoiseach will know from the studies that have been done that the basic social welfare payment is not sufficient to maintain any kind of life of dignity, yet the Government, by its actions, is forcing those people onto the breadline.  What is the justification for cutting people's incomes by 40% when many of the jobs that were lost will not be reinstated by next February?  We hope many new jobs will be created, but it is undoubtedly the case that there will be still high levels of unemployment among those people who have lost their jobs.

I sincerely hope that was not a pun and that the plan will succeed.  I have been quite critical of some of the Government measures.  The Taoiseach has never taken any responsibility for some of those measures and has always said it is because of Covid that this, that or the other has closed.  On the other hand, he has said we have fared better than other countries.  He has taken the credit but not the downside.<\/p>  <p>  I have long argued that I would have preferred to see fewer restrictions on society and the economy generally and more targeted interventions.  One area in particular that needed targeted interventions was the nursing home sector and, in fairness, the Government provided the temporary assistance payment scheme, TAPS, for the sector.  However, we are learning now that in conjunction with the measures the Government is announcing, it is simultaneously taking away that temporary assistance to nursing homes.  I accept that the scheme is temporary but, equally, it is essential.  The threat in general has not subsided and the threat has not subsided for nursing homes in particular.  We know congregated settings are a risk, whether that be direct provision centres, where there was an outbreak in Ennis last week, meat factories, where there are continuing risks and outbreaks or, indeed, nursing homes.  There was an outbreak very recently in Marymount nursing home in Cork, in the Taoiseach's constituency, notwithstanding that all the staff and residents are vaccinated.<\/p>  <p>  Continuing measures are necessary in nursing homes and in congregated settings more generally.  If that is not funded through the TAPS, how will it be funded?  We all accept that we cannot go back to the situation as it was before and that there had to be a change in practices in nursing homes.  I very much welcome that change.  The committee I chaired recommended a systemic change away from reliance on nursing homes towards care in the community.  In conjunction with that committee, the previous Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, set up a nursing home expert panel.  The Government has not implemented any of the recommendations of the committee I chaired or the expert panel, yet, at the same time, it is taking away the supports nursing homes currently have to introduce safer practices.  How are nursing homes to pay for this?  If not through the TAPS, will there will be an increase in the amount they are paid through the fair deal scheme?  We all accept that greater measures have to be taken and those measures must be paid for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100007#E00200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1622553900,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  We will have to agree to disagree in terms of the issue around the imposition of restrictions in society.  The measures we have taken overall have resulted in fewer deaths in Ireland and less severe illness than in other countries that took a different approach.  Ultimately, the role of Government is to protect lives and public health to the very best of its ability.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the nursing homes scheme, and the TAPS in particular, the first point I have to make is that the results from the vaccination programme have been very significant in terms of nursing homes, with a reduction almost to the point of elimination of severe disease in nursing homes, among both staff and residents.  The serial testing is revealing that and new protocols for visiting nursing homes have been introduced as a result.<\/p> <p>That has been very positive and needs to be acknowledged.  The Government has allocated very substantial resources under TAPS.  It provides contributions to nursing homes towards the cost of maintaining isolation rooms and provided a one-off contribution towards temporary visiting infrastructure during winter 2020.  Over 6,675 claims have been processed and approved since 10 May.  Approximately &euro;93.9 million in direct financial support will be provided to the sector in 2021, with &euro;42 million provided so far.  That is a very substantial allocation of resources.<\/p> <p> In addition to TAPS, the HSE has provided other enhanced measures to support nursing homes and their residents in the context of Covid-19: the Covid response teams, access to PPE and oxygen, support for staff accommodation, access to training and the serial testing programme.  As Deputy McNamara will know, priority vaccination was provided to nursing homes and the uptake has been extraordinary.  I think it is at nearly 99%.  The strong vaccine effect is very evident in the nursing homes, with huge reductions, as I have said, in the numbers of cases and outbreaks and in mortality.<\/p> <p> Essentially, we are now into a different phase of the pandemic as we speak.  The vaccination programme is having an impact.  There are consequences to that as we move forward and allocate resources in a more targeted manner.  Again, the Government will be there to support nursing homes.  At the time of the introduction of TAPS, our nursing homes were in a far different position in respect of Covid-19.  The outbreaks that were occurring are no longer occurring at all or in no way to the same extent or frequency.  TAPS was part of a wider suite of supports.  We should now evaluate and take lessons from the pandemic as to how in the medium term we can ensure a more supportive environment for nursing homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100007#E00300","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622554200,"counter":22,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach did a good job of outlining what TAPS supported, and I welcome that, but how will that be supported now?

Notwithstanding the high take-up of vaccines, there are still outbreaks, unfortunately.  They are fewer in number and their consequences are lesser, I accept, but we need to avoid the outbreaks and their consequences.  The Taoiseach talked about lessons being learned.  We will have to look at the spread of Covid-19 in healthcare settings and congregated settings.  I think a tribunal will have to be considered to look at the earlier deaths in nursing homes in particular and whether people were sent home or sent into nursing homes from acute hospitals with Covid.

Families and communities the length and breadth of the country have been affected by suicide.  It is important to continue to raise awareness and to speak openly about mental health.  That is important within our education curriculum and outside of our education curriculum.<\/p>  <p>  The Connecting for Life strategy is Ireland's national suicide reduction strategy.  It aims to reduce suicide and self-harm rates across society and in priority groups.  We have the National Office for Suicide Prevention within the HSE.  It was established to co-ordinate suicide reduction efforts around the country and to implement the strategy.  Funding has increased on an annual basis, but it is not just about funding alone.  It is about the proper delivery of services and co-ordination.  Suicide prevention funding would have gone up progressively from about &euro;3 million ten years ago to about &euro;13 million or so now.  Also, the National Office for Suicide Prevention works with the non-governmental and community sector in particular and with the HSE in an advisory role.  About 20 partner non-governmental organisations are involved and 54% of the funding would go to those non-governmental organisations - groups like Pieta House, the Samaritans, Suicide or Survive and the Family Resource Centres.<\/p>  <p>  It has been a while coming, but about 24 of the 26 emergency departments now have access to a mental health professional at all times, I am informed, through liaison mental health services based in acute hospitals or the national clinical programme for the management of self-harm in emergency departments.<\/p> <p>That is important.  In addition, prior to the pandemic, community mental health teams provided access to a seven-day per week mental health service.  This is still in place and available for existing mental health service users in a blended format in compliance with Covid-19 restrictions.  The seven-day telehealth service includes the crisis text line 50808, <i>yourmentalhealth.ie<\/i>, the information line 1800111888 and NGO partners' online supports.  <br\/><br\/>Access and traffic to all of those services has increased during the Covid-19 period and we have an extra obligation to do more now during this period and its aftermath to support people, and young people in particular.  That is why an education and well-being initiative, as part of funding that was allocated in the return of schools during the Covid-19 period, is focusing on the mental well-being of young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100009#G00200","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622554800,"counter":30,"content":"<p>The main message to get out of this debate is that no one should ever need to feel alone.  It is making the connection between the person who is at a critical time in his or her life and making it easier for him or her, whether that is through the local GP, calling the Samaritans, or calling a friend, but also accessing the services that are there that the Government is funding.  It is about making a person feel in this country that there is no need to feel lost or alone.  You can put up your hand, dial your phone or call out for help and that help is there.<\/p>  <p>  Every one of us, and especially politicians because we are quite simply dealing with so many people every day of the week, should be looking out for people&rsquo;s mental health as well as for all of the other aspects of their lives that we try to positively impact upon.  We should be on our guard because if by doing our work properly we can save any people going through the torture and anguish that is suicide, it would be a job very well done.  It is an onus and responsibility that each of us have, which we should take very seriously and conscientiously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100010#H00200","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1622554800,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I agree 100% with what the Deputy said.  We always have to watch out for the vulnerabilities in others and be alert and aware.  As he said earlier, we should be open in talking about mental health and about suicide but also in letting people know, which I consistently say to young people, that they should be kinder to each other.  In life, people should be kinder to each other than is often the case and the Deputy referenced that in his earlier remarks.  It is very important in a group or crowded setting to be very conscious that not everybody may be happy at a given, particular point in time or in a good position.  We then have to provide supports in the access to GPs, community health teams, or a mental health professional within the community, which the Deputy has referred to.<\/p>  <p>  My view, having been in the Department of Health quite some time ago, is we need to continue to strengthen the community health teams across the length and breadth of the country.  In speaking to some senior psychiatrists and to people who have been involved in mental health service provision for years, they felt that we were overly institutionalised as a country, overly focused on the acute phase of mental illness and less so on the community side.  We need to build up strong community mental health teams.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100010#H00300","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1622554800,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach and I also thank Deputy Healy-Rae for raising that important issue.

Will the Taoiseach agree to go on &euro;350 if he thinks it should be cut?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100016#Q01000","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1622557500,"counter":140,"content":"<p>We are extending the pandemic unemployment payment out to September and then gradually easing out of that into February of next year.

We are aware that some local authorities across the country still operate an any-bag, any-bin policy and that some private operators incinerate all waste collected from the black bin, the blue bin, or even the brown bin.  Practices across the public and private sectors are in direct conflict with the Government's current roadmap for waste planning and management, limited as that plan is.  There are firm commitments to the circular economy, yet the mass production of unnecessary plastics by very profitable companies continues.

While we sit here debating the greater things in life, we rarely think of the centrality of workers in our society.  We rarely think of them as a resource that could make our society much more efficient.  In this regard, what does the Taoiseach think of the F&oacute;rsa campaign for a four-day week, F&oacute;rsa being the trade union leading the campaign?  How might Ireland use a four-day week, as Spain is doing, to become one of the first countries in the world to lead a trial that would show how the associated work practice changes could have a double-whammy impact in that they would improve both the environment and levels of equality?  The four-day week would improve the environment because, as studies have shown, changing to a four-day week can help to reduce emissions.  It would improve our equality agenda because studies have shown that where a four-day week is implemented, fathers and partners, particularly men in relationships, can play a more caring role, a role that women are normally forced to play.

The Four Day Week Ireland coalition has highlighted how moving to a four-day week could reduce carbon emissions by up to 16% while also improving people's work-life balance and mental health.  It is an important demand raised by the trade unions and the environmental movement and it constitutes an important part of the eco-socialist green new deal that we advocate.  Earlier this month the T&aacute;naiste said the four-day week was not something his Department was even considering.  Are the Taoiseach and his Department considering it?  If not, will they?  Too often, tackling climate change is presented as being a matter of eco-austerity, greenwashing, new taxes on workers and cutting back on people's living standards but it does not have to be, and must not be, that way.  Instead, an eco-socialist approach is about raising the quality of people's lives and tackling climate change together, transforming people's lives for the better and avoiding the climate catastrophe that is on the way.  The demand for a four-day week without loss of pay is a perfect example of the approach.

Some of the reasons for consternation and blaming young people are outrageous and wrong.  Young people have suffered so much over the past 18 months.  We have a genuine issue in that we are telling everyone to enjoy an outdoor summer but we need to prepare for it, not just in Dublin.  Luckily enough, I come from near Lough Derg on the River Shannon.  Ms Maura Boyle of Larkin's in Garrykennedy was on to me about the volume of people down enjoying the area at the weekend.  It is fantastic.  It is a question of the level of waste left behind by some people.  It is very difficult at times for some people because bins may be full and children and everything else may need to be managed.  Across the country, in both urban and rural areas, as we face another bank holiday weekend, we do not need to close streets or anything like that.  That just pushes people in other directions.  We need to ensure, as my colleague Senator Bacik said eloquently earlier, we need more bins, more benches and more bogs for people.  We need them pretty rapidly for an outdoor summer.  We can all be safer and it can be enjoyed more.  Local authorities need to provide them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100017#R00500","speaker":"1610"},{"type":"speech","time":1622558100,"counter":185,"content":"<p>Local authorities need to respond.  I agree with Deputy Kelly on that.  We are successfully reopening society and the economy.  The vaccination programme is making that possible, as is the adherence of the vast majority of people to guidelines for a prolonged period of time, which has had the desired impact of suppressing the virus or keeping it at reasonable levels.  The vaccination programme, in particular, has reduced ill health and mortality and kept hospitalisations at a reasonable level.  The number of intensive care unit admissions is down.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the preparation for outdoor activity, particularly for young people, outdoor facilities must be provided proactively by local authorities.  Some local authorities have been very proactive regarding the pedestrianisation of streets.  They have accelerated their pedestrianisation programmes.  The Ministers responsible for tourism and housing, Deputy Catherine Martin and Deputy Darragh O'Brien, respectively, have provided funding for outdoor facilities so both establishments and councils can enhance the public space for people.  That is the way to go.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Gannon's point that local authorities have been particularly effective.  They have to make a decision based on the allocation and resources they get.  With regard to biodiversity officers, I encourage their appointment.  I would have been at the forefront of the appointment of archaeological officers in my time on the council.  The appointment of a biodiversity officer is a key appointment.  Most local authorities are embracing biodiversity.  It is the cumulative impact of all the little things we do regarding biodiversity that will have the biggest impact.  The wild garden that is being developed on Leinster House lawn, as opposed to the manicured lawn, is delightful to see.  That is the type of initiative we need across the country.

How would all of this be facilitated?  In politics we will be a long way before we get to a six-day week, never mind a seven-day week.  There is a five-day week at the moment.  There have been moves to try to improve working hours and so on.  The remote working strategy is being promoted by the Government and will be legislated for to facilitate reduction in carbon emissions so workers will not have to go on a five-day basis into the town or city or wherever.  Where possible, they can do some of the work at home.  There is a great deal of work to be done to flesh out the proposal that has been put forward by the Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100018#S00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1622558700,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I am afraid we are not going to get to the three rounds of questions because of the time.

The report contained recommendations for the social and economic regeneration of Dublin's north east inner city.  The report has been further supplemented by the publishing of the next strategic plan, which runs from 2020 to 2022.  Both documents are available on the Dublin north east inner city, NEIC, website.<\/p><p>In June 2017 an independent chairperson was appointed by Government to the NEIC programme implementation board.  Members of the board include representatives from relevant Government Departments and agencies, business and the local community.  The board is assisted in its work by six subgroups: enhanced policing; maximising educational training and employment opportunities; family well-being; enhancing community well-being and the physical landscape; substance use misuse and inclusion health; and alignment of services.<\/p><p>The board and its subgroups continue to meet on a monthly basis to oversee and progress the implementation of the Mulvey report and the NEIC strategic plan.  Officials from the Department of the Taoiseach work closely with the board, the subgroups and the dedicated programme office based in Se&aacute;n MacDermott Street.  The chairperson of the board reports to an oversight group of senior officials chaired by the Secretary General of my Department.  This group, which has met 11 times to date, ensures strong and active participation by all relevant Departments and agencies and deals with any barriers or issues highlighted by the board.  The Cabinet committee on social affairs and equality provides political oversight of the NEIC initiative.  The Government is committed to supporting and investing in the north east inner city community and ensuring the board has the necessary resources to achieve its targets and fulfil its ambition.  To this end the Government has made available &euro;6.5 million in funding for the initiative in 2021.<\/p><p>I will set out some highlights of what the initiative has delivered to date in 2021.  There is strong support, both financial and otherwise, for the recently launched north inner city local community safety partnership.  There is an increased Garda presence in the area with the Garda community support van supporting a focus on community policing, particularly throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.  A Garda project focused on drug-related intimidation continues to have positive benefits.  Funding has been provided for the training of local garda&iacute; and local community-based practitioners in addressing domestic violence and child protection issues.  There is the ongoing roll-out of the P-TECH initiative in secondary schools - the pathways in technology programme - in the NEIC area.  A highly successful work experience programme in flash mentoring has been delivered for second level students in the NEIC.  Funding has been provided to develop an adult and community education strategy for the area.  Substantial funding has been provided for a community case management team that will work with the most vulnerable and high-risk families in the area.  The funding of a dedicated parenting support co-ordinator post has been provided.  There is funding to provide access to fast-track counselling for children and young people in the area.  A significant investment has been made in a bespoke sport, recreation and well-being programme for the area.  Dedicated community events and arts programmes have been funded for 2021.  A full-time intercultural development co-ordinator is employed for the area.  Funding has been provided for a recovery case manager and recovery coach internships.  We have seen the continued operation in the NEIC of Ireland's first social inclusion hub.  Funding is provided for a homeless case management team.  Funding is provided for a residential stabilisation programme.  Funding is provided for the City Connects programme.  Funding is provided to the local early learning initiative and the refurbishment of the swimming pool on Se&aacute;n MacDermott Street.  Finally, there is a multidisciplinary team of psychologists, occupational speech and language therapists.  I will read the rest into the record.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>Funding is provided to support the SWAN detached youth programme.  A green ribbon project has been rolled out with an environmental clean-up and litter prevention measures in partnership with local residents.  There has been the purchase of almost 500 laptops and devices to support students in NEIC schools with home learning through the worst of the pandemic.<\/p><p>In 2021, some &euro;1 million of the &euro;6.5 million NEIC budget has been allocated to the social employment fund, through which 55 posts have been filled in community projects providing childcare, youth services, elder care, cultural and environmental services.<\/p><p>This responsive and innovative initiative has been widely welcomed within the community.<\/p><p>The programme implementation board will continue to implement the remaining actions set out in the Mulvey report and the NEIC strategic plan 2020-22 as well as adopting a greater focus on long-term sustainable outcomes which operate in an integrated framework and add value to the existing service infrastructure.  Progress reports on the NEIC initiative are available on the NEIC website for 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020.<\/p><p>The Government remains committed to supporting and investing in the north east inner city community and ensuring the chairperson and programme implementation board have the necessary resources to help to make the area a better place to work and live.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100018#S00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1622558700,"counter":194,"content":"<p>Of course the neglect and poverty in the inner city of Dublin, as in other inner city and other areas throughout the State, is not accidental.  It has happened on the watch of successive Governments and is in fact the consequence of bad policy, as the Taoiseach knows.<\/p>  <p>  To create the brighter future to which the Taoiseach referred, it is imperative that we invest in our children and in early education.  That is what I wish to raise with the Taoiseach today.  Early education providers in Dublin's north inner city have been adversely affected by the new national childcare scheme.  In fact, up to 80% of children attending the early learning settings that cater for the most disadvantaged children are now in difficulties because of this new scheme.  The viability and sustainability of these centres is under question.  The parents of children attending these services are currently unemployed.  Therefore, the subvention is reduced.<\/p>  <p>  The providers in the inner city have raised these real concerns with the Department.  They have spent months trying to resolve this issue.  Their single wish is to ensure that children in the inner city, especially the most disadvantaged children, have access to early education.  Yet, they have found no solution.  They have suggested the implementation of a DEIS model to sustain these children.  I implore the Taoiseach to intervene on the matter and not allow these children to be failed again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100018#S00900","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1622558700,"counter":195,"content":"<p>The north east inner city task force has done extraordinarily good work but there is more work to be done.  How much is the Taoiseach engaged in the programme of implementation?  Has the Department or the Taoiseach been briefed on whether the Rutland Street School community hub project has gone to tender yet?  When is work expected to start?  If the Taoiseach is engaged, he will be able to reply and answer that.  The plans for this were announced in 2016.  It is now five years later.  It was originally believed that it would be funded by central government but now much of it is from the resources of the council.  There are numerous competing projects, as the Taoiseach can appreciate.  Is it being funded under the urban regeneration fund?  If not, why not?<\/p>  <p>  The Labour Party has called for a Mulvey-style commission or task force on the north side of Dublin and another in Drogheda.  My colleagues, Senator Marie Sherlock, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and Deputy Ged Nash, have campaigned for this for a long time.  We do not believe we can simply police our way out of crime alone.  We agree that the plan put in place some years ago had some merit but it needs a great deal of work.<\/p>  <p>  It seems from the evidence that this Government's commitment needs to be renewed.  A task force or Mulvey-style commission would really help to deal with many of the ingrained problems in the area.

Yet, in the Mulvey report, sport seems to be the great omission.  The Taoiseach read out the list of funding initiatives but there is little that pertains to sport.  There are two great soccer clubs in the north inner city, Sheriff Youth Club and Belvedere FC.  Both play on an astroturf pitch in Clontarf.  The pitch is completely outdated.  The pitch has a lifespan of approximately seven years but it has been at the grounds now for 11 years.  It is outdated and needs investment.  That needs to happen.  There is no GAA club currently in the north inner city.  That is something we need to factor in to our considerations because there is a great desire for GAA in the north inner city.  It is in the shadows of Croke Park.  The local boxing club in the heart of Dublin 1 applied for a grant for female changing facilities some weeks ago.  Those involved were turned down.

Other supports are going into the area.  I refer to the SWAN Youth Service, the detached youth work programme and the Green Ribbon Project, through which environmental clean-up and litter prevention measures are being rolled out.  I refer also to the purchase of almost 500 laptops and devices to support students in north-east inner-city area schools with the home learning that has been ongoing during the pandemic.  A sum of &euro;1 million has been allocated to the social employment fund, through which 55 posts have been filled in community projects providing childcare, youth services, elder care and cultural and environmental services.  These measures have been broadly welcomed.<\/p>  <p>  I will address some of the issues that have been raised.  With regard to the Rutland Street School site, Part 8 planning approval was granted by Dublin City Council in October 2019 and an enabling works contract to the value of &euro;780,000 was completed in 2019.  This was a lead-in contract to assess structural loading, asbestos volumes and so on in advance of main contract works.  Tender documents for the main construction contract were issued in July 2020.  The main construction contract for the Rutland Street School redevelopment is in the final stages of the public procurement process.  Following completion of restricted procedure stage 1 in the fourth quarter of 2020, a number of shortlisted firms were invited to submit tenders for stage 2.  Evaluation of these tender submissions is currently under way and it is anticipated that this process will be completed in the coming weeks.  That is good news for this particular development.  I agree with Deputy Gannon.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputy Kelly made the point that we need to create area-based partnerships such as that created in the north-east inner city elsewhere.  I have tasked my Department to work with the Cabinet subcommittee on social affairs to identify a number of areas of disadvantage or areas with particular challenges for which to prioritise supports.  This was the approach of the old revitalising areas through planning, investment and development, RAPID, programme which we created years ago when I was last in government.  The idea is that clubs and organisations in those communities are to be given higher ratings when applying for funding.  This would mean that Corinthians Boxing Club, for example, would be more highly prioritised.  I will ask the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media to look at the area of boxing because some clubs need support both in making applications and in making sure that they are successful in getting the supports they urgently need in partnership with local authorities, the county and city councils.  Such clubs do great work.  <\/p>  <p>  I would like the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media to work with Dublin North East Inner City and with the sporting groups in the community in respect of soccer, GAA, which the Deputy mentioned, and other sports.  This is where investment should go.  I have no difficulty in working with Government to provide capital investment in these areas for sporting facilities, particularly AstroTurf pitches and so on in inner-city locations.  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to childcare, I will speak to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in respect of investment.  There has, however, been sustained investment in childcare in inner-city areas.  There has also been sustained investment in education.  Going way back, I  was involved in providing funding for Larkin Community College.  There has been consistent engagement and support.  I take the point made in respect of housing.  I will engage with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, with regard to the issues pertaining to childcare.  More generally, housing has a role to play in the revitalisation of the area.  In addition to supporting the existing community, we have to work to ensure that younger generations can aspire to housing within the community.  We have to work to refurbish existing housing stock and to create new housing provision in the area.  The early years are important but, as I pointed out in my earlier reply, I am very committed to the provision of multidisciplinary supports from physiotherapy to speech and language therapy and occupational therapy for children.  A multidisciplinary team-based approach is vital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100019#T00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements","time":1622559300,"counter":203,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100019#T00250"},{"type":"question","time":1622559300,"counter":204,"qnumday":10,"qnumall":"[28339\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100019#T00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his latest engagement with the social partners.","asker":"1550","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1622559300,"counter":205,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[26235\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100019#T00400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his most recent engagements with the social partners.","asker":"1610","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1622559300,"counter":206,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[28066\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100019#T00500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his recent engagements with the social partners.","asker":"1466","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1622559300,"counter":207,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[29779\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100019#T00600","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his most recent engagements with the social partners.","asker":"1478","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1622559300,"counter":208,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[29782\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100019#T00700","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his most recent engagements with the social partners.","asker":"1628","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1622559300,"counter":209,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[29785\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100019#T00800","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his most recent engagements with the social partners.","asker":"1486","askee":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1622559300,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 15, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  The Government recognises the importance of regular and open engagement with all sectors of society.

This is particularly important as we face the enormous challenges ahead, including climate action, digital transition, disruption to the labour market and housing.<\/p>  <p>  There are many different fora in place for these conversations, including the National Economic Dialogue, the National Economic and Social Council, various sectoral groups and initiatives such as the citizens' assemblies.  There is also regular bilateral engagement at official and ministerial level, of which I am very supportive.<\/p>  <p>  As committed to in the programme for Government, a social dialogue unit has been established within the economic division of my Department.  Its initial focus is on supporting and enhancing engagement with the social partners, including through existing mechanisms such as the labour employer economic forum, LEEF, which deals with labour market issues.  LEEF helped ensure useful discussions between Government, employers and trade unions during the Covid-19 pandemic and I chaired the most recent meeting in February where, along with Brexit and Covid-19 issues, we discussed ways to strengthen social dialogue and engagement with civil society and representative groups.  A further meeting of LEEF will take place shortly.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, I met with the environmental pillar on 21 May, and will meet with the community and voluntary pillar and the farming and agriculture pillar in the coming weeks, to discuss how social dialogue can be strengthened and to exchange views on issues pertaining to those particular sectors.

We have delayed our Bill deliberately because the Taoiseach said in all sincerity that he was going to address the matter.

I want to know what the Government, which provides Aer Lingus with State support through the EWSS, intends to do to protect these workers and to prevent assaults of this type on living standards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100020#U00200","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1622559900,"counter":216,"content":"<p>Last week, I questioned the T&aacute;naiste about the double rent hike facing renters this July as landlords attempt to impose two year's worth of rent increases in one fell swoop, which is allowed under the legislation introduced by the Government.

Will the Taoiseach and the Government bring forth this month the emergency legislation needed to stop this happening?  For the average renter in Dublin, an 8% rent increase would be an increase of &euro;140 per month, an incredible amount of money that is unaffordable for many, especially considering the cuts coming down the line in terms of the PUP.  We should be extending the rent freeze.  We should be taking action to bring rents down.  At the very least, we need emergency legislation to stop this double rent hike happening.  If the Government refuses to do that, People Before Profit will bring forward legislation and we will make sure that it is a major issue in the by-election in Dublin Bay South.

I agree with the points he made.  We discussed this earlier in the House.  Again, it is a key issue, particularly in terms of young people.  Any supports we can give, we will give.  We will work with the Deputy and others in respect of that particular issue.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Kelly raised a number of issues.  We will work with the Deputy's party in respect of the Organisation of Working Time (Reproductive Health Related Leave) Bill 2021 in relation to supporting those who have gone through the trauma of miscarriage.  On statutory sick pay, the Government is examining the issue and is positively disposed to such a scheme.  Work is ongoing in that regard.  This question was on the social dialogue and on the leave programme.  We have made considerable progress on a number of fronts.  This is an issue on which we want to make progress.  We have work to do in regard to the living wage as well, which is provided for within the programme for Government and also in terms of other initiatives that we can take and lessons that we can learn from the pandemic in regard to sick pay, illness benefit more generally and supporting workers more broadly into the future.  <\/p>  <p>  On the new national childcare scheme, I reiterate what I said earlier, that is, significant and substantial resources have been provided to childcare providers during the pandemic and that will continue.  Our aim is to provide for children in very disadvantaged settings and to provide good quality childcare for children in those environments.  That has been the commitment of the Minister and of the Government during the Covid-19 pandemic.  As we emerge from Covid-19 we want to establish a strong, supportive situation for childcare and for the early years sector.  The most important years in the development of any child are the formative development years when children learn an awful lot that is key to their development.  We will work on that.  <\/p>  <p>  On the wider issue of the EWSS and the supports we provide, from which companies like Aer Lingus have benefited significantly, last week we had a number of Deputies in the House saying that the Government was not providing supports to aviation or to the airlines.  The reality, of course, is that through EWSS and other supports Government has provided substantial supports to employers to keep employees working and to keep their companies viable so that when the reopening and the restart happen they will be in a position to retain that employment and to grow the numbers working in those companies into the future.  That is the raison d'&ecirc;tre of the supports that we have introduced for businesses.  Up to 315,000 workers are currently being supported by EWSS.  Many more have been supported over the last two years, but currently the number of workers being supported is 315,000.  More workers are being supported through the Covid restrictions support scheme and other schemes introduced by Government.  We will continue to do that.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to proposals from a particular private sector company, the Government has made clear to the companies it supports that it expects all agreements to be honoured.  There are industrial relations mechanisms in place to facilitate resolution of any issues that employees might have with their companies.  We have made a number of things clear to companies in that respect.  In terms of aviation, we want connectivity, including regional connectivity.  We want flights operating again from Shannon Airport.  We want to see the return of early flights to London, transatlantic flights and flights from Cork.  We believe in strong regional growth and development and we have made that clear to Aer Lingus and to the airlines, both in terms of employment creation and FDI.  Under the urban regeneration development funding, the Government provided over &euro;1.2 billion for locations across the length and breadth of the country to build up the regional cities and to build up towns.  We will continue to do that.  There has to be reciprocation from companies given the nature of State support in terms of maintaining good pay and conditions for workers and the broader economic goals and objectives of Government in respect of a balanced economic development across the regions.  We have made that clear in any engagement we have had with companies, not just in aviation, but in other sectors as well.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is examining the situation with regard to the possibility of landlords doubling up in respect of rent increases, which we do not want to see happening.  As we speak, that situation is being actively considered by the Minister.  We will do what we can to support tenants through the legislation already enacted to protect people from eviction, to protect tenants in terms of security of tenure, to build more houses and make them available for people across the length and breadth of the country, to make sure that councils can get housing projects through planning and passed so that the housing can be built because there has been too much delay in some councils and, in my view, too much negativity and too many projects gathering dust for far too long.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100020#U00400","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1622559900,"counter":218,"content":"<p>There are only four minutes remaining, which leaves little time for the next group of questions.

It is brought forward following the disturbing escalation in the lengths the Belarusian authorities are willing to go to repress those critical of Alexander Lukashenko's leadership.  By coercively forcing a Ryanair aircraft to divert to Minsk under false pretences, they displayed a willingness to endanger the lives of passengers to detain someone whose views the regime does not like.<\/p><p>Ireland reacted to this incident swiftly and firmly.  At a meeting of EU leaders last week, the Taoiseach clearly communicated Ireland's view that a strong EU response was needed.  That response is now being delivered.  EU airlines have been asked to avoid Belarusian airspace, work has commenced on banning Belarusian airlines from EU airspace and actions are being taken to impose sanctions on those responsible for this dangerous incident.  Our concern must be for the protection of our citizens and the safety of international aviation.<\/p><p>Alexander Lukashenko holds no democratic legitimacy.  The Belarusian people have made that clear through their ten months of protests since the fraudulent presidential election in August 2020.  Ireland and the EU have rejected the result of that election and Mr. Lukashenko's secretive so-called inauguration.  We have repeatedly called on the Belarusian authorities to engage in a meaningful national dialogue with the political opposition and civil society, make needed reforms to the electoral process, and hold fresh elections that are free, fair and independently monitored.<\/p><p>Mr. Lukashenko maintains de facto control by ruling through fear.  Since coming to power in 1994, he has sought to deny the Belarusian people free choice in their political representation.  No election in Belarus since that time has been free or fair.  Frustrated by his leadership, the Belarusian people very clearly expressed their desire for change in the run-up to the August 2020 presidential election.  In advance of that vote, Mr. Lukashenko imprisoned his main political challengers and cracked down on protesters and civil society.  However, he underestimated the strength of the desire for democratic change among the Belarusian people.  In doing so, he clearly demonstrated his inability to recognise the winds of change.<\/p><p>He dismissed the challenge posed by the courageous women who took charge of the democratic movement.  Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Veronika Tsepkalo and Maria Kalesnikava inspired a mass democratic movement both at home and abroad among the Belarusian diaspora.  Ms Tsikhanouskaya, in particular, led this movement despite the imprisonment of her husband and threats from the authorities to take her children away.  Notwithstanding the obvious popularity of her campaign, the Central Election Commission was complicit in delivering a falsified election result that gave Alexander Lukashenko roughly 80% of the vote.  International monitors were not given sufficient time to send an election observation mission.  Due to widespread irregularities in the voting process, including ballot rigging, we will never know the true result of the election.<\/p><p>Hundreds of thousands of peaceful protesters took to the streets immediately following the result.  Rather than engage with the protesters, Mr. Lukashenko chose to deploy massive state violence against them.  Ireland and the EU strongly condemned this violence.  We were appalled by the mass arbitrary detentions, including of children, unexplained disappearances and loss of life, reports of torture, curtailments on fundamental freedoms, Internet shutdowns and much more besides.  Ireland reacted to these events promptly and publicly.  At meetings of the UN Security Council and the Human Rights Council, I made clear Ireland's deep concerns regarding the repression of the Belarusian people.  Ireland has been vocal in calling for an end to the violence and repression and we have repeatedly called for the immediate and unconditional release of all those unjustly detained, including hundreds of political prisoners.  I commend the many Oireachtas Members and Irish MEPs who have highlighted the cases of persons imprisoned for their political views.  I share their concern for the welfare of those detained.<\/p><p>Mr. Lukashenko has all but criminalised freedom of expression in his country.  Even the most trivial forms of dissent carry heavy costs and lengthy sentences.  The Belarusian Association of Journalists recorded 477 detentions of journalists and media workers in 2020 alone.  There has been an increase in restrictions on media outlets over recent months, including the blocking of access to independent news websites.  Ireland has strongly condemned the repression of independent media and attacks on journalists, bloggers and media workers.  They play a critical role in documenting human rights violations and challenging disinformation and state propaganda.  Promoting and defending the right to freedom of expression, media freedom and the safety of journalists is at the core of UNESCO's mandate.  Ireland supports the EU's call for UNESCO to react to the deteriorating situation.  At the UN, Ireland has supported joint statements expressing deep concerns regarding the use of Internet shutdowns and the situation faced by journalists and media workers in Belarus.  The Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, also conveyed Ireland's views during a meeting of UN Security Council members in January.  Ireland is fully committed to the protection and promotion of the freedom of expression.<\/p><p>In that connection, I wish to express my deep concern for the welfare of Roman Protasevich.  The coercive forced landing of a Ryanair aircraft travelling between EU capitals to detain Mr. Protasevich was utterly unacceptable and my Department has made our strong views known to the Belarusian Embassy in London.  Mr. Protasevich now faces a severe penalty solely for expressing views the Lukashenko regime does not like.  His companion, Sofia Sapega, was also detained simply for her association with him.  I reiterate Ireland's call for their immediate and unconditional release.<\/p><p>We reject the transparently false narrative of the Belarusian authorities regarding the now widely discredited bomb threat on board the Ryanair aircraft.  Last week, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, called for an urgent investigation into the incident by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO.  I welcome its agreement to undertake such an investigation.  It is important that those responsible for this outrageous attack on EU aviation security be held to account.<\/p> <p> The Belarusian people have endured a long term of repression under the leadership of Alexander Lukashenko.  Ireland shares the concerns of UN rapporteurs.  There have been 2,000 reports of human rights violations, including allegations of torture involving rape and electrocution, women human rights defenders have been persecuted and human rights work has been effectively criminalised.  We regret that the Belarusian authorities continue to deny the special rapporteur for human rights in Belarus access to the country in her official capacity.  This is essential to establishing the facts on the ground.  Ireland will continue to support her mandate until she has had the opportunity to complete her work fully.<\/p> <p> We have all seen the harrowing images of injuries sustained by those who were unjustly detained in the aftermath of the election.  We have seen security forces beat peaceful protesters in broad daylight.  Tragically, we have also witnessed a number of deaths in custody, including a children's art teacher and, most recently, other activists.  Yet we have not seen investigations into these abuses by Belarusian authorities.  One of the guiding principles of Ireland's tenure at the UN Security Council is ensuring accountability.  We are committed to promoting the rule of law and the upholding of human rights.  Central to this commitment is the fight against impunity.  It is clear that impunity breeds violence.  That is why Ireland and the EU have repeatedly called for transparent and independent investigations.  To that end, Ireland played a constructive role in extending the mandate of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to investigate human rights violations in Belarus, including possible gender dimensions.  The High Commissioner has begun the work of operationalising that mandate by hiring a team of international human rights experts.  The NGO-led International Accountability Platform for Belarus and investigations conducted in EU member states under the principle of universal jurisdiction will complement the work of the high commissioner's team.  Ireland fully supports all these efforts to ensure that those responsible for human rights violations are made accountable for their actions.<\/p> <p> Ireland also supports the recommendations of the OSCE's expert investigator, Professor Wolfgang Benedek, in his Moscow mechanism report.  This report found human rights violations to be massive, systematic and proven beyond any doubt.  The detailed recommendations in his report establish actionable steps to bring Belarus into line with its OSCE and international commitments and obligations.  I again urge the Belarusian authorities to implement those recommendations promptly.<\/p> <p> Sanctions are also important for international accountability.  In Belarus, 88 individuals and seven commercial entities have been sanctioned.  Following the recent Ryanair incident, it is clear we need to go further.  The EU will bring additional sanctions against those responsible for what has happened and is actively considering what form additional economic sanctions may take.  Ireland welcomes the EU's robust response and that of our like-minded international partners.  Lukashenko assumed he could silence opposition and wait out international concern as he has done in the past.  The EU has been clear, however, that there cannot be a return to business as usual under his leadership.  His fear of democracy and the political will of the Belarusian people are very clear now.  He has now delayed national local elections until 2023 and has made no meaningful attempt to reach out to the opposition or civil society.  Rather than make good on his promise of constitutional change as a precursor of his retirement, it seems he has focused on ensuring his family's succession in the event of his death.  The rhetoric and actions emerging from Belarus have threatened the peace and security of the European neighbourhood.  Belarusians deserve to have their democratic voice heard in free and fair elections, and Ireland will remain steadfast in calling for those elections and in supporting actions to bring accountability to those who have deprived the Belarusian people of their rights.<\/p> <p> I commend this broad motion to the House and, as I said at the start, I hope it will get universal support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100021#V00200","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622561100,"counter":222,"content":"<p>I add my support and the support of my party, Sinn F&eacute;in, to the motion.  I can only condemn in the strongest terms the act of international piracy committed by Alexander Lukashenko in Belarus.  The hijacking of a civilian aircraft to facilitate the arrest of a journalist is an absolute disgrace.  I am glad that the international community is prepared to act to ensure that this act will not go unpunished.<\/p>  <p>  It may be argued that when the Belarusian President, Alexander Lukashenko, gave the order to hijack this plane he was targeting not simply a journalist and the journalist's girlfriend but also, in effect, the entire Belarusian opposition.  We have long associated performative violence with the counter-insurgency tactics of colonial powers from the 19th century onwards, be they French, British, Israeli or whatever else.  The impact of performative acts of violence is well known.  Most usually it is intended as a moral lesson to be visited upon the watching audience as much as the unfortunate victims.  It is a tried-and-tested method of colonial policing, the practice of which has been taken up by authoritarian regimes globally.  It is the practice of striking terror in the hearts and fear in the minds of men and women who would dare to lend their support to the opponents of an authoritarian regime.  In the hijacking of the Ryanair plane, Alexander Lukashenko was attempting to send a message to all who oppose his government that there is no place safe from his reach.  It was a blatant act of aggression intended to silence legitimate dissent to the undemocratic actions of the Lukashenko government.  It was a message intended to convey the strength, dominance and reach of Lukashenko.<\/p>  <p>  In that regard, I have been struck, from the commentary I have witnessed since the hijacking took place, by the impact the event has had on members of the Belarusian diaspora, including some who reside in this State, and this is totally unacceptable.  The Irish Government, along with its EU counterparts, needs to offer reassurance to the members of the Belarusian diaspora who feel threatened by the acts of President Lukashenko.  We have a duty to protect the physical and emotional security of all on this island, particularly those who would be threatened by this act of international aggression.  A failure to do so would act as a measure of success for President Lukashenko and his intention of silencing the democratic opposition of the Belarusian people.  Lukashenko has attempted to increase pressure on the Belarusian opposition living abroad through the targeting of family members at home in Belarus.  This includes an incident which saw the detention of the grandparents and the sister's husband of a foreign-based Belarusian journalist.  International measures designed to curtail Lukashenko need to be extended to offer protection to the families of his opponents who remain within his reach.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that the EU was able to reach a unanimous decision on the important issue of voting to put in place sanctions against the Lukashenko government.  I wish to express my disappointment, however, that some eastern European members of the EU that have led out on the calls for action against the Belarusian government, which I repeat I and my colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in support, have singularly failed to apply the same rigorous criteria to the human rights abuses of other administrations in other parts of the world.  All our actions and decisions and our entire outlook, both here in the D&aacute;il and in the EU, must be predicated on the rule of international law.  When nation states are found guilty of breaking international law, they must know they will face consequences commensurate with their crimes without fear or favour.  International law is not a pick-and-mix; it must be applied rigorously and fairly.<\/p> <p> It is disturbing that a number of states can refuse to support the application of the rule of international law against Israel for its flagrant abuses of international law and persecution of the Palestinian people.  We can speculate as to what their reasons are.  It is correct that the EU will vote to impose sanctions against Belarus, but it is shameful that the EU persists in its refusal to impose sanctions against another state that continues to act in violation of international law, one that stands accused of the crime of apartheid and, in recent weeks, has been responsible for the murder of hundreds of civilians, including dozens of children.  The D&aacute;il has shown that it is prepared to stand against this oppression, but our Government must take up the mantle set before it by the Irish people and demand at EU level an equivalence under international law for all states guilty of human rights abuses.  While I agree with everything the Minister said, I agree with one part in particular, namely, that impunity breeds violence.  A perceived impunity has allowed Israel to perpetrate grave human rights abuses.  As a country, we must stand up for the rule of law internationally.  It is incumbent on us to take a lead on measures, not just against Belarus for breaching international law, but against all countries that do so, and that must include Israel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100022#W00200","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622561700,"counter":224,"content":"<p>I am pleased to support the motion.  What happened last month was like something one would see in a Netflix movie - a Ryanair aeroplane taking off from one European capital, heading north towards another European capital, and being subjected to an effective hijacking by a leader styling himself on a dictator.  In reality, it was the news.  A plane full of Europeans and Americans flying from Athens in Greece to Vilnius in Lithuania got MiGed to Minsk and Lukashenko and his onboard gang of KGB thugs got their priority passenger - a young journalist who was gathering intelligence and exposing corruption, tyranny and brutality in Belarus - all on the pretext of a threat from Hamas when what was happening in Gaza was utterly disgusting.  The screenwriters and plotters had all their political bases covered.  Politically, it was brazen, reckless and audacious.  No doubt, it has given ideas to those of a similar disposition or inclination.<\/p><p>All of us with children who are in their 20s feel the fear and distress of Mr. Roman Protasevich's parents and the sickening worry of his partner, Ms Sofia Sapega's family as they consider the immunity of impunity and <i>vice versa<\/i>being established in that part of Europe.  This did not just happen on our doorstep, but on one of our budget airlines, Ryanair.  At 33,000 ft with a fighter jet escort and a state's lie about a terror threat on board, the people inside the aeroplane were trapped and vulnerable.<\/p><p>I have constituents from Belarus who now live in north Kildare.  They are worried about their country and families and are anxious about Lukashenko's grip on their homeland.  At the same time, they have fierce pride and fear for the Chernobyl child with the strong ties to Roscrea, County Tipperary, Ms Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who has taken the place of her husband after the opposition leader and pro-democracy campaigner was jailed before the elections, joining more than 400 other political prisoners in a country that still has the death penalty and where political detainees are regularly tortured.<\/p><p>I welcome the swift and necessary international political moves against Belarus.  Unfortunately, they stand in stark contrast to the international tardiness in similar necessary action against Israel for its breaking of international law in Palestine against the Palestinian people, including 66 dead Gazan children.  I urge the international community to look at Belarus and Israel with the same political zeal.  We cannot come down hard on those who break international law in one country while tiptoeing around those who break it in another.  It is the law itself and the breaking of that law that matters, not who breaks it.  It cannot be a case of all eyes on Lukashenko but a blind eye turned to Netanyahu.  If it is, we are excusing and complicit in the breaking of international law.  I urge the Minister to remember this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100023#X00200","speaker":"1585"},{"type":"speech","time":1622561700,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion.  I do not often agree with Michael O'Leary, but in anyone's language, the action by the Belarusian Government last month was state-sponsored piracy.  I send my solidarity to the people of Belarus, who are suffering under the Lukashenko regime.  In particular, I send my solidarity to Mr. Protasevich and his girlfriend, Ms Sapega.  It is clear that Mr. Protasevich's arrest was the object of the exercise.  It has been reported that there were several KGB agents on the flight.<\/p>  <p>  I commend the work of Belarusian exiles in applying pressure to companies like Rolls-Royce and British American Tobacco, which are seen as supporters of the regime.  They have also contacted holders of Belarusian bonds listed on the London Stock Exchange.  No company with any regard for human rights should have any relationship whatsoever with Belarus.<\/p>  <p>  We need a strong response from the EU.  This is a serious issue that requires a serious response.  Citizens of European countries were endangered by the actions of the Belarusian Government and there must be a commensurate response.

We supported publicly and in this House the sanctions taken by the EU against the Lukashenko regime's violent action against peaceful demonstrators.  What is probably the most oppressive regime in continental Europe is a cause of shame for us all.<\/p>  <p>  The forced landing of a Ryanair flight between two EU capitals and the arrest of two of its passengers - Mr. Protasevich, a democracy campaigner and journalist, and his partner, Ms Sapega - dramatically refocused our attention.  Apart from a general level of shock at such an outrageous act of state-sponsored hijacking of a European airline in European airspace, it is clear that the objective of this action was not only to remove a journalist and his travel companion, but to terrorise any citizen who is critical of Lukashenko and his oppressive regime.  The Belarusian authorities subsequently released two videos, one of Mr. Protasevich and the other of Ms Sapega, each allegedly confessing to crimes of organising illegal demonstrations against the regime or other criminal actions.<\/p> <p>Lukashenko has been in power for 26 years.  He is an authoritarian ruler who, before last year's elections, had one eye on what Russia was doing in the annexation of parts of Ukraine and made some outreach to the European Union.  Now, he plainly believes that he can take this action without significant consequences.  Following last year&rsquo;s fraudulent elections, the European Union declared those elections to be just that.  Lukashenko dismissed the sanctions that were imposed and obviously came to the conclusion that the EU itself, in response to his actions, was largely toothless.  He was emboldened, therefore, to feel that he could act to intercept a flight of EU citizens between Athens and Vilnius and to consider that that was fair game for him.<br\/><br\/>The motion before the House urges the European Union, Council and Commission to continue to monitor the situation.  Most people in this House strongly feel that we need to do much more than that.  A clearly petrified journalist was bundled off an internal European Union flight.  He and all of the passengers who boarded that plane in Athens were entitled to feel safe and that they would not be intercepted by a foreign nation and that the authority of the European Union itself would protect them.  I welcome the actions taken to date and the actions or own Government in convening a series of meetings.  We must be prepared to do more.<br\/><br\/>Specifically, we must harness whatever international pressure is necessary to free Roman Protasevich and the Sofia Sapega.  Those people are among hundreds of political prisoners, many of whom have been tortured, in Lukashenko&rsquo;s Belarus.  They entrusted their safety to the European Union.  They boarded a flight in a European capital <i>en route<\/i>to another in a European-registered aeroplane.  We must mount whatever diplomatic and economic pressure is required until they are both freed.<br\/><br\/>We also need to know if Russia was involved in any way in this illegal hijacking.  As well as expressing the outrage of the Irish Government and people to the Belarus Embassy in London, about which he told the House, I ask the Minister whether questions were also put to the Russian Ambassador here.  If so, what response was received?<br\/><br\/>We have seen in recent times a number of horrendous actions by state agents hijacking citizens who expressed opposition to their regimes.  We saw the brutal murder of an opponent of the Saudi leadership in a consulate building in Turkey.  This week we also saw the taking of a critic of the Turkish Government itself from the streets of Kenya.  These are outrageous acts and we need to act as an international community to ensure that they do not reoccur.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100023#X00400","speaker":"1620","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622562300,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I am moving back to the Government slot.

As we know, the plane was forced to land in Minsk under false pretences.  This has been correctly described as state-sponsored piracy.  The dispatch of a Belarusian fighter jet to the scene reinforces this view.  In this case, we had EU citizens travelling between two EU states on board an EU-registered airline.  Belarusian journalist and opposition activist Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend were taken off the plane, arrested and put into detention.  They have since been coerced into confessing to participation in illegal demonstrations.  These confessions have been made public and are yet another case of fundamental human rights being breached.  These series of events represent a serious threat to the security of EU citizens in so many ways and are a wake-up call for the EU and for all who believe in democracy.<\/p>  <p>  How has the EU reacted to these events?  As it happens, a meeting of the European Council was scheduled at the same time as this saga was unfolding.  This was certainly a test of the resolve of the European Union.  President Alexander Lukashenko is reported as saying that EU politicians do not have balls.  In response, the EU strongly condemned the hijacking.  It imposed sanctions on Belarus after the presidential elections last year and new sanctions have now been imposed on individuals, high-level officials, and businesses in Belarus that are supportive of the regime.  That is the right approach.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, EU airlines were advised not to fly over Belarus and a ban was imposed on Belarusian airlines flying into EU airspace.  Again, that was right thing to do.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, the International Transport Forum has requested that an official investigation be carried out by the UN&rsquo;s International Civil Aviation Organization and I know that the Minister, Deputy Ryan, was very supportive of that.<\/p>  <p>  The primary demand at this stage must be for Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend to be released immediately.  The United States will also join the EU in imposing sanctions on Belarus and this is also to be welcomed.<\/p>  <p>  What is the situation generally in Belarus at this time?  By any standards, Alexander Lukashenko is an authoritarian ruler presiding over a dangerous regime.  The election committee in Belarus gave Lukashenko 80% of the vote in the presidential election last year, when independent observers estimate that the actual vote that he got was nearer 25% to 30%.  The election was therefore rigged.  Subsequently, protests were brutally suppressed.  Some 35,000 people were arrested.  Prisoners were beaten, tortured and even raped in prison.  Some candidates were imprisoned while others fled the country.  Ireland must continue to raise its concerns at the EU and the UN about these ongoing human rights abuses in Belarus.<\/p>  <p>  The daily harassment and intimidation of civil society, journalists and the independent media with unjust detentions and attempts to criminalise human rights are commonplace.  We should also ensure that this is on the top of the agenda of the Human Rights Council in Geneva.  These practices on the doorstep of the EU are totally unacceptable and must be called out and highlighted by Ireland at every available opportunity.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the situation generally in Belarus, the EU rightly took a strong stand following the presidential election last year.  Belarus is bordered by Russia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and the Ukraine.  Given that it is generally supported by Russia, Belarus is a threat to international security.  The EU, as a champion of democratic values, has also offered a &euro;3 billion package to Belarus if it transitions to democracy.  Again, this proposed practical assistance is the right thing to do.  The EU, including Ireland, is not neutral when it comes to the rule of law and the protection of freedom and democracy.  We must, therefore, keep Belarus high on the international agenda.  I met some Belarusians outside of Leinster House a short time ago and their fear is that their country will fall down the political agenda in a couple of weeks' time.<\/p>  <p>  I want to tell the House about Vitold Ashurak who died in a Belarusian prison last month on 21 May.<\/p> <p>He was a political prisoner, an opposition activist sentenced last year at a closed trial to five years for public order offences.  Aged 50, he was also an environmentalist.  According to official reports, he died of cardiac failure.  When his body was returned to his family, however, his head was entirely covered with bandages.  The circumstances of his death are, to say the least, very suspicious and must be thoroughly and independently investigated but, unfortunately, I doubt very much that will be facilitated.  I had adopted Vitold Ashurak as a political prisoner at the request of an NGO known as Libereco.  Other Deputies, Senators and Irish MEPs have also adopted political prisoners in Belarus, and I encourage more to do so.  Ireland and the EU must press home strongly the demand for the immediate release of all political prisoners currently in Belarusian prisons.  Their only crime was standing up for democracy and fundamental human rights in their country.<\/p> <p> Of course, the elephant in the room in this debate is Russia.  Russia must be clearly seen as a threat to our security at this time and it has form in this regard.  In 2008, Russia invaded Georgia, while in 2014, it invaded Crimea in the Ukraine.  It has recently announced plans to beef up its military operations in its western region.  The opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, was poisoned and imprisoned.<\/p> <p> It is clear Russia engages in cyberwarfare throughout the globe.  Incidentally, the Russian ambassador to Ireland was quoted in a Sunday newspaper as stating that Russia had no links to the hackers of the HSE ICT system.  The least Russia can do is to ensure the criminals in its country are prevented from engaging in this activity.  In 2018, there was the novichok nerve agent attack in Salisbury, England.  Election interference and cyberespionage by Russia is well-documented and its meddling in the 2020 US presidential election is also no secret.  In 2014, Russian military intelligence was linked to a blast at a warehouse containing 58 tonnes of ammunition in the Czech Republic.<\/p> <p> As regards the recent aeroplane hijacking, the Ryanair boss, Michael O'Leary, has stated that KGB agents were on board.  Russia retaliated in respect of the EU flight ban by banning flights into Moscow, and within days, President Lukashenko was very publicly photographed with Vladimir Putin.  It has been reported that Russia will soon send Belarus the next $500 million tranche of the $1.5 billion in agreed loans.<\/p> <p> We can draw our own conclusions from all of this.  It is clear that Russia wants to present itself as a major global power once again and its aim is to destabilise the EU.  We need to wise up to all this.  From what I can see, the US intends to do so in any event.  The US President, Joe Biden, has stated that he will raise abuses of human rights with President Putin when he meets him in Geneva this month.  President Biden has spoken about democracy being under threat in the US and globally, and again we all need to appreciate this.<\/p> <p> This brings me to the issue of growing authoritarianism throughout the globe, and in particular within the EU.  Of course, I have Hungary and Poland in mind in this context.  Gradually, democratic norms are being eroded in some EU states and that is a worry.  Let us hope this is just a temporary phenomenon.  Press freedom, an independent judiciary, academic freedom, tolerance of minorities, checks and balances and the right to protest are all basic democratic norms, yet the EU does not seem to have the tools for monitoring and sanctioning non-compliance.  While there are Article 7 and other mechanisms, there is a weakness as regards qualified majority voting when it comes to European Council meetings for some reason, to take one example.  The EU is divided between those who wish to punish offenders and those who think they should be encouraged to stay within the tent, so to speak.  On the EU recovery fund being contingent on rule of law adherence, for example, a fudge was eventually agreed, and it remains to be seen what will happen in the end in that regard.<\/p> <p> Democracy is a fragile form of government and it is under threat from creeping authoritarianism.  Democracies do not automatically self-renew.  We must be conscious of this before it is too late and we cannot take our democracy for granted.  I will support the motion.  As other Deputies said, perhaps we should do a bit more than what is contained therein, but this debate is most welcome and timely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100024#Y00300","speaker":"1552","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622562900,"counter":231,"content":"<p>An aeroplane travelling between Athens and Vilnius was diverted with the threat of a bomb, with a MiG-29 becoming part of the operation and with the return of terminology related to the KGB.  It is like something out of a bad film.  It is \"Die Hard\" without John McClane.  The problem is there was no hero and a crime was without doubt committed.  It was international piracy and state-sponsored hijacking.  There have been many headlines in recent years that we would not have anticipated, but we would never have predicted this.<\/p>  <p>  I assume that on some level, people in Belarus would say, \"No shock here\".  We are talking about Alexander Lukashenko.  To put it mildly, we look at that state and know that \"democratic deficit\" is the nicest way one could talk about it.  There have been significant human rights abuses and considerable knocks to democracy, and the people who live there do so under severe pressure.  Moreover, this is big-boy politics, big-boy play.  This is an attempt to show how powerful Lukashenko is.  This is a lesson to his enemies, at home and abroad, that he can do business and get them anywhere.  We really need to take action.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome what we are doing in this debate, with full support in the House for the motion, and what the EU has done, managing to get unanimity and sanctions.  I also welcome the fact that the US is going to follow through with sanctions, because that is all very necessary.  This crime was committed so that Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, could be detained.  It is difficult to believe this happened in the modern world, but sometimes people get into positions of power and do not see any restraints or controls.  We can get a result only through sanctions, putting pressure on them and ensuring that the world knows and that they are made to feel that theirs is a pariah state.  That is what needs to happen here.  We need to follow through on this and that is necessary.<\/p>  <p>  We know there are internal issues in the EU.  Other Deputies have spoken about its rule of law difficulties, particularly in regard to Hungary and Poland, and they need to be dealt with.  The wider issue of Catalonian elected representatives facing sanctions they should not face is utterly wrong as well.  Furthermore, it would be remiss of me not to mention the historic motion that my colleague, Deputy Brady, recently tabled.  We secured agreement to call out the reality of the Israeli annexation and stealing of Palestinian lands.  It was brilliant, effective and necessary that we got that work done in the House last week, but that will matter only if we bring it to another place, namely, back to the EU and the international community.<\/p> <p>It should be the case that we stand up for rights, human rights and for people&rsquo;s rights across the world and ensure international criminality, human rights abuses and slaughter is called out.  We should demand international law and deal with international criminals.  We support full sanctions in relation to this utterly international criminal act by the Lukashenko regime.  However, we also call for others to be dealt with in the same way.  Whether than can be achieved throughout the European Union, I doubt it very much.  Ireland, along with many other countries that are willing to sign up to the reality of breaches of international law by the Israelis, must put pressure on them and other rule breakers, other international criminals, and to demand the rights of people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100025#Z00200","speaker":"1498","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622563500,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I never thought I would have to stand in our Parliament and describe a scene where Ryanair, an Irish airline, was effectively forced to perform a rendition flight between two European Union member countries, Greece and Lithuania.  A rendition flight was performed on the order of the Belarusian, Alexander Lukashenko.  It is an unprecedented outrage.  I cannot begin to imagine the terror  on that flight, the terror of EU citizens being told that a bomb had been placed onboard.  As confusion reigned, a journalist became aware that the flight was being redirected, not to the closet airport in Lithuania, but to Belarus from where he had fled, having sought sanctuary in the European Union.  I cannot imagine the terror experienced by the journalist at that moment or the further terror experienced by those onboard as a fighter plane appeared, under the auspices of giving guidance to the airliner.<\/p>  <p>  It has been called international piracy and a state-sponsored hijacking.  I would add that it was state-sponsored terrorism.  Terrorism has many forms.  One aspect is to send a message of terror not just to the victims, in this case the journalist Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, but to anyone who would oppose the rule of Alexander Lukashenko.  There is another aspect.  It was a hijacking, international piracy and state-sponsored terrorism, but it was also a kidnapping.  The kidnapping part cannot be lost in this.  The most important thing now is the safe return of Roman Protasevich and Sofia Sapega, who is a student.  That is of paramount importance.  In addition to welcoming this motion, I welcome the immediate statement from our Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, in the hours following it calling for their release.  That cannot be lost in the outrage and shock of what happened.<\/p>  <p>  Protasevich was dangerous to the Belarusian regime because of his reporting.  He was dangerous because he reported on what was happening in Belarus.  The media organisation for which Protasevich works has a telegram channel with more than 1.2 million subscribers, which is a notable figure.  It is a huge audience in Belarus, that is, 1.2 million subscribing to Protasevich&rsquo;s telegram channel, considering it has a population of just 9.5 million people.  It shows how desperate the depths are to which autocratic leaders will sink to in order to silence the free press.  It underscores the importance of a free press in democratic societies.<\/p>  <p>  It must be said that the EU has failed to act with sufficient strength against Lukashenko and, in particular, against his cronies.  The sanctions introduced last year and in February have clearly been ineffective.  They were ineffective because they did not target the correct people.  It is welcome that the Minister spoke about further sanctions and suggested there would be discussions on what they would consist of.  It is not unknown that Lukashenko surrounds himself with oligarchs who have made their vast fortunes from petrol and fertiliser.  If the EU really wants to target Lukashenko and his allies, it should go after the petrol and fertiliser oligarchs.  Sanction them and make them pariahs.  Then we will see the rats scuttling from the ship of Lukashenko.<\/p>  <p>  This is a genuine test of EU foreign policy.  It is also a test of the EU&rsquo;s policy not just outside our borders, but within our borders.  People like Lukashenko have been empowered by the fact that other regimes in the European Union have acted in a way that was detrimental to our values and to the rights of citizens in the European Union.  If we are to truly confront Lukashenko, we must get the house of the European Union in order.  It has been stated, and I will repeat it, that the rule of law should apply in all circumstances.  Lukashenko cannot become a convenient enemy where we say he is terrible and cover our eyes to everything else.  Every day in Hungary and Poland, for example, migrant and minority communities are persecuted.  That must be confronted.  We should not tolerate that and we should never equivocate when the Orb&aacute;n Government and the Polish Government tries to suppress our values and tell us that we cannot include certain amendments to enhance women&rsquo;s rights and minorities.  When Poland enacted LGBT safe zones, we should have been visceral in our response, called for sanctions and should have done anything we could have done to ensure it did not take place.<\/p>  <p>  A point I made last week when this was discussed, and I will make it again today, is that Lukashenko behaved in a manner that was truly appalling in terms of attacking the free press.  It is welcome that the Government was quick to bring this motion to the House and it is one which I will fully support, but we cannot cover our eyes to how slow we have been to respond to the situation in the Middle East, in particular Israel&rsquo;s conduct.  Only a few weeks ago, Israel blew up a building that housed the offices of Al Jazeera and the Associated Press.  That cannot be forgotten.  If we are to stand in opposition to attacks on free press over the skies of Belarus, we must also stand in total opposition to it wherever it happens in the world.  The Government of Netanyahu blew up a building that housed the offices of Al Jazeera and the Associated Press.  I do not think we can ever unsee that.  I support the Government motion today, but I ask that we are not blind to where these injustices and autocratic despots operate elsewhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100026#AA00200","speaker":"1560"},{"type":"speech","time":1622563500,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this debate and, of course, I wholeheartedly support this extremely important motion.  Before I talk to the topic at hand, I want to state that this motion replaced statements on the post-European Council on the schedule.  I have asked my party&rsquo;s representative on the Business Committee that that be on a future schedule of the D&aacute;il because it is a requirement under the Lisbon treaty, in terms of subsidiarity, that our national Parliament receives a report on the European Council.  That is vitally important.  While Belarus was front and centre of the Council, it was not the only issue and there was much more to discuss.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, focused on in detail.<\/p>  <p>  I am grateful to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, for his detailed intervention and the strength of this motion.  It really is very strong and important.  I want to commend the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, on his tireless efforts on this issue.  Throughout his time as the Minister of State, he has gone above and beyond in terms of phone calls, meetings and corralling support within European Union member states for what was an important decision by the European Council last week.  I will not lie.  I was sceptical that the response from the European Council might have been slightly disappointing, given the nature of other governments' approach to dealing with Belarus and Russia.  To have unanimous support for what is easily the strongest set of sanctions on and condemnation of Belarus coming from the European Council is vitally important, and is a huge testament to the Taoiseach, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, and their tireless work with European colleagues.  I am struck and disappointed that it has taken an act of international terrorism to unite the EU to do something genuinely forcible in relation to the situation in Belarus.<\/p> <p>The fact an Irish-owned airliner was forced to land in Belarus so Roman Protasevich could be dragged off the plane by KGB agents with his girlfriend and now languishes in a Belarusian jail potentially facing the death penalty is the most bizarre and scary situation.  That is what it took for every one of the 27 member states of the European Union to finally stand up and offer genuine condemnation and sanction for the totalitarian regime in Belarus which many of us have spoken about and raised via parliamentary questions and other post and pre-European Council statements in this Chamber for some time.  It is nothing new.  We are dealing with a brutal dictatorship that is a puppet of the Russian Government.  We have to be firm, not just in this Parliament in the EU member state furthest from Belarus, but across the European Union. <\/p> <p>Roman Protasevich is one of at least 421 political prisoners languishing in a Belarusian jail.  I am fortunate, like many Members of this House, to have been asked by Libereco to adopt one political prisoner, Tatsiana Yakelchyk.  She sits in a Belarusian prison since November.  She was a 20-something-year-old student going about her business and concerned about the future of her country.  She was arrested in the middle of the night and taken from her apartment.  Her mobile phone, laptop and iPad were seized.  Now she stands on trial in a collective trial.  It is an absolute show trial and she will be found guilty.  Lord knows what the regime will do to her and many others.<\/p> <p> This has been going on for a long time and it is not good enough that we allow certain member states in the EU to block meaningful action.  While the sanctions agreed by the European Council were extremely welcome and this motion put down by the Government is particularly welcome and strong, it is still not enough.  We need to look at what other member states, former member states and non-member states of the European Union have done to provide a meaningful response to what is going on in Belarus and the Belarusian regime's attack on European sovereignty by forcing a European-owned and EU-registered airline travelling between two EU capital cities and full of EU citizens to be brought down in the manner it was, with a fighter plane and an illegal bomb threat.<\/p> <p> We have to call for the EU to make a full audit of every business based in the EU, including Ireland, which has connections or is active in Belarus.  Such an audit has been called for in the house in Westminster.  We have to make it clear that doing business with the regime in Belarus is unacceptable.  It cannot be stood for and we cannot allow the citizens of Belarus and of the EU to be put at risk for economic gain or otherwise.  I call on the Minister to make that meaningful charge at the next meeting of the General Affairs Council.<\/p> <p> I am struck by the universal tone of the debate here.  I have not heard anyone say they will speak or vote against this motion, which is refreshing.  Hopefully we will have more of this in the future.  This is a pretty black and white issue.  There is no grey area.  We have to look at what we as a country can do meaningfully and how we can separate the authoritarian, totalitarian dictatorship, the regime and the cronies that surround President Lukashenko from the innocent people in Belarus who are suffering.  Ireland has strong ties to Belarus.  I am thinking of the work done over the years by Adi Roche and former Deputy Noel Coonan, who worked with children from Belarus affected by the fall-out from the Chernobyl disaster and other things to bring them to Ireland.  We are struck by that tie and that relationship.<\/p> <p> Something we can do is follow the example of what the UK did with Hong Kong.  The Government can offer Irish visas immediately to any non-regime individual with the ability, opportunity and fortune to escape Belarus to allow them to work and travel and give them the security of being in the European Union.  That is in our gift and is a sensible, generous measure.  It is something we can do as a small EU member state to prove to the people of Belarus that we are on their side and that, when we criticise Belarus, we criticise the murderous regime of President Lukashenko, not the innocent people who have to live under that barbaric regime.<\/p> <p> Beyond that, we have to put pressure on the sporting organisations.  There is not a rich history of ice hockey in this country but the fact the ice hockey under-19 championships are due to take place in Belarus in the coming months needs to be raised.  We need to put pressure on EU member states with active ice hockey teams and ask them not to send those teams into this despotic regime to play and offer tacit agreement to what the regime is doing.  It extends, more importantly, to football.  There are many matches and tournaments in Belarus in the coming months and years.  We need to take a stand as a Government and as the European Union. <\/p> <p> We have to remember this regime denied Covid existed.  It did not bring in any restrictions, forced its people to continue to work, allowed the Belarusian football league to continue as the virus ran like wildfire.  What is behind this regime?  Of serious concern to the entire European Union is the tacit and not-so-tacit support the regime receives from the Russian Federation.  This is increasingly concerning and we have to be more outspoken in this Chamber and at a European Union level about the influence of the Russian Government directly and other sinister forces surrounding that Government, within the European Union and in our neighbourhood.  They are supporting and propping up this regime.<\/p> <p> At the weekend, we saw a lovely cuddle between Vladimir Putin and President Lukashenko.  We saw the desperate dictator going to Moscow to receive affirmation and the guarantee of protection, funding and much else.  It is pathetic, but that is what we face.  We see the influence Russia has had in the affairs of Ukraine.  We see the scandalous acts in the United Kingdom in the city of Salisbury and the brazen attempts by Russian elements, government or non-government, to influence elections across the European Union.<\/p> <p> This State expelled Russian diplomats only a couple of years ago in response to the vicious state-sponsored murder in Salisbury.  We need to be clear that within the European Union we will not tolerate these attempts to undermine our democratic institutions, our domestic security and the viability of this country to act without fear of influence and malevolent forces.  Many regimes across the former Soviet bloc are prepared to tolerate and protect the sort of criminal gangs that were responsible for the vicious cyberattack that befell the HSE in recent weeks.<\/p> <p> We are not talking about the situation in Belarus in isolation.  We are talking about the geopolitical stability of the entire region and the need for Ireland as a member of the European Union and the UN Security Council not just to put down a motion like this, though it is extremely welcome, and have a selection of strong speeches, but also to play our part on the global stage continuously.  The 400-odd prisoners in Belarusian jails will still be there in a couple of weeks&rsquo; time and the people who live in Belarus will still be suffering.  We cannot let this debate be a one-time effort.<\/p> <p> I appeal to the Minister to make sure that this motion is binding and lasting and that everything done at an EU level by any Minister of this Government continues to push the case for the ordinary people of Belarus and underlines the concern all of us have for security and stability across the European Union and how that is reflected by the dictatorship in Belarus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100026#AA00300","speaker":"1473","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622564100,"counter":236,"content":"<p>T&aacute; m&eacute; ag roinnt mo chuid ama le mo chomhghleaca&iacute;, an Teachta Andrews.  Ireland was drawn into what happened in Belarus by the nature of the arrest of Roman Protasevich.  The fact that a Ryanair aeroplane - and therefore, in many senses, an Irish aeroplane - was forced into an emergency landing, which brought increased dangers for all the 130 passengers on board, made the Government's intervention expected and necessary.  The Government has been strong on this, demanding answers from the Belarusian Government in relation to this emergency landing.  There has been clear shock from the Irish people that this has happened and that one of our aeroplanes was forced into an emergency landing.<\/p> <p>The answer that has been received so far that there were fears there was a bomb on board the same aeroplane that carried Roman Protasevich certainly seems a lot more than a coincidence.  The concern internationally regarding freedom of the press has been quite resounding and the action by the EU, through the imposition of sanctions, has been very swift.  It is deeply unfortunate that the same swift action in terms of the immediate imposition of sanctions with regard to the freedom of the press was not taken by the EU in the targeting of media outlets by the Israeli air force in Gaza two weeks ago.  We must be clear that we tolerate no attacks on the media, no matter where they are.  Outrage and swift action should not simply be confined to attacks on the media.  The killing of civilians, including many children, in Gaza should have been sufficient reason for the international community to act swiftly on Israel's apartheid regime.<\/p> <p> The Minister for Foreign Affairs met recently with the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, and National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, about the situation in Belarus.  I note that both were unequivocal in their outrage regarding same.  While the US does not have a direct say about what will happen to Roman Protasevich, it does have a direct say on another journalist who is being held captive, namely, Julian Assange.  He is someone I have raised in this Chamber on several occasions.  I hope the Minister used this opportunity to raise his case and call for his immediate release, as it would be utterly hypocritical not to do so when raising the case of another journalist, Roman Protasevich.  Julian Assange is facing charges for spreading information in a normal journalistic way and the silence on this from the international community has been deafening, as has been the silence of the very newspapers that published the information he gathered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100027#BB00200","speaker":"1579","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622564700,"counter":238,"content":"<p>The forced landing of Ryanair flight FR 4978, an Irish airline, put Ireland centre stage of an international incident.

The Government, along with the rest of the EU, was fast and decisive in the approach to dealing with the forced landing and the arrest of the journalist, an outspoken critic of the Belarusian Government.<\/p>  <p>  Freedom of the press and of political expression must be defended and upheld.  This international incident has rightly called into question the role of the EU and the international community in defending the freedom of the press and political expression.  Ireland's voice must be loud and clear in defending these values.  We cannot allow trade deals to buy silence and inaction when these values are targeted by various governments.  However, the strong, decisive and swift response towards Belarus with the imposition of sanctions highlights a certain double standard when it comes to defending these values.  Where were the sanctions against the apartheid state of Israel, following the targeted bombing of several press and media outlets in Gaza last month by Israeli war planes?  Al Jazeera's buildings were levelled.  Where was the strong, decisive action when Israel's apartheid security forces physically assaulted and detained journalists who were covering the protests in occupied Palestine?

It is very clear, despite the attempted obfuscation by the regime, that that is precisely what took place.  These are the actions of a desperate dictator.  Lukashenko has been in power for 27 years.  They are actions that People Before Profit absolutely condemns.  Lukashenko is a man who is under pressure from a mass movement from below to end his rule.  He thinks he can get away with these kind of actions in pursuit of his dictatorial agenda of repression.  We should raise our voices to demand that all political prisoners be immediately released.  The actions of Lukashenko in targeting Roman Protasevich are aimed not just at him and his partner or the right-wing opposition in Belarus, of which they are probably a part, but also at the wider opposition movement, including the hundreds of thousands of workers who engage in general strike action against Lukashenko.<\/p>  <p>  The immediate history to the current situation in Belarus is the supposed elections in August of last year, where Lukashenko claimed and was widely ridiculed for it to have won more than 80% of the vote.  That provoked mass protests and mass movements from below from workers who were opposed to the robbing of an election, the repressive policies of the regime within Belarus and the agenda of privatisation that is being implemented within Belarus.  The response by the regime to those protests has been one of repression.  More than 30,000 activists have been arrested.  Many people have been forced to leave the country and there have been widespread police and intelligence agency brutality against protesters, causing significant injuries.  This is a horrendous regime and, although we as socialists have political differences with Roman Protasevich, we defend his right to fly and not have his flight downed by the Belarusian regime or not to be jailed for his political views.  We support the movement against Lukashenko.  We call for the privatisation programmes to be stopped and for the Lukashenko regime to be overthrown and a system based on a workers' democracy to be put in place.<\/p>  <p>  One point I would make to the movement in Belarus, if people happen to be watching, is to be careful not to be allowed to be used by the forces of western imperialism.  They have no interest in the actual democratic rights of the ordinary people in Belarus or the economic living standards of working-class people and are looking to engage in a new cold war between western imperialism and Russian imperialism, neither side of which represents the interests of ordinary working-class people anywhere in the world.<\/p>  <p>  That brings me to the final point I want to make, which is the hypocrisy that is present in the righteous condemnation - a correct condemnation - of the actions of the Lukashenko regime.  Nobody is asking the question of where Lukashenko got the idea that he could down a flight.  Could the Government answer that question?  Is it a coincidence that the Austrian Government downed a flight in an act of international piracy, just the same as the Lukashenko regime?  In that case it involved the elected Head of State of Bolivia, Evo Morales, because it thought that Edward Snowden was on board.  It is an incredibly similar action of international piracy with no condemnation by the EU or the Government.  Instead of offering asylum to the likes of Edward Snowden or Julian Assange, who has been mentioned, the Government bows its head and only lifts a finger against Russia or states seen to be aligned to it whenever the major powers in Europe and the US tell it to.  That is because the Government is subservient to the interests of US and western imperialism and is completely unwilling to take a principled, moral and political stand against the actions taken by those governments and those states that are allied to them.  It is a Government that lets a foreign military power, the United States, use our infrastructure on its way to carry out its global campaign of war and terror.<\/p> <p> The point about double standards applies.  Again, to be clear, this is not whataboutery because I am 100% on record, and have been for years, in opposition to the Lukashenko regime.  In the European Parliament, I spoke out about the Lukashenko regime and I support a revolution against Lukashenko.  However, I ask why a Government that, correctly, is able to condemn those attacks on democratic rights, those repressive actions, is not willing to do it when it comes to the likes of the US Government?  We made the point in the House about the US Government brutally oppressing indigenous people at Standing Rock.  We called on the then Fine Gael Government to take action, to refuse to provide legitimacy to that regime and to show clear and unconditional support for the indigenous people, but it did not.  The same happened in terms of the Black Lives Matter Movement, when we had police repression on the streets of the US, injuring thousands, in that we called for a statement of opposition and to expel the US ambassador.  We look at what is taking place in Guantanamo Bay.  The US has more than its fair share of political prisoners yet this Government would not be caught dead taking a stand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100028#CC00300","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622565300,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Brendan Griffin, who is sharing time with Deputy Cormac Devlin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100029#DD00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1622565300,"counter":242,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion.

As I was coming into Leinster House earlier today, I paused briefly to speak to some of the demonstrators who had gathered outside the gates in solidarity with the people of Belarus.  The thought struck me, as I informed one of the protesters that I would be speaking on the motion this evening in solidarity with them, that, in their own country, those people could not do that.  Thankfully, in our country, in our democracy, we can do that freely and safely without the risk of being imprisoned like the hundreds of political prisoners in Belarus at the moment.<\/p>  <p>  On the doorstep of the European Union in recent times, we have witnessed appalling abuses of fundamental human rights, whether it is from the regime in Israel most recently, as they shamed itself in front of the world, in Turkey or, of course, in Belarus.  I concur with the very strong condemnation that has been expressed by Members on all sides of the House in regard to what has been happening in Belarus.  When we think about this, it is just over a two and a half hour drive from one of our EU capitals to Minsk but, really, it is like driving into a different world, a far darker world, a far more dangerous world and a repressed world, right on the doorstep of the European Union.  How we act now and into the future will be critical in regard to the stability of that entire region, and the safety and security of the European Union as well.<\/p>  <p>  I want to express my solidarity with Roman Protasevich, Sofia Sapega and all of the aforementioned prisoners in Belarus.  I am calling for their immediate release and for fair and free elections to take place in Belarus.  I concur with the entire wording of the very strong motion that is before the House.  I echo the words of Deputy Neale Richmond in regard to ensuring that we go further and that we fully utilise our position on the UN Security Council to ensure there is a strong global response and strong global action against this tyrannical regime in Belarus.  We have to give full consideration to the call by Deputy Richmond in regard to making Ireland a safe place for those repressed activists in Belarus to come to.  We have to follow our words with strong actions.  Deputy Richmond's proposal this evening is a very solid one and one that should be given strong consideration by the Government and enacted, if possible.<\/p>  <p>  What happened in regard to Ryanair flight FR4978 was an affront to the European Union and to all of our freedoms.  As an Irishman, given it was an Irish airline, I feel it was an affront to our country as well.  We cannot allow that to happen again.  We must ensure there is severe punishment for what happened.  The danger of normalising this and allowing it to happen again is that it would have far-reaching consequences.  I hope this was the final straw, that bridge too far.  It was total brazenness by the regime in Belarus.  I hope it will now also be the catalyst for a change of regime in Belarus.  It is simply not acceptable and it can never be acceptable.  As I said, it puts all of our freedoms at risk when this type of thing happens.<\/p>  <p>  The work of Libereco has been mentioned.  I have signed up to be a godparent for one of the imprisoned activists in Belarus and I would encourage all parliamentarians in this country to do likewise.  I commend Deputy Richmond on his proactive work in that regard and the other Irish parliamentarians, here and in the European Parliament, who have done so as well.  It is very important that we would show solidarity with people who are defending what is right, defending democracy, defending what we hold so dear and what we value as a country and as a people.  It is right that we, as the fairly elected representatives of our people, send a very strong message across Europe and across the world in solidarity with people who are incarcerated for defending that very right.  It is not acceptable and it is never acceptable.<\/p>  <p>  When we look at the world in recent years, when we look across the Atlantic, when we look at the devaluation of democracy that we saw in particular during the Trump Administration, that goes some way to explaining how there can be a devaluation of democracy in far more questionable regimes.  That is the thin end of the wedge, unfortunately, and it has played a part in where we are at today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100029#DD00300","speaker":"1581"},{"type":"speech","time":1622565300,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, for bringing this robust motion before us.  As many speakers said, the interference with Ryanair flight FR4978 by the Belarusian regime on Sunday, 23 May, was extremely worrying and frightening, especially for those on board.  This Ryanair flight was operating between two EU capital cities, Athens and Vilnius, and was carrying more than 170 passengers, including many EU citizens, and six crew, when it was forced to land in Minsk by the military forces of the Belarusian regime.  What would have happened if the flight had not co-operated with those instructions?  As we know, it was escorted in the air, which is extremely worrying.<\/p>  <p>  The illegal removal and detention of Roman Protasevich and his companion, Sofia Sapega, was a breach of all international norms and a gross violation of their human rights.  This act of international piracy, committed by Alexander Lukashenko and his regime, was outrageous and cannot go unanswered.  The brutality of the Lukashenko regime, now in its fifth term, is unprecedented and cannot be tolerated.  The EU must respond firmly to this despicable crime and the ongoing repression and silencing of the opposition in Belarus.  Roman Protasevich and Sofia Sapega must be released immediately.  I will be continually asking through monthly parliamentary questions about their well-being until they are released.<\/p>  <p>  Sadly, every day, we continue to see the regular harassment and intimidation of Belarusian civil society, journalists and independent media, with unjust detentions and apparent attempts to criminalise human rights work.  The repression of the Belarusian people, who are peacefully and courageously defending their democratic and human rights, is totally unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  As we heard from my Fianna F&aacute;il colleague, Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey, the 2020 Belarusian election was rigged, with Lukashenko receiving less than 25% of the popular vote.  Fianna F&aacute;il rejects the democratic and moral legitimacy of the Lukashenko regime and supports the Belarusian people in their demand for new and free elections, under the supervision of independent observers.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the European Council&rsquo;s strong condemnation of the hijacking of the Ryanair flight and the detention of Roman Protasevich and Sofia Sapega.  The move to restrict EU flights from Belarusian airspace is welcome, as are plans to increase economic and political sanctions on the leaders of the Lukashenko regime.<\/p>  <p>  I call on the Minister to raise the hijacking of Ryanair flight FR4978 and the other crimes of the Belarusian regime at the UN Security Council.  There are currently 421 political prisoners in Belarus.  I support the Government&rsquo;s motion calling for the immediate release of Roman Protasevich, Sofia Sapega and all those unjustly detained in Belarus.  It states that the D&aacute;il rejects the democratic legitimacy of Alexander Lukashenko following the fraudulent 9 August 2020 elections, and that Ireland stands in solidarity with the Belarusian people in their peaceful defence of democratic principles and fundamental human rights.<\/p> <p>As we heard earlier, people are protesting peacefully outside the D&aacute;il today, not only trying to raise the plight of Roman Protasevich and Sofia Sapega but of all those who have been impacted since the regime took hold.  It is important, as we have heard unanimously across the House, that people stand in solidarity today.  It underscores the seriousness of what took place a few days ago.  It is really important that the Government is able to speak with one voice on behalf of the people of Ireland to articulate our concerns and that of our European counterparts that this should not and will not be tolerated and that we stand in solidarity with the Belarusian people.

Hijacking and piracy have no place in today's society regardless of who may be on board or their political persuasion.  This was an Irish-operated flight with innocent passengers and flight staff on board.  The grounding of this plane by this repressive regime is wrong and caused great fear, endangering innocent passengers and staff alike.<\/p>  <p>  The attacks on those who oppose this anti-democratic regime must end and those who carry out these attacks on their behalf must be held accountable.  There has been international condemnation of these actions from the United States and the EU, which is right and proper, but we also need to acknowledge the selective non-condemnation of similar events.  For instance, in 2013, a French plane with the Bolivian president Evo Morales was grounded on the suspicion that the US National Security Agency whistleblower, Edward Snowden, was on board.  On that occasion there was not a peep of condemnation.  Unfortunately, many of those who contributed here have also engaged in selective condemnation of such incidents.<\/p>  <p>  The EU must be seen to act fairly in its sanction and breaches of international law.  To be clear, I commend those who have called for sanctions to be imposed on Belarus for this air hijacking.  All countries which break international laws should be brought to task for their actions.  Again, I note the total lack of calls for sanctions on Israel and the Israel Defense Force for its onslaught on innocent civilians, Palestinian men, women and children, with indiscriminate bomb attacks and a displacement of Palestinian families who have lived in their homes for many, many generations.<\/p>  <p>  Let me echo the call for the EU to impose the strongest measures available as soon as possible, but also to impose the same sanctions on all those who break international law, including in the last number of weeks and in previous years in respect of the attacks on Palestine by Israel, which have been acknowledged as major breaches of international for decades.  It is critical that the international community sends the message that this type of behaviour will not be tolerated by any country and it is of the utmost importance that the Government uses its place on the UN Security Council and within the EU to make it abundantly clear that Ireland condemns these actions and all actions against international law in the most robust terms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100030#EE00200","speaker":"1476"},{"type":"speech","time":1622565900,"counter":246,"content":"<p>I welcome this debate and the opportunity to speak on the worsening situation in Belarus.  I note the comments of previous speakers and wish to add my voice to the chorus of condemnation that has already been heard in this Chamber.  Accordingly, I am very happy to support this motion as it stands.  The events of 23 May over Belarus were scandalous and completely unacceptable at so many different levels.  First, the intercepting diverting and forced landing of a Ryanair civilian airliner in Minsk was an incredible and unprecedented event in modern history.  For all intents, it was state hijacking, state terrorism and state piracy all in one on a ridiculous pretext of a bogus bomb warning from Hamas and the subsequent charade of a baggage search on the airport tarmac.  It was an insult to everyone's intelligence.  Second, it was also the state kidnapping of a journalist and opposition activist Roman Protasevich and his travelling companion Sofia Sapega.  If that was not enough, both detainees were subjected to forced confessions on television, sporting bruises on their faces, as well as their ongoing arbitrary and indefinite incarceration.  Third, at an EU level, it was also an attack on both freedom of expression and freedom of movement and a threat to the safety of civil aviation, not to mention the unjustified subsequent expulsion of Latvian diplomats from Belarus, again, on false pretences.  In summary, this was a new low for an already discredited authoritarian regime and when coupled with the rigged elections of nine months ago, which were neither free nor fair, it represents a further significant and sinister deterioration in the situation.<\/p>  <p>  From a specifically Irish perspective, however, the ability of foreign agents to operate so freely in Athens poses very uncomfortable questions for our own sovereignty as it brings into sharp focus the potential for similar actions by foreign agents in this jurisdiction and our lack of counter espionage security services and resources.  Furthermore, it once again highlights our own sovereign lack of control of our own airspace, if any more evidence was needed. <\/p>  <p>  Where do we go from here?  I am glad the Minister for Foreign Affairs confirmed that an investigation by the United Nations International Civil Aviation Organization is now under way to formally determine the facts of the incident and that this committee will report by 26 June.  Second, I welcome the fact that EU aircraft will no longer overfly Belarusian airspace and that Belarusian aircraft will no longer be permitted to land in EU airports or even enter EU airspace.  Finally, I welcome &euro;3 billion of EU money that has been provisionally put on the table to encourage a peaceful transition of Belarus from an authoritarian state to a functioning democracy and I am very glad this investment is on hold with the transition process gets under way.  All these measures are appropriate, but we can go further and the EU needs to adopt a tougher stance from a Belarusian point of view.  For instance, additional targeted sanctions on President Lukashenko and his senior officials and entities should now be considered, unless there is an immediate and unconditional release of both detainees.  Targeted sanctions will not suffice, however, and we should also couple sanctions against the regime with supports for the innocent general population.  For instance, EU visas could temporarily be considered for Belarusians facing persecution or the risk of arbitrary arrest at home.  The EU should also engage with and support the Belarusian government in exile and recognise it as the legitimate transitional government of Belarus.  Perhaps most importantly, consideration should be given to inviting Belarusian opposition leaders to address the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence or perhaps even the D&aacute;il proper in plenary session.  Finally, more pressure should be exerted on Moscow to intervene positively.  New independently monitored elections are needed in Belarus as soon as possible. <\/p>  <p>  The regime of President Lukashenko is one of the last dictatorships in Europe.  Ireland needs to leverage its influential position at EU and UN levels to mobilise the international community and support the peaceful transition to democracy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100030#EE00300","speaker":"1587"},{"type":"speech","time":1622565900,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minster of State for the strong statement from this House, and I trust the motion will pass later.  I admire the principled stance the Government has taken on this matter.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge the speed with which the UN has acknowledged that this matter, particularly the forced landing of an aircraft to extract a citizen from it, is very serious.  It is a disgraceful act of tyranny.  <\/p> <p> The circumstances in Belarus has been deteriorating for some time.  I visited Minsk some years ago with fellow Members of the Oireachtas and saw at first hand an entire generation of Belarusian citizens who were unfortunately still suffering from the effects of the Chernobyl tragedy.  The current events are so horrific and, considering the response of the west, involving inevitable sanctions against the Belarusian Government, the citizens will suffer.  While I welcome the &euro;3 billion commitment by the EU, I do not believe it is enough.  We should do more in that regard.<\/p> <p> I commend the many charities that do incredible work in Belarus.  Ms Adi Roche was mentioned by Deputy Richmond.  Former Deputy Coonan did great work with children in Belarus.  It is important that we continue our outreach work in that country.<\/p> <p> The oppressive regime of Alexander Lukashenko has lost all credibility, not that it ever had any.  It is not fit to represent the people of Belarus.  They do not see the recent election results as legitimate.  I stand in solidarity with them today and those members of the Belarusian community who were outside D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann a little earlier.  The 2020 election saw significant irregularities, and independent experts have cited widespread electoral fraud in favour of Mr. Lukashenko.  Since that time, the regime has launched brutal crackdowns on peaceful protesters and the media.  It was mentioned that there were tens of thousands of arrests, and many have been subjected to a denial of human rights and civil liberties.<\/p> <p> We in Ireland have a long and rightly proud history of speaking out against authoritarian governments and highlighting the plight of persecuted peoples.  Our positions in the EU and on the UN Security Council afford us an even greater platform to shine a light on authoritarian leaders and foster the growth of democracy.  As a former head of delegation to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe Parliamentary Assembly, which position I had for the past seven years, I met many parliamentarians from around the world, including Belarus.  This latest turn of events appals both them and me.  Mr. Lukashenko's government has acted increasingly erratically.  The forced landing of the Ryanair flight is a symbolic sign of desperation.  Forcing the landing of a civil aircraft flying between two EU nations is simply unacceptable.  It is a State-backed act of piracy.<\/p> <p> The seizing of the aircraft to facilitate Mr. Roman Protasevich, a journalist who has been critical of the stolen election in 2020, symbolises all that we know that is true of tyrants: they fear an open press, they fear allowing their people the freedom to choose, and they fear an independent judiciary.  We know the regime is using violence and intimidation in a desperate attempt to suppress the will of the people.  This includes mass incarceration on political grounds, the use of torture and disappearances.  This is an affront to anybody who believes in human rights, democracy and freedom.  We must use our position in the international community to foster a democratic movement in Belarus and support the operation of a free press within the State.<\/p> <p> Supporting sanctions against the regime, along with other international measures, must be only the first step on a path to allowing democracy to flourish in Belarus.  Supporting the opposition, electoral reform efforts and system change must be further encouraged.  I am pleased the EU is committing to a fund of &euro;3 billion but it is not enough.  We must and can do more.  We must also recognise that support for the regime should not be tolerated by any nation.<\/p> <p> We cannot avoid the fact that the Russian Government has provided Lukashenko with political cover and offered a range of supports to the regime.  It is not the first time the Russian Government has done this, and it most certainly will not be the last.  Russia has destabilised regions of eastern Europe and far beyond.  The annexation of Crimea in recent years, the threatening of nations such as Georgia, the attacks on critics of the Kremlin at home and abroad, certain cyber activity, and the brutal repression of opposition journalists and activists are examples.  This behaviour is a threat to all European nations.  It has been mentioned by one of my colleagues.  Countries on the doorstep of the European Union have experienced difficulties associated with the Russian regime.<\/p> <p> A fundamental pillar that underpins freedom and democracy cannot be taken for granted.  Freedom and democracy require dedication and the continuous efforts of successive generations.  We can see these norms being chipped away at within the EU and externally.  Hungary and Poland, for instance, have both shown willingness to roll back on the liberties that have been so hard won.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100030#EE00400","speaker":"1562","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622566500,"counter":249,"content":"<p>I am happy to have an opportunity once again to speak on this subject.  Through the good offices of the Ceann Comhairle, I had a Topical Issue debate on the subject last week.  For that, I was grateful.  I believe, having listened to the various speeches in the House, that it is generally recognised that a situation is developing in Belarus caused by its hijacking of a civilian aircraft en route to a destination in the EU.  This is sinister.  It is terrorist activity and it needs to be dealt with.  If it is not dealt with forcefully and convincingly, there will be repeats.  One should remember that in the not-too-distant past in the region of eastern Europe in question, aeroplanes, including passenger aeroplanes, have been shot down, resulting in the annihilation of all the passengers.  I cannot imagine the terror on board the Ryanair flight when it was hijacked and directed to a different location than the one it had in mind.  What occurred was done irrespective of international law.  International law did not matter and does not matter to some people.<\/p>  <p>  I congratulate the Minister and Minister of State for the tremendous work they have done in this area and for bringing this issue to the fore, not only here but also across the rest of Europe.  I have no doubt they will continue to do so through the United Nations.  If this kind of atrocity is not dealt with meaningfully, it will happen again.<\/p>  <p>  I said last weekend that I believe the international criminal courts are the places to deal with these matters.  If people have to be tried in their absence, let them be, but there must be retribution.  If there is not, the circumstances will arise time and again.  It would only remain to be seen who would take the opportunity next to do something similar.  If it goes unpunished, there will be repeats.<\/p>  <p>  As others have mentioned, that are various locations across the globe where there are major and frightening abuses of human rights.  People say from time to time that we do not have civil liberties, including in Ireland, but it must be realised that in some parts of the globe, things are happening to peace-loving people, including women and children, that are appalling.  That these abuses should happen in the 21st century is a sad reflection on society.  It is a sad reflection on humanity and on what humanity can do to humanity at certain times.  Sometimes it is in times of war but sometimes not.  Widespread and large-scale abuses against women and children all over Africa and in some parts of eastern Europe, including through the slave trade and the trafficking of women and little children, occur without demur.  Nobody raises a word about them and those who do are deemed to comprise a fringe group.<\/p> <p>I would say the time has come for the international community to recognise the seriousness of the situation that is unfolding before us and to take clear action.  We should let it be known to the perpetrators that whoever they are and wherever they are, there will be retribution and the price that can and will be paid is high from their point of view.<\/p> <p> I believe people will always suffer.  The crucial issue is that people do something about it when someone raises the issue.  However, people have to raise it again and again.  We should introduce sanctions in every which way possible to ensure the perpetrators know full well now that whatever they do in future there will be a price to be paid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100031#FF00200","speaker":"1584","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622567100,"counter":251,"content":"<p>Tensions between the European Union and Belarus have increased since a Ryanair flight was forced to land in Minsk and a Belarusian journalist was taken off a flight.  Since 23 May the journalist and his girlfriend have been detained in Belarus.  This journalist ran a blog that was in opposition to the current Belarusian leader, Mr. Lukashenko, who has ruled the country since 1994.  The main opposition leader against Mr. Lukashenko in the country's elections last year said that a lawyer who visited the couple said they were fine.  Yet, it was doubtful because for sure the journalist was tortured and beaten.  He was charged with organising riots, a charge that carries a potential sentence of 15 years.  A day after he was arrested the journalist said he was confessing, but observers said the statement appeared to be forced.<\/p>  <p>  When the Belarusian strongman plucked a dissident journalist out of the sky he proved two things.  The first is that his 27-year grip on power is unhindered by international isolation.  The second is that in the absence of meaningful action by the United States and Europe, whose citizens were among the passengers on the hijacked flight, nothing will change.  It now appears that the journalist has been beaten and forced to confess to organising mass riots.  As many Ministers in this country have said, this is nothing short of an act of piracy.  It has also been said that we have to ensure the journalist and his partner need to be protected in every way possible.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to look at our country and the incident that happened off the coast of Castletownbere last Friday, which was nothing short of an act of piracy.

Regardless of all the pleas for help to our Naval Service to save our Irish vessel, it was left for 12 or 14 hours before any actions took place and the Spanish trawler had taken off.  Acts of piracy can take place in the air and on our seas, and they can go unhindered.  We need a strong Government to be able to act with our partners in Europe to ensure our skies are monitored and actions like this never recur.  We also need our Government to act and support our fishing vessels off Castletownbere when our citizens are in danger and continue to be in danger.<\/p>  <p>  Today, the Taoiseach made a false statement about me in the D&aacute;il.

The global community must get together and root these fellows out of office, make it difficult for them and get them out of power.  We are all calling on the EU, the UN, the United States and everyone.  We must join together to ensure that this dictatorship is got out of office.  We should get him out of power and restore an elected government in that country for the people who live there.  Like Deputy Durkan said, it is so sad to see what these villains are doing to ordinary human beings.  It is terrible and we must all stick together to root these people out of where they are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100032#GG00300","speaker":"1580"},{"type":"speech","time":1622567100,"counter":253,"content":"<p>I compliment the Government and support the motion this evening.

It is an act of war really and of total oppression.  Then we hear about intimidation and mistreatment and people being forced to make false statements.  It is all because they were trying to promote democracy and had the courage to oppose that dictator in an election and try to change the life of the people.  Russia has to be held to account as well.  While sanctions will hurt ordinary people, they are really necessary.  We know how fragile democracy is.

It was a brazen upfront demonstration on the part of Belarus that it will do whatever it wants on its own territory and elsewhere in its efforts to silence those who try to hold its government to account.  This act further reflects the growing authoritarianism that is insidiously creeping across the world, backed and supported by other authoritarian regimes.  Here in Ireland, we sit comfortably in our homes believing that we are far removed from all of this and that we are safe but the past two weeks should have given us pause for thought as an Irish airline fell victim to a state-sponsored hijacking and our entire health system was brought to its knees, the victim of a cyberattack that is likely to have originated in a country that seeks to destabilise western democracies.  We may think we are insulated on our little green rock in the Atlantic, but we are not.<\/p>  <p>  I fully support the Government's strongly worded motion.  It does not mince words and calls out the democratic illegitimacy of the election of Lukashenko.  It condemns the violence and repression perpetrated by his regime and, crucially, calls for the immediate and unconditional release of Protasevich and Sapega.  <\/p>  <p>  I cannot imagine and, in truth, do not even want to imagine the fear and terror felt by Protasevich and Sapega as they were dragged off that Ryanair flight.  We cannot let that act go unanswered and, so far, this Government and the EU have not done so.  Today, a number of D&aacute;il colleagues and I, along with the Minister of State, met a number of Belarusian citizens who are living in Ireland.  They described the fear felt by their families, friends and communities living under the repressive regime of Lukashenko and his links to Russia.  I have also adopted a political prisoner, Maksim Zinevich, through the good work of Libereco, which is an organisation that works to protect human rights in Ukraine and Belarus.  I urge my colleagues to do the same.<\/p>  <p>  Our words today are strong but we can do more.  We should look at our economic ties with Belarus and pursue the imposition of sanctions, where possible.  We should look at the possibility of providing a number of scholarships for students who have been thrown out of university.  We should simplify our visa application process, use our influence in international sporting organisations and, with our EU colleagues, try to support independent news agencies that have been shut down in Belarus.  This matter should not be a one-week wonder.

Members have rightly condemned the actions of the Lukashenko regime.  It is important that we have spoken with one voice, across all parties, against the Lukashenko regime and in full support of the ordinary people of Belarus, both those in the country itself and those who can no longer live there and who had to flee to other countries.  The diversion of the Ryanair flight to Minsk under transparently false pretences, a ruse, recklessly endangered lives.  This outrage joins the countless thousands of other incidents that have brought sorrow to individuals and families in Belarus and among its diaspora.  The motion provides an opportunity to clearly express what is happening in Belarus.  It is something the whole House finds unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  Members have spoken about the quick action on this issue.  Lukashenko chose the wrong weekend to do this as the European Council was meeting the following day.  The Council had no option but to take the strongest possible action, which was called for by everybody, and it did so.  That is important because it sends a strong message to authoritarian regimes all around the world.  It says that they cannot do this and get away with it.  That cannot happen.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland will always play a constructive role in the EU's strong response to the unacceptable actions at Minsk.  This happened at last week's meeting of the European Council.  The Taoiseach was involved in quite a number of bilateral engagements with colleagues in addition to attending engagements around the Council table.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, and I also had bilateral contacts, including contacts with the Belarusian opposition.  I was glad to take to take a phone call from Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, one of the leaders of the opposition in Belarus, in the immediate aftermath of the incident.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Taoiseach also had many engagements.  <\/p>  <p>  The individual sanctions up to now have clearly not been effective because, had they been, they would have prevented this incident.  We now seek to target the wallets of the regime and its supporters.  We will continue to monitor our broader relations with Belarus, including involvement in the Eastern Partnership mechanism.  Our support for the people is clear and unequivocal.  We keep the people of Belarus to the fore in all of our efforts.  The EU has diverted funds away from the authorities in Belarus and directed them to civil society.  Neighbouring member states have given refuge to those who have had to flee Lukashenko's repression and have supported scholarships for Belarusian students who have been removed from universities for expressing their views.  <\/p>  <p>  I pay tribute to the three Baltic states and to Poland, the states most directly affected by the actions of Lukashenko and those that have the most dealings with him.  It is very dangerous to be a neighbour of Belarus and these states are particularly concerned.  I express solidarity not only with Belarus and its people, but with the country's neighbours as well.  <\/p>  <p>  Through the European Endowment for Democracy, Ireland has given money towards projects that seek to protect human rights and media freedoms in Belarus.  We continue to do what we can to support these projects.  I welcome the positive vision for a future democratic Belarus, which the European Commission has outlined in recent days.  The EU has offered &euro;3 billion in funding for an economic stabilisation package, which contrasts sharply with Lukashenko's offer of further repression, corruption, economic stagnation and poverty.  Under Lukashenko, escape from the country is all its people can hope for.<\/p>  <p>  Let me be clear that the EU and Ireland are not playing geopolitics.  We do not want to alter the orientation of Belarusian foreign relations.  All we want is a prosperous stable neighbour that has full respect for the human rights of its citizens, democratic principles and the rule of law.  Those three concerns are, of course, central to participation in the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE.  As a participating state, Belarus has committed to those principles.  It needs to return to, and stick to, those commitments.  The chairpersonship and office of the OSCE have offered to facilitate meaningful, broad-based, inclusive national dialogue with the political opposition and civil society.  This needs to happen.  <\/p>  <p>  Belarus is also a member of the UN, as has been mentioned.  I remind the House that the preamble to the UN Charter reaffirms \"faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person\".  From the repressive acts we have seen taking place, it is clear that those principles have no home in Lukashenko's Belarus.  Belarus must acknowledge its international obligations and fully engage with the investigation of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.  A care for human rights is at the core of our engagement with the wider world.<\/p> <p>We take that care for human rights in regard to all of our relations around the world.  Our words and deeds have been consistent with this focus and we continue to seek a peaceful and democratic resolution to the crisis.  It is essential that the harassment and suppression of the political opposition in Belarus be brought to an end.  All of Belarusian society, at home and abroad, needs to be part of creating a new and prosperous future in Belarus, including those who support Lukashenko.  This is why dialogue, people coming together and having free and fair elections are so important.  <\/p> <p> The Belarus opposition is a broad-based movement.  Svetlana Tikhanovskaya is the international figurehead of the movement.  She has never claimed to be the sole representative, but it is worth recalling her links with this country, having come here as a Chernobyl child to escape that particular accident and to get rehabilitation and treatment, along with many other children.  She continued to come here after that to help other children affected and, I believe, she worked in this country as well.  Like Belarus, she has very strong links with Ireland.  Those links date back to ancient history, through migration in very ancient times.  There are some similarities between the Irish Celtic languages and Slavic languages.  There are other members of the opposition as well under the Coordination Council established by Ms Tikhanovskaya, including the former Minister for Culture, Pavel Latushko, Maria Kalesnikava and the Nobel laureate, Svetlana Alexievich.  All have either left the country or have been detained by the Lukashenko regime.  <\/p> <p> The European Parliament has rightly recognised the Coordination Council's courageous and peaceful defence of democracy and human rights by awarding it the 2020 Sakharov prize for freedom of thought.  The Taoiseach, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and I have all commended Svetlana Tikhanovskaya for her personal bravery.  As I said, she knows this country well.  We have extended an invitation for her to visit Ireland.  It is expected that that may happen in July when public health conditions permit.  We look forward to welcoming her back to our shores in the near future.  I hope that there will be an opportunity for her to visit Tipperary on that occasion as well.<\/p> <p> I want to acknowledge the many Belarusian people who now call Ireland home, some of whom I met today and previously.  They have worked tirelessly to maintain public awareness of the situation in the country of their birth.  Many Irish people have close personal ties to Belarus, as mentioned in the debate.  The Government has received a large volume of communications from Irish citizens about the situation in Belarus.  I assure them that we are doing all we can to help the people of Belarus.  <\/p> <p> A number of issues were raised in the debate.  It is slightly unfortunate that some people chose to raise other issues that are not directly related to this matter.  On the European Union, the Government is very strong on the importance of the rule of law within the Union.  There is no comparison to be made between Belarus and any member state and no comparison to be made with regard to the flight in Austria, which was mentioned by a couple of Deputies.  On that occasion the President of Austria had breakfast with the President of Bolivia on the aeroplane.  There is no comparison whatsoever in the two situations.  <\/p> <p> Last week, this House spoke with one voice on the Israel-Palestine situation.  We need to continue to speak in one voice.  We should not in a foreign policy discussion here say that we support something, but what about something else?  This country's interests have been always well served when we speak with one voice on foreign policy, be that in regard to Brexit, most famously over the past number of years or the Israel-Palestine situation on which we made history last week and spoke with one voice.  Speaking with one voice today gives us incredible strength.  <\/p> <p> It appears that nobody is opposing the motion and that it is unanimously supported by Members.  I very much welcome that.  I would welcome it if, as I expect, the motion will be passed unanimously without the need for a vote.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100033#HH00300","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1622568300,"counter":259,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1622568300,"counter":260,"content":"<p>Congratulations to all involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100034#JJ00300","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"\u00c1bhair Shaincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Matters","time":1622568300,"counter":261,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100034#JJ00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1622568300,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 37 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Thomas Pringle - to discuss a review of the disabled drivers scheme and primary medical certificate qualification assessment criteria; (2) Deputy Pat Buckley - to discuss the plan for reintroduction of live music in the hospitality sector; (3) Deputy Joe Flaherty - to discuss the need for a dedicated fibre connection for the new public library in Edgeworthstown, County Longford; (4) Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v - an g&aacute; at&aacute; ann go gcuirfear airgead ar f&aacute;il le c&oacute;ras s&eacute;arachais baile nua a chur ar f&aacute;il i gCill R&oacute;n&aacute;in Inis M&oacute;r, &Aacute;rann; (5) Deputy R&eacute;ada Cronin - to discuss the absence in north Kildare of psychological services for children, especially children with autism; (6) Deputy Dessie Ellis - to discuss the funding gap in the grant and actual cost of the works for replacing lead piping particularly in pre-1970s houses; (7) Deputy Patrick Costello - to discuss the child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, as it is currently operating; (8) Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan - to discuss the reinstatement of the school library grant; (9) Deputy Chris Andrews - to discuss the ruling by the European Committee of Social Rights on housing and breaches of the social charter by the Irish State; (10) Deputies Mattie McGrath, Michael Collins, Carol Nolan and Danny Healy-Rae - to discuss a serious international incident with a Spanish trawler that occurred on the south west coast; (11) Deputies Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh and Joan Collins - to discuss the imminent closure of Hesed House on Tyrconnell Road, Inchicore, an integral counselling and psychotherapy service for young people and their families; (12) Deputy David Stanton - to discuss issues that led to a large flotilla of trawlers recently gathering in Cork Harbour and the subsequent demonstration by fishermen; (13) Deputies Darren O'Rourke and Ruair&iacute; &Oacute; Murch&uacute; - to discuss bringing forward a survival and recovery plan for the taxi industry to ensure the sustainability of this vital public service; (14) Deputy Maurice Quinlivan - to discuss the review of the <i>ex-gratia<\/i>scheme for survivors of sexual abuse in day schools; (15) Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire - to discuss the delays in processing primary medical certificate applications; (16) Deputy Matt Carthy - to discuss support the Government can provide to the family of Gavin McShane in their campaign for justice; (17) Deputy Holly Cairns - to discuss the immediate need for safe infrastructure in Kealkill, County Cork for students to walk and cycle safely to school.<\/p><p>The matters raised by the Deputies Pringle, Stanton, Quinlivan and &Oacute; C&uacute;iv have been selected for discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100034#JJ00500","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Judicial Council (Amendment) Bill 2021: Second Stage [Private Members]","time":1622568300,"counter":263,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100034#JJ00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1622568300,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I move: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"<\/p>  <p>    I am sharing time with Deputies Conway-Walsh, Tully, &Oacute; Laoghaire, Mitchell and Stanley.  I am glad that I can introduce the Bill on Second Stage to the House.  For far too long, Deputies will have heard me talk about how consumers have been ripped off by the insurance industry, which has put its customers at the bottom of the list in terms of priorities.  Insurance is an essential part of a functioning economy.  In many instances, it is a legal requirement.  While consumers have no choice but to pay for insurance, the industry has a choice as to how it treats its consumers.  For far too long, it has treated its consumers badly.  That is the reality.<\/p>  <p>  An investigation by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, has found that some of the biggest players in the industry, AIG, Allianz, Axa, Aviva and FBD engaged in price-fixing cartel-like activity and behaviour for a 21-month period between 2015 and 2016.  In doing so, they reduced competition and increased prices for their customers.  Last December, the Central Bank confirmed that the industry was engaged in dual pricing, a price gouging activity that targets loyal and vulnerable customers and then hits them with artificially high premiums whenever they renew.  Sinn F&eacute;in has drafted legislation that would ban this practice as the Financial Conduct Authority, FCA, in Britain has done.  I ask the Government to end the delay it placed on that legislation so that the D&aacute;il can end this discriminatory practice at the earliest opportunity.   <\/p>  <p>  When it comes to prices, the average motor insurance premium has risen by 35% over the past decade, despite the cost of claims reducing over the same period by 9%.  Despite all of this, the insurance industry has received a listening ear in government to air its grievances and has regurgitated many of them which were false.  This D&aacute;il has responded to one such grievance and delivered for it.  The Judicial Council Act was passed by the D&aacute;il in 2019 and, ultimately, led to the personal injuries guidelines that came it into effect on 24 April this year.  These new guidelines reduce the level of damages for personal injury awards from between 38% and 69%, but the average being 50% across the board, cutting the cost of claims for the insurance industry and guaranteeing it significant savings as a result.  As the Ceann Comhairle and others will know, Sinn F&eacute;in supported these guidelines for one reason, that is, that they would reduce the cost of claims and, in doing so, reduce the cost of insurance for customers.  <\/p>  <p>  The insurance industry made a promise to pass on these savings to its customers in the form of reduced premiums.  We were even told how much we could expect premiums to reduce.  In 2019, the CEO of Zurich insurance told the finance committee the following with regard to a 50% drop in awards for soft tissue personal injuries: \"It would be quite reasonable that if that were to happen and insurers had not reduced their prices, with all things being equal, by somewhere in the region of 10% to 15%, the committee should be asking a lot of questions.\"  In regard to business insurance, he said that we should expect prices to fall by 20%.  They are the figures of the CEO of Zurich.  Maybe we should expect more.  It was straight from the horse's mouth that these guidelines provided for these types of reductions.  What we need now is an immediate and significant reduction in insurance premiums paid by customers, including motorists, businesses and homeowners.  That is clearly not happening.  <\/p>  <p>  In a survey conducted by my party, we received more than 1,300 responses.  Of those who had received a renewal quote since the new guidelines came into effect, 58% saw their premium increase despite having made no claims in the previous 12 months and only 22% saw a reduction in their premiums.<\/p> <p>With the new guidelines in place, every customer who has not made a claim should have seen his or her premium fall.  However, the Government's strategy has been to cross its fingers and hope the industry will do the right thing by cutting premiums in response to the guidelines.  I say we can do much better than that.<\/p> <p> We need a measure that will provide oversight and hold the industry to account.  That is precisely what this legislation does.  It requires insurance companies to provide information to the Central Bank each year for the next four years, including the amount paid by the company in personal injury claims and the amount it would have paid in such claims had the personal injury guidelines not come into effect.  In addition, companies would have to inform the Central Bank of the average premium charged under policies covering third-party personal injuries and the average premium that would have been charged had the guidelines not been implemented.  The Central Bank would then be required to submit a report outlining this information to the Minister for Finance on an annual basis, with a copy laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p> Those reports will show everyone how much the insurance industry has saved as a result of the implementation of the personal injury guidelines and, crucially, whether it has passed on all of those savings, euro for euro, to its customers.  If it has not, we will know about it and so will its customers.  Not only will this hold the industry to account, it will apply pressure on it to cut premiums immediately and significantly.  After reforms reduced whiplash awards in Britain, similar regulations to those contained in this Bill were introduced there, coming into effect in March last year.  Some of the largest players in the Irish market, including RSA Insurance, Aviva Insurance, AXA, Zurich, Allianz and AIG, are also the largest players in Britain and are subject in that jurisdiction to requirements akin to those set out in this legislation.  We should not accept any less oversight for customers in this State.  This legislation will provide that oversight and there is no legitimate reason for the Government or any Member to reject or oppose it unless he or she is doing the bidding of the industry.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State knows that what is proposed in this legislation is right and he will not vote against it.  However, the Government has indicated its intention to propose that the Bill not pass to the next stage, which is pre-legislative scrutiny, for nine months.  Why under God would the Government do that?  All we are trying to do is make the insurance companies live up to their promise to reduce premiums for customers and ensure the same oversight that applies when they sell a policy in Newry, Belfast or Derry applies when they sell a policy in this State.  I ask the Minister of State to drop the Government amendment and let the Bill go to pre-legislative scrutiny.  If he does, I will give a commitment to work with him and his Department to ensure the legislation is robust and fit for purpose and, if needed, that it is amended on Committee Stage after we have had proper legislative scrutiny.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100034#JJ00700","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622568900,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I commend my colleague and party finance spokesperson, Deputy Doherty, on bringing forward this Bill.  He has provided an opportunity to all Oireachtas Members, from all parties and none, to demonstrate to the people who have been crucified by high insurance costs that this House is prepared to stand for fairness.  Insurance companies have hidden for years behind the book of quantum.  They have continually and consistently used the high cost of personal injury claims as cover for charging eye-watering premiums for compulsory insurance.  Since the personal injury guidelines took effect on 24 April this year, they no longer have that defence.<\/p>  <p>  We know from experience that every possible tactic is used by the insurance industry to keep the raw data hidden from those who ask why Irish policyholders are forced to pay extortionate premiums.  Indeed, the European Commission was sufficiently concerned about price-fixing and the cartel-like behaviours of motor insurance providers that it conducted unannounced inspections.  When the CCPC conducted its own investigations, it found a lack of data on the market was serving as a barrier to new entrants.  Price gouging and ripping off of people who are legally required to purchase insurance must stop.  It is not enough just to stabilise the situation as it is.  There must be a reversal of the crippling cost of insurance.<\/p>  <p>  That is why this Bill is so important.  Put simply, it will require insurance providers to provide relevant data to the Central Bank that will show whether savings from the implementation of the new guidelines are being passed on to policyholders.  The substantial reduction in insurance costs must be the endgame.  Otherwise, the guidelines are just a paper exercise to increase the profits of the insurance industry.  We must stop dancing to the tune of the industry.  The Government needs to tackle the exploitation of people who can least afford to hand over their hard-earned money but are left with no other option.  Reductions in the cost of insurance claims must be passed on to customers.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill will guarantee the outcome we need.  It will apply pressure on the industry to pass on all the savings it makes, euro for euro, to its customers.  We know the new guidelines reduce the level of personal injury awards by between 31% and 69%.  Similar regulations came into effect in Britain, as Deputy Doherty indicated, following a reduction in the level of whiplash injury awards.  Many of the same insurers that are active in the British market are operating here.

In fact, many motorists, homeowners and business people are seeing their premiums increase.  When members of the insurance industry appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, their call for the implementation of personal injury guidelines was made with the commitment that a reduction in the volume of claims would result in a reduction in the price of premiums.  With that in mind, the Oireachtas passed legislation to that end and the guidelines took legal effect on 24 April last, replacing the book of quantum in determining the level of awards in personal injury cases.  The Judicial Council subsequently reduced the awards payable substantially in the light of the guidelines.<\/p><p>On the day the new guidelines came into force, the director of the Alliance for Insurance Reform was reported in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>as saying he expected insurance premium charges to be &quot;significantly reduced&quot; from the following Monday.

Premiums have not been reduced for motorists, homeowners and business people in line with the reduction in awards.  It seems the insurance companies have simply pocketed the bulk of the savings arising from the reductions in awards, despite the commitments they gave.<\/p><p>Since the guidelines came into effect, we have seen a dramatic reduction in insurance awards, with the level decreasing in some cases by more than 50%.  We need a way to verify that those reductions in awards are passed on to consumers in the form of lower insurance prices.  The legislation introduced by my colleague, Deputy Doherty, will ensure that happens and will provided much-needed transparency on this issue.  It will provide the Department of Finance with the ability to make regulations that require insurance companies to provide information to the Central Bank on how the new personal injury guidelines have impacted on premiums for policyholders.  It will force the industry to pass the savings it makes on to its customers.<\/p><p>Similar regulations have come into effect in Britain, where many insurers in the Irish market also operate.  The operations of those companies in Ireland should be subject to no less scrutiny.  Consumers cannot afford to wait any longer.  The Government cannot just sit back and hope insurance companies will do the right thing by reducing premiums.  The industry needs to be held to account and this legislation will allow that to happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100035#KK00300","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1622568900,"counter":268,"content":"<p>When we talk to people about the insurance industry and how it has conducted itself in recent years, they have many things to say.  Comments that are made regularly to me are that it is a law onto itself, it is beyond reach, reproach and sanction, and it is unaccountable.  Who pays the price for that?  It is paid by the businesses struggling to find any kind of affordable insurance cover at a time they are under severe pressure.  It is paid by the childcare facilities struggling to secure insurance, many of which are going out of business.  The price is paid by businesses operating in very specific areas, such as soft play providers.  It is paid by young people trying to get on the road and spread their wings, many of whom may need a car to get any kind of job or get to university.  All of these people are being denied by what the insurance industry is doing.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill seeks to make the industry accountable.  Insurance companies made big commitments that if the costs of awards and damages came down, they would pass that saving on to their customers.<\/p> <p>They said in 2019 that if awards decreased by 50%, they would reduce motor premiums by 15% and business insurance by 20%.  These guidelines have been in place for more than a month but there is no evidence yet of this being passed on to the consumer.  The Government's policy so far has been to cross its fingers and hope the insurance industry will do the right thing and reduce premiums.  That is not good enough.  The industry needs to be held to account to deliver on its promise.  Businesses in Cork, including in my constituency, and everywhere else are under very severe financial pressure because of the pandemic.  The least they deserve is not to be ripped off by insurance firms taking advantage.  This Bill would force insurance companies to pass these savings on euro for euro to customers in the form of lower premiums.  It would require the insurance industry to pass on information to the Central Bank outlining if and how it has passed on those savings.  It is perfectly sensible legislation and I do not understand why the Minister of State is delaying this for nine months.  It is a fiction.  It is a way of avoiding supporting perfectly good Sinn F&eacute;in legislation that would help motorists, businesses and community organisations, and the Government should drop its amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100035#KK00400","speaker":"1460","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622569500,"counter":270,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  It will benefit so many people, and I thank my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, for bringing it to the floor of the D&aacute;il.  The culture of insurance companies ripping off their customers is an issue with which we are all very familiar.  This Bill seeks to change that culture and pass on the savings to customers because it is the right thing to do.  Insurance companies have used rising claims to justify price hikes over recent years, but not passing the savings on to customers is unfair and unjust.  It is the insurance industry moving the goalposts to protect its profits.  The sector is speaking out of both sides of its mouth.  Its only motivation seems to be crazy profits off the backs of people who cannot afford to pay what they are paying.  The Bill seeks to make things better for drivers, businesses and homeowners who are being ripped off.  Young people are being priced off the road.  Childcare facilities are getting quoted out of existence or being refused insurance completely.  The average working person is getting robbed by these companies, and this Bill in some way will change that.  It is about fairness and protecting the consumer.  It is time the industry was held to account and was transparent with the people.  The Minister of State has to act.

Insurance companies have ripped off the public for too long.  The insurance sector made profits of &euro;142 million last year, yet premium prices kept increasing.  This Sinn F&eacute;in legislation would force insurance companies to pass on savings to their customers and reduce premium prices as a result of new personal injury guidelines.  A recent survey by Sinn F&eacute;in found that 58% of respondents had seen their premiums increase.  This is despite the new guidelines.  Our legislation forces the industry to outline to the Central Bank how it has passed on the savings to the public.  Similar legislation has been enacted in Britain and governs the practices of all relevant companies there such AIG, AXA, Aviva, Alliance and RSA, all of which operate in this country.<\/p>  <p>  Dual pricing is another issue on which Deputy Doherty has done a lot of work.  The practice was banned by the FCA last Friday yet continues here in Ireland.  The British ruling affects both home and motor insurance.  Dual pricing involves the overcharging of loyal customers on renewal premiums and can drive up prices by in the region of 35%.  The Central Bank has recently investigated this practice in Ireland thanks to complaints submitted by Deputy Doherty and Sinn F&eacute;in and it found that the practice was widespread.  It meant that \"those customers with the longest tenure\" were \"paying the most\".<\/p>  <p>  We need to see action on both these fronts.  We need action now to outlaw these practices.  The ball is firmly in the Government's court, and any thoughts of delaying this are outrageous.  There has been too much delay and there should be no more delays.

In February, we had a fruitful debate on differential pricing, and I hope that this evening we can have an equally informative discussion.  While there is no dispute that these two Bills attempt to address important issues, the Deputy must recognise that these two themes are part of this Government's whole-of-government approach under the action plan for insurance reform, which we launched last December.<\/p><p>There has been considerable progress in delivering on these actions outlined in our action plan.  A key achievement was the implementation of the new personal injuries guidelines in April.  This was delivered seven months ahead of schedule, a timeframe we felt was reasonable.  We are pleased that we are now seven months ahead of schedule and having this debate now because the Government passed the public injuries guidelines in this House some time ago.  We are having this debate at this very early stage in the life of the Government as a result of our speedy action in dealing with a variety of matters under the action plan for insurance reform.  These guidelines significantly reduce the award levels in a number of areas and will be used by both the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, and the Judiciary.  Objectively, these guidelines should bring about reduced costs to customers, not anything contained in the Bill before the House.  I stress that it is important for all sides of the House to recognise this fundamental point.  The judicial guidelines will bring about the reductions.  There is nothing whatever in this legislation - not a scintilla of a sentence or a syllable - to bring about reductions in the cost of insurance.  The Bill refers to the production of a report.  Based on what the Deputies have said so far, the publication of a report will not shame the insurance companies into reducing premiums.  The sole purpose of the Bill is to produce a report insofar as it might shame the industry into doing something, which Deputies have discounted on several occasions this afternoon.<\/p><p>Both the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and I have been engaging directly with insurers to hold them to account in respect of commitments they have made to reflect savings arising from reduced award levels.  This will continue over the course of the year to ensure a pass-through of the new guidelines continues to take effect, benefiting policyholders.  I welcome that some of the firms have indicated to Oireachtas Members initial reductions on premium renewal as the new guidelines begin to take effect.<\/p><p>As for the Bill, the Government shares its objectives to increase transparency on insurance companies reducing premiums as a result of the personal injuries guidelines.  At the heart of this debate is better understanding all the different costs that make up the price of premiums.  It is important that these costs are not singled out as the silver bullet in solving all the problems in the sector but examined in their overall contribution to premium pricing.  Ireland has a sophisticated transparency system in place to monitor insurance pricing and I welcome suggestions to improve it.  My officials in the Department of Finance are actively exploring ways to do this and they will be taken into consideration along with the principles in this Bill when we bring forward legislation on the insurance sector in the autumn.<\/p><p>Regarding transparency, first, I wish to highlight that the Central Bank produces a national claims information database, which has been referred to, the equivalent of which is not available in most other EU countries.  Second, it will produce its first ever report in this area on employer and public liability in June or July this year, which will be a major help to us in legislating.  In addition, during July it will produce its review on differential pricing.  We want to see the outcome of that review so we can incorporate what is necessary in the legislation we will bring forward in the autumn.<\/p> <p> Third, the third annual report on motor insurance premiums will be produced in September.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, produces figures on insurance prices on a quarterly basis and the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, produces regular public reports.  The likes of that organisation do not exist anywhere else.  There is no PIAB in the UK producing public and transparent information on an annual basis.  In addition, chief executives of several major insurance companies have appeared before the Oireachtas committee in recent weeks, which highlights the level of public scrutiny of this matter.  In September, the Consumer Insurance Contracts Act 2019 will ensure that all insurance companies sending out renewals for motor insurance must give the five-year history of their insurance premiums.  The level of transparency in Ireland is unparalleled in the EU and our neighbouring jurisdiction.<\/p> <p> The Bill is concerned with oversight, with which we agree.  That is what we will be doing as part of our legislation.  I will not dwell on particular aspects of the Bill except to say that we will take on board in a positive manner the principles behind it when we are drafting legislation as part of the action plan for insurance.<\/p> <p> Something else that will lead to cost reductions is combating the number of uninsured drivers on the road, which add at least &euro;30 to every policy.  Recently, we concluded public consultation on PIAB.  Its like does not exist in any neighbouring country.  We hope to have legislation on the reform of PIAB in the autumn.  Recently, the Department of Justice completed a review of the Occupiers' Liability Act, including the duty of care and notices and waivers, in order to increase protections for consumers, businesses, sporting clubs and community groups.  I understand that work is continuing on a formal proposal to the Government on proposed legislative changes in that regard.  The Criminal Justice (Perjury and Related Offences) Bill 2018 recently passed all Stages in the D&aacute;il and I hope that it will be passed by the Seanad shortly.<\/p> <p> I have listed five or six elements that will contribute to a reduction in the cost of premiums.  Passing legislation to isolate one element only while ignoring the other factors seems to demonstrate a limited understanding of the dynamics underpinning the cost of insurance.  If the judicial guidelines were all that we were reliant on to reduce premiums, I could understand why we would consider this Bill.  However, I have given one example of the myriad actions being taken by the Government.  To isolate one element and ignore others that will also contribute to cost reductions does not reflect what is happening.<\/p> <p> The approach the Bill uses to seek to hold insurers to account seems inadequate, as we already have a unique resource in this country, that being, the Central Bank's national claims information database, which provides a level of information that is not available in many other areas.  We must wait for the three reports that will come from the Central Bank, not next year or this autumn, but this summer, so that a good and broad-based discussion on insurance can be enabled when we return in the autumn.  Everyone would agree with that instead of believing that there is only one show in town and one silver bullet.  We have many strings to our bow when it comes to dealing with this issue.<\/p> <p> There is a perception that the Bill simply reflects recent legislation passed in the UK, as mentioned this evening, and that, given that many insurers operate in both markets, providing the information in Ireland should not be an issue for them.  However, the Bill goes much further than the UK requirements.  It appears to be a much more cumbersome exercise than in the UK and ignores the fact that we already have a superior capacity to monitor claims costs and pricing trends through the national claims information database.  We have a level of transparency that does not exist in other countries.<\/p> <p> The forthcoming reports will feed into the work that is under way in the Department on considering a number of potential legislative measures relating to consumer matters, including the two Bills that the Deputy introduced in recent times.  That said, we should not lose sight of the fact that the Government has developed a comprehensive whole-of-government action plan for insurance reform that addresses insurance issues in a structured and targeted manner and that we are already holding the insurance industry to account in terms of passing on savings arising from the reforms delivered to date.<\/p> <p> I commend the amendment to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100036#LL00400","speaker":"1590","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622570100,"counter":274,"content":"<p>I understand that Deputy Kerrane is sharing time with her colleagues, Deputies Clarke, Mythen and Paul Donnelly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100037#MM00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1622570100,"counter":275,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important legislation.

Premiums are still increasing.  That is the problem.  It is a great shame that we must constantly force the insurance companies to do the right thing when it comes to costs for customers.  Worse, the Government fails to act on behalf of those customers the length and breadth of the State.  Why has the Government not stepped in to ensure that the savings made by insurance companies through the reduction of up to 50% in awards are passed on to customers?  That is the reason we have had to step in with this legislation.<\/p>  <p>  For years, insurance companies have been ripping off customers with rising premiums, making it more difficult for young people to get on the road, especially in rural areas.  On turning 18 years of age last year, my brother received quotes of more than &euro;3,000.  That was on top of tax of &euro;700 or &euro;800 and the cost of running a car.  Unless a person has money, it is impossible to get on the road, particularly in rural areas where public transport is either non-existent or inconvenient.  Insurance companies have been lining their pockets and will do so even more now that they are saving money on awards while increasing premiums for no other reason than they can.

No one is that naive.  The behaviour and practices of the insurance industry make the introduction of legislation now necessary.  The time for good faith has passed.

Any owner of a vehicle will say that their premiums over the last few years have increased, year in and year out, especially for young drivers who have been subject to extortionate quotes, where these quotes often exceed the value of the vehicle itself.  This Bill gives this House the chance to correct and rein in this practice of gross profiteering and legally requires the insurance industry to supply information to the Central Bank to show categorically how claims have been reduced as a result of the new personal injury guidelines and, more importantly, how these savings will be reflected in premiums over the next four years and will be passed on directly to the customer.<\/p>  <p>  We all know, as sure as night follows day, that if insurance companies are left to their own self-regulation, the full savings created by the new personal injury guidelines will not be passed on to the customers or the full empirical numbers for claims will not be made public.<\/p>  <p>  In 2020, the Central Bank found that the average insurance premium increased by 35% in the last decade and that 2.5 million policyholders were overcharged by &euro;187 million in a single year.

The insurance companies, however, are clearly not keeping their promise to reduce the costs of insurance.

I will support any legislation or intervention from any Member of this House regardless of their political colour if it means that insurance premiums will be reduced for hard-pressed consumers in this country.  We cannot wait another nine months for this issue to be addressed.  I believe in the Minister of State's intentions.  He is well intentioned in the approach he wishes to take with the insurance industry.  Ultimately, that has to deliver, but we cannot waste any more time.  We have to take any interventions that are made in this House seriously.  We must try to take a consensual and unified approach to dealing with this very significant issue for Irish consumers, jobs and business.<\/p>  <p>  For years insurance companies promised us that we would see a reduction in premiums if court payment awards went down.  While it might be early days, there is little evidence to suggest that premiums have gone down since the Judicial Council guidelines came in.  In fact, there is evidence that I have come across in my own day-to-day work where some companies are just shifting the goalposts and introducing new criteria and thresholds to keep their profits up.  This is the kind of activity that the Minister of State needs to keep a very close eye on, as do the Central Bank and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.<\/p>  <p>  All of this comes on the back of insurance firms, particularly those in the motor insurance market, refusing to grant rebates to their customers like they did at the start of the pandemic, despite the significant reduction in road usage and, as a consequence, claims in the early part of this year.  This foot-dragging on premium reductions and rebates is simply unacceptable, but our experience of the insurance industry in this country means we should not be surprised.  This is an industry with form.  We all know that excessive awards were a problem to which the State responded but this was only part of a much larger problem.  The reality, as was stated earlier and as we have been told by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, is that motor insurance premiums increased by up to 35% between 2009 and 2019 while claims costs per policy fell 9% in the same period.<\/p>  <p>  At the same time the operating profits of these price-gouging firms have continued to rise, for example, by 10% in 2019, while premiums have fallen by only an average of 4%.  To add insult to injury, insurance companies are effectively pocketing State supports to businesses that the Minister of State and I, as taxpayers, are paying for.  I refer to supports that all of us in this House legislated for.  These companies are like the archetypal Second World War spivs, but in more expensive suits, who are trading off people&rsquo;s misfortune and exploiting a crisis to line their own pockets.<\/p>  <p>  At last week's meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, my Labour Party colleague, Senator Sherlock, challenged the FBD, Aviva and Zurich insurance companies on this extraordinary situation, which is happening in plain sight.   I have raised this with the Minister of State before, as have others, but it goes on.<\/p>  <p>  Insurance companies are obliged by law to reimburse the State in any personal injuries awards in respect of any welfare payments that may have been made to the injured party.  Despite the Minister of State's bellicose words on the airwaves, they get to make up their own rules when it comes to the treatment of business interruption insurance.<\/p>  <p>  Only last week, we saw the State&rsquo;s biggest general insurance provider, AXA, stating it intends to deduct the value of pandemic State supports from payouts to businesses.  They really have some neck and they need to be taken on.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State has rightly said it is not the job of the Government to subsidise the profits of the insurance companies, but he has a responsibility to call a halt to this travesty.<\/p> <p> The issue of insurance cover for businesses is a ticking time bomb as we move to the recovery phase of our economic development, we hope, post Covid.  In recent weeks, I have witnessed more and more insurance companies simply refusing to provide cover to businesses and, in some cases, even to firms that have never claimed.  They have no history of claims or of issues whatsoever.  Last week, Engineers Ireland spelled out in stark terms how the housing crisis could deepen because fire experts cannot get the proper insurance to allow them to sign off on individual houses, flats, nursing homes and entire housing estates.<\/p> <p> I am dealing with a shocking case in County Louth.  I will not identify the individuals involved but I mention this because it is illustrative of a wider problem.  A firm that employs almost ten people in the outdoors sector has, in effect, been closed because it cannot get standard insurance cover.  It is cover the firm has had since it opened, without a single claim having been made in the history of its operation.  The jobs are at risk of going.  This is an entrepreneur who has made it through the pandemic, only to be shown the door by an insurance company.  Two issues have been cited, one of which is Brexit and the fact that there are difficulties with the underwriters, which are UK licensed and finding it difficult to operate in the EU.  The second issue is the nature of the firm's business.  I reiterate it has had no claims made against it and it operates to the highest safety standards, as its record shows.<\/p> <p> If not tackled, this issue will stymie our recovery and put hundreds, if not thousands, of good businesses and good jobs at risk and out of operation.  Today, the Government launched its national economic recovery plan.  Many of the initiatives outlined therein are simply rehashed initiatives that have been lodged in any case since the Government came into office, although it would be churlish of me not to recognise that there are some positive initiatives in the document, notwithstanding the criticisms I have of some elements of it.  Nevertheless, there is one step that would greatly enhance the prospects of businesses' viability, namely, tackling all these deep-seated inequities and injustices in the insurance sector and the way in which businesses are treated.<\/p> <p> The shocking case that I outlined I am dealing with is illustrative of a wider problem.  We have a fundamental market failure in insurance in this country and it is holding back our economic development and our society.  Where there is market failure, an activist State ought to step in.  We recently proposed the introduction of innovative pooled insurance schemes, the norm in other EU countries, which would allow community services such as childcare centres, co-operatives and sports clubs to group together under one policy to secure significantly cheaper premium and to spread and share the risk.  That is normal elsewhere, but we do not seem to be able to do it in this country.  We have also called on local authorities and education and training boards, for example, to use their ownership of Irish Public Bodies Mutual Insurance to extend cover to community events and festivals, which will be absolutely necessary if we are to help our vibrant arts and entertainment sector bounce back from the pandemic.<\/p> <p> The State must step in actively to reshape the insurance market in the interest of customers, communities and local businesses.  In the meantime, we are happy to support this initiative, designed as it is to force down premiums.  We will support any initiative, regardless of where in the House it might come from, that is designed to achieve what we all want, namely, reduce premiums and costs for businesses, save jobs and give consumers a fair crack.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100038#NN00400","speaker":"1599","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622571300,"counter":282,"content":"<p>The lack of affordability of insurance in this country has been a hot topic for many years and the source of much annoyance and anger for consumers.  High insurance premiums add significantly to the cost base of our economy.  As premiums go up and up, this plays directly into the increase in the cost of living.  Affordable insurance, therefore, is fundamental to the long-term interests of our society and communities, not least in regard to protecting and creating jobs.<\/p>  <p>  One does not have to look far to see how astronomical premiums have impacted on communities and individuals.  As premiums increase, small businesses can be pushed out of the market by the crippling overheads they face, including in particular the cost of insurance.  Let us not forget the major crisis that befell our childcare sector at the end of 2019, when hundreds of cr&egrave;ches faced closure due to the lack of affordability of insurance.<\/p>  <p>  Before Covid-19 changed the landscape for summer festivals, they were already under threat from rocketing insurance premiums.  One such festival that came forward about increasing costs was the Ballina Salmon Festival, whose premium increased from &euro;6,500 in 2016 to &euro;25,000 in 2019.  The festival, which had been running for 65 years, finally had to shut because it had become completely unaffordable to take out insurance.  When premiums are sky high, local services are forced to close their doors, businesses can fail, jobs can be lost and community groups can no longer afford to put on events.  This has a considerable impact, not only on the economy but also on our community, yet despite the often devastating impact of high premiums, costs continue to rise.  We know this.  It is not news to anyone in the Chamber and it is long past time the Government sorted this out.<\/p>  <p>  Why does Ireland face such high insurance costs?  There have been many attempts to explain this away.  Today we are debating the claim that awards are too high, which insurance companies maintain leads to spiralling premiums.  I am not saying that high awards do not contribute significantly to high premiums - there is a certain logic and evidence behind that - but what we saw over recent years was a very successful portrayal by insurance companies of these high awards being a primary contributor to the cost of premiums.  This argument has passed the buck, so to speak, onto judges and their legal system and, in doing so, effectively absolved the industry of responsibility.<\/p>  <p>  The insurance industry heavily lobbied for new personal injury guidelines to replace the book of quantum.  Its efforts were successful and these new guidelines took effect on 24 April.  In its lobbying efforts, the industry was adamant that these guidelines would lead directly to a fall in insurance costs, and in some cases, a drop of up to 20%.  It is worth noting that a number of judges, including the former President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Peter Kelly, have on record expressed scepticism as to whether lower awards would result in lower premiums.  Serious doubts have been raised among the Judiciary about any benefit to policyholders, while the Law Society of Ireland has stated that the guidelines \"swing the pendulum too far\" in favour of insurers.  The industry maintained that these new guidelines were necessary.  Now that they have come into effect, policyholders need to see a return in the form of lower premiums - end of story.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill aims to hold insurance companies to account for those promises by requiring them to report to the Central Bank in respect of how the guidelines have affected the cost of insurance.<\/p> <p> The Social Democrats will be supporting this Bill.  It is not a silver bullet for the many issues within the insurance industry, nor does it claim to be.  However, it seeks to hold companies to account for their promises to lower premiums, if payouts are reduced.  For that, we welcome this Bill.  Oversight is desperately needed and this Bill aims to provide that.<\/p> <p> Reform of the insurance sector is long overdue.  While the Central Bank has begun to produce statistics and investigate the basis on which insurers have been increasing premiums, we cannot be satisfied it is sufficiently consumer-focused in its approach.  It does not collect enough basic data, especially on premiums, and is not active enough in terms of vulnerable customers or market concentration and volatility.<\/p> <p> How can we pinpoint the root of Ireland's high insurance premiums without sufficient data to understand the entire picture?   We have heard a plethora of theories about high awards, fraud and exaggerated claims, but without the data we cannot address the areas which need reform and legislation.  Where are the facts?  Where is the evidence to support the industry's claim that high awards are principally to blame?<\/p> <p> Ireland is often blamed for having a claims culture.  This is what the insurance companies have told us to gain support for the personal injuries guidelines.  Let us look at the numbers.  There was a big rise in personal injuries awards between 2007 and 2016.  They nearly tripled.  However, since 2016, the number and value of awards processed by PIAB has fallen year on year.  There has been a decrease of 11% in the number of awards and of 18% in the value of awards since 2016.<\/p> <p> Let us look at one insurance category.  In 2019, motor insurance accounted for 70% of personal injury assessments.  From 2009 to 2019, motor insurance premiums rose by 35%, according to the Central Bank's annual private motor insurance report.  It is a staggering figure.  What if we look at liability across categories of insurance?  Looking across motor, employer and public liability insurance categories, data from PIAB again show a decrease in each category, in the average value of awards, from 2018 to 2019.<\/p> <p> There is little proof that high premiums can be directly attributed to high awards.  We need more data to understand what is driving these skyrocketing insurance costs.  My party has been asking, for some time, for a new consumer affairs committee to be established within the Oireachtas, with its sole focus to be outcomes for consumers across the board.  Regulators should expect to have to answer far more regularly for their actions or, in many cases, their inactions.  A committee could play a valuable role in bringing about accountability, as well as highlighting where there are gaps in the legislation or deficiencies in the powers available to regulators.<\/p> <p> The bottom line is that insurance premiums are crippling for consumers, small businesses and community groups.  The cost of insurance is a huge overhead for businesses and these exorbitant costs are passed on to consumers.  Ireland was recently ranked sixth, in terms of the high cost of living, in Europe and 12th in the world this year.  Our high cost of insurance directly contributes to the high cost of living for individuals and families.  It directly impacts the quality of local communities, shuttering businesses and local services and forcing community groups to cancel events because they cannot pay the spiralling cost of insurance premiums.<\/p> <p> Today's Bill will not fix all insurance issues but it makes a serious effort to hold the industry to account for its promises.  I warmly welcome it for that reason.  I commend Deputy Doherty on bringing this Bill forward and on his tenaciousness in pursuing the significant problems in the insurance industry, which the Government should have solved long ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100039#OO00200","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622571900,"counter":284,"content":"<p>Is Deputy Murphy sharing time?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100040#PP00100","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1622571900,"counter":285,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Matt Shanahan, who is probably on his way.  I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing forward the Bill.  I commend Deputy Doherty on all of the work he has done, over many years, in highlighting issues in our insurance industry.  He has brought to light many important issues and has been relentless in his efforts to try to deal with them.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill would require insurance companies to provide information to the Central Bank for each of the next four years, outlining how the cost of claims have fallen as a result of the new personal injury guidelines.  I support this idea.  It is one way of helping us to understand how effective the personal injury guidelines have been.  Too often, the impact of policy is not analysed enough.  Guidelines or rules are often just introduced and it is assumed that they will achieve the intended results.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that when changes to anything are introduced, we have mechanisms in place to help us to judge whether the changes have been effective.  It may also help guide us towards any future amendments which need to be made or any additions which need to be made to the personal injury guidelines.<\/p>  <p>  It will also serve the purpose of monitoring companies and prices to see if and how they have passed these savings onto their consumers, in the form of reduced prices.  In my previous role as president of the Irish Road Haulage Association, IRHA, we found trying to tackle the insurance issue was like banging your head off a brick wall, because the competition authority was reluctant to tackle the issue.  It wanted masses of evidence before it would consider taking action, yet no such evidence was available because the insurance companies were not required to publish it.<\/p>  <p>  Another aspect of insurance reform that needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency is the issue of test cases.  The UK financial regulator takes test cases to court on behalf of a certain sector and the result of that case becomes the precedent or benchmark for all other similar cases.  However, in Ireland, each individual has to pay &euro;5,000 to take his or her claim to the commercial court.  This is unacceptable.  It makes it more difficult for businesses or individuals to legally challenge insurance companies.  Many publicans are in this position.  We need to update the role of our Financial Regulator to have it take test cases in a similar way to the UK.  After all, the Financial Regulator is there to serve the public.  Many small enterprises or individuals do not have the financial resources to take an insurance company to court and this will be even more problematic, since many business have been closed for the past 14 months.<\/p>  <p>  As this Bill relates to insurance, it is important to note that thousands of people are unable to get on the road due to delays in our driver testing.  We hope motorists will have cheaper motor insurance costs, but we also need to ensure that people can get on the road.  The Road Safety Authority, RSA, and the National Driver Licence Service, NDLS, have been lax in bringing back theory tests, driving lessons and driving tests.  All of the inaction serves to undermine any savings which could be garnered from insurance reform, as well as preventing those out of work from availing of job prospects, particularly in rural Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I have constantly called on the RSA to bring in an online portal for the theory test.  When it did bring it in, it only suited one quarter of the computer users because of the chosen software.  When one tries to apply, one discovers there is no test available until 2023.  If these new personal injury guidelines result in people being charged less for insurance, that is great news, but it is not that useful to someone who cannot get themselves up and running because of delays in other areas.  While that is a tangent from the contents of this Bill, it illustrates the lack of joined-up thinking in the system.<\/p> <p>Overall, I believe it is important to have transparency in our insurance industry.  Insurance companies make billions of euro in profits as a result of governments making insurance a legal requirement in certain aspects of life.  Therefore, it is perfectly reasonable that we have transparency, careful monitoring and protections for the consumer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100040#PP00300","speaker":"1622","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622572500,"counter":287,"content":"<p>The Bill speaks not just to fairness and transparency, but also to equitable justice and national competitiveness.  It is an attempt to hold insurance companies to account, in the first instance, and associated intermediaries, in the second.  The legislation calls for significant data available from the Central Bank to be provided in a clear format so we can assess the insurance reform measures proposed in recent months to see if they are having the desired effect in the market.<\/p>  <p>  This House has been debating for some years the dysfunction in the insurance sector.  This has been demonstrated recently, when the year-on-year rising claims market has been largely passed onto an unsuspecting public and business sector, with little or no rigorous examination by industry of the underlying cultures or environment driving insurance premiums in Ireland.  The recent findings of the Judicial Council have been adopted by insurers and the Judiciary to operate a new soft tissue awards profile, which offers a 50% reduction in soft tissue claims compared to previous levels.  It is worth noting that, at this award base, like-for-like injuries are still 30% less than UK peer insurance groupings.  This situation becomes even more interesting when one considers the majority of insurance companies operating in Ireland are under UK incorporation, where one assumes they have been operating profitably, despite the lower claims environment there and the lower premiums they exact in a far more competitive market.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill seeks to ensure the reduction in insurance premiums that is expected to result from reducing extravagant and bogus injury claims will be passed on to customers and should be immediately evidenced in 2021 by a reduction in premiums of at least 20% on the previous year.  Despite significant talk of reform, the insurance market in Ireland is dominated by a small number of key players whose underwriting is largely confidential.  Although much was made in the past 12 months of the cost of bogus injury claims by industry, there was next to no evidence of criminal proceedings being taken for false claims.<\/p>  <p>  I say as a member of the Regional Group included in the claims environment that there must be a propensity for perjury.  The Regional Group has advocated legislation begun by P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh and hopes to see the benefits, with criminal sanctions being pursued for perjury when it is evident in court.  Even with this additional measure, without rigorous year-on-year analysis of the claims environment, legal costs and premiums resulting, we can have no expectations based on past performance that insurers will pass on the full benefits of savings or that such savings may not be consumed in further legal activity costs.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the strategy to curb legal costs in personal injuries insurance claims, the work of the PIAB must be recognised and respected.  This body allows people with soft tissue injuries to access legal services and adequate redress without the need to initiate significant legal challenges.  The majority of claims for personal injuries of a low order can be dealt with in the District Court, where legal fees are capped at &euro;3,500 and injury claims are capped at up to &euro;15,000.<\/p>  <p>  There has been some disquieting commentary recently on the possible attachment of post-traumatic stress disorder syndromes to future soft tissue personal injury claims.  This would open a vista of actions proceeding to the Circuit or High Courts where awards and legal fees that can be expected are a multiple of those in the District Court.  I endorse the right of somebody who has suffered a significant injury to claim sufficient and even exemplary damages when negligence is proven but it is known that we already demonstrate a high volume of litigation in comparison to European peers.  This is a metric that must be reviewed year-on-year, along with the future analysis sought by this motion.<\/p>  <p>  Insurance cover was always meant to offer a defence for injury and damage resulting from the unexpected.  In recent years in Ireland, however, we have created the expectancy that every risk is unavoidable and every resulting injury the responsibility of anyone in the vicinity with adequate insurance cover to sustain a claim.  Insurance cover has become a massive burden for many businesses and individuals and is doing enormous damage to our national competitiveness and the social fabric.  Insurance fraud is theft, as is price gouging on vulnerable payers. <\/p>  <p>  To the degree this can be analysed, I welcome what the Bill supports.  Despite what the Government has put forward, I hope we will see scrutiny and analysis of Central Bank data over the coming months to tell us whether the reforms that have been recently adopted are having any effect on the market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100041#QQ00200","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speech","time":1622572500,"counter":288,"content":"<p>Moving on to the Rural Independent Group, there are four speakers.

Those savings must be passed on to customers in the form of lower prices.  There must be no excuses.  We have spent years and years discussing this matter here and it is falling on deaf ears.  I fully support the Bill brought forward by Sinn F&eacute;in.<\/p>  <p>  We saw during Covid how businesses were left high and dry with no insurance to cover them for closures.  The way publicans were treated was nothing short of scandalous.  Their businesses were and continue to be ruined and wrecked by Government.  The insurance companies tried every which way to get out of it and it was like a scam in its own right until they were held to account by the courts.  Some of them were trying to defend themselves after that again.  They remind me a bit of An Taisce.  They throw in appeal after appeal and, when they lose a case, they keep coming back again.  The insurance companies are ruthless in their attempts to destroy people instead of working with people.  I am very annoyed at the way insurance companies have worked.<\/p>  <p>  We also saw the debacle with insurance related to the flooding in west Cork, including Bantry, Skibbereen, Bandon, Rathbarry and Rosscarbery.  People had property insured but when they get flooded once, they will never again get insurance.  The Government brought in a compensation package for businesses. That package should have covered businesses, regardless of whether they had insurance.  I know of hotels in Skibbereen and many businesses in Bantry that were destroyed.  It is crazy that some that had insurance could not get the compensation package and some of those that had insurance are still holding out.  I met a businessperson over the weekend who still has not been paid by the insurance company.  He told me they do not know whether they will get the business up and running again.  Young drivers all over the country are being quoted enormous amounts.  These young people cannot afford that.  The Government has to come in here.<\/p>  <p>  On a different issue completely, I met with the west Cork credit unions yesterday.

Publicans who have business interruption insurance ring me every day and the insurance companies use every rule in the book to keep from paying, such as the fact there was not an outbreak in the public house itself.  It is blackguarding.<\/p>  <p>  I operate on the principle of &ldquo;N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile&rdquo;.  We are all in this together.  We were not all in this together.  Big businesses have cleaned up during this Covid pandemic over the past 14 months.  Insurance companies had no claims going on because pubs and many other businesses were closed and they gave a miserly couple of euro off.  In some cases, it was &euro;40 out of a &euro;7,000 premium.  Now they are pressurising them to get their insurance renewed.  They give them 21 days and if they do not go with them, they will be penalised again.  It is a shocking cartel out there with price gouging and everything else. <\/p>  <p>  Young people are trying to get on the road, but face the ineptitude of the RSA and the NDLS and the carry-on there.  There are 100,000 people waiting to get going.  How will we get our economy recovering?  Pass-through charges are extortionate.  One hotelier was charged &euro;30,000 while his hotel was closed.

The problem is as outlined in the Bill.  We want to bring down the cost of claims and we want to give the savings back to the customers.  Young people are paying enormous sums trying to get on the road.  Young boys and young girls want to get the wheels underneath them and to get on the road to earn a living, go to work and do what they have to do in their lives.<\/p>  <p>  We have serial complainants.  I have no problem in the world with people claiming if there is a serious accident or if something happens, but one thing that should happen in the courts is that a person's previous history of what I call \"misfortune\" should be taken into account, in other words, if they seem to find holes in the road to fall into or if they seem to continuously be bumping and humping into people along the road and claiming.  Why does that not come out during the course of a court case?  Why is a person's record not laid bare to see if he or she has previous claims?  If somebody is continuously claiming, there is something continuously wrong.  We have had situations in places such as Kenmare and Sneem where businesses were flooded.  Sometimes people find it awfully difficult to get insurance again afterwards.  We must be able to take on such situations and make sure businesses can get insurance and that they can be up and running and have proper cover.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to bringing down the cost of claims, one thing to do is ensure that there is due vigilance and when claims are made that they conform to the rigour of the law.  If an individual gets an amount for one type of damage in England or in any part of Europe, why should a person be able to get double the money here?  I am not trying to make little of it but a person often got a lot worse than a soft tissue injury or a sore neck on a football field or playing hurling and he or she managed to keep going afterwards and there was nothing about it.  Why is it that in Ireland there seems to be this game of going to the courts?  It is like an industry in itself.  That is wrong.  It should not be allowed.  Somebody has to pay.

They deserve to get a chance, but they honestly do not.  They have not been getting a chance and I am afraid they will not get a chance.  When elderly people and young people have cars that exceed ten years of age the insurance companies invariably tell them they cannot be insured.  They will not insure them even though they have a valid NCT or MOT.  What is missing out of the frame is that the insurance companies have a monopoly.  Whatever they say about Mr. Quinn, we were able to pay for insurance when he was there, but now whatever they get is not enough.<\/p>  <p>  The big worry for many people and businesses is that they will not even get a quote for next year.

One insurance company told me it would have to give money to a man because he was a customer of the company's as well.  He did not deserve money.  That is the truth of it.  He did not deserve what he got, but someone had to pay a dear claim and it put up his insurance because of the actions of the insurance companies.<\/p>  <p>  It is very evident to me that the insurance companies and the banks are destroying young people.

I pay tribute to Deputy Doherty for bringing it forward because it is necessary and important to do so.  The Bill intends to ensure that the Central Bank is informed by insurance companies on the effect of the personal injury requirements on insurance.  We all know that insurance is a statutory requirement that everybody needs to have but, in reality, insurance companies use it as an excuse.  As soon as a claim becomes possible, they try to get out of it.  That is the reality of the situation.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, because of the system we have in the D&aacute;il, Opposition Members cannot introduce Bills that make real change.  I imagine this Bill could be a lot stronger and could be introduced in a way to make real changes to how the insurance system works.  I welcome the Government's acceptance of the Bill, but it is kicking it down the road for nine months.  What does the Government hope will happen in that nine months?  In recent months we have seen the Government accept most Private Members' Bills and motions that have been introduced.  Is the Government afraid of seeing the figures go up when the vote takes place?  Rather than the Government getting a kicking on social media and in the press for voting down the legislation, it has decided to kick it down the road for nine months on the basis that it will probably die on Committee Stage or it can be finished off in some way that will attract less publicity and look better for the Government.  The Government wants to look good by accepting everything: to show it wants to help everybody by taking something on board.<\/p>  <p>  I do not know if this is parliamentary language, but it is basically a load of crap.  I would have more respect for the Government if it would stand up and say why it is opposing something or why it thinks something is not working or could not work.  Why does the Government not come straight out and say that what it wants to do is ensure that insurance companies in this case have an easy ride, so that they can make money and keep it in the system as quickly as possible, and they do that on the backs of those in society who must have insurance because people cannot go on the road or open a business unless they have insurance?  Why does the Government not say its role is to make it as smooth as possible for insurance companies in order to keep them here?  That is really what is happening.<\/p>  <p>  The system has been exposed big time through the pandemic.  Insurance companies included pandemic insurance as an add-on to make their insurance look far better than what anybody else was offering, but as soon as it happened they tried to find an excuse not to pay compensation.  People had to take cases and go to court.  The cases are going through the courts now and people have won.  Insurance companies will not offer pandemic insurance from this point on because they know there is a chance they could get caught.<\/p> <p>They will find something else to offer as a marketing tool.  That is sad but it is the reality of the situation and it will not change while this Government is in power.<\/p> <p> I spoke earlier about the Government accepting motions.  I moved the Thirty-Seventh Amendment of the Constitution (Economic, Social and Cultural Rights) Bill during Private Members' business some months ago calling for a referendum to put those rights in the Constitution, including a constitutionally protected right to housing.  Rather than vote it down, and even though we know the Government is not in favour of that, it decided that the Bill would be read two years later.  That makes it look like the Government supports it but after two years, when the Bill comes up on Committee Stage, I will be pushing it big-time and we will see then if the Government is actually in favour of it.  I do not think it will be and it will look to kill it off completely.  A number of weeks ago, I tabled a Private Members' motion on the Common Agricultural Policy, how to make it work for small farmers across rural Ireland, in Donegal, Mayo and along the west coast, and how European  money could be used to benefit all of them.  The Government accepted the motion which, at the time, was a tribute to it, or so we thought.  Now, however, we discover there is a call for an emergency motion in the House because the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is in Europe, negotiating the Common Agricultural Policy in order to undo what this House agreed to do and said should be done a few weeks ago.  That is the nonsensical nature of this whole process and it shows up what the Government is trying to do.  It is kicking it further down the road and making sure it does not have to make a decision, but it does not want to appear that it is voting against these motions.  It is sad that is the level at which the Government is going to pursue it.  I think I am right.  The Government might argue I am not but if I am, time will tell.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100042#RR00400","speaker":"1547","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622573700,"counter":296,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for an engaging discussion on the issue of insurance reform.  It is clear we all agree on the need for ongoing work to improve both the affordability and availability of all types of insurance.  That is the Government's policy intention and that is why we published the action plan for insurance reform in December to drive this agenda forward.  While the Government appreciates what the Deputy is trying to achieve with this Bill, it is still not clear from this debate what added value the Bill could provide beyond what the national claims information database currently offers in monitoring claims costs and premium prices.  A single Bill cannot be seen as holding the insurance industry to account.  Instead, there must be ongoing engagement by the Government's Cabinet committee subgroup and the insurance industry, as well as other stakeholders representing civic society, business and consumers, to ensure that any savings are being passed on.  This is the approach Government is driving from the centre.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill will do nothing to help the average consumer or business when they are purchasing insurance.  The Government is interested in implementing real reforms which bring tangible benefits.  The approach proposed in this Bill is merely a data collecting exercise, an administrative burden and an additional cost on insurers that will only show what alternative data sources already illustrate, namely, whether prices are falling or rising.  Whether this is attributable to the personal injuries guideline changes and what premiums may have been in the absence of these guidelines is quite academic.  What is clear is that progress in this area needs to be multi-pronged and involve a cross-departmental policy approach.  In time, we will be able to draw our own clear, evidence-based conclusions from future national claims information database reports as to the impact of the new guidelines on insurance premiums, along with other aspects of the Government's reform agenda.<\/p>  <p>  The availability of insurance is crucial for businesses, in particular as we emerge from the pandemic and begin rebuilding the economy.  The Government has provided unprecedented support to those businesses over the past year and we expect insurers to play their role as society starts to reopen.  Even before Covid-19, Brexit and a tightening in the global markets for certain types of insurance, such as professional indemnity insurance, had started creating supply pinch point issues here and worldwide.  As the Minister of State with responsibility for Government procurement, I have seen the impact of this, particularly in the construction sector.  One of the Government's key aims is to promote competition in the insurance market here, and that includes attracting new providers to enter.  Unfortunately, this Bill will not assist in either of those aims.  Indeed, if we do not succeed in getting the balance correct, it could send out a message that runs counter to those very objectives.<\/p>  <p>  I note from the debate, and from media coverage over the weekend, reference to a survey hosted on the Sinn F&eacute;in website, which indicates that 58% of the 1,363 respondents who received their renewal since the new guidelines came into effect saw their premiums increase.  While some customers may still see increases in their motor insurance premium, perhaps because of their individual circumstances, we need to be cautious in drawing conclusions from these figures as it is simply too early to do so.  The Minister for Justice is to make a report to Government by the end of this year assessing the impact of the guidelines.  Official data have shown that prices have been declining for some time.  Accordingly, these findings are at odds with official data published by the CSO and the Central Bank.<\/p>  <p>  While the Opposition may feel that it has had a monopoly on introducing insurance legislation, I remind the House a large volume of insurance legislation has been introduced by Government in recent years, particularly arising from the cost of insurance working group's recommendations.  These include the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018 to increase transparency around insurance costs and claims; the Insurance (Amendment) Act 2018 to enhance the insurance compensation fund framework to protect third-party motor claimants in the event of an insurance firm failure; the Judicial Council Act 2019, which provides for a Judicial Council setting new personal injury guidelines in place of the current book of quantum; and the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019 to enhance the PIAB and provide for amendments to the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 to make it easier for businesses to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected.  In addition, the Consumer Insurance Contracts Act 2019 was introduced with the assistance of the Government and Deputies across all parties.  I remind Deputy Doherty that a number of substantial amendments were introduced by the Government to make that particular legislation workable and that remaining provisions will be commenced in September.  All of these legislative measures, I contend, represent a solid record of legislative action in this critically important sector.<\/p>  <p>  I assure the House that there has been substantial engagement with insurers in recent months.  The T&aacute;naiste and a range of Ministers from all Government parties were actively involved in the matter.  The key stakeholders have been met and the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, has recently concluded a series of engagements with the main firms.  In these, he raised the need for the industry to respond to both the Government's ongoing reforms, in particular the new guidelines, and the Covid-19 pandemic by lowering premiums and continuing to offer forbearance measures.  These were undertaken in a positive manner, with many insurers indicating they intended to reduce premiums in response to the new guidelines.  This was confirmed to Oireachtas Members as recently as last week.  Further ministerial meetings will take place later this year to review progress in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, the amendment seeking to have the Bill read a Second Time in nine months is the correct course of action.  We should not lose sight of the fact the Government has developed a comprehensive, whole-of-government action plan for insurance reform that addresses insurance issues in a structured, targeted manner, and we are holding the insurance industry to account in regard to passing on savings arising from reforms delivered to date.  In addition, we will examine whether existing tools such as the national claims information database can be used to do this more effectively.  This will feed into work under way within the Department of Finance on considering a number of potential legislative measures in regard to consumer matters, including issues that were discussed this evening.  Accordingly, we are not supporting the moving of this Bill and, instead, we seek that the matter be considered again by the House in nine months after important work has been done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100043#SS00200","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1622573700,"counter":297,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Quinlivan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100043#SS00300","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1622573700,"counter":298,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

I often think how when Ministers come in and read scripts, it can really sound like they are reading them for the first time.  I wonder to whether they believe all the stuff that is in the text.  The Minister of State indicated that a single item of legislation will not hold the industry to account.  Of course it will not, but doing nothing will definitely not lead to the industry being held to account.  I was fascinated to hear the multi-pronged approach that the Minister of State just outlined because it does not seem to be having an impact.  Instead of reading from scripts, what Teachta Doherty and we have done is talk to people.  Some 58% of the people who responded to the survey said that their premiums have gone up.  When people say the proof of the pudding is in the eating, the eating of the pudding shows that the premiums are going up.  It is not good enough to say we should wait or add another prong to the multi-pronged approach or we should try to put another name on it - what people need and want is action.<\/p> <p> I am talking about people in my constituency who work in tourism-dependent industries and experience-type industries and who cannot afford to insure their businesses.  I am talking about young people who, because of poor transport infrastructure, have absolutely no choice but to have a car to be able to get on the road.  Those people do not want to wait and they should not have to wait nine months for another prong to be added or for there to be more deliberations or whatever it is that the Minister of State is doing because it is not working.  People want concrete action that will achieve results.  I talk to businesses and they are wary and fearful about reopening.  The last thing they need to see is their insurance premiums going up.  I urge the Government to think about the people who are affected, withdraw the nonsensical amendment, work with Teachta Doherty who has the support of people in the House and the credibility and track record and start to deliver for people who need to see their premiums come down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100043#SS00500","speaker":"1467","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622574300,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I thank my colleague, Deputy Doherty, for bringing forward the Judicial Council (Amendment) Bill.  The work he has done to tackle the artificially high premiums has been tremendous.  If adopted this Bill will have a really positive impact on insurance customers across the State.  I was disappointed to hear the responses from both Ministers of State.  When I lived in America, people would use the phrase \"ma&ntilde;ana, ma&ntilde;ana\", which means tomorrow, or we will basically do nothing.  The nine months mentioned by the Minister of State suggests that he is stalling again, kicking the can down the road.  We accept that we need insurance for myriad reasons, and there are associated costs and we presume this cost will be fair.  What is not acceptable is the artificially high premiums and the failure to pass on savings and damage awards to loyal customers.<\/p>  <p>  On 24 April, the personal injuries guidelines came into effect.  They reduce the cost of damages awarded by insurance companies.  These guidelines reduce the cost of pay outs for personal injury claims by between 31% and 69%.  In the month or so since these guidelines came into effect, the premiums paid by consumers remained high and less than a quarter of consumers have seen their premium reduce.  It is worth reminding ourselves that the when the insurance companies were before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure, Reform and Taoiseach in 2019, they committed to reducing premiums if damages to personal injuries were reduced.  They have not done this.  It was suggested that if damages were reduced by 50%, motor insurance and business insurance would fall by an average of 15% to 20%, respectively.  This has not happened.  The promise to reduce premiums has yet to come to pass.  We cannot rely on insurance companies to pass these savings on to their customers without pressure.  Had they wanted to, they would have done so already by reducing premiums.  We must take steps to ensure that these savings are passed on to people.  Rather than sit back and hope that insurance companies act in the interest of consumers as that has been the approach of successive Governments with little reward, Sinn F&eacute;in is introducing this Bill which would benefit motorists, homeowners and business owners.  It will create the conditions where much fairer pricing can be provided to insurance customers who for too long have been overcharged for their premiums.  Our nearest neighbours in Britain have similar regulations, with many of the same insurance companies operating in both jurisdictions.  If we were interested, we could sort out this issue if we wanted to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100044#TT00200","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1622574300,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I thank all the Deputies who spoke in tonight's debate on this legislation and all those who had kind words for myself and my party's campaign on insurance costs.  There was reference earlier to the Government trying to steal my homework.  I do not give a damn which Minister takes any of the work that I have done and runs with it.  They can have it all, they can have this Bill, the dual pricing legislation - they should go and do it, run with it, but do not delay it.  I was taken aback by the contribution by the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth.  It was mind-blowing because it was basically saying \"You're not as great as you think you are\".  I do not care.  I have only one agenda, and that is to drive down insurance costs.  That is all this is about.  He said that this legislation will do nothing.  He says after tonight's debate he still does not understand what is required.  Let me spell it out to him, after his very embarrassing contribution to the House.  This legislation is based on what the existing companies in Ireland, AXA, AIG, Aviva, Alliance, Zurich and RSA, have to do in the North and in Britain.  In Britain they gave a commitment that if awards were reduced, they would pass on the savings pound for pound to the customers.  In this State, they gave the finance committee the same assurances in 2019.  There is absolutely no way that we can ever know if that commitment is being delivered on.  Why?  It is because although the national claims information database collects a great deal of information from insurance companies, there is a crucial piece of information that it does not have the power to collect, namely: what would the premiums be if these new guidelines did not come into effect; and what level of awards would be paid out by the insurance industry if these new guidelines did not come into effect.  That is what these insurance companies have to do, audited by an independent auditor and provided to the central bank, the Bank of England.  That is what this legislation demands of them to do.  That means the Government holds them to account.<\/p>  <p>  We can find out whether they are delivering on their promise.  We may see some companies reduce premiums by 8% or maybe 12% or 14% but nobody in this House will ever have an idea whether that was actually passing on the full amount of the reduction in awards that was enabled through the passing of the Judicial Council Act.  If the Minister of State did not understand it, perhaps he understands it now.  This is a serious piece of legislation, which, thankfully, the Alliance for Insurance Reform is backing.  I welcome the work it has done with all parties across this House on reforming the insurance industry and driving down the cost of insurance.  This is not a gimmick.  This is about making sure that prices that should have been reduced for every single motorist who did not have a claim or who did not change their policy.  They should have seen a reduction after the implementation of these guidelines on 24 April.  The Minister of State said that the survey we conducted was out of kilter.  I was talking to a Deputy earlier who said it was a pity he had not had speaking time because he had just got his insurance renewal and the price had increased by &euro;100.  This is what is happening in the real world and we are letting the industry off the hook.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier, the Minister of State from Fianna F&aacute;il said that this is one element and it would be naive to think it was a magic bullet which was going to fix everything.  I never said that.  He went on to list reports, and say that we had to wait for reports.  One report was on dual pricing.  It was the result of a super-claim that I made in 2019 to the Central Bank that actually instigated that report.  Two reports we already got, the final one in July.  Then he talked about the coming into effect of the Consumer Insurance Contracts Act 2019, whereby people will be able to see their claims and premiums over the last five years.  Again, that is legislation I drafted, specifically that section, and brought into effect in 2019 but the two Ministers of State here have been delaying its implementation in the interim.  It will not come into force until September.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, went on to state that the national claims information database will have public liability information.  That is hugely welcome, and I argued for in 2019 when the legislation was being passed, and should not be delayed.  Then he said we would have crucial information when more information relating to motor insurance is published by the national claims information database.  That will not actually not take into account the timelines here.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, I do not care whose name is on the legislation.  What I do care about is that insurance companies are held to account.  It was an embarrassing contribution given by both Ministers of State this evening that could have been written by any one of the big giants of the insurance industry, giants which only last week rejected the findings of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission to the effect that they are operating a cartel.<\/p> <p>The negative point is that the Government has been delaying matters for nine months.  The positive one is this legislation will pass Second Stage.  This will send out a signal to the industry that it has nowhere to hide.  I noted the comment by the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, to the effect he is considering his own legislation and he may take the spirit of this legislation on board.  I implore him to address this.  I do not care whose name is on the legislation.  Let us do this.  Let us hold the industry to account and make sure it passes on, euro for euro, the premium reduction it promised two years ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100044#TT00300","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1622574900,"counter":304,"content":"<p>Amendment put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1622574900,"counter":305,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 80(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time tomorrow night.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100045#UU00300","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1622574900,"counter":306,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna - Questions (Resumed) - Ceisteanna ar Sonra&iacute;odh Uain D&oacute;ibh - Priority Questions","time":1622574900,"counter":308,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100045#UU00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cybersecurity Policy","time":1622574900,"counter":309,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100045#UU00700"},{"type":"question","time":1622574900,"counter":310,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[29408\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100045#UU00800","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"his plans to increase funding and resourcing for the National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC; when the capacity review of the centre will be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1507","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1622574900,"counter":311,"content":"<p>What are the Minister of State's plans to increase funding and resources for the NCSC?

They are also due to a lack of investment in the grid and our lack of options to move and balance power across the island at local and national levels.  One of the other things which is becoming increasingly clear, and which I see in my everyday life as a member of the Government, is that new industrial developments and employment opportunities are increasingly going to those areas where the grid is secure and accessible.  This is one of the reasons an overground solution presented itself.  Such a solution allows for the north east to attract industry which will need to connect into that grid.  This will only work, however, if it is part of a stable grid.  This requires North-South interconnections.

The idea is to set up areas in villages or towns that have broadband which can be used by anyone living in the area.  Some 317 of these have been set up around the country.  They can be rolled out much more quickly than fibre connections.

The threat of attack by cyber criminals is increasing across the world.\u00a0 Ireland is recognised by the global cybersecurity index as one of the countries that are ranked highly in terms of our commitment to cybersecurity.  Addressing the growing\u00a0threat requires a combination of responses, including actions by the State, by individual organisations and by all of us, as citizens.  While ensuring the security of the networks and information systems of organisations is a matter for each individual organisation, the National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC, plays an important role in this area.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSC was established by Government decision with a broad remit across the cybersecurity of Government ICT and critical national infrastructure.  It acts as a central contact point in the event of a Government-wide or nationwide cybersecurity incident affecting the State.  The NCSC also co-ordinates and supports the response to significant incidents, with the lead role being taken by the entity affected by the incident.<\/p> <p> Information sharing is a key component of the work of the NCSC, whereby it acts as a source of expert advice and guidance.  The NCSC gathers threat intelligence data, trends and risks from national, global and local sources, and it then shares that information with the people and organisations who need those data to protect their own systems.  It supports public bodies, operators of essential services and digital service providers to improve their cybersecurity posture and to fulfil their obligations under the European network and information security directive.  The NCSC takes a very proactive role by supporting these organisations to build their cybersecurity resilience continually through a range of initiatives, including by publishing advisories based on the most recent threat intelligence and by hosting seminars and workshops.<\/p> <p> Going forward, it is important that every organisation, public and private, continues to invest in strengthening its cybersecurity resilience.  Recognising the need to evolve continually, a capacity review of the NCSC is being undertaken.

Every Deputy in the House wants to know about the acceleration of broadband provision and when it will come to their area.  It is not just an issue for rural areas.  Even in urban areas, there are black spots.<\/p>  <p>  As I outlined in my reply to Deputy Canney's question, the programme for Government\u00a0commits to seek to accelerate the roll-out of the national broadband plan, NBP.  My Department is currently engaging with National Broadband Ireland, NBI, to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of the NBP roll-out, with the aim\u00a0of bringing forward premises that are currently scheduled in years six and seven of the\u00a0network build\u00a0plan.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has recently written to NBI seeking to put the acceleration\u00a0of the programme on a contractual footing.  Any change to the contract will require detailed technical, commercial and financial analysis by both parties. <\/p>  <p>  NBI has established a dedicated team to investigate the potential for acceleration of the fibre network roll-out from its current contracted schedule of seven years.  Substantial work has been completed by the team to date, including productive engagement with current build partners.  It is premature at this point to speculate as to how many premises may benefit from this potential change.  I can\u00a0say that the premises currently scheduled for the latter end of the roll-out will be the focus of the analysis.<\/p>  <p>  While significant progress has been made by NBI over the past year, in challenging circumstances, the pandemic has caused delays to elements of the programme.  A remedial plan to mitigate those delays has been agreed and it is in this context that the potential to accelerate the network roll-out is being explored.  I expect to receive a detailed assessment from my officials by the autumn and will then bring an update to Government on the matter. <\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high-speed broadband within the intervention area for connection over the term of the NBP.  An acceleration of this aspect of the plan\u00a0will see some 679 primary schools connected to high-speed broadband by the end of next year, well ahead of the original\u00a0target delivery timeframe of 2026.

In fairness, the NBI offered me similar information to what the Minister of State has just given.  Reference was made to the Department having eyes on the section 254 applications that are in place and that things are looking positive as regards dealing with local authorities and planning out the whole system.  The NBI representative also mentioned that acceleration requires a complete audit of everything and looking to almost double capacity in reference to the past two years, if everything is moved from years six and seven into years four and five.

There is a plan in place for this particular roll-out but there will be huge areas for which it will be three, four or five years before they have proper broadband provision.

Mobile telephone companies and satellite broadband providers offer some solutions but we probably need an element of a State audit and to look at anything that can be done to facilitate capacity and ensure we can offer an interim solution to those areas.

Fixed wireless access will be suitable in some situations.  More mobile masts will provide some type of basic broadband connection, and for many people that will be the answer.  It will not be easy.

As a first step in that process, the Minister launched a new waste action plan for a circular economy in 2020.  This action plan goes beyond waste management.  It looks at resource use much more broadly to capture and maximise the ongoing value of materials that might in the past have been discarded.

It is undergoing public consultation.  Its first iteration aims to provide an overall framework for circular economy policy development.  I intend to have the strategy updated in full every 18 months to two years.  Future versions will include specific actions and targets for all Departments and sectors of the economy.  Following publication of the strategy, an interdepartmental circular economy working group will be established to drive cross-government implementation.

In Cork, there is the plant in Aghada, all the energy assets and the pharmaceutical industries, so it has the same combination.  It is close to offshore wind energy that can be brought ashore.  It will only work if we get the planning right, particularly the environmental planning.  Critical to that, the Government is developing a marine area planning Bill which will be published within the next few weeks, as I understand.  We will have to manage this in a careful way to protect marine life and to be conscious of visual issues from the shore, but I believe it can be done.  To answer the Deputy&rsquo;s question, yes, I believe we can get that done.  There is no direct result that means offshore wind must be excluded from marine protected areas.  It can complement nature protection because there can be an area that is not trawled or is deliberately left idle because of the turbines, and that can see a potential return for marine life.<\/p>  <p>  In the development of the projects, we must be careful about seabirds and their feeding.  I believe this is achievable.  We are already starting to see development. There was an announcement, as well as the advert in Cork I mentioned, for a firm based in Ballycotton, which is looking at a development in Aghada.  I know it will take time, but this is the first of what I expect to be the industrial development of the future for our country.

This certificate is required for the purposes of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.  A primary medical certificate is only awarded to people with a very high level of disability.  Holders of the certificate automatically qualify for a disabled parking permit.  The primary medical certificate also provides a tax relief or fuel rebate for disabled drivers and passengers.  Reliefs may also be used to help disabled drivers adapt their vehicles.<\/p><p>Qualification for the primary medical certificate is subject to one of several conditions, for example, being wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs, or being wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg.  The conditions go on like that and it shows us how archaic the system is at this stage, that these are the criteria which are still used regarding qualification.<\/p><p>I am led to believe the HSE is considering the matter of primary medical certificate assessments in the context of its revision of the HSE recovery and restoration plan.  In reply to a recent parliamentary question, the Minister for Finance stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tFollowing approval of the Finance Act 2020, which provides for the medical criteria for the Disabled Drivers Scheme in primary legislation, a comprehensive review of the scheme, to include a broader review of mobility supports for persons with disabilities and the criteria for qualification for the Scheme, will be conducted this year.  On foot of that review new proposals will be brought forward for consideration. <\/blockquote>  <p>I have many examples of people who are discommoded by the scheme.  This scheme has been frozen for quite some time and it is hoped this review will come forward, but I have my doubts.  For example, one gentleman, who has just turned 50, suffers from idiopathic Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, dystonia, which is severe cramping, and dyskinesia, which is an involuntary movement.<\/p> <p>He applied for the certificate in June 2018.  The medical officer assessed him at home and told him on the day that he would not qualify under the criteria.  He received the refusal letter on 27 November 2018.  He was told he would not qualify until the criteria change.  This gentleman had to get a loan to buy an automatic car as he was no longer able to drive a manual vehicle.  No supports were available for this man and his family even though he had a registered carer.<\/p> <p>  Another example is a woman in her late 40s who is registered with the Irish Wheelchair Association and was refused a primary medical certificate.  She had an accident in 2007 and has had multiple back surgeries to allow her to be able to walk.  She has bolts and screws all over her back.  If she was to lie down on a floor, she would not be able to get back up.  She is in chronic pain, unable to work and finds walking a challenge.  The last operation she had was in 2015.  She lost the use of her left leg for over a year but movement has partially returned.  She is unable to use public transport.  This is a scheme she would benefit from but she does not satisfy the criteria. She has applied many times and been refused.<\/p> <p> There is no review process for these applications.  An applicant can appeal but will have to travel to the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal in D&uacute;n Laoghaire for a hearing.  Before Covid, it was taking a year for appeals to be heard and at that stage, when people are in chronic pain, they cannot travel what is a long distance in some cases.  A review system should be set up and made accessible in each county, similar to the social welfare appeals that are called for oral hearings.<\/p> <p> In September 2019, the Minister for Finance stated that he had no intention of reviewing the criteria that allowed people to qualify for the scheme.  A new functional scheme needs to be put in place without delay because there are many people who would benefit.  As a society, we should make sure people benefit from this scheme and contribute to our society by being able to purchase vehicles and secure transport for themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100054#DDD01200","speaker":"1547","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622580900,"counter":443,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  He has outlined some difficult cases he is aware of and there are many such cases throughout the country.<\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  The disabled drivers and passengers scheme provides relief from vehicle registration tax and VAT on the purchase and use of an adapted car, as well as an exemption from motor tax and an annual fuel grant.  The cost of the scheme in 2020, excluding motor tax, was &euro;67 million.  The scheme is open to severely and permanently disabled persons, as drivers or passengers, and also to certain charitable organisations.  In order to qualify for relief, the applicant must hold a primary medical certificate issued by the relevant senior medical officer or a board medical certificate issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal.  Certain other qualifying criteria apply in relation to the vehicle, in particular that it must be specifically constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  To qualify for a primary medical certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled with a physical disability.  The terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 set out the following medical criteria, at least one of which is required to be satisfied in order to obtain a primary medical certificate: be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg; be without both hands or without both arms; be without one or both legs; be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; or have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.  I think everyone would agree that is language from a different era.  None of us would write medical criteria like that in this day and age but that was in the legislation, which is now subject to the recent Supreme Court decision.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  The medical criteria for the tax concessions available under the scheme have changed over time.  When the scheme was first introduced in 1968, the legislation only allowed for one medical ground.  In 1989, four medical grounds were added.  In 1994, one additional medical ground was added.  The Supreme Court decision of 18 June 2020 found in favour of two appellants against the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal's refusal to grant them a primary medical certificate.  The judgment found that the medical criteria set out in the regulations did not align with the regulation-making mandate given in the primary legislation to further define criteria for severely and permanently disabled persons.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  On foot of legal advice, it became clear that it was appropriate to revisit the six medical criteria set out in regulation No. 3 of SI 353 of 1994.  In such circumstances, primary medical certificate assessments were discontinued until a revised basis for such assessments could be established.  The medical officers who are responsible for conducting the assessments need to have assurance that the decisions they make are based on clear criteria set out in legislation.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  In order to allow for assessments to recommence, the Minister for Finance brought forward an amendment to the Finance Bill to provide for the existing medical criteria in primary legislation.  Following approval of the Finance Act 2020, the HSE has been informed that medical assessments can recommence from 1 January 2021.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  The scheme is still in operation.  All persons or charitable organisations can currently access the scheme.  While some assessments have taken place this year, some of the key medical officers involved are tied up with the roll-out of Covid vaccines and that has led to a delay.

They are salt-of-the-sea people, as opposed to salt-of-the-earth people.  They are decent, hard-working families who are concerned about the future.  They are concerned about the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP.  They say Ireland has not been allocated a fair share of fish quotas that reflect the contribution of our fishers across the European Union.  They are also concerned about the Brexit trade and co-operation agreement, TCA, between the UK and the EU.  They say it is unfair and unjust and penalised Ireland's fishing industry.  They are worried about the penalty points system.  We have had this debate back and forth on a few occasions.  They maintain that it should only be applied to licence holders and skippers following a court conviction.  They maintain the fact that there is no appeal mechanism for it is unfair.<\/p>  <p>  They maintain the revoking of Ireland's fish landing and control plan by the European Commission is impacting on the reputation of the entire Irish fishing industry.  They take issue with having to weigh the fish on the quay side, de-ice the fish and then re-ice it and bring it on from there.  They say it is unsafe as there are no hazard analysis and critical control point, HACCP, controls.  I ask the Minister to comment on that.<\/p>  <p>  The fishermen are concerned about our fishing grounds at Rockall.  They want a review of the migrant workers atypical scheme.  They also want the Brexit adjustment reserve fund, of which &euro;1.2 billion is said to be available to Ireland, to be used to redress the damage to the Irish fishing industry caused by the unfair loss of quota.  A compensation package should be assessed and paid on the basis of the loss of earnings that will accrue from generation to generation and year after year in the future.  The Minister might comment on that as well.  What is the situation with respect to the &euro;1.2 billion?<\/p>  <p>  A lot of families around the coast, from Dingle to Wexford, are very concerned about the CFP.  In the previous debate we had a discussion about wind energy off the coast but a lot of these families are worried about whether their future will be sustainable and if they will be able to survive or if they will have to stop fishing altogether.  In industries like fishing and agriculture we need to attract young people to keep the business going and to keep it viable.  It is very hard to attract younger people if there is no future or no wage at the end of a week.  We know how difficult and how challenging it is for fishermen to go out into the Atlantic when the seas are rough and to bring in fresh fish that we all like and enjoy.<\/p>  <p>  I am very interested in hearing the Minister's comments on these points and what he can do to reassure fishermen about their future, that they will have an income and they will be able to put food on their own tables as well as food on other tables, and that they will be treated more fairly, as they see it.  Could the Minister indicate if he is in constant contact with the Irish South &amp;amp; West Fish Producers Organisation?  What can he say to reassure those families about the future of their industry?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100056#FFF00300","speaker":"1515"},{"type":"speech","time":1622581500,"counter":449,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Stanton very much for raising this issue and for giving me an opportunity to update the House on it.  I saw the flotilla on the news coverage last week and I recognise the frustration among fishermen that led to it.  I hope to address some of those issues here in the House tonight.  The main points raised by the fishing industry during the demonstration on 26 May relate to: the inequitable burden on Ireland in terms of the quota transfer to the UK following Brexit; Ireland's share of quota in our 200 nautical mile zone; and issues concerning EU fisheries controls.<\/p>  <p>  The impact of Brexit on Ireland's seafood sector, and the coastal communities dependent on it, is understandably a major issue of concern for the sector.  However, this impact would have been far greater had the Barnier task force agreed to UK demands, or had we been in a no-deal scenario which would have seen all EU vessels barred from UK waters and subsequent displacement into Ireland's fishing zone.  However, that is not to diminish in any way the very real impact that exists, which amounts to a 15% reduction in our national quota between now and 2026.  The aggregate final transfer by Ireland to the UK under the trade and co-operation agreement is estimated at be &euro;43 million.<\/p>  <p>  I assure the House that this Government intends to continue to keep the focus on the disproportionate quota reductions for Ireland.  I have raised the matter of inequitable burden sharing for Ireland at EU level, most recently at the May Agriculture and Fisheries Council held last week, and I will continue to do so whenever an opportunity arises.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the out-take from Ireland's 200 miles exclusive fisheries zone, over the period 2011 to 2015 average landings of all species amounted to just under 387,000 tonnes with an approximate value of &euro;444 million.  Of that, Ireland accounts for 42% by weight and 36% by value.  I am seeking an update for more recent years and will publish the data when I receive them.  I am pursuing every opportunity at EU level to increase the available quotas for our fishing fleet.  As I have previously advised the House, I am committed to doing all possible through the upcoming review of the CFP to secure additional quota, where possible, for Irish fishers.<\/p>  <p>  Fishers also raised the issue of fisheries control.  The monitoring and control of fishing vessels within Ireland's exclusive fisheries zone are matters for the Irish control authorities.  Under the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006, all operational issues of this nature are exclusively for the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, and the Naval Service.  As Minister, I am expressly precluded from getting involved in operational matters such as this.  The SFPA is currently engaged with the sector on these matters.<\/p>  <p>  The impact of Brexit has been a major blow for the Irish fishing industry, but I am convinced that there is a sustainable future for the sector.  There are opportunities for growth if we invest in and add value to our seafood sector, and there is a strong commitment from the Government to do this.  My objective is to work with the industry to grow the sector in the years ahead.  My Department's action plan for 2021 sets out the priority actions to be implemented this year to drive the development of a sustainable, competitive and innovative seafood sector.  Importantly, I also set up a seafood sector task force, which brings all voices in the sector together, to advise on how we can invest in and develop the sector in the future.  I anticipate receiving the interim report from the task force shortly.  I assure the Deputy and the House that this Government is committed to working with the seafood sector to adjust to the impact of Brexit and to ensure a clear path for the growth of the sector in the years ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100056#FFF00400","speaker":"1546"},{"type":"speech","time":1622581500,"counter":450,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the work he is doing in this area and encourage him to continue in the strongest possible way to assist the fishing industry.  I wish to make two points in particular.  Could the Minister comment on the revoking of Ireland's fish landing control plan by the European Commission, whereby the fish have to be weighed in many instances on the quay side, to be de-iced, weighed and then re-iced again?  It strikes me as being very strange and perhaps even unsafe.<\/p>  <p>  I understand &euro;1.2 billion is said to be available to Ireland from the Brexit adjustment reserve fund.  Could the Minister indicate if any of this could be used to address the damage to the Irish fishing industry caused by what the Minister acknowledges is an unfair loss of quota?  Is any compensation package available to fishermen from the fund to help them?  I would like the Minister to address the two questions on the revoking of Ireland's fish landing control plan and the Brexit adjustment reserve fund.  Has the Minister been able to secure any funding from those moneys to assist fishermen at this time?<\/p>  <p>  Could the Minister comment on the future of the fishing industry in Ireland?  He acknowledged that it is under a lot of pressure.  There is a lot of stress and concern there at the moment.  I commend the fishermen on the demonstration in Cork the other day.  It was respectful and well organised.  They linked up with all the authorities to cause minimum disruption to everybody while getting their message across.  They recognise that others have to make a living as well.  Unfortunately, they may have to do it again to draw attention to the real concerns they have.<\/p> <p>They do not want to be doing this as they want to be out fishing.

I will deal first with the final point, which was the respectful nature in which the fishermen made their protests and their point, and I want to recognise that as well.  They certainly made their point very strongly.<\/p>  <p>  As I said in my opening contribution, any sector that has been impacted in the way they have, coming out of Brexit, where 15% of quota is to be lost between now and 2026, would be massively frustrated, and that is certainly a source of massive frustration to our fishing sector.  The fact a no-deal Brexit would have been worse, or what the British Government was looking for in negotiations would have been worse, is only small consolation given the fact there is a 15% impact.  As I recognise that very strongly, I have set up a fisheries task force to advise on how we can invest in the sector to mitigate the impact of Brexit, alongside the efforts I will make at European level in regard to addressing burden sharing and, importantly, to support the sector financially to grow and to mitigate the impact of Brexit in the time ahead.  I will be very much advised by the fisheries task force on how to go about that.<\/p>  <p>  On weighing at the pier and the revocation of the control plan which facilitated weighing in factories, that has undoubtedly posed a very significant challenge for many fishermen.  It is a decision the European Commission has taken following on from an administrative inquiry that it carried out.  The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority has the legal and operational responsibility in this regard and it is engaging with the sector to seek to address the impact of that decision.  It recently outlined to the Oireachtas committee its intention to work towards developing a new control plan.<\/p>  <p>  I fully understand the impact this will have, particularly for the whitefish sector.  In the wider sense, I will work with the sector in every way I can to deal with the many challenges that face it at the moment and to help it grow into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100057#GGG00200","speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Abuse","time":1622582100,"counter":453,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100057#GGG00250"},{"type":"speech","time":1622582100,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I want to express my disappointment that the Minister, Deputy Foley, is not present.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, for dealing with the matter.<\/p><p>I have raised the issue of redress for victims of historical abuse in Irish national schools numerous times in my five years as a Deputy.  I have spoken specifically in regard to survivors of sexual abuse at Creagh Lane national school in Limerick.  I am deeply frustrated by the glacial pace of progress on this issue so we can imagine the frustration of the survivors.  To quote Professor Conor O&rsquo;Mahony, the Government special rapporteur on child protection, he recently stated that we are quick to criticise other countries who ignore international law but our Government has openly flouted a decision of the European Court of Human Rights on its liability for sexual abuse for seven and a half years and counting.<\/p><p>It is disgraceful how long these men have been waiting for answers.  In 2009, their abuser was convicted but they were excluded from any redress.  In 2014, Louise O'Keeffe won her case in Europe.  The fact that she had to bring her own State to the courts of Europe is a shame on all of us.  The men from Creagh Lane travelled to Brussels in 2017 with the then MEP, Liadh N&iacute; Riada, and myself, and they highlighted their case at the European Parliament to a number of MEPs.  In 2018, the Government of the day had to be defeated in a D&aacute;il motion from Fianna F&aacute;il to ensure that the obnoxious prior complaint requirement was waived.  The then Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, apologised to victims in July 2019.  That same summer, the Minister, Deputy McHugh, stated he was happy to meet with the survivors of Creagh Lane and he said that it is what we do next that counts.  What we did next was to erect new barriers to redress and no meeting has taken place.<\/p><p>To move on to the Thirty-third D&aacute;il, in July 2020, I raised the issue directly with the Taoiseach, who said he would meet with the Department of Education that week with the intention of providing me with a timeline for the roll-out of a new redress scheme.  In September of the same year, the Taoiseach told my party leader that we were still awaiting the outcome of the review.  We are still waiting.  Since then, I twice raised the issue with the T&aacute;naiste in December 2019 and in March of this year.  My party raised the issue and I subsequently wrote to the Taoiseach in March 2021 but, to date, I have not received a reply.<\/p><p>They are no longer young men.  Their childhood and youth was stolen from them by their abuser.  Those who were abused did not just suffer in childhood and this violent intrusion affected many throughout their lives.  For some, there were family breakdowns and they were robbed of an education.  They carry the ramifications of this evil with them every single day.  They were children and now they are ageing men.  Some, unfortunately, are not with us anymore as they have passed away.  They do not have time to wait for an outcome.  They should not have to wait this long for a decision on redress.  This is about a sense of closure to the trauma they have lived with for their entire adult lives.  These men feel utterly abandoned by the State.  Is it any wonder when we consider how callously the State has treated them?<\/p><p>In 2015, an <i>ex gratia<\/i>payment was offered but claimants were required to prove a prior complaint of sexual abuse had been made.  This was impossible.  Thankfully, in 2019, Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill reviewed this and deemed it to be a wrong interpretation which closed off redress to many sexual abuse survivors.  In the D&aacute;il in 2019, the then Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, made an apology to the survivors on behalf of the State.  It was important and long overdue.  The apology was appreciated by the survivors and suggested to them that action would follow.  I stated as much in my remarks to the House that this action and work was needed.  It is now June 2021, 23 months later, and there has been no progress at all on including these men in the redress scheme.<\/p><p>There should not have been a need for review for the former pupils of Creagh Lane.  Their abuse was proven in court and the onus of prior complaint has been rightly removed, yet these men had to fight for every inch they have travelled on this journey towards justice.  They have been outside the gates of Leinster House protesting, they have had to talk about these painful incidents with the media and they have travelled to Brussels to highlight their mistreatment.  The State made Louise O'Keeffe jump through the courts system before she was provided with justice.  Is the Department playing a new game?  To take almost two years to complete a review suggests it is.  I ask the Minister to use the weight of her position to fast-track this review or to intercede directly to ensure redress is provided to the former pupils of Creagh Lane.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100057#GGG00300","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1622582100,"counter":455,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for setting out the timeline from his perspective.  It is important to say the legacy of sexual abuse against children, whether in residential institutions, day schools or in any other setting is harrowing.  I understand the review of the <i>ex gratia<\/i>scheme is ongoing and it is the Minister, Deputy Foley&rsquo;s intention to bring proposals to Government shortly in this regard.<\/p><p>It has always been the contention of the State that it bears no strict liability for abuse in day schools, given the unique context of ownership and management of the schools in the system.  This has been strongly supported by key rulings in the domestic courts relating to the proceedings brought by Louise O&rsquo;Keeffe against the State in 2005 and 2009.  Following the Supreme Court judgment, 203 cases against the State were discontinued by litigants with a commitment by the State that costs would not be pursued against them.  In 2014, as noted by Deputy Quinlivan, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the State bore partial responsibility for what happened to Ms O&rsquo;Keeffe because it had no system in place to act on the complaint that had already been made against her abuser.  In response, and without legal obligation, the State settled the 22 cases where prior complaints had been made and not acted upon.  It also opened an <i>ex gratia<\/i>scheme for those who had already discontinued their cases - there were 203 cases of those - and therefore had no way of coming back into the court system to establish their case that a prior complaint had been made against their abuser and not acted upon because of a lack of a system to address such a complaint.  The scheme received 50 applications, none of which was successful.<\/p><p>The State appointed an independent assessor, retired High Court judge, Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O&rsquo;Neill.  The role of the independent assessor was to assess cases of those who applied for the <i>ex gratia<\/i>scheme but were declined by the State Claims Agency.  In 2019, Mr. Justice O'Neill was asked to review 19 cases which had not been successful in their application to the scheme.  He concluded that 13 were entitled to a payment from the <i>ex gratia <\/i>scheme.  These applications were originally declined because they failed to furnish evidence of a prior complaint.  The State undertook to abide by the determinations of the independent assessor.  All 13 applicants whom the independent assessor determined should be entitled to a payment from the <i>ex gratia <\/i>scheme have been offered payment.  The current position is that 16 offers of payment have been made and I understand that, to date, all 16 have been accepted.  The other six cases referred to the independent assessor are not entitled to a payment from the <i>ex gratia<\/i>scheme because they failed to meet the additional criterion of having discontinued their litigation cases.  It should be noted that the report of the independent assessor is not a legal ruling or judgment.<\/p> <p>It is important to recognise the scheme is addressed towards a specific cohort of historic discontinued day school sexual abuse cases which were impacted on by the European Court of Human Rights judgment in the O&rsquo;Keeffe case.<br\/><br\/>The crux of the Deputy's question was on the <i>ex gratia<\/i>scheme.  Work on this was delayed for a period due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  However, the Department of Education and the Office of the Attorney General are devoting significant resources to progressing this matter and there has been intensive engagement on the most appropriate revisions for the <i>ex gratia<\/i>scheme, including examining in great detail the complex legal questions involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100057#GGG00400","speaker":"1472","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622582700,"counter":457,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her response but it seems from her remarks that these men are no closer to achieving an answer on this.  They still do not know if they are included in the review of the scheme, despite numerous parliamentary questions we have put in.  The Taoiseach himself has met these survivors.  He made both public and private commitments to them on this.  He was vocal on the matter in opposition and before the general election.  The time for review has long passed.  These men deserve and, as a matter of fairness, must be provided with redress.  It is long past the time for the Government to act.  The abuser of these men was convicted in court in 2009.<\/p>  <p>  I will ask the Minister of State some questions and I would appreciate direct responses.  Will she confirm that the ex-pupils of Creagh Lane are to be included in the redress scheme?  Does she anticipate the review being extended further?  Will she provide me and, more importantly, the survivors with a date by which the review will be completed?<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister of State will be aware, the State is facing a court case on 7 July.  The matter needs to be addressed before then.  The State cannot bring all these people in front of the courts; it is so unfair.  Frankly, it is embarrassing the State is resisting and prevaricating on many of the issues of redress and the survivors see no alternative but to go to court to get justice that should be awarded.  The Minister has to intervene to stop this.  I ask the Minister of State to give the survivors a definite answer, give them hope and peace of mind and not to let the State fail these citizens again.  The former pupils of Creagh Lane do not need to be included in any review or any other scheme.  Their case is clear cut.  There is a conviction and, if the political will is there, the issue for them can be resolved.  I hope we can get a better answer than the Minister of State gave in her first reply.  It was very disappointing to come back with legalese.  We are dealing with just 19 people specifically in the Creagh Lane case.  It is clear cut with a conviction in court and commitments from the Taoiseach that he would intervene personally.

T&aacute; br&oacute;n orm ach t&aacute; an freagra as B&eacute;arla.<\/p> <p>As the Deputy will understand, this is a matter for Irish Water in the first instance.  Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has had statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels.  Thus, the prioritisation and progression of individual projects, such as those outlined this evening, are a matter for determination by Irish Water.<br\/><br\/>My Department has made inquiries specifically with Irish Water on the issue mentioned by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  I understand that there is a small waste water treatment system serving a small number of houses in the village and that it is managed by Irish Water, along with its partner, Galway County Council. <br\/><br\/>I am informed that Irish Water has been investigating complaints and that works required to improve this facility are currently being reviewed.  A programme of works is currently being planned.  It is anticipated that these works will be completed in the second half of 2021<font color=\"#FF0000\"><\/font>to alleviate the concerns of residents in the area.  Further information is available from Irish Water's website, or by telephone on 1850 278 278.  Details of all Irish Water's plans and projects are available at <i>www.water.ie<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>Significant and sustained investment is needed to ensure the continued operation, upgrading and repair of the country's water and waste water infrastructure and to support economic growth in the years to come.  In this regard, as part of budget 2021, my Department secured funding of over &euro;1.4 billion to support water services.  This includes &euro;1.3 billion in respect of domestic water services provision by Irish Water.  This overall investment will deliver significant improvements in our public water and waste water services, support improved water supplies right across Ireland, including rural Ireland, and the islands.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100058#HHH00600","speaker":"1512","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622583300,"counter":463,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire St&aacute;it as ucht na ceiste seo a th&oacute;g&aacute;il, ach caithfidh m&eacute; a r&aacute; go bhfuil an t-eolas a tugadh d&oacute; thar a bheith easnamhach.

It is one on which we will follow up in our inquiries with Irish Water.  <\/p>  <p>  The works planned in the second half of 2021 are an immediate priority for Irish Water.  Any future wider works for the village can be considered in the context of longer-term planning.  We will raise this as a matter of priority.
