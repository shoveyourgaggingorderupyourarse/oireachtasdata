From Budget 2014 it was decided to retain the 9% rate to support the increased number of jobs, and latterly, due to the weakness in Sterling following Brexit.  It was for these reasons that I retained the 9% rate in last year&rsquo;s Budget. <\/p>  <p>  I also, however, made a commitment during last year&rsquo;s Finance Bill to undertake a comprehensive economic study of all aspects of the 9% VAT rate in order to better inform any decision in relation to the reduced rate going forward. <\/p>  <p>  The &ldquo;Review of the 9% VAT rate: Analysis of Economic and Sectoral Developments&rdquo; was published by my Department in July 2018.  In addition to assessing the relevance, cost, value-for-money, impact to date of the 9% VAT rate, the Review also looks at the estimated impact on the relevant sectors were the rate to be increased.  <\/p>  <p>  The Review found that tourism expenditure is more sensitive to income growth and the economic cycle than price changes.  The economy is currently performing well, with high levels of employment and strong demand in the tourism sector.  Growth is also expected to continue in the medium term. This positive economic outlook means that the income channel of demand is likely to ensure that economic activity within the 9% rate sector remains strong.  The Review concludes that the VAT rating applied to the tourism sector should not greatly impact demand or employment in the sector.  The Budget decision to increase the VAT rate was made following this analysis.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the expected increase in Exchequer revenues in 2019 as a result of the Budget change, this is estimated to be &euro;466 million.  The VAT rate increase in tourist accommodation is expected to yield &euro;235m in 2019, restaurants are expected to yield &euro;191m, hairdressing is estimated to yield &euro;27m in 2019, bloodstock sales is expected to yield &euro;7m and cinemas and shows is estimated to yield &euro;6m in 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200063#WRA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":9,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 7 to 12, inclusive, answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carbon Tax Yield","counter":10,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200063#WRA00750"},{"type":"question","counter":11,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[48421\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200063#WRA00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount of carbon tax collected on solid fuels in each of the years 2015 to 2017 and to date in 2018, respectively; the steps he is taking to ensure compliance with the law in this regard and secure the revenue base; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":12,"content":"<p>Solid Fuel Carbon Tax was commenced in May 2013 at a rate of &euro;10 per tonne of carbon dioxide emitted when combusted, and was increased to &euro;20 per tonne in 2014. Approximately 75% of solid fuel carbon tax yield relates to coal. <\/p>  <p>  Annual net receipts for the tax amounted to &euro;23.5m in 2015, &euro;24.4m in 2016 and &euro;19.1m in 2017.  As of end October, receipts to date in 2018 amounted to &euro;19.9m.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue has responsibility for administering this tax and takes a risk-focused approach in its deployment of resources on compliance activities.  Solid fuel carbon tax is collected by Revenue on a self-assessment basis and compliance with the law is enforced using the full range of compliance interventions and enforcement provisions for self-assessed taxes. Liable fuel suppliers must file a return and pay for each bi-monthly period by the last day of the following month. Where suppliers do not submit returns by the due date Revenue will issue an estimate of the tax due. If a taxpayer fails to pay the amount due, including any debt for which an estimate has issued, Revenue may refer the debt for enforcement action. This can include sheriff enforcement, civil proceedings through the courts or attachment of third parties. I am advised that, to date, Revenue has undertaken actions to enforce approximately &euro;640,000 of Solid Fuel Carbon Tax.  <\/p>  <p>  Under European Union Single Market constraints, Revenue has no authority to stop vehicles and physically inspect loads of solid fuel. Similarly, the transport or possession of solid fuel that originated in Northern Ireland are not, in themselves, Revenue offences and Revenue officers have no authority to challenge such transportation or possession.<\/p>  <p>  As I, and my predecessor, have pointed out before, because of the price differential with Northern Ireland, the collection of solid fuel carbon tax is heavily reliant on the regulatory regime covering the marketing, sale, distribution and burning of solid fuels in the State. This regulatory regime is operated by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and is enforced by local authorities.  This regime, which imposes higher environmental standards on coal in the State than applies in Northern Ireland, enables local authorities to undertake enforcement action to prevent the sale or distribution of coal that does not meet our standards.  <\/p>  <p>  I am advised that Revenue is working with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to discuss the effectiveness of the regulatory regime for solid fuel and to explore how Revenue could support the Department to improve matters in light of continuing concerns that fuel sourced from Northern Ireland is getting onto the market here.

CUAC remains an important advisor to me on strategic issues facing the sector. <\/p>  <p>  Since 2011 my Department has put in place a number of measures to assist the credit union sector, including the establishment of the Commission on Credit Unions, introduction of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 and the establishment of the Credit Union Restructuring Board which oversaw 82 restructuring projects involving 156 credit unions during its lifetime. <\/p>  <p>  More recently an Implementation Group was established to oversee and monitor the implementation of the CUAC Report&rsquo;s recommendations. The group is chaired by my Department and consists of one member from each of the representative bodies, one member from CUAC and a member from the Central Bank. This group is an important forum for key stakeholders in the sector and has submitted papers on long-term lending and consultation and engagement to the Central Bank. The Implementation Group is expected to issue a final report to me in December 2018. <\/p>  <p>  While there are challenges to returns arising from the low yield environment and low loan to asset ratios, the sector continues to show signs of improvement reflected in growth in new lending, delivering c. 35% of all unsecured consumer lending in 2017, a decrease in the level of reported arrears and an increase in reserves. Total assets have increased consistently for many years and currently stand at approximately &euro;17.5 billion. <\/p>  <p>  Business model development is another challenge and opportunity facing the sector and to this end the Central Bank has set up a dedicated Business Model Unit within the Registrar of Credit Unions and has developed initiatives such as the CEO forum to address key constraints to, and enablers for, business model development. Business model development is also a focus of the CUAC, and I have specifically requested the committee to review barriers to and supports for collaborative efforts as well as SME lending, linking with the outcomes of the Local Public Banking report.<\/p>  <p>  It should be recognised, however, that there are many positive developments taking place in the sector, led by Credit Unions and their representative bodies.  Next year will see around 50 large credit unions, encompassing almost half of sector assets, providing Member Personal Current Account Service (MPCAs), a Central Bank-approved suite of services which includes personal current accounts, a range of payment services including debit cards, and overdrafts. <\/p>  <p>  2019 will also see a new regulatory framework for lending being introduced, which should materially increase the scope for credit unions offering mortgages to their members. The proposal would allow sectoral capacity of up to at least &euro;861m for mortgages, with this figure rising if Credit Unions are approved for higher limits.  To put this figure in context there is approximately &euro;165m of house loans currently outstanding within the credit union sector.

These deductions are available to all taxpayers.<\/p>  <p>  The Chapter on the &ldquo;Management of high wealth individuals&rsquo; tax liabilities&rdquo; in the recent 2017 Annual Report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;AG) states that the effective tax rate for high wealth individuals (HWIs) is more than double the rate for all income tax payers. The Report also identifies that 83 HWIs had taxable income of less than the average industrial wage.  <\/p>  <p>  The Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners attended the Public Accounts Committee meeting on 15 November. During the detailed discussion with the Committee, the Chairman outlined the various lifestyle and wealth management features of HWIs. In relation to the 83 HWIs with taxable income of less than the average industrial wage, he outlined that this low taxable income is related to the circumstances of the individuals which includes: family members of HWIs (25); non-resident individuals (21); individuals no longer categorised as HWIs (17); entitlement to credits and reliefs (15) with the remaining individuals having low income in that year.  It is important to point out that the deductions claimed which lower a taxpayer&rsquo;s taxable income are legitimate credits against tax liabilities.

Its <i>Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance <\/i>was published in January 2017 and makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, set out within an Action Plan.

This consultation process undertaken by the Working Group involved a wide range of stakeholders representing the different voices within this sector, including representative bodies, the major individual motor insurance providers and interest groups.  The impact of excessive premiums being charged to consumers from all counties across the country was a feature of this engagement process with industry.  <\/p><p>In addition, my officials regularly raise specific issues affecting consumers across the country during their ongoing engagement with Insurance Ireland, including within a sub-group formed to implement relevant consumer-focused recommendations from the Motor Report. <\/p><p>Furthermore, I have separately met with representatives from insurance companies and other relevant stakeholders in relation to a number of issues and the problems resulting from high insurance premiums have been discussed during these engagements.<\/p><p>Quarterly progress updates on the implementation of the Reports provide more detailed information on the implementation of each of the recommendations and actions.

The purpose of the research was to examine the extent and variety of interest rate restrictions within the EU and further afield and to assess the appropriateness of introducing such a restriction in the Irish market, given its specific circumstances and financial environment.  The key report recommendations highlighted by the Social Finance Foundation are that an interest rate restriction should be introduced but that this is conditional on there being a reliable alternative for consumers who are able and willing to repay and that consideration should be given to increasing the statutory 1% monthly cap on credit union interest rates.  <\/p>  <p>  The report did not specify the type or level of interest rate cap that should be introduced.  Both the report and the Social Finance Foundation highlight that this and other issues should be the subject of further research. The Social Finance Foundation also advised that the only thing worse than high cost credit is no credit.  <\/p>  <p>  The Social Finance Foundation points out that the credit union movement is a viable alternative for the community currently serviced by licensed moneylending firms because of the Personal Micro Credit (PMC) Scheme that many of its members participate in.  It began as a pilot scheme, supported by Government, in November 2015.  Loans under the initiative are branded \"It Makes Sense\" loans.  The PMC Implementation Group was established to oversee and drive the implementation of the scheme through its pilot phase and subsequently through to implementation nationwide.  My Department is represented on the PMC Implementation Group, which is chaired by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that credit unions are independent and it is at management discretion if they sign up to offer the \"It Makes Sense\" loan to consumers.  Additionally Credit Unions can only lend within their common bonds.  Currently 47% of credit unions are involved in the PMC scheme and, therefore, only consumers within the common bond of these credit unions can avail of the &ldquo;It Makes Sense&rdquo; loan.  As a result the \"It Makes Sense\" loan is not yet available as a nationwide mainstream alternative of affordable credit for current users of licensed moneylenders. <\/p>  <p>  The report and its recommendations will be examined by my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200063#WRA03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":52,"content":"<p>Question No. 26 answered with Question No. 20.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":53,"content":"<p>Question No. 27 answered with Question No. 17.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":54,"content":"<p>Question No. 28 answered with Question No. 24.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Costs","counter":55,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200063#WRA04050"},{"type":"question","counter":56,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[48602\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200063#WRA04100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will report on the progress of the implementation of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance;

It is a statutory Code first introduced by the Central Bank in February 2009, with the current CCMA becoming effective from 1 July 2013.   The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework, requiring relevant firms to ensure borrowers in arrears or pre-arrears in respect of a mortgage loan secured on a primary residence are treated in a timely, transparent and fair manner and that due regard is had to the fact that each case of mortgage arrears is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits .<\/p>  <p>  Banks, retail credit firms and credit servicing firms servicing loans on behalf of unregulated loan owners are all required to comply with the CCMA.  The CCMA recognises that it is in the interests of borrowers and regulated firms to address financial difficulties as speedily, effectively and sympathetically as circumstances allow.  <\/p>  <p>  Each regulated entity must consider the borrower&rsquo;s situation in the context of the solutions they provide, which may differ from firm to firm.  The CCMA does not prescribe the solution which must be offered.  The CCMA includes requirements that arrangements be sustainable and based on a full assessment of the individual circumstances of the borrower and that repossession be used only as a last resort.  Borrowers who engage with their lender, therefore, benefit from the protections afforded under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP). <\/p>  <p>  Under the CCMA, a regulated entity may only commence legal proceedings for repossession where it has made every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment arrangement (ARA) with the borrowers and other clear requirements are met or the borrower has been classified as not co-operating.  During the legal process, borrowers have opportunities to re-engage with lenders to find a solution.  In some circumstances, however, loss of ownership may be unavoidable.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to supporting people in mortgage arrears to remain in their homes and there are a range of supports and services in place to assist people in that regard, including the Mortgage to Rent scheme; the personal insolvency system; and the Abhaile service which funds borrowers access to regulated financial or legal professionals. <\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Finance, I am unable to interfere with any commercial decision of a financial entity and so I cannot comment specifically on whether institutions should be doing debt write-downs.  However, I do think it is important to note that the review published last week of the Central Bank's Report on the Effectiveness of the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears in the context of the Sale of Loans by Regulated Lenders states that for borrowers who engage with the process, the CCMA is working effectively and as intended.   <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore the Central Bank have stated that they will continue to assertively supervise regulated firms' compliance with the CCMA, track how long and short term arrangements are being applied to borrowers over time and that although strategy, commercial decisions and contractual rights of regulated entities cannot be interfered with, the Bank will investigate any patterns of behaviour it becomes aware of that suggests the CCMA is not being followed.  The Central Bank will also engage with industry on providing fuller information to borrowers on the assessment of their case in relation to arrangements being considered or not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200063#WRA05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":72,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200063#WRA05250"},{"type":"question","counter":73,"qnumday":35,"qnumall":"[48579\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200063#WRA05300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the results of a report issued by a company (details supplied) illustrating the effects on employment in the retail bookmaking industry as a result of the blanket increase in betting duty; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1291","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":74,"content":"<p>As announced in the Budget I have increased the rate of betting duty from 1 per cent to 2 per cent for all bookmakers and the rate of betting intermediary duty from 15 per cent to 25 per cent on the commission earned for betting intermediaries.

It is also the case that there is no VAT applied on betting transactions. With the Betting (Amendment) Act 2015 now well embedded in, I believe it is timely to increase the rates of Betting Duty and Betting Intermediary Duty.<\/p>  <p>  I am familiar with arguments put forward by the betting sector regarding the impact of the increase in betting duty. I acknowledge that advances in technology have challenged existing business models and have changed the structure of many markets, including the betting market, with more betting taking place online. I further acknowledge that smaller bookmakers may have ongoing difficulties competing in that environment or indeed with large retail bookmakers. While I have sympathy for small bookmakers I cannot apply the increase to some bookmakers and not others. Ultimately many taxes on goods or services are passed through to the end consumers and bookmakers will need to make commercial decisions on such matters.    <\/p>  <p>  I should point out that my Department held a consultation with the sector last year asking if the current model was appropriate and the overwhelming response was that it was. The main focus of the sector's engagement during this consultation was to oppose any increase in the betting duty, which leaves me with few options in this regard other than to impose a straight forward increase in the current regime. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, we must also acknowledge the raised public consciousness of the problem of gambling in society. While problem gambling can result in the problem gambler, and their family, bearing the severest of economic and of course personal costs, the social costs of problem gambling can extend to their employers and to public institutions in the health, welfare and justice systems, such costs ultimately borne by taxpayers.

Credit Servicing Firms are typically firms that manage or administer credit agreements such as mortgages or other loans on behalf of unregulated entities.  Credit Servicing Firms are required to obtain authorisation from the Central Bank in order to conduct credit servicing activities as defined in the 2015 Act.

The reports of violence, arbitrary detention, and persecution of civil society leaders, peaceful protesters and those who have assisted them paint a troubling picture of repression. I once again strongly condemn any use of violence and reiterate my calls on all actors to respect the right to peaceful protest and to freedom of expression. I also call on authorities to ensure full accountability for all acts of violence, while ensuring due process for all prisoners.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the reports to which the Deputy refers and the worrying accounts they contain of a pattern of human rights abuses and repression. Compounding this climate of impunity is a lack of official cooperation with the international missions investigating human rights abuses.  <\/p>  <p>  The UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) was expelled from the country following the publication of its report. The Group of Independent Experts (GIEI) and the Follow-Up Mechanism of Nicaragua (MESENI), set up by the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights (IACHR), have also both reported difficulties in working with the authorities. I urge the Government of Nicaragua to allow the OHCHR officials to re-enter the country, and to cooperate fully with the GIEI and MESENI, so that they can effectively carry out their important work. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland regularly engages on this issue at EU and international level. The EU and its Member States, including Ireland, calls on the government of Nicaragua to act on the findings and recommendations by the IACHR and OHCHR, to ensure full accountability for perpetrators of human rights abuses and the disarming and disbanding of armed groups. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland also supported the declaration in October by the EU High Representative on behalf of the EU on the situation in Nicaragua.<\/p>  <p>  The statement expressed the EU&rsquo;s serious concern at the situation, and urged the government of Nicaragua to allow the return of the OHCHR to enable it to continue its mission, as well as calling on the government of Nicaragua to stop the disproportionate use of force against demonstrators, halt arrests based on laws which criminalise peaceful protest, allow free peaceful demonstrators and re-establish the full respect of due process for all detainees. <\/p>  <p>  I echo the EU call on the government of Nicaragua to resume the national dialogue. I believe that inclusive dialogue remains the only way of negotiating a peaceful and democratic resolution to this crisis, and of restoring the trust of the Nicaraguan people in the country&rsquo;s institutions. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland supports EU action taken to support international and local initiatives to address the human rights situation, promote a culture of peace, and to provide support to victims of the crisis and their families. It is important to monitor the humanitarian consequences of the crisis and its impact on the population.   Officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, both in Dublin and in our Embassy in Mexico, which has responsibility for diplomatic relations with Nicaragua, have been monitoring the situation closely. The Deputy Foreign Minister of Nicaragua, Valdrack Jaentschke, was met by officials in my Department on 1 October last and was informed of our strong attachment to the European Union position on Nicaragua. He was also advised of the importance we attach to the establishment of a genuine national reconciliation process. <\/p>  <p>  We have been engaging regularly with partner organisations on the ground, and raising the issue at international level where appropriate. Ireland greatly values the work of these partner organisations and will continue to engage with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200064#WRB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":107,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200064#WRB01500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Gambling Sector","counter":106,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200064#WRB01400"},{"type":"question","counter":107,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[48666\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200064#WRB01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason a gaming licence was granted (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":108,"content":"<p>The legal framework for the approval of a Gaming Licence is as follows.\u00a0 An operator of gaming machines is required to hold a Gaming Licence for each premises where gaming machines are available for play.\u00a0 Section 19 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 provides that Revenue shall, on the application of a person to whom a certificate for a gaming licence has been granted by the District Court and on payment by that person of the relevant excise duty to Revenue, issue to that person a gaming licence.\u00a0 Applicants to Revenue for a Gaming Licence are also required to hold a current tax clearance certificate.\u00a0 Where an applicant satisfies these requirements a Gaming Licence is issued.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to a Gaming Licence, section 43(3) of the Finance Act 1975 provides that a gaming machine shall not be made available for play in a public place unless a Gaming Machine Licence is displayed in a conspicuous position on the machine concerned.\u00a0 Section 43(4) of the same Act provides that a Gaming Machine Licence may only be granted by Revenue to a holder of a Gaming Licence.\u00a0I am also advised by Revenue that the details supplied are not sufficient to allow any more information to be provided, but in any case the restrictions imposed by section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 would limit their ability to provide information that could be associated with or related to an identifiable taxpayer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200064#WRB01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Expenditure","counter":109,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200064#WRB01700"},{"type":"question","counter":110,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[48669\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200064#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of homes the construction of which has been funded by NAMA; and the number of these that have been sold, by local authority and by year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":111,"content":"<p>I am advised that, from Q1 2014 to Q3 2018, NAMA funded the construction of 8,013 new residential units in Ireland on residential development land under the control of its debtors and receivers.

Our priority now is to work towards the finalisation of that draft Withdrawal Agreement and the political declaration on the EU-UK future relationship. However any Brexit scenario will mean considerable change and impact for Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s contingency planning for Brexit was initiated well in advance of the UK referendum in June 2016 and my Department has been to the fore in producing and funding a number of economic assessments on Brexit, both before and since the UK&rsquo;s referendum decision in June 2016, all of which are available on the Department&rsquo;s website.<\/p>  <p>  The regular updates of my Department&rsquo;s macroeconomic forecasts, as part of the Budget process, analyse the impact of Brexit on the Irish economy. My Department&rsquo;s forecasts in Budget 2019, published last month, assume, as a central scenario, that the UK will make an &lsquo;orderly&rsquo; exit from the EU. This involves a transition period being agreed between 2019 and 2020, and a free trade agreement thereafter. This feeds through to our fiscal projections. <\/p>  <p>  The impact of Brexit on Irish output is outlined in Box 5 in the Budget 2019 Economic and Fiscal Outlook. In this box my Department sets out the potential economic impact of a central (&lsquo;orderly&rsquo; exit) scenario and an alternative (&lsquo;disorderly&rsquo;) exit scenario. This shows that under the central scenario, after five years, the level of Irish output would be close to 2 per cent below what would be the case under a no Brexit baseline. There is of course still a great deal of uncertainty regarding the post-exit arrangement. Under the &lsquo;disorderly&rsquo; exit scenario, the level of Irish output would be around 3&frac14; per cent lower than under the no Brexit baseline.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the long term impact, joint research by my Department and the ESRI published in 2016 shows that the potential impact of a hard Brexit is significant.\u00a0 After ten years the level of output would be almost 4 per cent below what it otherwise would have been in a no-Brexit scenario. The level of employment in Ireland would be 2 per cent lower, with the unemployment rate nearly 2 percentage points higher. <\/p>  <p>  I should also point out that the Department of Finance has been to the fore in producing and funding a number of Brexit-related studies, both before and since the UK's referendum decision, covering overall macroeconomic and sectoral impacts. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to stress that the economic models may not capture the full impact, given the difficulty in modelling financial market effects, non-tariff barriers and other factors. Therefore, these quantitative effects should be seen as a minimum as opposed to a maximum impact.<\/p>  <p>  While it is still Government&rsquo;s view that a &lsquo;no deal&rsquo; outcome remains unlikely, we are planning for all scenarios. It is imperative to boost the resilience of the Irish economy in order to minimise, in so far as is possible, any future disruption. Since the UK referendum in 2016, all of our national Budgets have been framed to prepare for the challenge of Brexit. The economic and fiscal policies, which we have pursued, mean that the economy is now in a better position to weather the impacts of Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200064#WRB02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector","counter":115,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200064#WRB02300"},{"type":"question","counter":116,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[48650\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200064#WRB02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the rainy day fund codified in the National Surplus (Reserve Fund for Exceptional Contingencies) Bill 2018 could be used to recapitalise the banks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1280","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":117,"content":"<p>Under section 10 of the National Surplus (Reserve Fund for Exceptional Contingencies) Bill 2018, the only place to which a drawdown of the Fund can be made is the Exchequer.

Revenue recently split its Large Cases Division into two divisions, one of which is now focused on HWIs, avoidance and pensions. I am advised by Revenue that one of the current criteria to be considered a HWI, and come within the management of its Large Cases HWI Division, is to have net assets of over &euro;50 million. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The new Division is in the process, as reflected in one of the recommendations in the Annual Report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;AG), of reviewing the case base with a view to increasing the number of HWIs managed in the Division. As part of this review the threshold of &euro;50 million in net assets will be re-assessed to identify the most appropriate threshold. I understand that Revenue&rsquo;s structural realignment is also being supported by an expansion in the number of specialist and experienced staff assigned to the oversight of the new Division&rsquo;s case base. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Revenue is independent in its administration of the tax and duty system. I am advised by Revenue that cases not previously or currently meeting the criteria for inclusion in its Large Cases Division were and are subject to ongoing risk evaluation and, where necessary, intervention programmes. This applies to all taxpayers including those not within the responsibility of the Large Cases HWI Division.

Based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) inflation was just 0.3 per cent in 2017, this marked the fifth consecutive year in which inflation has been below 1 per cent. The subdued level of inflation has continued into 2018, with average inflation of just 0.7 per cent in the first ten months of the year. By contrast, inflation across the euro area accelerated to 1.7 per cent over the same period. <\/p>  <p>  The divergence between inflation in the euro area and Ireland can in part be attributed to the impact of euro-sterling appreciation on consumer prices in Ireland. In turn this reflects the importance of the UK as a source of imports of consumer products, which have fallen in price recent years as a result of the appreciation. <\/p>  <p>  While overall inflation has been subdued, services inflation has been relatively robust, averaging 1.6 per cent in the first ten months of the year. One important factor driving the increase in services inflation is strong growth in residential rents. Annual rent inflation averaged 6.4 per cent in the first ten months of the year. <\/p>  <p>  The pace of growth in rent prices, which in part reflects the ongoing shortage of housing, is a concern.

It provides a framework for coordination of economic policies across the European Union in which guidance is provided to Member States before they take policy decisions at national level. The guidance is provided in the context of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) and the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure (MIP). As part of the Semester process, the Commission makes country-specific recommendations to provide tailored policy guidance to each EU country on how to boost jobs and growth, while maintaining sound public finances.

In addition, further output growth should continue to pay dividends in the labour market next year, with over 60,000 jobs likely to be created and an unemployment rate converging towards 5 per cent. <\/p>  <p>  In an EU context, Ireland remains one of the fastest growing Member States. The strong growth and performance seen in our economy is also clearly illustrated by a comparison with the performance of our main trading partners &ndash; the euro area, the UK and the US. Following stronger than expected growth last year, the pace of expansion in the euro area and EU economies is expected to ease. For the euro area the Commission is forecasting growth of 2.1 per cent this year, moderating to 1.9 per cent and easing further to 1.7 per cent in 2020. For the UK, modest GDP growth of 1.3 per cent is expected this year slowing slightly to 1.2 per cent for both 2019 and 2020, based on a technical assumption of status quo in terms of trading relations between the EU27 and the UK. The US economy continues to benefit from several tailwinds, supporting GDP growth of 2.9 per cent this year, although this is expected to moderate to 2.6 per cent next year and to 1.9 per cent in 2020. In common with Ireland, there has been a recovery in employment growth in all our main export markets &ndash; though at a more modest pace &ndash; with a corresponding reduction in unemployment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200064#WRB06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":154,"content":"<p>Question No. 64 answered with Question No. 54.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs Data","counter":155,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200065#WRC00300"},{"type":"question","counter":156,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[48810\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200065#WRC00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the plans of the Revenue Commissioners to cut flat rate relief for a number of industries; the estimated amount of extra tax that will be received as a result of the changes; the rationale for making this change; the industries impacted by this change; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":157,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[48811\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200065#WRC00500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of persons claiming flat rate relief by industry; the cost of this relief being claimed in each case in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":158,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 66 together.<\/p><p>I propose to take these two questions together as they relate to the flat rate expense regime operated by Revenue.  I am aware that there have been some recent updates to Revenue&rsquo;s concessionary\u00a0flat rate expenses regime.<\/p><p>In the first instance, it is important to note that there has been no change to the general rule set out in legislation that\u00a0says that all employees are entitled\u00a0to claim a deduction under section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 in respect of an expense incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of their employment, to the extent which the expenses are not reimbursed by the employer.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Revenue are independent in the administration of the tax code and the flat rate expenses regime is\u00a0an additional concessionary practice operated by Revenue where both specific commonality of expenditure exists across an employment category and the statutory requirement for the tax deduction as set out in section 114 TCA 1997 is satisfied. <\/p><p>The purpose of the regime is to simplify administration where the specific legislative criteria is met to help both the taxpayer and Revenue, by making it easier for large groups of employees working in the same sector to avail of their entitlement to tax relief in respect of expenses incurred in the performance of their employment duties. <\/p><p>The flat rate expense is agreed following engagement between Revenue and the relevant representative body for the particular group of employees who incur the same expense. This regime developed incrementally over the last 40 to 50 years, and currently incorporates some 53 employment categories covering broadly 134 individual flat rate expenses. <\/p><p>Given the historic nature of some of the flat rate expenses and having regard to changes in employment circumstances, regulations and work practices across employments, Revenue commenced a comprehensive review in 2018 of flat rate expenses. The rationale for the review, which is in line with best practice and good corporate governance, is to ensure the expenses agreed are still justified and appropriate to modern day employments and work practices and are in accordance with the legislative requirement for deduction as set out in section 114 of the TCA. <\/p><p>I am advised by Revenue that a flat rate expense can only be retained where the legislative basis underpinning the deductibility is supported and they have engaged with relevant representative bodies in cases under review.\u00a0 A consequence of the review by Revenue may be an adjustment to the quantum of the flat rate expense (either increased or decreased) or it may be withdrawn where the continuation is no longer justified.\u00a0 I understand that engagement is on-going in relation to some existing and new categories of flat rate expenses, which is likely to either result in an increase to the existing amount or a new category agreed with Revenue. <\/p><p>The flat rate expense categories initially selected by Revenue for review in 2018 were based on a combination of two factors, the quantum in terms of number of claimants and the value.\u00a0 Revenue has advised that they intend to have their review completed by the end of next year. Therefore, in the interest of fairness to all sectors and employees currently benefiting from the regime, Revenue has decided that the effective date for implementation of any changes to particular flat rate expense categories will be deferred until 1 January 2020, prior to which the review of all the flat rate expenses operating in the various employment categories will be completed.\u00a0<\/p><p>The flat rate expense categories listed in the following table will be withdrawn with effect from 1 January 2020:<table><tr><th>Flat Rate Expense Category<\/th><th>Flat Rate Expense Amount <\/th><th>Number of recipients in 2018<\/th><th>Total gross value of Flat Rate   Expenses -\u00a0 2018<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Agricultural Advisers<\/td><td>&euro;671<\/td><td>122<\/td><td>&euro;81,862<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cardiac Technician <\/td><td>&euro;107\/&euro;212<\/td><td>881<\/td><td>&euro;177,535<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Journalist in employment<\/td><td>&euro;381\/ &euro;153<\/td><td>8,134<\/td><td>&euro;2,255,910<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Professional valuer in the Valuation Office<\/td><td>&euro;680<\/td><td>42<\/td><td>&euro;28,560<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Freelance actors in employment<\/td><td>&euro;750<\/td><td>682<\/td><td>&euro;511,500<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Shop Assistant<\/td><td>&euro;121<\/td><td>75,822<\/td><td>&euro;9,174,462 <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>More generally, I am informed by Revenue that it is estimated that the total number of PAYE workers who benefit from the flat rate expenses regime in 2018 is in the order of 536,000.\u00a0 I am also informed by Revenue that a breakdown of the cost and numbers by reference to each industry in which the flat rate regime currently operates is not readily available. \u00a0It is not possible for Revenue to accurately quantify the tax saving\/cost associated with the withdrawal as it depends on the particular tax circumstances of the individual recipients, for example, the extent of their income subject to tax and whether income is subject to tax at the standard or marginal rate.\u00a0However, in the context of their ongoing review of the flat rate regime, Revenue has undertaken to provide a sectoral breakdown.<\/p><p>Finally, Revenue has advised that withdrawal of a flat rate expense does not impact on a taxpayer&rsquo;s statutory right to claim a deduction under section 114 of the TCA 1997 in respect of an expense incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of their employment, to the extent to which the expenses are not reimbursed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200065#WRC00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Loans Sale","counter":159,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200065#WRC00800"},{"type":"question","counter":160,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[48812\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200065#WRC00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of NAMA loan sales that have been subjected to review by the Comptroller and Auditor General; the names of the loan sales; the amount of proceeds received from each loan sale under review by the Comptroller and Auditor General; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":161,"content":"<p>The Comptroller and Auditor General is independent in the exercise of his functions and therefore my Department does not have access to the information requested.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The C&amp;AG does report publicly on material findings emerging from his work.

Following GDP growth of 7.2 per cent in 2017, GDP is forecast to grow by 7.5 per cent this year. While the GDP figures can be misleading in an Irish context, a broader range of measures including labour market and tax revenue developments confirm the economy is performing strongly. <\/p>  <p>  Despite the rapid rate of growth, the main indicators of an overheating economy &ndash; for instance the growth in wages, prices and credit - do not yet suggest that overheating pressures have emerged. <\/p>  <p>  The strength of the economic recovery has perhaps been most clearly evident in the labour market. Since the low point in 2012, close to 400,000 additional jobs have been created. As a result there are now more people in work than ever before. Importantly employment growth is broad based, with growth recorded in 10 of the 14 sectors reported by the CSO. Despite the improvements in the labour market, there remains some slack in the economy for employment to increase further. <\/p>  <p>  Importantly the recovery in the economy has not yet given rise to significant inflationary pressures. For the first ten months of the year, inflation, as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), averaged just 0.7 per cent on an annual basis, this follows five consecutive years in which inflation has been below 1 per cent. Although price pressures have emerged in both the housing and the rental markets, this reflects the undersupply of housing over the last number of years, rather than evidence of over-heating pressures.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to credit growth it should be noted that lending to Irish households only turned positive during the second half of 2017 after several years of contraction. Safeguards are now in place to help prevent a reoccurrence of the unsustainable build up in credit, most notability the macro-prudential regulations introduced by the Central Bank. <\/p>  <p>  Over the coming years, our economy is expected to move towards full employment. As such, it is important that we remain cognisant of the upward pressure this will place on both prices and wages, which could give rise to a loss of competitiveness. While the economy is expected to continue to grow strongly, such pressures in the economy may give rise to imbalances over the medium term.<\/p>  <p>  With this in mind, we will continue to focus on maintaining competitiveness-oriented policies and building capacity within the economy. In particular, we are now investing significantly to address the bottlenecks to growth which emerged during the economic recovery, such as the need for residential development and public infrastructure investment.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Government will also continue to implement budgetary policies designed to enhance the resilience of our public finances. As set out in Budget 2019, we will &lsquo;balance the books&rsquo; next year and are currently establishing the Rainy Day fund. This prudent approach to our public finances will help to mitigate against any future downturn in economy activity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200065#WRC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Investment Incentive Scheme","counter":165,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200065#WRC01400"},{"type":"question","counter":166,"qnumday":69,"qnumall":"[48814\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200065#WRC01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the penalties and fines that would be imposed on applicants who make incorrect, intentional and unintentional applications to the scheme under the proposed changes in the employment investment incentive scheme, EIIS, in the Finance Bill 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

My Department uses a Geographical Information System (GIS) to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise. The GIS uses data from a range of sources, including the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and my Department's own databases. With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post-primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed. <\/p><p>Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following: <\/p><p>- Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools <\/p><p>- Extending the capacity of a school or schools <\/p><p>- Provision of a new school or schools.<\/p><p>In April 2018, the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022). In addition to the new schools announced, there will be a need for further school accommodation in other areas in the future.  Approximately 40% of extra school places are delivered by extending existing schools.<\/p><p>While the announcement did not include a new post-primary school for the Dunshaughlin school planning area, the requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular will have regard for the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.<\/p><p>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998. The enrolment policy must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.<\/p><p>My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in the area. Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. <\/p><p>Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of an Educational Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school. Further information on the Section 29 appeals process is available on the Department's website <i>www.education.ie<\/i>.

The Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015. <\/p>  <p>  New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health), must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the Act can be commenced.  <\/p>  <p>  A high-level Steering Group comprised of senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission (MHC) and the Courts Service, together with the Director of the Decision Support Service, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service (DSS) and this work is ongoing. The Steering Group meets approximately once a month to monitor progress. <\/p>  <p>  A number of provisions of the Act were commenced in October 2016 in order to progress the setting up of the Decision Support Service. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 515 of 2016), brought Part 1 (Preliminary and General) and Part 9 (Director of the Decision Support Service) of the Act, other than sections 3, 4 and 7 in Part 1 and sections 96 and 102 and Chapter 3 in Part 9, into operation on 17 October 2016. These provisions were brought into operation in order to enable the process of recruitment of the Director of the Decision Support Service (DSS) to begin. Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn was appointed Director of the Decision Support Service on 2 October 2017. <\/p>  <p>  The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.\u00a0 The Minister for Health, under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) (No. 2) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 517 of 2016), brought some provisions of Part 8 of the Act into operation on 17 October 2016 . The provisions commenced in Part 8 were the definition of &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; in section 82; the definitions of &ldquo;code of practice&rdquo; and &ldquo;working group&rdquo; in section 91(1); and section 91(2).\u00a0 The commenced provisions provide for the establishment by the Minister for Health of a multi-disciplinary group to advise in relation to codes of practice on advance healthcare directives.\u00a0 The multi-disciplinary group has been set up and work is ongoing on the code of practice on advance healthcare directives. <\/p>  <p>  The key preparations are being put in place under the oversight of the Steering Group to allow for further commencement orders for the provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the DSS is ready to roll out the new decision-making support options. The Director of the DSS is working in a very determined way to get the necessary staff resources, processes, IT system, expert panels, codes of practice and regulations in place in order that the DSS can be up and running as quickly as possible. There are many complex strands to this work, including involvement of multiple organisations. <\/p>  <p>  Every effort is underway to ensure that the DSS has all necessary capacity to open for business as soon as possible.\u00a0 While the DSS has been working towards being operational and ready for the commencement of the main provisions of the Act in early 2020, the situation will be kept under review as the preparatory work on implementation moves forward.\u00a0  <\/p>  <p>  In April 2018, the MHC engaged the consultancy firm BearingPoint to support the development of a detailed, costed plan to establish a fully operational Decision Support Service. The contract also includes ongoing project management support for the design and establishment of the organisation, business processes, IT systems and risk management framework. <\/p>  <p>  The MHC has in recent weeks received sanction for the recruitment of a number of staff for the DSS and also a number of staff to provide shared services for the MHC and DSS. The MHC proposes to recruit these staff on a phased basis between now and 1 January 2020. <\/p>  <p>  The National Disability Authority is currently finalising its work on the suite of draft codes of practice in relation to non-healthcare matters which are required to be prepared under section 103 of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  <\/p>  <p>  In June 2018, my Department recruited an external legal expert to assist in the preparation of draft regulations in relation to decision-making assistance agreements, co-decision-making agreements, certain matters relating to decision-making representatives, and enduring powers of attorney.\u00a0 These regulation-making powers are provided for in sections 10(4), 31, 45(3), 45(4), 46(3) and 79 of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.

Each application will be assessed individually on its merits.  On this basis, a decision will be made as to whether on the balance of probabilities the applicant comes within the scope of the scheme. In addition, for those cases where there is insufficient documentary evidence available to make an assessment on their case, an interview process is in place so as to facilitate a fairer assessment of a woman's application.  <\/p><p>In relation to the age at which a girl started work in a Magdalen laundry,  the information contained in the McAleese Report relates only to girls and women admitted to the Magdalen Institutions. The McAleese Committee did not conduct any research into the adjoining institutions which are now covered by the Addendum.  The statistical analysis carried out by the Committee indicated that the average age on entry into the Magdalen Institutions was 23.8 years of age and the median age was 20 years of age.  While the youngest entrant was identified as 9 years of age, this had occurred in the 1930s.  The McAleese Committee's analysis also shows that only 4.1% were under 14 years of age at the time of entry.  As stated in the Addendum, it is open to an applicant to show that she worked in a Magdalen Laundry before she reached 12 years of age and, where shown, such work would be included in the calculation of the 'work' element of the lump sum.  <\/p><p>It is assumed that the details requested by the Deputy in relation to age, hours worked and the records of the religious congregations returned to the Department, relates to records received by the Department in processing applications under the scheme established in 2013 for those women who were admitted to and worked in a Magdalen Institution. The only criteria relevant to calculating the lump sum payable to successful applicants under that scheme is as set out by Judge Quirke in his report on the scheme of compensation for the Magdalen women.  Those criteria are (i) that the applicant had been admitted to and worked in the Magdalen Institution and (ii) the length of stay in that institution. Therefore the only information required from records submitted by the relevant religious congregations are the entry and exit date for the applicant.  Records as to the age of the applicant while in the Magdalen Institution or their hours of work were not relevant to the calculation of the award.  Applicants to the scheme are asked to provide supporting documentation and, where it is necessary and the applicant has consented,  the religious congregations provide records to the Department. It should be noted that the religious congregations co-operated fully with the Department in the administration of the scheme and provided records where requested.  <\/p><p>In relation to the McAleese inquiry which preceded the Quirke report and the establishment of the ex-gratia scheme, the religious congregations also cooperated and provided access to their archives.  When the McAleese report was finalised and published, the records provided by the congregations were returned to them and they are not part of the State archive.  Chapters 5 &amp;amp; 12 of the McAleese Report detail the research undertaken on the legislation and regulation of  employment, factories and the workplace.<\/p><p>Chapter 6 of the McAleese Report sets out the approach in relation to the archive.  The McAleese Committee agreed that the archive be deposited and stored centrally with the Department of the Taoiseach, noting the approach taken in relation to archiving set out in the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004.<\/p><p>The Committee decided that the archive contains only copies of state records, in order to avoid disturbance to or destruction of original or archived files. The originals of all such records identified &ndash; many of which were already archived, and some of which are covered by the National Archives Act 1986 - will remain in their original files and locations. <\/p><p>There are no plans at this stage to provide access to the McAleese archive at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200066#WRD04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Operations","counter":255,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200066#WRD05100"},{"type":"question","counter":256,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[48704\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200066#WRD05200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of instances in which the PSNI has entered here in the past five years to assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with its operations; the number of times An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has requested permission to leave here to assist the PSNI in Northern Ireland with its operations; the level of engagement he and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have had with their counterparts in Northern Ireland in the context of Brexit in order to ensure that both police services can co-operate in the event of a hard border; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":257,"content":"<p>There is very close and substantial on-going cooperation between an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI in respect of all aspects of cross border policing, notably in combating organised crime, road safety and responding to the security threat posed by paramilitary groups.  As such, the presence of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI in each other's jurisdictions takes place in the context of the on-going co-operation to keep all communities on this island safe.  The Deputy will be aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the only police service empowered by statute to exercise policing and security services in the State and, in accordance with the law, to engage in co-operation with other police services in this regard.<\/p><p>The two police services have for many years operated a joint <i>Cross Border Policing Strategy,<\/i>the overarching purpose of which is to improve public safety throughout Ireland, to disrupt criminal activity and enhance the policing capability of both police services on the island of Ireland.  The Strategy covers the range of policing activities and contains a series of initiatives in which both police services are actively engaged and which will go towards fulfilling its objectives.  A good practical example of on-going co-operation is the Annual Cross Border Conference on Organised Crime, the most recent of which was held in County Down on 7 November.  The Conference brings officers from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI together to enhance co-operation between all law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border under the shared objective of combatting organised crime.<\/p><p>Close police co-operation on this island across the full range of policing responsibilities will continue regardless of the final shape of Brexit.  I would emphasise that it is the Government&rsquo;s firm intention that the same border arrangements as currently apply on the island of Ireland will continue.

I have discussed this matter with my counterparts in the British Government and I know that protecting the gains of the peace process are a clear and shared objective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200066#WRD05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Data","counter":258,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200066#WRD05400"},{"type":"question","counter":259,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[48718\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200066#WRD05500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of fixed charge penalty notices paid to date of the 50,833 drivers that have been caught while driving behind the wheel; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1250","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":260,"content":"<p>My Department has sought a report from\u00a0the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the information requested by the Deputy.<\/p><p>I will contact the Deputy directly on receipt of a Garda report in relation to this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200066#WRD05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Leave to Remain","counter":262,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200067#WRE00200"},{"type":"question","counter":263,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[48729\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200067#WRE00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the progress to date in the determination of an application for leave to remain in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":264,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that it received a request for permission to reside in this State from the person concerned on\u00a07 August 2018.\u00a0 INIS sought further information\u00a017 August \u00a0from the person's\u00a0legal representative, however, INIS has no record of a response to that request.\u00a0 I understand that it remains open to the person to provide the information and the request will\u00a0be considered further by INIS in light of a response.<\/p><p>The Deputy may be aware that I launched a new scheme on 15 October 2018 which\u00a0allows certain non-EEA nationals, who came to Ireland to study between January 2005 and December 2010, to apply for permission to remain in the State.<\/p><p>Eligible applicants may apply\u00a0for a permission to remain in the State, including the right to reside and work in the State, and will be subject to renewal after two years.\u00a0\u00a0The Scheme is\u00a0open for on-line applications until 20 January 2019.\u00a0 The person concerned may wish to consult the INIS website at <i>www.inis.gov.ie<\/i>for further information.<\/p><p>Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

The changing demographics and the implications for future health care costs underpin the importance of developing a wider choice of appropriate housing options for older people suited to their needs.\u00a0 The aim is to encourage and facilitate timely planning by older people and to rebalance the care model away from residential care to supporting older people to remain living independently at home for longer.\u00a0 As the research shows, this reflects the preferences of older people themselves.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The aim is to ensure that older people will have more choice\u00a0by developing a range of housing options that are suited to their needs, so they can plan ahead and, insofar as possible, choose the right option for them.\u00a0These options may include retirement villages, housing with supports projects or other initiatives.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Varying levels of support will be needed to enable older people to continue living in their own homes and communities, including care needs where appropriate. However, it is envisaged that there will always be a cohort of people for whom residential nursing home care is the most appropriate option. The main issue is the significant gap in alternative or intermediary options. This is the issue that I wish to address. There is a significant need to put in place suitable options to give older people the choice and importantly, to ensure that care is provided in the most appropriate setting. This aligns with the vision of Sl&aacute;intecare where there is an overarching aim to bring care closer to the community and the person's home.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Capacity Review published earlier this year, in addition to recognising the pressures being faced across the health system in terms of access to healthcare, was also an indication of the Government&rsquo;s desire to plan appropriately for the future. Analysis of future scenarios (based on demographic projections and taking account of envisaged reform measures) shows potential requirements for the period to 2031. On the back of these findings, the Government committed to providing 4,500 additional short and long term residential care beds in the National Development Plan. The exact criteria for the planning and design of these beds will be evaluated on a phased basis as the projects are approved.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Currently more than 23,200 people are supported in nursing homes under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme. This figure does not include those in short stay or transitional care beds. The Health Information &amp;amp; Quality Authority website has information on the number of registered beds for each designated residential care centre, public and private.<\/p>  <p>  On November 20 I hosted an expert conference on housing for older people with my colleague Mr. Damien English T.D. Minister for Housing and Urban Development. The overwhelming outcome of the event, shared by the experts, was that choice and the development of a range of community supports and services in close proximity to older people is the key to achieving the objective of keeping people living longer and independently in their communities. The outcome of this conference will be used by my officials and officials of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to inform the development of a suitable policy framework for housing for older people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200068#WRF04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Home Services","counter":363,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200068#WRF04700"},{"type":"question","counter":364,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[48714\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200068#WRF04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons on waiting lists for nursing homes nationwide; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1217","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":365,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200068#WRF04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Reimbursement","counter":366,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200068#WRF05000"},{"type":"question","counter":367,"qnumday":142,"qnumall":"[48720\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200068#WRF05100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 391 of 18 September 2018, the progress that has been made since in relation to an application for the reimbursement of Translarna from a company (details supplied).","asker":"1278","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":368,"content":"<p>The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicines, in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013; therefore, the matter has been referred to the HSE for reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200068#WRF05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Orthodontic Services Provision","counter":369,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200068#WRF05300"},{"type":"question","counter":370,"qnumday":143,"qnumall":"[48721\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200068#WRF05400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Donegal will be called for orthodontic treatment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":371,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200068#WRF05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Eligibility","counter":373,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200069#WRG00200"},{"type":"question","counter":374,"qnumday":144,"qnumall":"[48747\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200069#WRG00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will review upwards the income thresholds for the medical card, general practitioner card, over 70s medical card and the over 70s general practitioner card in view of increases in wages and the minimum wage in particular and increases in the rate of social welfare payments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":375,"content":"<p>Budget 2019 provided for increases in a number of social welfare payments which are intended to come into effect in March 2019.

The HSE in turn have\u00a0advised that in late\u00a0October 2018, an error was discovered in correctly communicating a genetic test result by the Department of Clinical Genetics at Our Lady's Children&rsquo;s Hospital Crumlin (OLCHC) following an enquiry by an oncologist for a patient with recurring cancer who had a genetic test, known as a BRCA test, in 2009. Crumlin Hospital are currently reviewing this incident as a matter of the utmost priority.<\/p>  <p>  This error has been reported as an incident and is being managed in accordance with the HSE Incident and Risk Management policy, including in commencing an incident review process of this transcription error in correctly communicating the test result in a letter to the referring clinician. Direct contact has been made with the patient involved in this incident, with an offer made for an Open Disclosure meeting to take place at the discretion of the patient.<\/p>  <p>  As a precaution, OLCHC has also instigated a review of the communication of all BRCA test results since 2006, firstly prioritising the 335 positive BRCA results processed by the Department of Clinical Genetics. This review of the correct communication of the positive BRCA test is currently underway and is expected to be completed in the forthcoming days. The hospital will then review the correct communication of the negative BRCA tests.<\/p>  <p>  For the sake of clarity, I would also like to stress to the House that there is no concern regarding the accuracy of the BRCA test itself.

There is now an enhanced regulatory regime in place to monitor and manage risks to the economy emerging from the housing sector. The Central Bank's macro prudential rules, which are working effectively,\u00a0aim to increase both bank and borrower resilience and mitigate the risks of credit fuelled house-price spirals emerging.<\/p>  <p>  The availability of appropriate development finance for commercially viable residential projects has been identified as a key contributory factor to underpin further progress in addressing\u00a0the shortfall in\u00a0housing supply. The Government is meeting this challenge through the launch of Home Building Finance Ireland (HBFI) which will\u00a0utilise up to &euro;750 million to provide debt funding for residential development, funding new housing construction across all regions in the country.<\/p>  <p>  In overall terms, the key elements of the Government&rsquo;s\u00a0approach to addressing the issues in our housing sector\u00a0are set out in the\u00a0Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, and Project Ireland 2040, which sets out a comprehensive set of measures designed to address the on-going structural constraints within the construction sector and restore the housing market to a sustainable equilibrium.\u00a0 The CSO&rsquo;s most recent Residential Property Price Index , published on 14 November 2018, shows a moderation in house price growth rates; in the year to September 2018, residential property prices at national level increased by 8.2%, compared with an increase of 8.9% in the year to August and an increase of 12.0% in the twelve months to September 2017. In Dublin, residential property price growth continued to moderate, with an annual\u00a0increase of 5.8% in the year to September 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Increasing housing supply, however, is the most important element of our response to the housing crisis.  In that regard, the\u00a0most recent data show the continuation of some very positive trends:<\/p>  <p>  -  Planning permissions (Q2 2018) granted up 39% year on year;<\/p>  <p>  -  Commencement notices (August 2018) up 20% year on year;<\/p>  <p>  -  New homes available for use (Q3 2018) up 20% year on year;<\/p>  <p>  -  Registrations (July 2018) up 7% year on year.<\/p>  <p>  The Government continues to address affordability specifically.\u00a0 In particular, for those households earning low to moderate annual gross incomes (up to &euro;50,000 for single applicants and &euro;75,000 for dual applicants), a multi-stranded approach is being taken to the targeted delivery of affordable housing.<\/p>  <p>  In order to support the affordable housing programmes of local authorities, the Government has committed &euro;310 million, over the three years 2019 to 2021, under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF) announced as part of Budget 2019. The funding is available for key facilitating infrastructure, on public lands, to support the provision of affordable homes to purchase or rent. I envisage a maximum amount of SSF funding of &euro;50,000 per affordable home and on this basis at least 6,200 affordable homes could be facilitated. <\/p>  <p>  A first call for proposals under the Fund issued to the four Dublin local authorities; Kildare, Meath, Wicklow, Louth and Cork County Councils, and Cork and Galway City Councils.\u00a0 Fifteen proposals were received, from nine of the local authorities targeted under this first call and I expect to announce funding decisions in relation to these applications shortly. I expect infrastructure works on approved projects to begin as soon as possible thereafter and delivery of affordable homes from late 2019\/early 2020 onwards.<\/p>  <p>  More broadly, all local authorities are carrying out economic assessments of the requirement for affordable housing in their areas and the viability to deliver such affordable housing from their sites. My Department hosted a workshop for local authorities on 8 November to discuss these issues. <\/p>  <p>  A second call for proposals under the Fund will be made shortly. The scope of that call will be influenced by the information received from local authorities, as part of the aforementioned assessments, which they have been requested to submit by 30 November. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of the type of affordable housing that will be delivered on local authority sites it may be affordable housing for purchase, for example, under the recently commenced provisions of Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, or cost rental, which is being advanced on a number of pilot sites before being rolled out further. The Regulations to support the operation of Part 5 will be finalised shortly. These initiatives complement other Government actions which help first-time buyers to buy a home, such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the new Land Development Agency (LDA) will contribute significantly to the delivery of affordable housing. All of the State land developed by the LDA will include 40% social and affordable homes to purchase or rent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200072#WRK03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Loan Scheme","counter":569,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200072#WRK03800"},{"type":"question","counter":570,"qnumday":216,"qnumall":"[48748\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112200072#WRK03900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"when the next tranche of moneys will be provided for the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme (details supplied).","asker":"1306","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":571,"content":"<p>My Department has sanctioned sufficient\u00a0funding\u00a0to local authorities in order to approve loans under the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan Scheme\u00a0(RIHL). <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the specific case that the Deputy has raised, she will be aware that under Section 63(3) of the Local Government Act 2001, a local authority is independent in the performance of its functions.
