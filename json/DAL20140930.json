However, receipts from the United Kingdom which were profiled for November were received in September and when they are excluded, a net current deficit of &euro;432 million emerges.<\/p><p>  In income and expenditure terms, the HSE is reporting a year to date net expenditure figure of &euro;7.039 billion to the end of July against a budget of &euro;6.754 billion, leading to a variance of &euro;285 million.  The acute hospital sector accounts for &euro;160 million or 57% of the overall deficit.  Employment agency costs were &euro;194 million, up &euro;63 million on the figure for last year, a significant element of which was incurred in acute hospital services.  The primary care division had an overall deficit of &euro;54 million, with local demand-led schemes a key area experiencing excess expenditure.<\/p><p>  Undoubtedly, 2014 is proving to be a financially challenging year for the health service.  While the budgetary targets this year are particularly constrained, it is important to recognise that demanding financial and resource constraints have applied in each of the past number of years as a direct consequence of the crisis in the public finances.  The cumulative impact of this unprecedented period of financial and resource restraint has resulted in reductions in the health service budget of &euro;1.5 billion since 2008, with numbers employed reduced by 14,000 over this period. <\/p><p>  These challenges come at a time when the demand for health services is increasing each year which, in turn, is driving costs upwards.  Despite these resource reductions, the HSE has managed to support increasing demand for its services arising from such factors as population growth, increased levels of chronic disease, an ageing population, increased demand for prescription drugs and new costly medical technologies and treatments. <\/p><p>  Currently, it is anticipated that a Supplementary Estimate in excess of &euro;500 million will be required to support services in 2014.  This is based on costs to the end of July and takes account of the HSE&rsquo;s best estimate of likely expenditure to year end, mitigated by ongoing cost containment plans and income generation.  It is important to stress that, as with any forecast, there is some degree of uncertainty, particularly given the scale of the overall HSE cost base, the complexity of the services and the lack of a national financial system.  This forecast deficit excludes any overrun on the State Claims Agency, which relates to medical negligence payouts. <\/p><p>  The HSE continues to work closely with my Department to mitigate the projected deficit to the greatest degree possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000003#A00500","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1412082000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>The HSE is not being enabled to deliver the services it outlined in its service plan for 2014.

There are also protocols in place for viral haemorrhagic fever risk assessment by ambulance personnel at airports and shipping ports.

They deliver their services in a range of settings, including community-based health centres, residential centres, nursing homes and hospitals.<\/p><p> The HSE employs professionally trained psychologists, including counselling psychologists, clinical psychologists and educational psychologists, in a range of roles across the health service.  Counselling psychologists are largely employed in primary care and national counselling services.  Under section 22 of the Health Act 2004, the HSE has the authority to appoint persons to be its employees and may determine their duties.  This includes the appointment of persons to posts within the psychology service.  With regard to the recruitment of psychologists, in the context of significant organisational change and realignment, it is the executive's intention to review the selection criteria for posts within the psychology service.  The review will commence in November, and as part of this process the views of stakeholders will be invited and consideration will be given to developments within the profession.  This review is timely in order to ensure that the recruitment of professionally trained psychologists continues to meet the needs of our evolving health services.

I had the opportunity to visit Roscommon on Saturday where I spent a few hours in the hospital.  I was impressed to see that there were services in the hospital which were not available in Blanchardstown, where I live, including, for example, a minor injuries unit where one can be seen in less than an hour with a laceration, broken bone or other injury of that nature.

There is international evidence of increasingly poor outcomes, including increased mortality, in relation to the closure of accident and emergency departments and their over-centralisation.  A recent study in California has demonstrated as much and it is reflected across a whole range of studies conducted globally.  We need to recognise that is the case.

The universal health insurance model was the opposite of that, which is why the Government is slowly letting it wither and die.  It knows that the model will place an extraordinary burden on ordinary families.

We support the concept of universality when it comes to GP access but as I said to the current Minister and the previous Minister people cannot fund universality by taking it from those who do not have.  That is clearly what the Government is doing.  In respect of general practitioner access, it is taking medical cards and other services from people who do not have them.  The Government must get its priorities right.  The vulnerable and those who need medical care the most must be the priority.

Related settlement proposals were drawn up by the commission and issued to the parties on 23 July.<\/p><p>  The settlement proposals recognise that the situation is problematic, given that the HSE has more public health nurse vacancies in the greater Dublin region than there are nurses in the 2013-14 class who wish to or are able to work in that region.  The situation is further complicated by the fact that a national recruitment panel is in place since 2011 which is composed of public health nurses who are already working in Dublin and who wish to transfer to provincial locations, including the west.  In 2013 a similar issue arose prior to the graduation of the 2012-13 class.  The parties accepted that this class would take priority over the existing panel for nationwide vacancies.  Most of that class have been accommodated in locations that suit them and the current proposals provide for the remainder being accommodated up to the end of 2014.  The proposals also provide a structure for the assignment of the 2013-14 class to posts in Dublin in the first instance and for the existing national panel to be prioritised for posts becoming vacant outside of Dublin.<\/p><p>  A significant proportion of new posts in recent years have been in the Dublin region and other urban locations, and this is likely to continue given service demands and population trends.

The success of the outpatient initiative run by the HSE at the end of 2013, and further validation work in 2014, resulted in the facilitation of 33,000 extra outpatient appointments in 2013 and an additional 55,883 such appointments thus far in 2014.  As the Deputy can see, there has been an increase in capacity.  The success of the outpatient waiting list initiative last year in reducing the waiting list from over 100,000 in March 2013 to fewer than 5,000 in December 2013 has had the consequence of driving up inpatient and day-case waiting lists as patients are referred for appropriate treatment.  In addition, other pressures such as almost 30,000 new cancer diagnoses each year are placing increasing demands - of the order of 3,000-6,000 additional referral requirements - on the system each month.<\/p><p>  Almost half of the 7,727 patients waiting over eight months for inpatient and day-case treatment are accounted for by three hospitals, namely, Beaumont, the Mater and Galway.  There are several potential strategies hospitals can use when planning their resources most effectively around the delivery of the national access targets for their patients.  For example, improvements in chronological scheduling, consistent validation of waiting lists and active engagement with patients to reduce &quot;did not attend&quot;, or DNA, rates are under way in order to address outpatient waiting list.  Similar measures, as well as optimisation of theatre capacity and day of surgery admission, where possible, are being employed to improve management of inpatient and day-case waiting lists.  All hospitals have been asked to provide action plans to address all waiting lists by the HSE's national director of acute hospital services.  These individual hospital plans will be monitored by the special delivery unit's scheduled care team.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000015#N00300","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1412087700,"counter":90,"content":"<p>To the end of July more than 360,000 people were on outpatient waiting lists, an increase of almost 60,000 on the figure for last year.

There comes a point where it is no longer possible to force that level of throughput through hospitals because they simply do not have the ability to deal with it as a result of a lack of theatre capacity, consultants and front-line staff.  There is also an issue with regard to an inability to transfer people from acute hospitals to step-down facilities.  The latter is because the Government, the Department and the HSE have simply not provided funding for such facilities in recent years.  At any given time there can be between 600 and 700 people in our hospitals who should not be there and who should instead be being looked after in community settings - with access to home-care packages - or in step-down facilities.  It is one thing to make statements but there is also a need to put sufficient funding in place in order to ensure that our hospitals have the necessary capacity.<\/p><p>  Does the Minister agree that the special delivery unit appears to have run out of steam and that it also seems to be incapable of addressing outpatient and day-case waiting lists?

On Friday last, the Taoiseach issued an apology, saying: \"I wouldn't say it was my finest hour and I take responsibility for this having evolved to what people might imagine it is.\"  That apology calls for a far greater degree of clarification.  People are wondering what exactly he was apologising for, because he did not say precisely.  People did not imagine this; it happened.  The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht appointed Mr. McNulty to the board of IMMA, albeit for two weeks.  In so doing, the Government used IMMA, an institution with considerable artistic status and an achievement on behalf of the country, as a political tool.  He was clearly appointed to give him suitable qualifications to contest the Seanad by-election on the Cultural and Educational Panel.  Despite the fact that the Minister wished Mr. McNulty every success in his tenure only last Tuesday in the Seanad, he resigned on Friday, which raises a question: how could he, in her words, \"bring his considerable talents and abilities\" to serve effectively a board that he could not serve on for longer than a couple of weeks?<\/p><p>  Will the Taoiseach clarify when it was decided that Mr. McNulty would be the Seanad by-election candidate?  Did he or anybody on his behalf ask, direct or suggest to the Minister that Mr. McNulty be appointed to the board of IMMA?  Why was it decided to appoint someone to the board of a national institution when it was clear that the person could not serve for longer than a few weeks?

A sub-committee of the executive council made a recommendation for a number of names to be considered for the Seanad, which was their responsibility.  Subsequently, Deputy McGinley announced his retirement and I looked at the possibility of the appointment of a candidate for the Seanad from Donegal.

That list of eminent judges came before the Cabinet and was approved unanimously; therefore, things have changed; they are not the same as they were.  <br\/><br\/>What the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has done is set out an entirely new model for State appointments to remove that element of politics such that all appointments will be credible and all appointees will be qualified and appropriate for appointment.  It may well be that a Minister may say in keeping with his or her exclusive responsibility, &quot;These people are well known or you do not have enough suitable applicants for what I think we need.&quot;  Perhaps other applications come through on <i>StateBoards.ie<\/i>.  It is a genuine attempt to transform a system that has been very unclear for many years to a position of clarity, assessment, validation and selection for service on the boards in question.  As I said in respect of the Court of Civil Appeal, the seven member panel was selected by very eminent legal personnel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000023#V00800","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1412092500,"counter":236,"content":"<p>It is very important for the Taoiseach to comment on the employment of a member of the board of Irish Water as a personal driver for one of his Ministers.

The main purpose of the special European Council in August was to elect a new President of the European Council and appoint the new High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.  I am very pleased that the Polish Prime Minister, Donald Tusk, and the Italian Foreign Minister, Federica Mogherini, were selected for these key positions.  I have worked closely with Donald Tusk in his capacity as Prime Minister in the past few years and believe his experience and professionalism will serve the Union well.  I have told him that I look forward to working closely with him in driving forward the agenda of growth, jobs and investment.  I take the opportunity to record my thanks to the outgoing President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, and the outgoing High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton, who have guided the Union through some very difficult times in the past five years.<\/p><p>  While I did not have separate bilateral meetings with Chancellor Merkel, Prime Minister Renzi or President Hollande at the August European Council, I did, of course, engage with all of my colleagues during the course of discussions, including those to whom I have just referred.  I also met wChancellor Merkel during my visit to Berlin in<\/p><p>July.  My replies to previous questions about that visit are on the record of the House.  I have not had a specific meeting with the President of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, recently.  However, he participates regularly at European Council meetings when core economic issues are discussed.<\/p><p>  At the European Council meeting in August we discussed the economic and employment situation in the Union.  We reiterated the need to progress the country-specific recommendations under the European Semester and implement the strategic agenda agreed at the European Council in June.  We will return to these issues at the European Council and the Euro Summit in October which President Draghi will also attend.<\/p><p>  During the European Councils in June, July and August and on the margins of these meetings I engaged in discussions with a number of colleagues about Ireland's economic situation, as well as about broader European economic issues.  The possible use of the European Stability Mechanism for bank recapitalisation was not up for discussion at these European Council meetings, but it is for consideration by Finance Ministers.<\/p><p> At the July meeting of the European Council Heads of State and Governments repeated their call on Russia to actively use its influence over illegally armed groups and to stop the flow of weapons and militants across the border with Ukraine in order to de-escalate the situation rapidly.  The Council regretted the lack of progress on four key steps set out at the June meeting and agreed to take a number of new measures in response to the deteriorating situation in the area.  A special European Council meeting on 30 August took place against a backdrop of a very serious intensification of fighting in eastern Ukraine in the previous two weeks.  The meeting included a discussion with President Poroshenko.  The European Council condemned the increased flow of fighters and weapons from Russia into the Donbas region, as well as the aggression of Russian armed forces on Ukrainian soil, and called for their immediate withdrawal.  We reiterated the importance of implementing President Porosheko's peace plan without delay and set out the essential actions required to achieve this.  <\/p><p> The European Council also requested the Commission and the European External Action Service to present proposals for further restrictive measures against Russia within seven days for its consideration.  These measures which reinforce the restrictions already in place since July were adopted on 8 September and entered into force on 12 September.  We also called on all parties to support the UN-led international relief effort aimed at providing urgently needed humanitarian assistance for the local civilian population.  The European Council conclusions reiterated the urgent need for a sustainable political solution based on respect for Ukraine's sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and independence.<\/p><p> While the emergency Foreign Affairs Council in August focused on recent events in Gaza, the special meeting of the European Council in late August adopted conclusions which flowed from the Foreign Affairs Council welcoming the recent ceasefire and stressing, in particular, that efforts must continue to bring about an end to the closure regime operated by Israel, an improvement in the condition of the people in Gaza and an end to the rocket attacks on Israel.  The Council reiterated the European Union's willingness to assist in Gaza and stated Gaza must be part of the comprehensive resolution of the conflict in a two-state solution.  Further humanitarian and reconstruction aid for Gaza will be discussed at an international conference in Cairo on 12 October. <\/p><p> The European Council in August also expressed concern about the crisis caused by the ebola virus in Africa and stressed the importance of the international community as a whole providing substantial co-ordinated support for the countries of the region, NGOs and the World Health Organization to help them to tackle the disease as swiftly and effectively as possible.  The European Council welcomed the additional funds provided by the European Union and its member states and their efforts to provide further financial and human resources to meet, in particular, the increased demands for experts in local areas.  The European Council paid tribute to the efforts of humanitarian and health workers on the front line.  It called for increased co-ordination at EU level in the assistance provided by EU member states and invited the Council to adopt a comprehensive EU framework response to address the crisis.<\/p><p> I have answered questions on the special meeting of Heads of State and Government in Brussels in May and these replies are included in the Official Report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000023#V03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412093100,"counter":267,"content":"<p>As we have a short amount of time, I ask Deputies to be as brief as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000024#W00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1412093100,"counter":268,"content":"<p>After the euro area summit in June 2012, the Minister made lavish claims in the D&aacute;il that this meant one of the euro financial mechanisms would be used to replace the massive &euro;64 billion Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party, followed by Fine Gael and the Labour Party, had forced Irish taxpayers to pay to bail out the European financial market system.  That was two years and a number of months ago.  Why did this not feature at the summit on which the Taoiseach reported to us?  Where are the funds?  Where is the relief that was promised?  When the Taoiseach and the former T&aacute;naiste came here to talk about seismic changes and earth-shattering events, we thought a tsunami of relief was to follow shortly.  Not one cent has been seen and I ask the Taoiseach for an explanation.<\/p><p>  Has the position and future of Hong Kong featured at EU summit level in the recent period?  I am sure the Taoiseach knows that China is declaring that its Stalinist totalitarianism will be imposed on the people of Hong Kong who, in particular the youth but also wide ranges of the population, are in revolt and absolutely correct to be so.  Is the Taoiseach embarrassed about this recent development, as he feted the Chinese leadership and failed to criticise the nature of the regime when it visited Ireland?  There is massive repression at the diktat of the Chinese regime and we cannot rule out the possibility that a horror like what happened at Tiananmen Square could be visited on Hong Kong, either before or after the 2017 elections.  Will the matter feature in upcoming meetings?  Is it an issue on which the Taoiseach will engage and raise at meetings?  <\/p><p>  I refer to the horrors and atrocities visited on the people of Gaza by the overwhelming miliary power of and bombardment by the Israeli regime.  How do the Taoiseach and his fellow EU leaders justify Israel being a favoured state of the European Union as far as trade issues are concerned?  How does he justify the weak-kneed, cowardly, dishonest and hypocritical failure of the European Union to call what the Israeli regime is doing in Gaza by its name?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000024#W00300","speaker":"954"},{"type":"speech","time":1412093100,"counter":269,"content":"<p>The situation in Hong Kong was not discussed at the European Council meeting.  It had not erupted in the manner it has in more recent times.  I deplore that kind of activity and hope the situation can be stabilised quickly.  There is no doubt that it will be discussed in the future.<\/p><p>  On the question of finances, the banking union structure has continued to be put in place at official level and towards the end of the year the stability mechanism and banking union will be in place.  It will then be a question of considering what is the best option for recapitalisation.  The taxpayer put &euro;4 billion into Bank of Ireland and received &euro;6 billion in return and it still owns 15% of the entity.  The appropriate time for it to be disposed of is a matter for consideration by the Minister for Finance and the Government in due course.  The same applies to AIB.  The option of deciding which entity would give the best return to the taxpayer remains.  The option of being able to pursue the process of direct recapitalisation of the banks remains open and on the table, all of the elements having been completed.<\/p><p>  In regard to the situation in Gaza, we were appalled by it all summer.<\/p><p>The loss of life was not acceptable under any circumstances.  Ireland has consistently warned that if this was not resolved it would lead to a new outbreak of exceptional violence, which happened with loss of life, particularly on the Gaza side, following the shootings in the West Bank.  The situation has stabilised somewhat, but the place is destroyed.  There is an exceptional requirement for reconstruction funds to bring in material to rebuild the many thousands of dwellings and houses that have been flattened in Gaza.<\/p><p> The ceasefire on 26 August brought about some sense of stability, and I noticed the reaction of the people in Gaza to that.  Political discussions must continue.  The attitude and the political position of the different groups from Hamas to so many others is an issue that requires constant analysis because of the changing nature of what is happening there.  It is unacceptable to have had a continuation of attacks from Israel into Gaza.  I could never understand why one would hear comments that they were investigating incidents in which schools were hit and comments as to whether stocks of arms were held in United Nations buildings.  It always struck me that the United Nations is doing a remarkable job out there and clearly those buildings should be sacrosanct for the purposes for which they are intended.  How they could become places for arms to be stocked is something I could never get to grips with.  The ceasefire is tenuous.  It is another beginning with thousands of lives having been lost.<\/p><p> It is not appropriate that the acquisition of land on the West Bank and the building of very significant numbers of houses and apartments continue without restriction.  The European Union and the international community must be focused on this.  I note, for the attention of Deputy Joe Higgins, from the discussions which took place at the European Council that a million people have fled from Syria into southern Lebanon and a million people have moved from Syria into Jordan, and they have had all sorts of humanitarian crises in Syria.  There is a civil war in effect in Libya, and we have ISIS and ISIL and the other challenging issues that apply across the greater Middle East region, including the extermination of Christian communities and the Christian population at Mosul, formerly Nineveh.  Deputy Higgins will be aware that the UN Human Rights Council has appointed a panel of inquiry to examine breaches of human rights in the recent conflict, and I am sure it will find many.  We support the council and its work on this.  Ireland supported an investigation, and now that the panel has been established, I am not sure whether any other format will be brought forward.  The position has been grossly unacceptable and we hope the tenuous ceasefire that is now in place can continue and that these people in a devastated area can have some sense of family living.  It is a couple of years since I was out there, but one has to go there, as the Deputy knows himself, to see the extent of the devastation - flattened buildings, unemployed young people and the struggles they have to deal with every day under different regimes, always with the awareness that another incursion might take place.  This was an issue that was raised also.<\/p><p> The financial position and issues with regard to repayments were raised.  I note for information the approval, of which the Deputy will be aware, that has been given from our European colleagues for the early purchase of IMF loan repayments.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and his team did an excellent job here.  Ireland borrowed &euro;22.5 billion at 5% from the IMF, the most expensive portion of which is the &euro;18.3 billion portion which is subject to the IMF's highest credit surcharge.  It makes practical common sense that if we can borrow at much lower rates than applied previously, there is an opportunity to buy out the loans.  Thanks be to God we can, as the rates currently available on the international markets are well below the 5% level.  Our ten-year bond in Ireland is now less than 2%.  By buying out the loans at a lesser charge, we can save the taxpayer approximately &euro;1.5 billion over a five-year period.  That would be a positive indicator for Europe, a very significant advance for Ireland and a very worthwhile saving for the taxpayer here due to the emergence of the country as a stronger and more competitive economic unit.  We are grateful to our EU colleagues for that.<\/p><p> Under the terms of each of Ireland's loan agreements with the EFSF, the ESM and the three bilateral lenders - the UK, Sweden and Denmark - we were supposed to pay back those loans at the same time as making repayments on the IMF loans.  However, at the meeting of 12 and 13 September, Ministers expressed broad support for Ireland's proposal, as did the bilateral lenders.  For some member states, this approval is subject to the necessity of reverting to their national parliaments for parliamentary approval and authorisation.  That is being done.  For the EFSF loans, the Eurogroup mandated the euro working group to take this proposal forward while ECOFIN mandated the economic and financial committee to do likewise.  The Minister for Finance wrote to the EFSF, the ESM and the three bilateral lenders on 19 September to formally request their agreement to our proposal to repay up to &euro;18.3 billion of our IMF loans ahead of schedule and to the waiving of the mandatory proportionate repayment clauses set out in each of the loan documents.  Once the national procedures are adopted, it will be possible for Ireland to start discussions with the IMF on the detailed arrangements for early repayment.  I am sure Deputy Higgins welcomes that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000024#W00400","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412093700,"counter":271,"content":"<p>I suggest we group the questions of the three Deputies offering to speak: Deputy Adams, Deputy Martin and Deputy Boyd Barrett.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000025#X00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1412093700,"counter":272,"content":"<p>I have about ten questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000025#X00300","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1412093700,"counter":273,"content":"<p>There are only 12 minutes remaining and I cannot leave anyone out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000025#X00400","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1412093700,"counter":274,"content":"<p>I will be as brief as I can, but I note that this is not a satisfactory way to do business.  I asked a number of questions of the Taoiseach about Gaza and the onslaught there and he did not answer one of them in his response.  We all know that more than 2,000 people were killed by the Israeli Defence Forces, including more than 500 children, and that the Israeli Government is in breach of international law, humanitarian law and criminal law.  The question is what the people of Palestine are to do.  If the international community stands back and does not uphold the rights of citizens there, the Israeli Government will continue to do what it is doing.<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach said in his remarks that the international community must be focused on this, but our Government is not focused on it.  Our Government, this State and the island of Ireland could be leaders in conflict resolution and the promotion of human rights globally, but we are not.  We have the shameful decision by the Government to abstain on a UN vote calling for an investigation into war crimes during the slad on Gaza.  It is beyond comprehension that we abstained on that issue.  Similarly, while the Government recognises the mission of the State of Palestine in Ireland, it does not provide it with the same privileges, immunities, exemptions and facilities granted to other diplomatic missions in Dublin pursuant to the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.  In response to a question I asked, I was told that a formal recognition of the Palestinian state and the establishment of formal diplomatic relations should take place in the context of a comprehensive peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.<\/p><p>That is not good enough.  I ask the Taoiseach to ensure that we become champions of peace in the Middle East, that we stand up for the rights of the people of Israel, particularly those who are the victims, and for the rights of the people of Palestine.  He can do that by affording full diplomatic status to the Palestinian mission in Ireland and raising all those issues in a consistent and ongoing way.<\/p><p> I note the response to what is happening in Ukraine is markedly different from what is happening in the ongoing crisis in the Middle East and the onslaught upon the people of the Palestinian territories.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000025#X00500","speaker":"1066","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412094300,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I have tabled 11 questions in this group and it is unsatisfactory that I have to deal with them all now in a short space of time.

Whoever decided to group them should have at least divided them up in that way because this is totally unsatisfactory.<\/p><p>  First, in terms of the debt issue and the retrospective debt, for three and a half years the Taoiseach and the Government defined relief on banking debt as European agreement on retrospectively funding the debts that were effectively imposed on Ireland.  In fact, two senior Ministers went so far as to say that up to &euro;60 billion could be retrieved in such a manner.  That followed the famous 2012 meeting when Mario Monti and those others forced Chancellor Merkel's hand but what we have witnessed since then essentially has been the unravelling of that decision.  The Taoiseach has completely changed tack and the idea of getting such a sizeable retrospective deal has abated; he has given up on that.  He now uses vague language to do with existing options, and no one quite knows what those options are.  There was always an option to sell the banks later on.  That was never off the table, but that was not the point.  The point was that Europe imposed a solution in Ireland at a time when Europe itself did not have solutions for what was a wider eurozone crisis, not just an Irish crisis.  That is at the kernel of this, and it did not treat Ireland fairly.  The former T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, said that the 2012 meeting was a game changer.  It has not turned out to be a game changer.  Can the Taoiseach confirm to the House that the European leaders are not prepared to do a deal on Ireland's debt retrospectively?  The separation of sovereign and banking debt, which was proclaimed, will not be retrospective.  Can the Taoiseach give a straight answer regarding what he is being told now by Chancellor Merkel and others?<\/p><p>  Second, regarding the Palestinian crisis and the appalling strategy being taken by the Israeli Government, we have condemned the Hamas rocket attacks on Israel but those rocket attacks were no justification for the declaration of war on Palestine, and on Gaza in particular, by the Israeli Government.  It cannot bomb with impunity and do those kinds of military operations without killing many innocent women and children, and innocent civilians generally.  What was appalling was the lack of any pulling back when innocent children running across a beach were murdered.  To be honest, the Taoiseach pulled his punches in terms of the UN committee on human rights but there was a lack of unequivocal condemnation of that kind of activity emanating, in my view, from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and from others.  I got the sense that there was a decided lack of comfort within Government circles about what was transpiring and how to react to it.  There comes a time when we have to say that the use of such lethal force on a civilian population had no justification and was a disproportionate response to what was happening.<\/p><p>  There is a sense that the Government has a particular position on this debate than that it had three and a half years ago in that it was far more tolerant of Israeli strategy, which I believe is a flawed strategy.  I have no difficulty in terms of Israel as a state in the sense that I recognise its right to exist and I recognise the two-state solution as the ideal solution, but I am not sure Israel believes in a two-state solution.  I am not sure that its political strategy is designed to achieve that.  In fact, one would have to come to the conclusion that its political strategy is to do the exact opposite.  The recent announcements in terms of further land settlements is flying in the face of United Nations rules, regulations and law and makes it far more difficult to ever have a two-state solution or a Palestinian state that has the capacity to be effective as a Palestinian state.<\/p><p>  All the Israeli strategy succeeds in doing is undermining moderate opinion within Gaza and moderate opinion within the West Bank, and undermines Abbas and his Government, Fayyad and all those who showed that progress could be made if there was some dialogue.  It is almost as if Israel has a vested interest in ensuring that the extremes stay vibrant and in existence.  People may disagree with my position on that but that is my sense of it.  There is an urgency for Europe in that regard.  The UN Secretary-General summed it up when the conflict ended when he asked - &quot;what do we do now?&quot;.  Do we rebuild it yet again?  How many more hundreds of millions of people will come from Europe to rebuild Gaza for another war in two years time, which will level everything again?  I recall being at Foreign Affairs Council meetings at which Tony Blair said the sewage treatment plant would be rebuilt.  None of the promises made after the flotilla disasters, which the Taoiseach might remember, happened.  It is an appalling crime against humanity that an entire population is imprisoned to the degree it is, and western states and the European states have not called it what it is, for a range of reasons.  It is time some countries within the European Council, including Ireland, spoke a few truths now and again about this issue.  I ask the Taoiseach to give me some indication of what transpired at the summit meeting with regard to that issue.<\/p><p>  Third, regarding Ukraine, I welcome the Taoiseach's support for the tough sanctions against Russia in terms of its aggression against a neighbouring state.  The Sinn F&eacute;in leader said there seemed to be a different response from the Government side to Gaza than there would be to Ukraine.  One could make the same statement about the Sinn F&eacute;in's stance in terms of Gaza and Ukraine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000026#Y00400","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1412094300,"counter":279,"content":"<p>That is not the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000026#Y00500","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1412094300,"counter":280,"content":"<p>It is because Sinn F&eacute;in has followed the same line in the European Parliament as it followed here-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000026#Y00600","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1412094300,"counter":281,"content":"<p>We have been very clear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000026#Y00700","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1412094300,"counter":282,"content":"<p>-----which is that it attacked the European Union and the United States, and it tried to draw an equivalence between the behaviour of the EU and the United States to Russia's behaviour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000026#Y00800","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1412094300,"counter":283,"content":"<p>All of them are wrong.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000026#Y00900","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1412094300,"counter":284,"content":"<p>That is my point.

Europe and the developed states have not responded with the urgency necessary from the outset of this crisis.  It is an appalling, devastating crisis, not only in terms of ebola itself.  The entire public health system in Sierra Leone, west Africa and across the entire Continent is in danger of collapsing.  There will be far more deaths from malaria, maternal mortality and other conditions because people are no longer turning up to hospitals.  Hospitals are closing.  Health staff have left because of the impact of ebola.  People are not taking medicines or going onto the system.  I acknowledge that the Government has donated &euro;600,000.  He might see if Irish Aid could do more and if the public health community in Ireland could meet with a view to determining if there is anything they could do on a more practical level to assist the international effort.<\/p><p>This is a public health crisis of extraordinary consequence and demands a far greater international response then it has received to date.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000026#Y01700","speaker":"992","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412094900,"counter":293,"content":"<p>My question concerns double standards when it comes to the way Europe deals with the situation faced by Palestinians, and the people of Gaza in particular, in the wake of the recent assault by Israel on Gaza.  I would like the Taoiseach to explain how on earth the EU can continue to confer trade privileges and effective associate EU membership on Israel, contribute &euro;840 million in recent years to Israel to develop weapons and missile systems through the EU scientific research programme and continue to allow the EU to be largest trading partner of Israel by a mile.  We give them trade privileges, unprecedented access to EU funds and we contribute directly to the development of weaponry and military research that Israel uses against Palestinians in what Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande described as a massacre.  The president of an EU state described what they did to the UN school as a massacre.<\/p><p>  The Russell tribunal met in the past week in Brussels and found that Israel's Operation Protective Edge displayed evidence of war crimes, crimes against humanity, crimes of murder, extermination, persecution and incitement to genocide.  It does not get much more serious than that yet the EU confers trade privileges on a state accused of these things.  At what point do diplomatic niceties, realpolitik and blind submission to the diktats of the wider EU and its strategic interests give way to standing up and showing moral backbone and saying it is no longer acceptable to treat as a normal state and confer privileges and trade benefits on a state guilty of massacres and accused of genocidal action?<\/p><p>  The same European Union can, in an instant, impose sanctions on Russia.  I absolutely condemn what Russia is doing in Ukraine but nobody is accusing Russia of genocide.  Israel is being accused of genocide and there is no question that it engaged in massacres yet we do nothing.  When will the Taoiseach speak out and stop hiding behind EU silence and the claim that it is a decision for the EU?  Will Ireland speak out about this and say it is not good enough that genocidal assaults over many years are being conducted against the people of Gaza and we continue not just to treat Israel as a normal state but to confer privilege on it?  It is an extraordinary moral contradiction and I ask the Taoiseach to explain it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000027#Z00200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1412094900,"counter":294,"content":"<p>It is just not good enough.  Deputy Martin raised Gaza as well.  It is a country surrounded by Arab countries and on three occasions in the past 30 or 40 years a two-state solution was offered but rejected because of the inability of Arab nations to get agreement on this very controversial situation.  It is unacceptable in any circumstances that, as pointed out by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, disproportionate use of lethal force should be directed at a confined entity like Gaza.  Ireland has been forthright in unreservedly condemning that scale of attack and also condemning the rockets from Gaza indiscriminately fired into places in Israel.  Ireland has its experience and the professionalism of our troops serving in the UN based on our proven capacity to do things differently in the case of conflict resolution, including decommissioning weapons and building tenuous peace.  I was speaking to someone yesterday who was in Belfast 25 years ago and I asked him what he thought.  He said that the walls are higher and that it is not the way it used to be despite the fact that things were difficult then.  Deputy Gerry Adams is aware of the discussions to be led by both Governments that may bring about a renewed sense of activity about what we must do in Northern Ireland.  I share the view of Deputies Boyd Barrett and Miche&aacute;l Martin on the question of water, accommodation and the scale of reconstruction funds that must go in to Gaza for the nth time.  The blockade of its seaward side and its sea fishing exits is crushing people.  This is a case of attempting a different kind of conflict resolution but it must involve the capacity to reach out to different forces.  The question of decommissioning is an issue.<\/p><p>  Ebola has frightened millions of people listening to international newscasters.  If people contract symptoms that look like ebola and decide to leave the local region, they carry this with them.  The capacity to beat this is obviously there and it may be that countries allocating money for humanitarian aid may be better off giving a proportion of it to the World Health Organisation, which has the logistical capacity to deal with it but not have the funds.  Countries with good intent allocate funding for humanitarian works.  A portion of it might be better spent by the World Health Organisation to deal with rehydration of people and developing the capacity to treat people locally rather than have them travel long distances where the disease can spread.  My layman's understanding of this is that it can peter out with proper treatment but new movement brings about a resurgence and causes major anxiety.  With regard to Deputy Martin's comment about the Irish aid already given, we will see whether something else can be made available.<\/p><p>  President Poroshenko was very forthright at the European Council meeting, as was the response from the European Council in respect of the extra sanctions implemented within seven days.

It was not possible to do anything until the banking resolution and banking union mechanisms were put in place, which will be from November.  The Government will make its decision on the best option.<\/p><p>The Deputy is correct in that the option of the sale back of the banks was always available.  With direct recapitalisation, it took a hell of an amount of complex and tortuous discussion and negotiations to get to the present point.  It is now being finalised and is the subject of decisions by countries if they wish to make a claim under it.  <\/p><p> The Government will make its decisions in due course on the testing of the value of banks or the option of pursuing the question of the decision of 2012, which is still there and very much on the table.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000027#Z00300","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1412095500,"counter":296,"content":"<p>Written Answers follow Adjournment.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Order of Business","time":1412095500,"counter":297,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000028#AA00250"},{"type":"speech","time":1412095500,"counter":298,"content":"<p>It is proposed to take No. 16, motion re proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of the Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income) (Kingdom of Belgium) Order 2014 (back from committee); No. 17, motion re proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of the Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income and Capital Gains) (Kingdom of Thailand) Order 2014 (back from committee); No. 18, motion re proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of the Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income and on Capital) (Grand Duchy of Luxembourg) Order 2014 (back from committee); No. 19, motion re proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of the Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income) (Botswana) Order 2014 (back from committee); No. 20, motion re proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of the Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income) (Kingdom of Denmark) Order 2014 (back from committee); and No. 5, Registration of Lobbying Bill 2014 - Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.<br\/><br\/>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. 16 to 20, inclusive, shall be decided without debate and shall be moved together and decided by one question which shall be put from the Chair.

We cannot sort out the world on our own.

The cost of such operations here is approximately &euro;10,000.  I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that this makes no economic sense whatsoever.  Is he in a position to confirm that this issue will be examined in order that surgery might be performed here rather than in the United Kingdom?

In her current capacity as Minister for Justice and Equality, however, she published the actual Children and Family Relationships Bill on Friday last and has excluded the section on surrogacy.  In January the Government - through the former Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter - launched the general scheme of the Bill which included a section that would have provided legal clarity on the parentage of children born through assisted human reproduction and surrogacy and granted &quot;court oversight in the making of declarations of parentage in order to ensure future arrangements consensual, altruistic and non-commercial&quot;.  Surrogacy was mentioned on 97 occasions in the general scheme published in January, but there is not one reference to it in the Bill published on Friday last.  On promised legislation, the Government previously indicated that the issue of surrogacy would be dealt with.

I also thank the Minister for attending.  This is a serious issue relating to pupil-teacher ratios, PTRs, in two schools.  The first is Donaghpatrick national school in Caherlistrane, north Galway.  When the school forwarded its enrolment numbers to the Department a number of months ago, it had the correct number to secure an additional developmental teaching post.  However, through no fault of the school, a family had to leave the area for economic reasons, reducing the number of pupils by three.  Unfortunately, that has left the school in a terrible predicament whereby it will lose the developmental post at the end of October.  The concern for the school is that this will result in a class of 42 students in junior and senior infants, which is unacceptable.  This is also causing a great deal of concern for parents.  To add insult to injury, the post will be given back to the school next year and, therefore, for the sake of four or five months, 42 students will be put together in one classroom.  It is unacceptable and I would like the Department to demonstrate some flexibility in retaining the teacher and taking the pressure off the teachers and pupils.<\/p><p>  The second school is Cappataggle national school near Ballinasloe, County Galway.  This relates to the changes in the PTR for two-, three- and four-teacher schools in rural areas.  If the school enrolment remains as it is, the school will lose a teacher next September.  This is unbelievable, because the State pumped a great deal of money into the school a number of years ago.  If the post is lost, the two classrooms that the money was invested in will no longer have a teacher or students.  I acknowledge that budgetary measures have been implemented, but could the PTR for 2013 be used?  This would give the school an opportunity to retain its allocation.<\/p><p>  We need a review of how teachers are allocated.  It makes no sense to remove a teacher from Donaghpatrick national school when the post will be given back to the school next September.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000031#DD03500","speaker":"1041"},{"type":"speech","time":1412097300,"counter":397,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this issue and I thank the Minister for being present to reply to the debate.  I regret that she has declined my numerous requests since August to meet to discuss this matter, but I have an opportunity now.  Since the measures were announced in budget 2012, I have worked hard to have some reversed and to have their impact eased, with some success, through, for example, the introduction of the appeals process.  However, the impact on schools has been profound and it has led to huge difficulties.  In particular, geographically isolated schools, which will never have the option of amalgamation and are far away from the nearest other schools, have been hit hard.  The Department's message at the time the changes were introduced was that the entire process would encourage amalgamation.<\/p><p>For a small number of schools, mainly on the western seaboard, amalgamation will never be an option.  Lauragh national school, on the Beara Peninsula in my constituency, is located on a stretch of 26 km where there are no other primary schools.  It has lost its second teacher because it has 17 pupils, which falls below the threshold of 20.<\/p><p> It would be easy for the Department to allow a geographically isolated school to appeal its staffing allocation on the grounds that it is isolated.  The Department's appeals board could then consider each appeal on its merits.  Unfortunately, the Department is not showing any flexibility in this matter.  I have been informed that the issue cannot be discussed until the value for money report has been published, which is an unacceptable position.  Children living in geographically isolated communities are not any less important than children living in urban environments.  This matter could be addressed with the stroke of a pen.  I ask the Minister to act.  The appeals process was introduced without any great difficulty and this issue could also be rectified.  Unfortunately, it has not been addressed and children are suffering as a result.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000031#DD03600","speaker":"1051","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412097900,"counter":399,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies Paul Connaughton and Brendan Griffin for raising this important issue.  I apologise that I was not able to attend the House to discuss this issue last week.  The Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, and I were both appearing before the Select Committee on Education and Skills to discuss the Estimates.  I note, however, that Deputy Brendan Griffin spoke about this issue earlier in the summer when he explained to me the position on small schools in his locality.<\/p><p>  The staffing arrangements for primary schools include a provision whereby schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional classroom posts on developing grounds.  These are not the types of school the Deputies have highlighted.  In addition, a staffing appeals process is available to schools, including a new criterion for the 2014-15 school year which is aimed at schools that make a significant contribution to absorbing demographic growth.<\/p><p>  The Government recognises that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities and they will continue to be a feature of the education landscape.  The staffing schedule at primary level disproportionately benefits small primary schools.  It is worth noting that more than two thirds of the 3,200 primary schools have more than 86 pupils and, therefore, a much higher average class size than all of the schools affected by this measure.  For example, a two teacher school with 32 pupils has an average class size of one teacher for 16 pupils.  In contrast, a typical ten teacher school with 272 pupils has an average class size of 27.2 pupils.  Nevertheless, I accept Deputy Paul Connaughton's point that teachers in smaller schools must teach a number of different classes.  <\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the phased increases implemented in the period between 2012 and 2014, the threshold for small schools will still be significantly lower than the minimum of 28 pupils that was required for the appointment of a second teacher in schools prior to the mid-1990s.  An appeals process is available to small schools affected by this budget change.  A school with four classroom teachers or fewer which is losing a teacher or failed to gain an additional teacher as a result of the budget 2012 measures can submit an appeal to the primary staffing appeals board.

The figure will decline to &euro;2.2 million in 2014-15.  At best, the measures saved &euro;1.5 million after tax, which is a pittance in the context of the departmental budget.  They are, however, having a profound impact on small, rural communities and not benefiting larger schools.

One of the first questions I tabled on my election to the D&aacute;il was to ask when the report would be published.

The Department is hiding behind it and taking what could almost be described as a threatening approach to those who raise issues about small schools by stating it will publish the report.  Given that the report will probably be leaked a few weeks before the election, it would be better to publish it now and have an honest debate on it.  It is unacceptable that it has been held back for the past three years, during which communities with small schools have suffered.  In one school in south County Kerry only one teacher is available for 17 children across eight streams.  Amalgamation is not an option for that school and a handful of other geographically isolated schools.  With political will, this matter could be addressed overnight.

It is a pity that the Minister for Education and Skills has left the Chamber as the issue I raise also relates to education.  Children from certain household backgrounds are more likely to die young, experience poor health and have literacy problems, yet educational supports for such children have been targeted for cuts.  The background to this issue is that for the past six months meetings have been held in a number of local communities to highlight and explain to public representatives what is coming down the track.<\/p><p> For the last six years there has been a 33% cut in the school completion programme.  Those schools are now asking for a halt to those cuts.  They hear statements from the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy JOan Burton, and the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, to the effect that things will change but they have not seen that happen.  <\/p><p> I have visited a number of schools in my constituency recently, including St. Mark's, St. Maelruain's and St. Dominic's, as well as others in Old Bawn, East Tallaght, Killinarden, Brookfield, Fettercairn and Jobstown.  Those schools have wall charts of all the different things on their programmes but one could see that after six years those programmes had been gutted and filleted.  The schools are saying that the cuts have to stop.<\/p><p> The cuts are affecting the most marginalised students and their families.  More cuts is the message coming from the Minister's new agency, Tusla.  Talk is cheap but action is really important.  Every euro taken from these programmes is a huge loss to society and a kick in the teeth for those communities.<\/p><p> How can the Minister stand over these cuts?  Most of us in this House - some of us more strongly than others - believe in the idea of an inclusive and progressive society but that is not happening.  Over the last six years, such school programmes have gone backwards instead of progressing.  <\/p><p> In real terms, it will mean fewer people attending third level education.  Recent figures showed that in Dublin 24 some 16% of school students continue to third-level education, whereas literally down the road in Dublin 6 some 99% of students continue to third level.  That is the sort of divide that exists in our society.  It comes down to the fact that if children leave school early they have nowhere to go.  They will not go into well paid jobs.  Many of them will be hanging around street corners while some will get involved in drug dealing and other criminal activity.  It makes sense to provide such supports, including monitoring school attendance.  <\/p><p> The OECD has reported that 93% of young people complete second-level education in Ireland compared to the OECD average of 84%.  People around the world are examining the Irish model, so what have we got right?  We are literally filleting it and tearing it up. <\/p><p> I hope the Minister will have some answers.  Everyone will be looking at the next budget but some schools have already been told that this year's cut is 6.5%.  As I said earlier, there has been a 33% cut in the school completion programme in the past six years.  It is very hard to stand over this. <\/p><p> Given the Minister's message, are we really sincere about trying to keep young people at school through the school completion programme?  If so, we will have to change direction and stop this drift away from the programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000032#EE01100","speaker":"1037","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412098500,"counter":410,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this question.  I wish to confirm that we are very serious about this matter.  The aims of the school completion programme are to help young people stay in the formal education system until they complete senior cycle, as well as generally improving their school attendance and participation in education.  The programme is a targeted intervention for schools identified through the DEIS action plan for educational inclusion of the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p><p>  The school completion programme involves 124 locally managed projects and related initiatives, operating across 470 primary schools and 224 post-primary schools.  It provides targeted supports to some 36,000 children and young people who may be at risk of educational disadvantage.<\/p><p>  Every project in the school completion programme is managed and directed by a local management committee, which includes representatives of schools, parents and other education stakeholders in the locality.<\/p><p>  The programme's project model approach gives local communities the autonomy they need to devise creative and innovative approaches to effectively address the needs of young people most at risk of early school leaving.  Projects provide a range of targeted supports, including homework clubs, breakfast clubs, mentoring programmes, learning support, and social and personal development programmes for young people.  In addition, a number of out-of-school supports including music, art and sports are provided, as well as a range of activities during holiday periods.<\/p><p>  As with all major spending programmes, the school completion programme budget was examined in the context of the 2011 comprehensive review of expenditure.  This process identified a requirement for savings of 6.5% per annum across the programme over the period 2012 to 2014.  In 2014, an allocation of &euro;24.76 million has been provided for the programme.<\/p><p>  Since its establishment at the beginning of this year, the Child and Family Agency, Tusla, has operational responsibility for the school completion programme, including allocating funds to projects within the programme.  This process requires local projects to develop annual school retention plans, with detailed service proposals for the forthcoming school year.<\/p><p>  Allocations to projects are determined on the basis of these school retention plans, while having regard to the savings requirements set out in the 201 I comprehensive review of expenditure.  I am advised that the agency has completed the detailed process of evaluating and approving the school retention plans prepared by individual projects for 2014-15 and that the first instalment of funding under the programme issued to projects in the first week of September.  Further instalments will issue in December 2014 and May\/June 2015.<\/p><p>  The Child and Family Agency will continue to work closely with local management committees, schools and local school completion programme co-ordinators to assist projects through the process.  The potential for any changes in the funding allocated to this programme in future years is a matter to be considered in the Estimates and budgetary process, and the resources available to Government.<\/p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that a review of the school completion programme is currently under way, which is an important initiative in relation to the future development of the programme.  The objectives of the review are to identify best practice in providing support to children and young people to stay in school; clarify the roles and responsibilities of those involved in the programme; and build upon the valuable learning and experience acquired to date.<\/p><p>  It is envisaged that this work will be completed during the 2014-15 academic year.  The review should help to identify any reforms that are needed to put the programme on a sustainable footing for the future.  Most importantly, the findings of the review will be critical to ensuring that funding is directed to those services that provide the greatest contribution to better outcomes and brighter futures for vulnerable children and young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000033#FF00200","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1412098500,"counter":411,"content":"<p>We are talking about disadvantaged schools right across the country.  It is not just a problem in urban areas but also in rural ones.  I hoped that something positive would come out of the Minister's speech and he said there will be a review, which is grand.  However, many boards of management involved in the school completion programme have told me that they cannot continue.  No programme can sustain a 33% cut over a number of years.  It sends the wrong message concerning the school completion programme.  We are doing a similar thing in the drugs area but that is an argument for another day.<\/p><p>  The whole idea of the programme is to give support to disadvantaged students.  According to the attendance levels, it would appear that the programme is working.  However, the level of incremental cuts over the past six years is now impacting on such services, so it has to stop.  It may be a budgetary argument but the situation is not sustainable.  Teachers and students in the relevant schools want the programme to continue working.  I am appealing to the Minister to go forward instead of going back, but in order to progress the programme needs to be funded.  I welcome any review in that regard.  The school completion programme will stand up to any peer review.<\/p><p>Ultimately, we need to send to those communities a positive message that education is the way forward, that it is not set aside for a small elite in society and that there is a place for every child if he or she wants to proceed to further education.

Will the Minister, in his new position, commit to championing the cause of those children who have been left behind and are disadvantaged through no fault of their own?

We want those who are particularly vulnerable and at risk of losing out through leaving education early in life to be supported in the best way possible.  The schools inclusion programme is a huge part of this process.  There have been cuts because, as we know, the country found itself in a bailout having lost its financial sovereignty.  However, we are now out of the bailout programme and will certainly do everything in our power to protect the school completion programme.  However, Government expenditure in this area is not limited to that programme.  Nearly &euro;49 million has been spent on various youth services programmes to offer support to young people all around the country.  There is no doubt but that we could not do without these youth organisations and the tens of thousands of volunteers who work in this area supporting children and programmes, not to mention the tens of thousands of volunteers in the sports organisations who help to keep children occupied and engaged in healthy and physical activity that is to their benefit.  We certainly have not targeted this area for cuts, but it has been one that has had to endure cuts.  It is an area in which I firmly believe it is worth investing.  Money spent on prevention reduces expenditure on treatment in a general sense, but nowhere is the gain greater than with children.  Certainly, from our point of view and in our budget negotiations, this has been to the fore in our minds.  We want to continue to support children to get the best out of the education system and support them when they are getting into trouble.

She was a young woman in her prime and had just given birth to her first baby.  The real tragedy is that this was not an isolated incident.  Unfortunately, Dhara was the latest in a long list of others, including Savita Halappanavar, Nora Hyland, Bimbo Onanuga and Tanya McCabe.  There have been inquests in Sligo and investigations in Portlaoise, in the middle of which are women hoping their giving birth to their children will be a joyous occasion.<\/p><p>  All of the occurrences in question happened under the watch of the HSE.  There is a systemic crisis in maternity care, for two reasons.  First, the cutbacks have meant that not a single maternity hospital is operating to safe ratios.  Critically, however, our policies are wrong.  We have an outdated antenatal policy that has not been changed for years.  We should be seeking to develop a country-wide strategy involving midwifery-led units; instead, the HSE is actively pursuing midwives.  I find it sickening that on the same day that the verdict of death by medical misadventure was given against Sligo hospital, where a midwife said she could not tell a patient had jaundice because she was Indian, an independent midwife with 31 years of stalwart experience, Ms Philomena Canning, had her State indemnity insurance withdrawn consequent to a decision handed down in the courts.  All afternoon I have been receiving e-mails from people who worked with Ms Canning and women for whom she acted or has been acting as midwife.  Her crime was not killing somebody or doing something which led to somebody's death; rather, it was that, while observing all procedures and protocols, she transferred a woman to hospital after a home birth when that woman felt dizzy.  That woman was discharged ten hours later and she and her baby were fine.  Owing to the actions of the HSE, there are ten women &ndash; many of whom are about to give birth imminently &ndash; who do not have a midwife.  This is really serious, particularly when one notes the list of fatalities in hospitals under the direction of the HSE.  Nobody was suspended, let alone fired.  Ms Canning has devoted her life to women and proper birthing in which women have a choice.  The policy is completely wrong and the Minister must consider a decent and proper system of maternity care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000034#GG00400","speaker":"1192"},{"type":"speech","time":1412099100,"counter":416,"content":"<p>I extend my deepest sympathies to Mr. Michael Kivlehan and his family on their tragic loss.  Mr. Kivlehan's perseverance in having the hearing held in the Republic did the State a great service in the sense that it has brought to light some of the issues regarding the death of his wife, Dhara.  It was unacceptable in first instance that efforts were made not to have an inquest.  It was said the inquest should be held in Belfast because that was where Dhara had died, but, thankfully, through the perseverance of Michael, his family and legal representatives, an inquest was held here.  The information that has emerged on the care offered to Dhara in Sligo leaves a lot of questions unanswered on the longer term issues concerning maternity services, not only in Sligo but also across the country.<br\/><br\/>Ms Eilish O'Regan wrote an article in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>today on the lack of information emerging from maternity services.  We have raised this issue before on foot of the cases of Tanya McCabe, Savita Halappanavar and others who died while giving birth or just thereafter.  Ms O'Regan states:<blockquote>The blunt statement was made by Phelim Quinn, who is now acting head of the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), when he was launching its report on the death of Savita Halappanavar in University Hospital Galway.  He revealed that some maternity units have not even provided annual reports to give basic statistics and reveal how and why any babies or mothers died in their care.  Maternity services have existed largely under the radar until the case of Savita and earlier this year revelations of four similar baby deaths in Portlaoise hospital since 2006.  The full details of the tragic case of Dhara Kivlehan, who died in Sligo General Hospital, would probably never have come to light had it not been for her brave husband Michael.<\/blockquote>In general, we have very safe maternity services in this country, but there is still a problem regarding the collation of data on incidents and ensuring monitoring and proper oversight.  We cannot continually blame staff when there are huge pressures on the system.  There are systemic failures in the system regarding intensive care beds.  A lack of such beds was identified during the inquest.  We do not yet have a centralised system for intensive care bed allocation such that patients can be transferred to the place where the most appropriate care is available.  We owe it to Dhara and the other women who have, unfortunately, died tragically to put in place safe services.  Most important, we owe it to those women who are pregnant and the young women who intend to have a child at some stage in our maternity services.  We also owe it to the staff.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000034#GG00500","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1412099100,"counter":417,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for raising this important issue and allowing me to address the House on the matter.<\/p><p>  I offer my deepest condolences to Mr. Michael Kivlehan, his son, Dior, and their families on the sad and tragic loss of Dhara Kivlehan.  I understand the HSE has offered sincere condolences and apologised to both families for the shortcomings in the management and care of Mrs. Kivlehan at Sligo Regional Hospital.<\/p><p>  While cases of medical misadventure do occur in the health service, it is very important to reassure women and their families that maternal and perinatal health statistics indicate that Ireland continues to be a very safe country in which to give birth.  Our safety record and maternal mortality rates compare favourably with those of other developed countries.  It is important that we reassure people of these facts.<\/p><p> The tragic death of Mrs. Kivlehan took place in 2010.  This was before the investigation by HIQA into a maternal death in University Hospital Galway and prior to the CMO's report on perinatal deaths at the Midland Regional Hospital Portlaoise.  The actions required to address the recommendations of both reports are being undertaken across health services to improve patient safety and provide a more patient centred model of care.<\/p><p> A patient safety culture is now embedded in the HSE's service plan through specific measures, including performance indicators for health care associated infections, medication safety and implementation of early warning scores, which did not obtain at the time.  My officials meet the HSE each month on the service plan and patient safety is a standing item on the agenda.  The HSE has advised me that improvements in patient safety continue within maternity services at Sligo Regional Hospital.  The HSE is also focused on delivering improvements in the way critical care is organised and delivered within the hospital group structures to ensure patients receive the same high quality of care no matter where they are treated.<\/p><p> Furthermore, as the Deputies will be aware, we are working on the development of a new maternity strategy for Ireland.  Developing the strategy will provide us with an opportunity to take stock of current services and identify how we can improve the quality and safety of care provided for pregnant women and their babies.  This will include both hospital and home care and obstetric-led and maternity led units.  The strategy will ensure services comply with best available national and international standards.  We want to make sure women are provided with the right care, in the right setting, by the right person, at the right time.<\/p><p> While maternal deaths in Ireland are rare, I know that is of no consolation to those families who have suffered such a loss, but I can assure them that we are learning from mistakes of the past, building on that knowledge in the present and endeavouring to ensure they are not repeated in the future.<\/p><p> Deputy Kelleher Billy asked about the availability of intensive care beds.

However, I am aware that the HSE supports and provides cover for a number of community midwives and that no effort is being made to reduce or remove cover for all community midwives.

I received many e-mails on this issue, but one I received this afternoon came from a woman who was a patient of Ms Philomena Canning and is 32 weeks pregnant.  She says women are entering hospitals and leaving in coffins and that women are leaving maternity hospitals carrying their dead children home to be buried.

Pregnancy is not a disease but a physiological condition and there is no reason women with a normal pregnancy should not have their baby delivered at home by a community midwife or in a midwife-led unit.  Every pregnancy does not need to be dealt with by an obstetrician and this is the sort of issue the maternity review will consider.  <\/p><p>  Whether in the case of an obstetrician or a midwife, I put it to the Deputy that the HSE does not withdraw cover lightly or on a whim but for a reason.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000035#HH00400","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1412099700,"counter":422,"content":"<p>I just asked the Minister to look at the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000035#HH00500","speaker":"1192"},{"type":"speech","time":1412099700,"counter":423,"content":"<p>On the matters raised by Deputy Billy Kelleher, I inform him of changes that have been made since 2010 when the case occurred.  The national early warning score has been introduced to detect deteriorating cases; in the hospital in Sligo there is now a new structured hand-over meeting between medical staff when they move from one shift to another and there is an enhanced and updated admission and discharge policy for ICU.  With these changes, there are continuing developments in risk management, structures and processes.<\/p><p>  While I believe we need more obstetricians - 120 is not enough - according to the OECD's report, Health at a Glance 2013, we have more obstetricians and gynaecologists per head than in Canada and New Zealand.  The report also indicates that the ratio of Irish midwives stands above the OECD average and above that in France, Germany and the Netherlands.  People can be quite selective when they make comparisons.  They pick the countries with which they want to compare.  I am picking countries with which I want to compare.<\/p><p>  As somebody who has worked in eight hospitals, including a maternity hospital, I believe it is important to point out that being short staffed should never be an excuse for medical negligence or misadventure.  It takes 30 seconds for a laboratory scientist to ring a ward with a blood result about which there is concern.  It takes about one minute to check a blood result.  If one misdiagnoses an acute abdomen case, it has nothing to do with time or resources, but is a mistake.  We should not allow people to claim that being short staffed is an excuse for medical misadventure or negligence.  It should never be accepted as an excuse.  If we accept that excuse, it will always be the excuse.  Today I heard the suggestion that a patient's mouth was taped with surgical tape because a hospital was short staffed.

The Registration of Lobbying Bill is an integral part of this programme.  The key objective of the Bill is to introduce a register of lobbying to make information available to the public on the identity of those who are communicating with the Government and senior civil and public servants on public policy matters.  The exclusive purpose of lobbying by individuals or groups with different interests is to influence decisions taken at political and administrative level.  There is, therefore, a strong public interest in knowing &quot;who is lobbying whom about what&quot;.  The Bill is specifically designed to achieve this goal through the establishment of a web-based registration system of lobbying activity.<br\/><br\/>Vibrant communication and dialogue and close interaction and engagement between the Government and citizens are central to a well functioning democracy and vital to support informed and evidence-based decision making.  Interest groups, representative bodies, industry and civil society organisations, NGOs, charities and third party professional lobbyists all provide crucial input and feedback for the political and public administration systems through communication of the views and concerns of the public to legislators and the Government.  However, they also clearly seek to influence the policy and decision making process in order to align it with their own organisational or personal goals and objectives.  These goals and objectives may reflect a private, commercial or sectoral interest or be represented as a wider public interest or benefit.<br\/><br\/>The aim of the Bill is unequivocally not to restrict the flow of information, opinions, perspectives or proposals feeding into policy making or legislation but rather to bring about significantly greater transparency in that flow.  It is appropriate that this activity is open to public scrutiny as part of the desirable checks and balances which help to ensure any attempt to seek to exert undue or improper influence on the conduct of policy formulation and development, political decision making and preparation and implementation of legislation is discouraged.<br\/><br\/>The reports of the Mahon and Moriarty tribunals have highlighted, <i>inter alia<\/i>, the risk that the legitimacy of the political system could be eroded by the corrosive impact of secrecy and undue influence.  The regulation of lobbying is one of a suite of measures the Government is taking to address, through an extensive programme of political and governmental reform, the serious concerns that have emerged in this area in recent times.  The value of regulation of lobbying in fostering a culture of integrity is supported by the Organisation for Co-operation and Development, OECD, which states &quot;...a sound framework for transparency in lobbying is crucial to safeguard the public interest, promote a level playing field for business and avoid capture by vocal interest groups&quot;.  Since communication is the essence of policy making, the introduction of lobbying regulation cannot be allowed to obstruct the information channels to the political system and the public service.  The international experience of lobbying regulation reassures us that regulation has not given rise to such unintended harmful effects, nor is there evidence that it has made it more difficult to gain access to key decision makers.<br\/><br\/>It is clear that the introduction of lobbying regulation in Ireland represents a significant change to the existing political culture, replacing a relatively informal set of arrangements with, I hope and believe, a more structured and transparent system.  My Department's task was twofold: first, to formulate legislative proposals to meet the objective of registering lobbying activity in a transparent manner and, second, to address the cultural shift required to ensure successful implementation of regulation in this area.  From the outset, therefore, my Department sought to engage with as many stakeholders as possible in the change process and tailor the legislation, based on the feedback from that consultation process and best practice and experience overseas, so as to develop a user-friendly and not overly burdensome registration process which meets the transparency objective but minimises compliance costs in terms of both time and resources.<br\/><br\/>In December 2011 advertisements were placed in the national newspapers inviting submissions from interested parties on key issues relating to options for the design, structure and implementation of an effective regulatory system for lobbying.  The consultation process was based on the agreed OECD principles for transparency and integrity in lobbying which were the subject of a recommendation by the OECD council in February 2010.  The response to that consultation process was positive and approximately 60 organisations and individuals initially submitted views to my Department.  A number of these contributors were subsequently invited to meet officials of my Department to discuss specific issues contained in their submissions.  In addition, my Department undertook a review of international approaches to the regulation of lobbying.<br\/><br\/>Research was undertaken of lobbying regulation in a number of countries, including Canada, the USA, Australia and several European countries.  The regulations in place in the European Union institutions were also analysed, as were the proposals at the time for the introduction of a regulatory regime in the United Kingdom.  This work was advised and informed by the work of three international experts on lobbying regulation, Professor Gary Murphy of DCU, Professor Raj Chari of TCD and Dr. John Hogan of DIT, as well as comprehensive analysis and recommendations published by the OECD on lobbying regulation.  In preparing my proposals I had regard to five Private Members' Bills published on the topic of regulation of lobbying since 1999.  Four of these Bills were introduced by the Labour Party, including one by me, while one was introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il in opposition.  The Fine Gael draft lobbying Bill included in its &quot;New Politics&quot; document, published in 2010, was also reviewed as part of the comprehensive analysis of best ideas.<br\/><br\/>In July 2012 my Department published a policy paper entitled, Regulation of Lobbying Policy Proposals.  In overall terms, the paper examines what activities should be the subject of regulation through the introduction of a new register.  The paper was published to communicate to the public and all interested parties, including Departments and public bodies under their aegis, the main elements of my proposed policy approach to the development of legislation in this area.  The paper promoted the view that lobbying was inherent to the democratic process, in and of itself a good thing and played a very positive role in securing a more informed environment for policy making and the development of legislation.  I believe there is not a Member of this House, in his or her normal clinic activities, who is not lobbied either by individuals who because of their personal circumstances look for a change in the law or by local or national organisations.  <br\/><br\/>The paper sets out the policy rationale for the regulation of lobbying, as well as an overview of the proposed policy framework and recommended options for further consideration of key features of the legislation, including definitions, disclosure, exemptions, exclusions, the format of the lobbying register, the lobbying registrar, sanctions, a code of conduct, registration fees, a cooling-off period and a review of the legislation.<\/p><p>The publication of the policy paper was also intended to allow stakeholders to provide further views on the principal implementation issues arising from the proposed policy approach.<\/p><p> Following publication of the policy proposals, a public seminar on the regulation of lobbying in Ireland was hosted by my Department on 5 July 2012 with contributions from me and Ms Lynn Morrison, Integrity Commissioner of Ontario, who was the key speaker at the seminar.  This provided an opportunity to have a full and frank debate with a range of interested parties on the emerging issues from the consultation process to the options for improving the regulatory system proposed.  Following the public seminar, a further consultation phase on lobbying took place focusing on the issues raised at the seminar.  Approximately 30 further responses were received, including from several Departments and public bodies.  My proposals have been carefully framed to take account of the issues raised throughout this rather exhaustive consultation process which was important in bringing the Bill to its current stage.  Full details of the consultation process, including all of the submissions received and the reports of meetings which took place with stakeholders, are published on my Department's website.<\/p><p> I turn to the Bill before us and will briefly go through each Part outlining the content and purpose.  Sections 1, 3 and 4 deal with standard preliminary and general matters, including the Title of the Bill and provisions for commencement of the Bill.  Section 2 provides for a regular review of the operation, implementation and effectiveness of the legislation.  Deputies this this is necessary because we are not going to get it exactly right and we must learn from user experience as the process develops.  The first review will be held no later than one year after the commencement day of the Bill.  Each subsequent review should be held every five years thereafter.  I am interested in hearing Members' views on whether that is too long or short a time line and I have an open mind on the matter.  Reports on the findings and recommendations of each review will be presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas within six months of the end of the relevant period.<\/p><p> Section 5 provides the definition of &quot;lobbying&quot;.  It establishes that lobbying activity is carried out by persons in the course of their business in return for payment by a client - obvious paid lobbyists; an employer or his or her employee on behalf of the employer; any person on matters of planning or rezoning of land.  It defines the communications which constitute lobbying and those that are excluded.  It also determines that normal citizen interaction with public representatives in a private and non-commercial capacity or communications by employers with ten employees or fewer acting on behalf of that employer will not be included in the register unless the communication is in respect of land rezoning or development.  Planning matters relating to an individual's private residence will also be exempt.<\/p><p> This section also sets out other exemptions from the regulatory requirements set out in the Bill.  Such exemptions include those relating to international relations, factual information sought by a public body or other information sought and published by a public body and matters posing a threat to the safety of persons or the security of the State.  It also exempts communications between public officials acting in an official capacity.  Communications between members of a group established by a Minister or a public body and including persons from outside the public service are also exempt, subject to a requirement to comply with a transparency code.<\/p><p> Section 6 sets out the meaning of &quot;designated public official&quot;.  This term includes Ministers, Ministers of State, special advisers, Deputies, Senators, members of local authorities and Irish MEPs.  I intend that, on commencement, the Bill will apply to communications with officials at Secretary General and assistant secretary level in the Civil Service and equivalent levels in local authorities.  It is my intention to extend the Bill on a phased basis and prescribe further grades within the Civil Service and other areas of the public service as designated public officials in the light of experience with implementation.  Again, I am interested in hearing the views of Members opposite in that regard.  The Bill requires public bodies to maintain a list of designated officials with up-to-date details on their websites.  <\/p><p> Section 7 defines certain terms used in the Bill.  <\/p><p> Part 2 of the Bill contains sections 8 to 15, inclusive, and details how the system of registration of lobbying communications will operate.  Section 8 provides that a lobbyist must be registered before carrying on lobbying activities, unless it is that person's first time to lobby.  In that case, the registration and the return must be completed before the next return date.  <\/p><p> Section 9 provides that the commission will establish a register of lobbyists.  The Standards in Public Office Commission will be the registrar.  <\/p><p> Section 10 provides that the information to be supplied when registering or in a return will be available on the register.  It provides for the commission to decide not to publish certain personal information in order to prevent misuse or to protect the person's right to privacy, for example, private email addresses.  It also sets out the role of the commission should it deem that information given is inaccurate, out of date or misleading.<\/p><p> Section 11 provides for the registration details to be included in the register and confirmation that the details entered on the register are correct.  It also allows for registrants to have their registration marked as ceased.  <\/p><p> Section 12 provides for returns to be filed.  It requires three returns per year.  Anyone engaged in lobbying, in accordance with the definitions used in the Bill, must file a return for each of the mandatory return dates.  It allows for a nil return to be submitted also.  <\/p><p> Section 13 provides that the commission may require clarification or further information which must be returned within 21 days of the date of the notice.  Where a reply is not received within 21 days, the inaccurate registration or return will be removed from the register for non-compliance and a notice of the removal will be issued.  The registration or return will be considered as not having been made.  In certain circumstances the commission may also immediately remove the information from the register.<\/p><p> Section 14 provides for delayed publication where the registrant believes the registration or the return relating to the lobbying activity would be expected to have a serious adverse effect on the financial interests of the State, the national economy or business interests generally or the business interests of any description of persons or it establishes that the commission on receipt of the application will consult the relevant Ministers, where appropriate, before a decision is made on such matters.  Delayed publication may also be sought where immediate publication would be expected to cause a material financial loss to the person to whom the information relates or prejudice seriously the competitive position of that person in the conduct of the person's occupation, profession or business or the outcome of any contractual or other negotiations being conducted by that person.  In both cases, the commission would be required to consider whether the public interest would, on balance, be better served by refusing to grant than by granting the application.  The commission may also decide to publish summary information only.  All of this is an empowering provision to be exercised at the complete discretion of the registrar.  <\/p><p> Section 15 is a technical provision and establishes that any document which the commission certified as a copy of an entry on the register is deemed to be a true copy.  This is just normal legal cover.  <\/p><p> Part 3 of the Bill contains sections 16 and 17 and deals with the code of conduct for lobbyists and guidance to be provided by the commission.  Section 16 allows for a statutory code of conduct to be created for lobbyists by the commission.  In developing a code the commission must consult interested organisations or individuals.<\/p><p> Section 17 allows the commission to issue guidance, particularly with a view to promoting understanding of the Bill.  This is a new provision and from all the discussions I have had with interested groups, I know that there is concern and fear about how it will impact on normal organisations such as the IFA and trade unions in carrying out their normal affairs.  It will take a bedding-in process to explain it in some detail.<\/p><p> Part 4 contains sections 18 to 21, inclusive, and deals with enforcement matters.  Section 18 defines the contraventions relevant to the Bill.  Section 19 provides the commission with the power to authorise an investigation to be carried out.  The commission can appoint authorised officers to carry out an investigation on its behalf.  While conducting an investigation, an authorised officer can request any information or copies of documentation deemed appropriate to the investigation and has the power to enter the premises to seek copies of documents, subject to the consent of the occupier or pursuant to a warrant.  Any information in the authorised officer's possession will remain confidential, unless the Bill requires it to be public.<\/p><p> Section 20 provides for prosecution for serious offences under the Bill and the imposition of penalties for these offences.  Section 21 establishes that the commission may serve fixed payment notices where an offence has been committed under section 20(1) in regard to the late filing of returns.  A fixed payment notice will state the amount, namely, &euro;200, and the payment method and date.  Where payment is made within the timeframe, court proceedings will not be initiated.<\/p><p> Part 5 contains sections 22 to 26, inclusive, and covers miscellaneous and supplementary issues.  Section 22 provides for certain designated public officials, notably Ministers, Ministers of State, special advisers and, on commencement of the Bill, Secretaries General and assistant secretaries in the Civil Service and equivalent grades in local authorities, to apply to the commission for approval to carry out lobbying activities in an area that might cause a conflict of interest as a result of their former roles in public employment within one year of ceasing to be designated public officials.  The model proposed focuses on the particular activities likely to present a conflict of interest, rather than imposing a blanket ban on the take-up of employment.  This approach allows the commission to permit, for example, the take-up of employment but to impose conditions or refuse to give consent.  This will be an issue we can discuss in some detail.  We have to strike a balance between not debarring people from exercising their constitutional right to work, while at the same time ensuring there is no improper use of information gleaned or garnered while holding a public position when one has moved out of that position.  <\/p><p> Section 23 provides for appeals of decisions made by the commission.  It establishes that the Minister can appoint a panel of independent appeals officers.  Appeals may be made in regard to decisions made under section 10(5) relating to inaccurate or misleading information, under section 14 relating to delayed publication or under section 22 relating to post-term employment applications.  <\/p><p> Section 24 establishes that a decision of the appeals officer may be appealed to the High Court on a point of law.  This appeal must be brought within 21 days of the notice of the decision.  The decision of the High Court is final.  <\/p><p> Section 25 provides for an annual report to be compiled by the commission.  It sets out the type of information to be reported on and provides for the report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas within six months of the end of the relevant period.<\/p><p> Section 26 makes amendments to the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 to provide, as appropriate, for changes to the functions of the commission regarding its new role as lobbying registrar.  The consultation process has demonstrated the complexity of the issues involved and the required culture change arising in the introduction of regulation in this area for the first time.  I assure the House that the correct balance will be achieved between the need for maximum transparency in public policy making and the need to avoid unnecessary administrative burdens on those sectors which interact, as a matter of course and routine and as is proper and appropriate, with government.  The Bill, therefore, proposes reviewing the legislation 12 months after its commencement in the light of our experience with its implementation.<\/p><p> I would welcome the views of Members now and in more detail when we get into the meat of the Bill on Committee Stage on any additional provision which they believe would strengthen the Bill or help to ensure it meets its core objective of casting greater light on public policy making.  I will genuinely approach our discussions with an open mind.  I anticipate that I will have a number of technical amendments to bring forward on Committee Stage.  In addition, I intend to propose an amendment to section 5 which will have the effect of ensuring relevant communication by representative bodies and bodies established to further particular issues will come within the definition of lobbying, regardless of the number of employees in the bodies.  The amendment will not change the broad policy approach adopted in section 5.<\/p><p> The intention is that the Bill will be enacted during this session.  I hope it can be passed safely by both Houses in that timeline.  A period of time will then be required prior to commencement of the legislation to enable the development of the IT and information systems which will support the registration process.  My Department is working closely with the Standards in Public Office Commission on these issues.  We are also discussing resource issues.  It is intended to establish an advisory group shortly, comprising relevant experts and key stakeholders who will be in a position to provide information and guidance to assist in the smooth implementation of the Bill once enacted.  Of course, the timeframe for the regulatory provisions of the Bill to be brought into operation will depend, in the first instance, on the time it takes for both Houses to pass the Bill.   All going according to plan, however, I anticipate commencement of the Bill by the summer of 2015.<\/p><p> I will be happy to expand on any of the provisions included in the Bill during the course of the debate, if Deputies wish to raise particular issues, if there are new proposals or anybody has examined international best practice and can add to the Bill.  I will approach the debate with an open mind.  I look forward to hearing the contributions of Deputies and hope the House will support the passage of the Bill, secure its speedy passage on Second Stage, have a detailed debate on Committee Stage to meet the timeline I have set out for having the Bill as the law of the land, with all support necessary through the Standards in Public Office Commission, by the middle of next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000036#JJ00550","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412101500,"counter":435,"content":"<p>We are discussing the Registration of Lobbying Bill 2014, the timing of which is most relevant and interesting.  Before I debate the specifics of this important legislation, we need to examine the background.  Essentially, the citizens of Ireland want to know who has the inside track.  Many believe a small group of people have the inside track and can get their point of view across and have it accepted by the Government or other public bodies, as the case may be, and that the majority are excluded from this track. <\/p><p>  When I read the Bill, I asked myself a simple question: would the Bill, if enacted in its current form, show who had lobbied the Taoiseach on the appointment to the board of the Irish Museum of Modern Art?  If the Bill leads to that question being anwered, it is a good one.  That will be the acid test.  I would like to know where in the Bill these issues are addressed.  <\/p><p>  The Minister has had to rush and brought a memo to the Cabinet today on appointments to public bodies.  That is all well and good and cuts across the area of who lobbies Ministers and Taoisigh on board appointments.  However, the issue of board appointments is not discrete; it has a wider impact across other issues.  We are here to discuss the issue of lobbying the Government, Ministers and those in decision making capacities.  The Minister may be able to explain at the end of the Second Stage debate or on Committee Stage where in the Bill we can find a clear answer to the question as to which section refers to the lobbying of the Taoiseach or a Minister on an appointment to a State board.<\/p><p>I refer to that issue because it is a current example of what is going on and it is not just the Taoiseach but the Minister of the Taoiseach's own party.  The Taoiseach was forced to admit today that the Minister had been given CVs by officials of her own party.  <\/p><p> This leads to another important distinction which we might have to include in the legislation.  I refer to the Jesuitical distinction the Taoiseach made a couple of hours ago in the Chamber when he distinguished between his role as Taoiseach and his role as leader of the Fine Gael Party.  It was as if to say, &quot;They are two separate issues.&quot;  Technically, they are, but he is the one person.  It is not good enough to say that when he was looking at the CVs of the various people nominated in Fine Gael for their suitability for the Seanad, he interviewed the particular man in question in his capacity as leader of Fine Gael.  Yes, he has that role, but when the role as a leader of a political party impacts on public bodies, the distinction is no longer valid.<\/p><p> I do not mind if the Taoiseach is out canvassing in Tallaght tonight and dealing with issues as leader of Fine Gael from a Fine Gael perspective.  He may be asked about issues relating to Government policy, but he cannot take decisions as leader of Fine Gael that affect Government actions.  There must be a distinction.  The distinction the Taoiseach drew this afternoon is capable of driving a coach and four through this legislation.  It will allow him to say, &quot;In my capacity as Taoiseach, I never met that person.&quot;  The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht can say, &quot;I never met that person.&quot;  The Minister for Finance can say, &quot;In my capacity as Minister for Finance, neither I nor my officials met that person.  It so happens as a member of Fine Gael, I met him.&quot;  The same applies to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform as a member of the Labour Party.  There is a lacuna that must be closed in some way because the public will not accept that loophole in the legislation when passed.  I accept that the roles are distinct, but where they collide, there must be legislation to cover the registration of lobbying.  The legislation will mean nothing to the public if we can have a repeat of what happened in the last fortnight in six or 12 months time.  The issue must be addressed and the gap must be closed.<\/p><p> Only a few short hours ago going into the Cabinet meeting, the Minister opposite, Deputy Brendan Howlin, was recorded as saying he would vote for Mr. John McNulty.  He said he had a problem in getting legislation through the Seanad and that it was important that he vote as a Government member for Mr. McNulty to assist in getting legislation through in the next 18 months.  Does the Minister stand by this?  Mr. McNulty who has shown a degree of integrity we did not see from the Taoiseach or the Minister does not have a legal mechanism to take his name off the ballot paper.  There could be a case for cancelling the election if people were serious about it.  Perhaps, it cannot happen in a democracy once an election is taking place.  I remember that during the local elections a Fine Gael councillor, unfortunately, died the day before or on the morning of polling and the election was held over for three weeks.  There must be some exceptional provision to allow an election to be held over.<\/p><p> It will make a mockery of integrity and honesty if members of the Government parties go ahead and vote Mr. McNulty into the Seanad on 10 October, the weekend before the budget.  He has said, &quot;Do not vote for me,&quot; but the Minister has said he is voting for him.  The Minister might clarify whether he will comply with Mr. McNulty's request.  It will make a joke of every member of the Government if they continue to say they still think Mr. McNulty is the most suitable person on the ballot paper and that they have no option but to vote for him.  If he takes his seat in the Seanad, it will make a mockery of the whole process, which brings me back to my first question.  Who lobbied the Taoiseach and will the legislation cover that scenario?  It is a very important question.  I never like to get personal, but there is some family connection to canvassers of the person involved or something like that.  The legislation excludes social contacts.  There is significant scope to get around the legsislation, which is my difficulty.<\/p><p> Fianna F&aacute;il produced a Bill in January 2012, as the Minister did previously.  It has been around a while and there is no getting away from it.  Our problem with the timing of the legislation - I have a problem with the content also, but we will talk about how it can be improved - is that it was promised in the programme for Government in 2011.  We gave the Government 12 months and in early 2012 published our own Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000038#LL00400","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412102100,"counter":437,"content":"<p>Having voted mine down twice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000039#MM00200","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1412102100,"counter":438,"content":"<p>That is right, but Fine Gael and the Labour Party were the one that were going to have a democratic and political revolution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000039#MM00300","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1412102100,"counter":439,"content":"<p>We did and it is there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000039#MM00400","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1412102100,"counter":440,"content":"<p>To test the promise made, we brought forward the legislation which, it goes without saying, the Minister has not taken up.  We brought the Bill forward because at that stage the Government was talking about the sale of State assets.  It has since privatised the national lottery licence and parts of Bord G&aacute;is and its customer base and meters, which has a resonance for the other subsidiary of Bord G&aacute;is in relation to Irish Water.  There is nothing except a Government majority preventing that from happening at a later date.  The Government has set up NewERA and Irish Water and none of us knows who lobbied who during these processes.  That is why we wanted the legislation to be brought forward before all that was done.  The financial decision on setting up Irish Water will be one of the larger ones the Government will have taken in terms of new legislation, new State bodies and the sale of various State assets, as I have mentioned, yet all of that was neatly got out of the way before this legislation came to pass.<\/p><p>  What most concerns me about the legislation is the mammoth number of omissions.  The first thing that needs to be included in the legislation is consultants employed to carry out work on behalf of public bodies.  I go back to the national lottery licence.  The Minister rightly pointed out that he was not involved and that consultants were employed to deal with it.  He was hands off.  Believe it or not, consultants are human too, although some people might not think so.  People could have lobbied these consultants on the sale of State assets.  They might lobby any consultant brought in to modernise any Department or State body.  Unless the consultants who are being paid by the public body are brought under this legislation, it will be woefully inadequate.  There must be a mechanism for to do this.  The Government can outsource a decision to a consultancy firm and people can lobby the consultants.  The result can be the one desired by the lobbyists and the Government can state, &quot;But nobody lobbied us.&quot;  That is not good enough and we must deal with the issue.<\/p><p>  We must also consider, as the Minister suggests in the last paragraph of his speech, the provision regarding employers with fewer than ten employees.  I come at this from a couple of points of view and most of what I say will work its way into amendments which the Minister will receive.  We will go back over my script and the Minister's officials will have time to consider from where I am coming.  The ten employee provision appears, on the face of it, to be fine to avoid tormenting small companies in trying to lobby for something simple.  However, many businesses are run through shelf companies.  Some of the largest construction contracts handed out through public procurement processes go to developers with few or no employees.  We are tired of talking about main contractors who pass jobs on to subcontractors who pass them on again.  The main contractor for the job may be a shelf company taken on for a specific project worth tens of millions of euro.  While the intention in the ten employee provision is good, we must capture more people than that number.  Many of the largest companies in the country have shelf companies within their organisational structures.  One could have a holding company in which all decisions are made and which has no employees.  It may just be a chairman, the secretary and a board with no staff.  We must have a mechanism to catch all of these.   <\/p><p>  The Minister referred to the issue of the representative bodies.  How many times have I been lobbied by RECI or electrical or security contractors with only two or three employees?  However, they are big organisations when they get going.  One might have to consider turnover, as well as issues such as representative bodies in terms of the group of which a company is part.  I acknowledge that this is getting complicated, whether it be &euro;5 million or &euro;10 million, but if there are companies in the market for large contracts, there must be a mechanism to capture them.  The requirement in respect of having ten employees is too narrow when it comes to business transactions.  An example would be companies liable to be audited.  They must have a certain turnover and be of a certain size.  I am not saying the exact figure that should apply, but that size is closer to the scale of a company about which Revenue will want to know.  I am trying to be helpful by making some suggestions other than about the employees, but I understand the Minister's position.<\/p><p> The Minister might clarify where all this legislation will fit in under the freedom of information legislation.  I presume the Standards in Public Office, SIPO, is subject to the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act but there are references in the report to the effect that it can issue summaries of reports etc.  There is no point in inserting that in the legislation if the full report is capable of being got under FOI-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000039#MM00500","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412102700,"counter":442,"content":"<p>It will be a matter for SIPO.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000040#NN00200","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1412102700,"counter":443,"content":"<p>It is not a bone of contention but we might clarify that.<\/p><p>  I have an open mind on one of the contentious issues in this legislation.  I do not have a fixed view, although some people have fixed views on this issue.  The Minister nailed his colours to the mast in the programme for Government about the two year cooling off period.  The legislation refers to one year.  I know some people believe strongly the period should be two or three years, or that the person should never work in the area again.  Some people will always go to the extreme and if the Minister is introducing such measures for somebody who leaves a public body, the issue of compensating that person who cannot work again in an area in which they have expertise must be examined.  The popular view is that the period should be two years, the longer the better, that we are all pariahs and we should not have interaction between the public and private sectors.  I take the opposite view.  Part of what is wrong with Ireland is that there is an undue suspicion between the public and the private sectors.  The more regulated interaction, the better.  More interaction is better for both the public and the private sector but I accept that we must regulate it.  I am not just sure whether the legislation should provide for a period of one or two years.<\/p><p>  I will give an example, and the Minister might respond that it is good for the company involved.  A senior official in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine who was excellent in terms of the dairy or the beef industry retires at whatever age he is entitled to retire.  It could be beneficial for the country for that person to be employed by one of our major international co-operatives to help our food exports.  Some might say he should go home and watch DVDs or play golf for two years and that he should not be allowed take up a position that could help the industry, employment and exports.  I believe we must reconcile that issue.  I may be going a little too far but I can see a situation where a retired public servant, and we are talking about different grades of people, through the talents and knowledge he or she has built up, being used in the international sphere for the good of the country, and he would be getting paid for it - there is no argument about that.  I would be concerned that we would take the simple line that he could not do that.  It is complicated, and conflict of interest issues arise, but it is an issue we have to tease out.  I do not subscribe to the strict demarcation line between the public and the private sectors.  Exchange of staff between the public and private sectors can be good for all concerned.  The question I have to ask is who lobbied for that change since the programme for Government was agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000040#NN00300","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1412102700,"counter":444,"content":"<p>It was part of all the dialogue and part of the communications, and all that is on the website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000040#NN00400","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1412102700,"counter":445,"content":"<p>That is fine, but I have an open mind on the issue.

Eirgrid should come under it because it has a massive impact on people's lives.  A director of Sustainable Energy Ireland is a director of one of the companies promoting the big wind farm projects - I refer to Brendan Halligan, a former colleague of the Minister.  That has come up time and again, and I have heard the Minister's Oireachtas colleagues criticising that apparent conflict of interest between a person who is a director of Sustainable Energy Ireland and also a director of one of the companies promoting the wind farms.  Eirgrid and such organisations that deal with this area should be included.<\/p><p>  In terms of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, a definition of what is and is not covered should be included.  I refer also to the Irish Aviation Authority, which I accept is a niche area.  I came to mention the Minister's colleague in Clare who was put onto that board.  We have had a good bit of that discussion in the past few days.  I mention the Private Security Authority and Tourism Ireland also.  Many hotel groups, bed and breakfast establishments and a wide variety of people in the tourism industry want to lobby Tourism Ireland for funding and projects that will be beneficial to them.  Such people have a very big impact.  Waterways Ireland is another one.<\/p><p>  I read in one of the briefing notes here in the Oireachtas that what is excluded is the implementation of public policy.  I know it must stop somewhere.  The Minister said that some of the companies I mentioned did not make public policy but those that implement public policy, such as the organisations I mentioned including Tourism Ireland or Eirgrid, must be covered under this legislation.  There is a gap in that regard.  Sometimes those organisations can have far more practical power and influence in terms of people's daily lives and the direction in which the country is going than the officials in the Department who drafted the legislation that set them up.<\/p><p>  Principal officers and assistant principal officers have to be included in the legislation.

I was never a Minister.  I do not know how strong a private secretary can be but I am sure some private secretaries can get their Minister to meet an individual if they believe it would be worthwhile to his or her Department.  There is a case to be made in that regard.<\/p><p>  I refer to all the people who are lobbyists but who do not have to list their social contacts.  The Minister excluded the Frank Flannerys of this world from the legislation.  I come back to my opening sentence about the inside track.  The people want to be assured there is not an inside track for the 1% of people concerned as opposed to the other 99%.  He had an inside track.  I will not demonise the man but the case was publicised.  I mention him because the Minister's former ministerial colleague, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, said about him earlier this year that he was always around the corridors and that he could lobby in a non-lobby kind of way.  He would chat to one and tell one what he wanted done.  He would say he was not there to lobby one but one would get the point he was making.  The former Minister said Frank Flannery was capable of lobbying in a non-lobbying kind of way.  It is a lovely phrase.  It is probably an Irish way of putting it but everyone understood that.  It might not be the Queen's English but Irish people understood what that meant.  We have to deal with that.<\/p><p>  In a way, because of what is omitted, the legislation is a bit of a fig leaf because it is narrow.  I have listed the areas I want included, and the people will see that.  They want high standards and ethics in politics.  I have been canvassing in the by-election in recent days and people are shocked.  They thought we had a change in Irish society but they said that when it comes to this issue this crowd are worse than us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000040#NN01500","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1412102700,"counter":456,"content":"<p>That is a damning indictment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000040#NN01600","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1412102700,"counter":457,"content":"<p>I never thought we were that bad but the Minister gets the point I am making.

We need a proper and full registration of lobbying Bill, not what is before the House.  A great deal needs to be included in this legislation and if the Minister accepts our amendments, we will have good legislation that will be fit for purpose.<\/p><p>  I seek clarification on a number of points.<\/p><p>If there is lobbying on broader issues then this should be included.  The Minister might clarify where the other social partners fit in.  He made a reference to the IFA, IBEC, charities, voluntary groups, sporting organisations and organisations helping the homeless.  Groups are set up around the country and might have to hire a legal person if they are opposing a wind farm or organising a campaign to save the local post office.

Some of the organisations, like the IFA or the GAA, have many paid officials.  More often than not we meet the local voluntary chairman who is here on behalf of the person who sent him with a very good briefing note.  The latter was from an organisation with more than ten people.  That can happen in sporting organisations.  I have covered various aspects of the Bill.<\/p><p>  I refer to some of the specifics.  I am dealing with section 5(k).  I have an issue in respect of communication between public servants.  The story goes that Ryanair wanted to put an airport at Baldonnel and the civil servants who would be living under the flight path on the south side of city conspired and decided it was not a good idea.  Public servants dealing with organisations other than their own should be brought into this.  The organisation has a function in its own right and these matters may not always be in the public interest.  I refer to commercial bodies, semi-State bodies and some of the regulators I mentioned.<\/p><p>  The Minister has omitted the regulators from this legislation.  The energy regulator, the National Transport Authority, the health insurance regulator and perhaps the Financial Regulator must be brought in under the legislation.  They are key people in implementing Government policy.  Section 5(l) refers to semi-State companies .  It is okay if they are dealing with the Minister in the ordinary course of business, such as day-to-day activity or monthly or annual reporting.  When there is a bigger issue to be dealt with, they should not be exempt from the legislation.<\/p><p>  Section 5(7)(c) refers to relevant matters and the authorisation involving public funds.  Is it voted funds?  The matter has been raised in this House before.  Are moneys that go to section 38 or section 39 organisations public funds?  It has come out of the public purse and has passed onto a private body.  Some of the organisations are mammoth and have a major influence on the delivery of key health services.  We must tease out this matter.<\/p><p>  Section 14 deals with delayed publication.  I can understand that there might be a reason for it but an annual report should refer to where items are subject to delayed publications.  Details do not need to be given but people should know whether there are matters of concern.  Local authorities must be addressed.  The Minister has included local authority members for planning and zoning issues.<\/p><p>  What underlines this legislation is that people must be paid to do the lobbying.  There is crossover between people in a company and volunteers working for the same company who are a front for the same organisation but are not being paid.  That must be addressed.<\/p><p>  I refer to factual information that has been requested.  Statistics are factual information but in every organisation there are lies, damn lies and statistics.  The same factual information can be presented in different ways depending on the point of view one is trying to get across.  We must specify what factual information means because it normally means that people draw conclusions when looking at a graph.<\/p><p>  With regard to grassroots lobbying, the Minister mentioned that the key aspect is the reference to managing or directing the making of relevant communications.  A paid organisation can be directing the relevant communications even if the people involved are not doing it themselves.  This deals with representative groups and associations.<\/p><p>  With regard to the regulatory impact statement, I noted that we made provision in the Estimate of &euro;350,000 for SIPO to get ahead with this.  The Minister might tell us where we are now in that regard because the legislation will not be enacted before Christmas.  Will that need to come back to the Department and be given to SIPO in next year's Estimate?<\/p><p>  The principle of the legislation is welcome but my main concern is the level of admissions.  Much of what is in there, in respect of the role of trade unions and investigations, is good.  People cannot just walk in with a warrant from a District Court.<\/p><p>  I will not deal with what I have not referred to because those elements are okay.  They are necessary and I have no argument with the drafting.  Fianna F&aacute;il will table a number of amendments to broaden the scope of the legislation rather than its detail.  I look forward to discussing it in detail on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000041#OO00300","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1412103300,"counter":461,"content":"<p>I welcome the introduction of the legislation, which has been a long time coming.  The legislation comes on the back of decades of political corruption and cronyism.  Members in the D&aacute;il and beyond are familiar with the corruption scandals of the 1990s to 2000s that exposed corrupt practices.  In summary, the legislation is designed to rebuild trust in the political system.  It is welcome and necessary.  It is unfortunate that, at a time when we discuss this landmark legislation, it is against a backdrop of some of the most outrageous displays of stroke politics.  As recently as today in the D&aacute;il Chamber, we heard the Taoiseach give an incoherent and garbled account of communication and decision-making between his political party, his decisions as leader of Fine Gael, and his communication with a fellow member of Cabinet, Deputy Heather Humphreys.  The Taoiseach has acknowledged responsibility for some wrongdoing but he has, as yet, fallen short of identifying the sequence of events and what he is apologising for.  In discussing the legislation, it is not a platform for us to focus on the issue but it is important that in dealing with legislation such as this, we understand the depth of the malaise and the lack of public confidence in individual politicians or political parties but also in the political process and system.  It is a serious state of affairs and we must be sure the legislation goes substantially along the way to address some of the issues.<\/p><p>  I am glad there is a review provision after 12 months.  I am concerned about the five-year period thereafter.  It is rather long and perhaps we will revisit this aspect on Committee Stage.  I may suggest a three-year period but we can debate the matter.  I share the concerns raised in respect of designated persons.  There is a difference between an outside organisation or group lobbying a public official and the internal communications of public officials.<\/p><p>I accept that these are qualitatively different things.  None the less, if this legislation fails to capture the lobbying that does happen between public officials of one sort or another, be they of high rank in the Civil Service or at ministerial rank, we leave a very big and gaping hole in the legislation.  The events of the past week or more involving the Taoiseach's interaction with the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, on the matter of the appointment to the board of IMMA clearly reflect the need for transparency and for a light to be shone on those interactions.  I do not propose that this would intrude on matters of Cabinet confidentiality but the Minister must consider and have an open mind on Committee Stage.  I do not believe that the Minister, no more than I, wishes to see, much less preside over, a situation where lobbying can occur in that manner and can have such a negative consequence in terms of public confidence and public perception.<\/p><p> I am interested to see the meaning of this transparency code referred to in section 5 and what it might look like.  I know it is not proposed to incorporate the transparency code within the primary legislation but I suggest that we could have a very useful and, I hope, fruitful conversation on Committee Stage on that concept and what form and shape it might take.<\/p><p> This time of the year is very busy for lobbyists.  The budget will be announced in a fortnight and Oireachtas Members have spent a lot of time in recent weeks attending briefings on the budget and considering budgetary submissions from various organisations, companies and charities.  Given the very great and often crippling effect that budgetary decisions can have on individuals and families, it is very important that all interest groups have equal access to policy-makers.  We need to redress the imbalance between those organisations that have the resources to fund slick public relations campaigns and those that do not enjoy such a level of resources.  We must ensure, inasmuch as is possible, that equal access is afforded to groups that are broadly representative of society and not just of large commercial interests.  We must make space for and acknowledge smaller community group lobbies and charities.<\/p><p> The Minister referred to the consultation process.  I welcome that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform undertook this process with interested parties as part of the drafting process.  It was very important that we had access to a range of opinion and expertise on the subjects of lobbying and advocacy.  I acknowledge the work carried out within this process by organisations, individuals and community groups who took part in that consultation process and by the Department and its officials.  It is disappointing that we have had to wait so long for the Bill to reach Second Stage.  It perhaps reflects that this matter was low on the list of priorities for political reform for the Fine Gael and Labour Government.<\/p><p> The Minister will recall that Fine Gael promised to implement sweeping political reform under the now fabled banner of the democratic revolution.  This week has shown us that it is business as usual in so far as stroke politics and jobs for the boys are concerned.  It is sobering to see how little has changed since the arrival of the new Government and the scant regard that Fine Gael and, it seems, the Labour Party, have in real terms for the project of political reform.  No matter how many political scandals are exposed and investigated in this State, lessons are not learned and the cycle continues.  On a note of optimism, the debate, consideration and passage of this legislation, as amended, will mark something of a sea change in that attitude within what I will call the political class.<\/p><p> The intention of regulating lobbyists is to level the playing field in order that all stakeholders have equal access to decision-makers in matters of policy-making or in the drafting of legislation.  The worst outcome for this legislation would be that groups would be excluded from its remit.  It is important that regulation does not present any barriers to small groups or to citizens accessing representatives or policy-makers.<\/p><p> I draw the Minister's attention to section 5 and the fact registered charities are not mentioned.  The Minister will be aware that charities are entitled to tax exemption if registered with the Revenue Commissioners.  Under Revenue guidelines, an organisation that engages in lobbying cannot be registered as a charity.  I hope that at the more interactive forum of Committee Stage we can tease out this matter and have a discussion about lobbying and advocacy and the role of charity groups and protections for such groups within that system.  We cannot leave a situation where charities engaging in advocacy might lose their status as registered charities due to any lack of clarity in the Bill.<\/p><p> I am pleased to note that the register proposed is to be made available online, public and free of charge.  This is the correct course of action.  I am also pleased that a range of information to do with various types of lobbying will also be available in the online register.  It is very important that the most comprehensive information possible is available to the public.  This might entail amendments to the Freedom of Information Act if meetings and other activities which are currently available for public scrutiny are to be included in the register.  We will need a discussion on and some clarification of this part of the legislation.<\/p><p> I am pleased to note specific protection for normal citizens in their interactions with public representatives in the matters of their private affairs has been included in the list of exemptions.  There are a few questionable inclusions in this section.  While I appreciate the positive sentiments behind the exclusion of communications by employers with ten or fewer employees, it might be prudent to redefine this subsection to include the annual turnover of companies.  The Minister might be open to a discussion and an amendment along these lines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000041#OO00400","speaker":"1008","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1412103900,"counter":463,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Direct Provision for Asylum Seekers: Motion [Private Members]","time":1412104500,"counter":464,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000043#QQ00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1412104500,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I move:<blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:notes:<blockquote>&mdash; 2014 marks the 14th year of the existence of the Direct Provision system in Ireland;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; over 4,300 asylum seekers are currently residing in the 34 Direct Provision centres in the State, some of whom have been living in these centres for up to and above 10 years; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that more than one third of these residents are children who have spent a great deal of their lives, or their entire lives in these centres, which is having a negative impact on their safety and development;<\/blockquote>acknowledges:<blockquote>&mdash; that the Direct Provision system is an ineffective and costly system that is not fit for purpose;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; concerns raised by the United Nations Human Rights Committee regarding the &lsquo;prolonged accommodation of asylum seekers in Direct Provision centres which is not conducive to family life&rsquo;;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; concerns raised by the Special Rapporteur on Child Protection in relation to the detrimental effect of Direct Provision accommodation on children and on parents&rsquo; ability to provide adequate care;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the social injustice of denying children residing in Direct Provision centres the opportunity to progress to third-level education;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that the personal allowances of &euro;19.10 per adult and &euro;9.60 per child per week are wholly inadequate to address the cost of living;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that the proposed Protection Bill providing for a single application procedure for the investigation of all grounds for protection, in itself, will not benefit those who have already begun the process of applying for asylum in Ireland; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Minister for Justice and Equality&rsquo;s pending establishment of a Direct Provision working group to improve the current system is unnecessary considering the plethora of information available for the Government to act now and provide an alternative system; and<\/blockquote>calls on the Government to:<blockquote>&mdash; abolish the Direct Provision system and introduce a legislative framework for specialised reception centres operating as &lsquo;one-stop-shops&rsquo; for newly arrived protection applicants, providing access to the necessary services for the identification and assessment of needs;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; provide appropriate self-catering accommodation which respects family life in a system that embodies the best interests of the child, as well as identifying and properly supporting individuals with special needs and vulnerabilities;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; ensure the availability of early legal advice and independent complaints and inspection mechanisms;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; provide for the transfer to independent living within six months if a decision on a person&rsquo;s status has not been reached by then;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; lift the prohibition on employment to allow residents of Direct Provision centres to work within six months if a decision on a person&rsquo;s status has not been reached by then, to enable them to be actively participative in society, giving them a sense of worth and purpose in their daily lives which is a basic need of every human being;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; introduce a strategy for implementation of the new system with a clearly defined timeframe to adapt to a reformed system of accommodation for asylum seekers; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; introduce a mechanism that allows asylum seekers that have already begun the process of applying for asylum in Ireland, and who are therefore unable to avail of the single procedure, to be fast-tracked to ensure no further unnecessary delays ensue.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote>I am sharing time with Deputies Finian McGrath, Seamus Healy, Ruth Coppinger and Catherine Murphy.  I will be using 15 of the allotted 40 minutes and the remainder will be shared equally among the other three Deputies.<br\/><br\/>&quot;Imagine if we saw the potential of refugees not the imagined risk.  The opportunity not the fabricated crisis.  Compassion not fear.  Imagine.&quot;  This is a quote from the founder and CEO of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre in Australia.  It is an observation with which it is important to begin this debate and for everyone to keep in mind in the context of the motion before the House.<br\/><br\/>The number of refugees, asylum-seekers and internally displaced people worldwide has for the first time in the post-Second World War era exceeded 50 million, which truly is astonishing.  When I see this figure it brings to mind the 4,300 plus asylum seekers - over one third of whom are children - in Ireland who are living, if one can call it that, in inhuman conditions not fit for the 21st century in the 34 direct provision accommodation centres throughout the country.  This system must end.  For 14 years people from these centres have come to me desperate for assistance.  At this stage, some of them have been living in direct provision for over ten years.  I know from their experience, and from mine in representing them, that these centres are not fit for purpose and they effectively operate as open prisons.  In particular, I am concerned about the protection of children in these centres.  Many of the children in question were born into this system and know no better life.<br\/><br\/>While there has been much talk recently on reforming the system, the Government has done little in respect of the matter.  The direct provision working group which is being established will not result in the reform that is required because it is being asked how the current system might be improved when what is actually needed is an alternative.  Concerns raised about direct provision since 2001 include the lack of any legal basis for the system of direct provision; and reports of poor food quality, infestations, cramped living conditions and individuals institutionalised in the system for several years.  Reports relating to prostitution and safety issues in respect of children are nothing new for anyone who has worked in this area, despite the fact that these issues only received media attention quite recently.  As a result of the fact that there is a limited choice of food, movement and shared living space, curfews and restrictions on visitors to the centres, it is claimed - and rightly so - that the system breaches the right to private and family life under Article 8 of the Convention on Human Rights.  In fact, some of the asylum seekers with whom I have worked are unable to attend the debate tonight and tomorrow night because they cannot break their curfews.<br\/><br\/>Despite the recent media attention this issue has been receiving - it is about time too - I have been wanting to raise it during my allotted Private Members' time for almost a year.  When it began to receive increased attention during the summer and when it seemed clear announcements were pending, I briefly considered whether there was any point in proceeding with moving this motion if we were on the precipice of great change.  Then, earlier in the summer, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, ruled out any consideration of the question of extending the right to work for asylum seekers.  Shortly thereafter, the establishment of the working group was announced.  Subsequently, the Minister has continued to make reserved comments.  Everyone here who has an interest in the direct provision system can indicate what needs to be done because the experts have been informing us about the matter for quite some time.  While I am sure there are good intentions on the part of the Minister for State with responsibility for equality, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, this is just another delaying tactic on the part of Fine Gael that will result in a much diluted version of what must to be done.  That is just not acceptable.<br\/><br\/>Most Members will agree that the current system just will not do.  I am glad the matters in this regard have moved forward, even though there is still an undercurrent of discrimination against asylum seekers that is being fed by a flow of misinformation.  However, the motion is not about fixing the wrongs in the direct provision system.  Rather, it relates to constructing an alternative and it is in this light that I want to progress the debate.  The motion calls on the Government to abolish the direct provision system and introduce specialised reception centres operating as one-stop-shops for newly arrived protection applicants providing access to the necessary services for the identification and assessment of needs; provide appropriate accommodation which respects family life in a system that embodies the best interests of the child as well as identifying and properly supporting individuals with special needs and vulnerabilities; ensure the availability of early legal advice and independent complaints and inspection mechanisms; provide for the transfer to independent living within six months if a decision on a person's status has not been reached by then; introduce a strategy for implementation of the new system with a clearly defined timeframe to adapt to a reformed system of accommodation for asylum seekers; lift the prohibition on employment to allow residents of direct provision centres to actively participative in society, giving them a sense of worth and purpose in their daily lives, which is a basic need of every human being; and introduce a mechanism that allows asylum seekers that have already begun the process of applying for asylum in Ireland and who are therefore unable to avail of the single procedure to be fast-tracked to ensure no further unnecessary delays ensue.<br\/><br\/>This issue goes beyond party politics, it is a human rights issue.  I, therefore, urge all parties and Independents to accept the motion.  In its observations published last July, the UN Human Rights Committee rightly put Ireland to shame regarding its direct provision system when it expressed its concern &quot;at the lack of a single application procedure for the consideration of all grounds of international protection, leading to delays in the processing of asylum claims and prolonged accommodation of asylum seekers in direct provision centres which is not conducive to family life&quot;.  The committee recommended that Ireland &quot;take appropriate legislative and policy measures to establish a single application procedure with a right of appeal to an independent appeals body without further delay&quot; and that the Government should ensure that &quot;the duration of stay in Direct Provision centres is as short as possible and introduce an accessible and independent complaints procedure in Direct Provision centres&quot;.  The Government appears to believe that the introduction of the single application procedure for protection will solve everything.  However, the proposed legislation will have no impact on the thousands of asylum seekers who have been left waiting years for decisions on their status.  The number in this regard continues to grow but we have not yet even been presented with the draft heads of the proposed protection Bill.  Regardless of this, there should be respect for basic human rights in any centres which accommodate asylum seekers, however short their stay.  By only fixing some of the problem, all the Government is doing is papering over the cracks.<br\/><br\/>Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness put it aptly when she warned that a future Irish Government will be obliged to issue a State apology to and compensate former Direct Provision residents, particularly children.  Last summer we learned that social services have been alerted to over 1,500 cases involving young asylum seekers.  The issues investigated by child protection staff in respect of these cases include inappropriate sexualised behaviour among children, the inability of parents to cope, young people not being supervised and mental health problems.  In addition, the figure to which I refer indicates that the volume of reported concerns over children living in direct provision accommodation are between three and four times the rate for young people who live in the general community.  The 2012 report by the Special Rapporteur on Child Protection, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, highlighted the real risk of child abuse in direct provision accommodation arising from shared sleeping arrangements whereby single parent families are required to share with strangers and teenagers are obliged to share with parents and siblings of the opposite sex.<br\/><br\/>The &quot;E&quot; grade given by the Children's Rights Alliance in its Report Card 2013 in respect of the right to equality and non-discrimination exemplifies how asylum seeking children are being treated.  Article 2 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, UNCRC, requires states to ensure that children are not discriminated against, including in the context of the status of their parents, while Article 7 stipulates that a child shall have a right to a nationality.  It has been affirmed that the enjoyment of rights stipulated in the UNCRC is not limited to children who are citizens of a state party and must, if not explicitly stated otherwise, also be available to all children - including asylum-seeking children - irrespective of their nationality, immigration status or statelessness.  The UNCRC also calls on states to ensure that all young children are guaranteed access to appropriate and effective services - including programmes of health, care and education - specifically designed to promote their well-being and that particular attention should be paid to the most vulnerable groups of young children and those who are at risk of discrimination.  The latter category includes asylum-seeking children.  We all know that we are failing miserably in the protection of such children.  This is also widely known elsewhere.  Last year authorities in the North sought to return a Sudanese asylum seeker and her three children to the Republic, where they initially sought asylum.  However, the High Court in the North prevented the move on the basis that returning the family to direct provision was not in the best interests of the children.  The presiding judge, Mr. Justice J. Stevens found that &quot;the well-being both emotionally and financially of the primary carer and the importance of that to the well-being of the children in her care would point significantly to the best interests of the children being to remain in Northern Ireland&quot;.  That is a sad indictment of the system in this State.<\/p><p>Children must be accommodated as a priority in a safe environment where their welfare can be protected and their natural development nurtured.  Essentially, parents need to be able to parent and the family should be self-contained as a family unit as much as possible.  For child protection to be at the heart of the reception system, appropriately trained staff should be present within the accommodation system and not simply at a national central point with remote access.<br\/><br\/>As most people know, Ireland is one of only two European Union member states where asylum seekers are prohibited from working after a designated period.  The Government argues that extending the right to work for asylum seekers would almost certainly have a profoundly negative impact on application numbers.  However, there is no evidence to support this claim.  The Health Service Executive has documented the negative health effects among asylum seekers of not being able to work: &quot;Lack of entitlement to work, when this restriction extends over a long period, may further compound mental health, with boredom, depression, sense of isolation and loss of self-esteem commonly reported symptoms,&quot; it concluded in a recent report.  When a person is denied the right to work, he is denied the right to provide for himself, he is denied his individuality and responsibility and there is no sense of control in his life.  The matter was aptly put by an academic and journalist:<blockquote>To deny the right to work is to deny a fundamental source of human dignity.  Work contributes to a sense of self worth that is essential to well-being.  It can be a vital coping mechanism, particularly for people who have suffered trauma and upheaval.  That is one of the reasons why the right to work is enshrined in international treaties...including the Refugee Convention and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  To deny asylum seekers the right to work is to put their mental and physical health at risk.<\/blockquote>The fact is our direct provision system has cost the State an extortionate amount in recent years, but it is providing little in terms of a decent standard of living.  The State has given more than &euro;850 million to private firms for the provision of accommodation and food since direct provision was established.  Many of these companies are large firms involved in the property, hospitality or catering business.  Several have moved to shield their company accounts from public scrutiny and, in some cases, their beneficial owners include companies in offshore jurisdictions such as the Isle of Man or British Virgin Islands.  While many cynics would use this information to argue that we already do too much for them or that we should send them all back where they come from, the fact is these costs exist because of the reluctance and resistance to deal with minority groups living in and being processed through an ineffectual system.<br\/><br\/>If the asylum process did not take so long with residents spending many years in the system, costs would be cut immediately.  However, as mentioned previously, the single procedure in itself is not the answer.  The introduction of a self-catering system instead of handing-out millions to private companies would introduce more transparency as well as respect for family life.  It is not a question of costs as much as how we treat our fellow human beings.  There is no denying the cost and transparency element involved which, if rectified, would in fact improve how we treat asylum seekers.<br\/><br\/>Archbishop Desmond Tutu has said:<blockquote>When we oppress others, we end up oppressing ourselves.  All of our humanity is dependent upon recognizing the humanity in others.<\/blockquote>Where is the humanity in direct provision?  What is needed is an alternative system that respects the human rights and basic needs of each individual and family for the duration of their stay, a system which is efficient and transparent and which allows asylum seekers to be productive in society rather than imprisoned living a life of degradation.  I believe what is proposed in the motion would do precisely this.<br\/><br\/>I recognise several Deputies from all parties and none feel strongly on this issue and that the Minister of State, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, had a particular interest in this issue as a backbencher and has stated his wishes to reform completely the system numerous times since entering office.  I believe we are similarly minded on this issue and I hope he is given the space to do what he is in the Department to do.  We have a responsibility as a nation and as a member of the UN Human Rights Council such that when people come to our country looking for protection they are treated with the dignity and respect that should be afforded to all human beings, and that they can live in the knowledge that they and their children will be safe for however long they remain in our country.  Therefore, I call on the Government to accept the motion, introduce a strategy for the implementation of the new system and begin on the path to meaningful reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000043#QQ00200","speaker":"1001","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412105100,"counter":467,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity of speaking to this important debate on the direct provision system in Ireland.  I take this opportunity to thank and commend my Independent colleague, Deputy Thomas Pringle, on bringing forward this motion.  He has shown great leadership and compassion on this urgent matter and all sides of the House should support him and his motion.<\/p><p>  I accept that for some people this may not be popular.  Yesterday's poll, for example, shows we have a long way to go in respect of changing the mindset of those who are hostile to the sentiments expressed in the motion.  I challenge those people tonight.  Would they like their son, daughter or brother to live in the direct provision centres with the &euro;9.60 weekly allowance for children?  Would they like to see their family in these conditions in a far-off land while waiting for a decision?  I put it up to them tonight in the debate.<\/p><p>  The plight of the migrant is a major, critical issue in the modern world and it is a fact of life today.  It is important to remember them as human beings.  We have all seen the recent pictures on our televisions of in the region of 120,000 migrants being rescued by the Italian coastguard off the Italian coast.  Of these 120,000 a total of 2,200 died in the crossing and in September alone 750 people died.<\/p><p>  We have also seen another aspect of this issue, that is, the complete humiliation and exploitation of these migrant people.  Women have been abused and sexually exploited.  These issues are important as well as the details of direct provision.  We must look into the heart and soul and the words of this motion and turn them into a reality for these families.<\/p><p>  When we are dealing with this issue we must speak out against any form of racism in our society.  Whether in Ireland or Europe, we must challenge the racists and put an end to this carry on.  I encountered an example one and a half years ago in my constituency involving several individuals.  I asked an innocent question on direct provision.  They photocopied a leaflet and gave it out in a part of my constituency allegedly in a negative way.  I put it to those people that I am very proud to stand up and support the rights of people.  I am proud to stand tonight with Deputy Thomas Pringle and the Independent Deputies who are standing up for the rights of people.  I put it to them that they should consider our history and the Famine.  They should consider our families and extended families who had to go to other countries.  We all have relations in America, Australia and throughout the world.  They had to emigrate as well.  We are part of the process.  Only in the past week we saw the great Galway man, Marty Walsh, home on a visit to Ireland, Galway and Dublin.  He was elected mayor of Boston.  I listened to the details of his interview and how he got elected by a cross-section of Boston society.  He got a good deal of support from different communities and used his vote in a very positive way.  It is important that we use these examples because as I speak there are children in the centres who could be doctors, scientists and leaders of tomorrow.  We have to focus on those people and their qualities.<\/p><p>  The issue of cost comes up regularly.  I gather the figure is between &euro;17 million and &euro;19 million per annum in public money although I am unsure whether that is an accurate figure.  People have put it to me that a considerable amount of money is being made on legal fees.  We need to examine these figures.<\/p><p>  It is important to examine factually the details of Deputy Thomas Pringle's motion.  There are over 4,300 asylum seekers in the 34 direct provision centres in the State.  Some of them have been living in these centres for up to ten years.  One third of the residents are children.  The direct provision system is an ineffective and costly system that is not fit for purpose.<\/p><p>  Concerns have been raised by the United Nations Human Rights Committee regarding the prolonged accommodation of asylum seekers in direct provision centres.  The committee suggested this was not conducive to family life.  Concerns were also raised by the special rapporteur on child protection in respect of the detrimental effect of direct provision accommodation on children and parents' ability to provide adequate care.  We have seen the social injustice of denying children residing in direct provision centres the opportunity to progress to third level education.<\/p><p>The personal allowances are &euro;19.10 per week for an adult and &euro;9.60 for a child.  These are important facts.  The Minister has set up a working group.  He should get on with the job, given that there is cross-party support for helping these people.  There should not be a fudge or any messing around.<\/p><p> We need to consider sensible actions that could be taken.  I would like the Minister to provide for the transfer of residents to independent living within six months if a decision on a person&rsquo;s status has not been reached by then.  The prohibition on employment should be lifted to allow residents of direct provision centres to work within six months.  We need to introduce a strategy for implementation of the new system and a mechanism that allows asylum seekers that have begun the process of applying for asylum in Ireland to be fast-tracked.  If Government Members support justice, equality and respect for the person, they will support the motion at 9 o'clock tomorrow night.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000044#RR00200","speaker":"1017","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412105700,"counter":469,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate, and I compliment Deputy Pringle, who tabled the motion.  He has been interested in this issue for many a long year and he is supportive of a change in the direct provision system.  That view is becoming more widely accepted.  The system is detrimental to families and individuals and, in particular, children.  I am particularly disappointed that the Government has tabled an amendment.  It is unnecessary, because the House should not be divided on this issue.  There is significant cross-party support for a change to the system and, even at this late stage, I call on the Minister of State to withdraw the amendment and allow the motion to be passed unanimously by the House and implemented in the near future.<br\/><br\/>I deal with asylum seekers on a regular basis.  There is a direct provision facility, Bridgewater House, in Carrick-on-Suir in my constituency.  It has been in operation for some time.  There are excellent relations and good interactions between the asylum seekers and the local community and there is excellent support from the community for the residents and their children.  The children attend local schools and are involved in many local organisations, including the GAA, while also participating in many traditional cultural events.  Many of the adults are engaged in education and training and they are supported through the Nano Nagle centre in Carrick-on-Suir.  Everybody in the town should be complimented on the good interaction and support provided for the residents of Bridgewater House.<br\/><br\/>As Deputy Pringle said, this is the 14th year of direct provision.  Approximately 4,300 asylum seekers are currently resident in 34 centres in the State, many of whom have been in the centres for up to ten years, while a few have been there even longer.  More than 1,600 of them are young people under the age of 18, and there is no doubt the system is having a negative effect on them, in particular, and on families.<br\/><br\/>There is widespread support for the view that this system needs to be changed, although that view was held in some parts of society from the beginning.  A retired Supreme Court judge, the former Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly, the Special Rapporteur for Children, many civil society organisations, the United Nations Human Rights Committee and numerous politicians have come to share this view.  I hope the Minister of State will withdraw the amendment and agree to the passage of the motion unanimously.<br\/><br\/>A total of 4,360 persons are in direct provision, of whom 2,800 live in 851 family units.  Some 1,666 residents are aged under 18, while another 451 are aged between 18 and 25.  Although the numbers in the system have decreased over the past number of years, the length of stay in the centres has increased significantly and there is no doubt that now is the time to change the system.  The 34 centres are located in 18 counties but only three were purpose-built for accommodation.  The remainder are former hotels, hostels or guest houses, convents, nursing homes and so on, which were never intended for long-term residents.  This is not good for individual residents and it is particularly negative for children.<br\/><br\/>Since the introduction of the system in 2000, the weekly personal allowance has not changed.  It remains  &euro;19.10 per week for an adult and &euro;9.60 for each child.  There are serious concerns about the effect the system is having on children.  Mr. Geoffrey Shannon, the Special Rapporteur for Children, has mentioned this in his reports.  For instance, he stated:<blockquote>The particular needs of children in the Direct Provision system should be examined with a view to establishing whether the system itself is detrimental to their welfare and development and, if appropriate, an alternative form of support and accommodation adopted which is more suitable for families and particularly children.  In the interim, the state should implement without delay an independent complaints mechanism and independent inspections of Direct Provision centres and give consideration to these being undertaken through either HIQA (inspections) or the Ombudsman for Children (complaints)...<br \/><br \/>Research is needed on the specific vulnerability of children accommodated in the system of Direct Provision and the potential or actual harm which is being created by particular circumstances of their residence, including the inability of parents to properly care for and protect their children and the damage that may be done by living for a lengthy period of time in an institutionalised setting which was not designed for long-term residents.<\/blockquote>This is a particularly damning view.  The system is detrimental to children and needs to be changed urgently.<br\/><br\/>The UN Human Rights Committee has also addressed the issue in a report, stating: &quot;The Committee is concerned at the lack of a single application procedure for consideration of all grounds for international protection.&quot;<\/p><p>According to the report, the system must be completely changed.  <br\/><br\/>I again ask the Minister of State not to introduce the amendment because Deputies agree more than they disagree on this issue.

The Technical Group has a rota for Private Members' business and there is always a long list of issues Deputies would like to discuss.  Deputy Pringle was particularly determined that the House would debate the issue of direct provision.<\/p><p>  All Deputies will remember the night we had survivors of the Magdalen laundries in the Gallery.  It was an unusual occasion because we stood up and applauded these women for surviving what the State did to them.  The State also has survivors of industrial schools and mother and baby homes.  It seems that those who are in the wrong category at a given time in this State must survive.  Many of us have read about the views that prevailed in this country when certain sets of circumstances were allowed to persist.  It has been horrifying to learn of some of the values that more or less shaped the policies which resulted in a hidden Ireland in which we sought to hide things away.  In many ways, asylum seekers in the direct provision system have also been hidden away as it is only relatively recently that they started to become vocal.  People in the direct provision system should not have to survive the State.<\/p><p>  Approximately 70 million people claim Irish ancestry.  Ireland has not failed in terms of distributing its population to other countries.  Many Irish people were not treated well abroad.  The way in which Irish people were treated in London and elsewhere in the 1950s and 1960s horrified us.  We must ask if what we are doing today is any better.  <\/p><p>  Direct provision was introduced in 2000 by a Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government as a short-term solution to the changing profile of migration.  It was intended to last for perhaps six months.  No one anticipated that people would live in direct provision for up to 14 year or that large numbers of children would spend virtually their entire childhoods in these arrangements.  We need to visualise what this means for such children.  They will not have a normal home or family life and their parents will not have any prospect of securing employment.  Ireland and Lithuania are the only countries in the European Union which deny asylum seekers all opportunities to work.  The current system essentially steals childhood opportunities from the children of asylum seekers.<\/p><p>  Deputy Healy referred to children integrating in the community by participating in sport and so forth.  Such integration is difficult to achieve when families receive &euro;9.60 per week for each child.  Participation requires charity from the communities in which direct provision centres are hosted.  While there is generally good will among such communities, such charity should not be required.  We must dismantle the current arrangement which is unacceptable, particularly in the 21st century. <\/p><p>  Ireland has a proud record on overseas aid.  Even in these tough times, we continue to support some of the most vulnerable communities in the world.  It is odd that we are concerned about incurring reputational damage on money markets and so forth, yet our treatment of those seeking asylum is placing at risk the proud record we have built up on overseas aid.  Many asylum seekers come here having experienced war and direct violence and it is no longer safe for them to return home.  Those who have fled often find it most difficult to produce paperwork because they had to flee in difficult circumstances or at short notice.  This makes it difficult for them to corroborate their case, as they are entitled to do.  <\/p><p>  The rate of acceptance of asylum applications in Ireland is among the lowest in the European Union.  I understand the EU average is 12% compared to 5% here.  This issue needs to be examined to ensure we do not return people to countries where their lives will be at risk.  <\/p><p>  The total cost of direct provision fell from &euro;86 million in 2008 to &euro;65 million in 2013.  This is a substantial cost for a highly unsatisfactory arrangement.  As Deputies are aware, adults in the direct provision system are paid &euro;19.10 per week, while children receive &euro;9.60 per week.  We must take account of school, medical and transport costs for children.  It is dreadful that people have been placed in a position in which some resort to prostitution.<\/p><p>  There is ample evidence that many direct provision centres are not fit for human habitation.  Accommodation in some of them is substandard, with some people living in a single room, heating systems are inefficient and spaces are cramped.  The situation is reminiscent of the Dublin tenements.  It is not extreme to compare the thinking behind the direct provision system with the view taken when the workhouses were established, in other words, they should be made extremely unattractive in the hope that nobody will enter them.  That is the type of thinking involved.  It is unacceptable that the system was designed in this manner.  <\/p><p>  I accept what previous speakers said in respect of the Minister of State's bona fides in this area.  He will, I am sure, accept that the current system of inspections is inadequate.  I hope he will secure the support of both parties in government to take immediate action on the direct provision system.  Independent, non-departmental inspections similar to those carried out by the Health Information and Quality Authority must be allowed.  The Ombudsman for Children should be given a role in respect of children in direct provision as I believe that office would produce highly critical reports on the system on the basis of the stories and complaints made about it.  <\/p><p>  Asylum applications must also be processed quicker.  If this requires a relaxation in the recruitment embargo, so be it because we must bring closure to asylum applicants and ensure they are given a fair and speedy decision on their cases.  <\/p><p>  I echo Deputy Healy's view that the House should not divide on the motion.  Deputies should be able to find sufficient common ground to enable us to address the issue of direct provision.  While the problem affects only a small number of people, the impact on them is very adverse.  I call on the Government to rethink its amendment and instead accept this reasonable motion.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000046#TT00200","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"speech","time":1412106300,"counter":472,"content":"<p>The Minister of State proposes to share time with Deputies Derek Nolan, Robert Dowds and Se&aacute;n Kyne.

I appreciate his sentiments in this regard.  <br\/><br\/>I welcome the opportunity to speak about the system of direct provision because, as made clear in the new statement of Government priorities 2014 to 2016, the Government is committed to addressing not only the issues arising in relation to the system of direct provision but also the issues which need to be addressed in the context of the wider protection process.<br\/><br\/>The statement of Government priorities contains a number of interconnected commitments in the area of international protection for this purpose.  These include:<blockquote>- the commitment to legislate to reduce the length of time an applicant spends in the system through the establishment of a single application procedure by way of a dedicated protection Bill; and<br \/><br \/>- the commitment to establish an independent working group to report to the Government on improvements in the protection process, including direct provision and supports for asylum seekers.<\/blockquote>The single protection procedure we will put in place will ensure Ireland continues to meet its international obligations and in a way which is both efficient and fair.  This reform will simplify and streamline existing arrangements and provide applicants with a final decision on their protection application in a more straightforward and timely fashion and also, as a consequence, reduce the length of time applicants spend in the direct provision system and the costs to the taxpayer.  That will equally allow us to address issues which now arise in the context of the system of dispersal and direct provision.<br\/><br\/>It is no secret that I have been and continue to be a critic of the direct provision system as it currently operates.  I want to see it reformed into something of which we can be proud in a civilised society that describes itself as a republic.  I have described it as inhumane, intolerable and a system I refuse to stand over in its current form.<br\/><br\/>I am particularly mindful of the position of families and children.  We need to ensure the facilities we have in place are capable of meeting the needs of families in circumstances where their cases are ongoing for protracted periods.  We need to ensure, in particular, that the length of time people are spending in the system does not mean that children's only experience of life is of life in the direct provision system.  The needs of children will be a key issue to be addressed in the reform of the system.  Therefore, I want change.  In particular, I want to see changes made to the system in the short term which will have a direct benefit for those residing in centres as quickly as possible.  That is why I very much look forward to working with the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and my other colleagues in government in taking forward these commitments in my capacity as Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality.<br\/><br\/>The motion appears to acknowledge that change cannot occur overnight and I welcome this.  We need to be sure the changes we make are ones we are capable of delivering on and sustaining into the future.  We also need to take account of the fact that the system of direct provision does not operate in isolation from the overall protection process and that it is important that we address all relevant issues in the context of that process as a whole.<br\/><br\/>There are lessons to be learned from the circumstances in which the system of direct provision and dispersal were introduced and it is important that we do not lose sight of this.  Direct provision was the public policy response to a major accommodation crisis at the time.  We must be careful not to create a new one in circumstances where there are already considerable pressures in the housing market.  The Government introduced the system in 1999 in response to an increase in the number of persons applying for asylum, which rose to 7,724 in that year from a figure of 424 only four years previously.  That upward trend and the concentration of asylum seekers in the Dublin area meant that the accommodation services there were, understandably, unable to cope.  The Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, was consequently established to put in place arrangements which would enable the accommodation needs of protection seekers arriving in the State to be met.  The direct provision system has, nonetheless, succeeded in the period since in meeting the housing and other immediate needs of over 51,000 asylum seekers.  No one has ever been turned away or left homeless.  The difficulty is that a short-term emergency measure has become long-term policy.  <br\/><br\/>The system of direct provision and dispersal has also enabled the housing, education and health needs of asylum seekers to be met in a manner which has avoided overburdening services in Dublin and other urban areas.  It has in this way facilitated the mainstreaming of these services for asylum seekers, ensured they access the same services and that their children attend the same schools as their peers in the communities in which they live.  We need to ensure these beneficial aspects of the system are preserved.<br\/><br\/>The system of direct provision has shown itself capable of responding in a flexible way as the number of asylum seekers arriving in the State has ebbed and flowed.  The number of persons residing in direct provision accommodation peaked at 8,080 in 2005.  The decline since has meant that the number of direct provision centres has fallen from over 70 to the 34 now in operation.  The most recent closure took place in July 2013.<br\/><br\/>The annual budget for direct provision accommodation, at its highest, in 2008, exceeded &euro;91 million.  This year the cost will be approximately &euro;51 million, a reduction of 40%.  The number now in direct provision accommodation is approximately 4,300 which represents a reduction of 3,780 persons or 46% compared to the high point.  The numbers residing in direct provision accommodation reflect, in part, the number of asylum applications being made.  The number of applications had increased from the low hundreds in the early 1990s to 7,724 in 1999 when the decision to introduce the system of direct provision was made and was later to peak at 11,634 in 2002.  The number of asylum applications has declined in the period since, reaching 946 last year.  The numbers of asylum seekers presenting themselves can clearly have implications for processing times, as well as the nature of the accommodation that can be provided.  That is why it is important that we consolidate the improvements made in recent times in processing times.  The reducing numbers being accommodated in the system also offer the possibility of improving conditions for everyone.<br\/><br\/>The average length of time persons spend in the direct provision system has been increasing year on year for some time and is a particular issue of concern to the Government, as well as to me.  There are, however, many reasons this is so.  An analysis undertaken earlier this year revealed that approximately 50% of persons in the direct provision system had either judicial review applications pending, were the subject of deportation orders, or were seeking leave to remain in the State for non-protection reasons.  A recent examination of cases in the direct provision system suggested that, in the overwhelming majority of cases in the system longer than four years, the applicants or their family members had legal proceedings pending, having exhausted all of the processes in the protection system.<br\/><br\/>I mention these facts for the purpose of setting out the context for the work we have to do, not in any way to apologise for the system as it is constituted.  That also explains why we have decided to proceed by way of the establishment of an independent working group to report to the Government on improvements to the protection process as a whole, as well as the system of direct provision and supports for asylum seekers, in particular.  The necessary work for the purpose of establishing the working group is well under way.  <br\/><br\/>Both the Minister and I hosted a round-table consultation on 18 September.  The round-table discussion brought together a wide range of organisations that have been working in the field of refugees and asylum seekers or have a particular perspective to bring to their needs.  I take the opportunity to thank the Irish Refugee Council for its assistance in organising the round-table discussion.  The groups represented were the Irish Refugee Council, as well as a representative of its core group of asylum seekers and refugees, AkiDwA, Cult&uacute;r, Doras Luimn&iacute;, the Jesuit Refugee Service, Mayo Intercultural Action, NASC, SPIRASI, Tralee International Resource Centre, the Crosscare Migrant and Refugee Project, Dublin Aids Alliance, BeLonG To Youth, Children's Rights Alliance, FLAG, Barnardos and the Integration Centre.  Representatives of the UNHCR and Amnesty also attended.  Both the Minister and I benefited greatly from their insights into the operation of the direct provision system.  <br\/><br\/>The main purpose of the round-table discussion was to enable the groups to outline key issues for them concerning the State's current arrangements for asylum seekers and the direct provision system.  The outcome of the round-table discussion has helped to clarify the issues the working group will need to address.<\/p><p>The results of the round-table consultation will inform in more detail the terms of reference of the working group, which the Minister will announce shortly along with the membership of the group.  The working group is to be chaired by former High Court judge and presiding officer of our citizenship ceremonies Bryan MacMahon.<b><\/b>I expect that the membership will include representation from a wide range of interests in this area and include NGOs, advocacy groups working with children and other vulnerable people, refugees and representatives from all relevant Departments that have a role to play in providing supports and services to protection applicants.  The Minister's intention is that the working group will be asked to submit a first report to the Government by the end of the year. <br\/><br\/>In advance of the round-table consultation, we had already identified a number of indicative themes with a view to guiding the discussion without limiting those contributing to those themes.  These were the material needs of applicants in direct provision, including the direct provision allowance and exceptional needs payments; the needs of families and persons with special needs in direct provision, with reference to the accommodation portfolio; the arrangements for handling complaints and inspections; how linkages with local communities can be improved; support for residents when transitioning to life in the community; whether limitations should be placed on the length of time persons spend in direct provision; supports for protection applicants, including in regard to education, training, health care, social welfare entitlements and access to employment; and issues relating to the international protection determination process.  The final remit of the working group will now be determined in the light of the outcome of the round-table consultation.  This will ensure that all relevant issues are approached in a structured and considered way.<br\/><br\/>There is a sovereign requirement for Ireland to maintain balanced and appropriate immigration controls while at the same time ensuring that those who come to our shores to seek the protection of our State are dealt with fairly, humanely, expeditiously and in accordance with both domestic and EU law and rules.  As a country and a people, we can justifiably say we are playing our part in this respect.  Over the past 14 years or so, close to 40,000 immigrants who came here and utilised our protection and related processes have been allowed to remain in the State on a permanent basis.  Indeed, very many of these have proceeded to become Irish citizens. <br\/><br\/>We will, of course, continue to honour our solemn international duty in the area of protection.  However, we do not have limitless resources and we simply cannot operate an immigration policy which leaves us open to being targeted by those who trade in human misery, no more than we are in a position to provide for the vast number of economic migrants who seek a better life.  It would be wrong for us to pretend otherwise or to offer simplistic solutions to what are truly complex and difficult issues of public policy with which governments all over Europe are struggling to grapple. <br\/><br\/>The statement of Government priorities also includes a second key commitment, which is to legislate to reduce the time an applicant spends in the system through the establishment of a single application procedure by way of a dedicated protection Bill.  This is a key Government priority as it will be essential to removing structural delays, which are a feature of the existing protection system.  Work on the Bill has already commenced.  We are aiming to publish it in January 2015 with a view to its enactment by Easter next year.  The key purpose of the Bill is to establish a single applications procedure and, as I indicated, simplify and streamline existing arrangements and provide applicants with a final decision on their protection application in a more straightforward and timely fashion.  It will mean that all aspects of protection - asylum and subsidiary protection &ndash; in addition to any non-protection grounds that may prevent the Minister from deporting a person in the event of protection being refused, will be investigated and decided upon at the same time.  It will, as a consequence, reduce the time that applicants spend in the direct provision system. <br\/><br\/>There has been some comment on the single procedure being of no benefit to persons already in the system.  The benefit of a single procedure would not necessarily be limited to new applicants.  The introduction of a single procedure for new applicants would raise the question as to what extent the new procedure could be applied to cases already in the system.  The details in that regard are currently being examined in my Department. <br\/><br\/>I would like in closing to refer to some recent events.  As Deputies will be aware, there are a number of ongoing protests in direct provision centres around the country.  I fully respect the right of residents to protest and express their concerns about the living conditions or the protection process.  At the same time, I am concerned about the impact the protests can have on children and other vulnerable persons living in the centres.  Other aspects of the protests have been quite disquieting.  These have included the targeting of individuals working in certain direct provision centres and the stopping of people going about their work.  I know from my visits to the centres that the persons working there, in addition to those in the Reception and Integration Agency, are working on a day-to-day basis in the interests of the residents and bring real commitment to their work that often goes far beyond what is required of them.  I would not like to see the good relationships that exist in most centres undermined.<br\/><br\/>Issues outside the control of the Reception and Integration Agency and local centre management, such as the time spent in centres and the right to employment, are issues that will be addressed by the working group which is being established.  Direct provision, as the motion makes clear, has existed for 14 years now.  It is not something that can simply be wished away or ended immediately.  The Government has also to take account of the broader context of the challenging picture in regard to the public finances and the competing demands on them.<br\/><br\/>The Government is nevertheless committed to change and to bringing about real improvements to the protection process and the arrangements in place for accommodating asylum seekers.  That is why we will be tasking the working group to report back to the Government within a very tight timeframe.  We have form in this regard.  We pledged to end the degrading practice of slopping out in Mountjoy and we did so.  We pledged to close St. Patrick's Institution for Young Offenders and we have done so.  We will not be found wanting in respect of direct provision.  I ask the House to allow the working group the time to undertake that work and to support the Government&rsquo;s counter-motion. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000047#UU00100","speaker":"1018","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412107500,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I support the overwhelming desire of the motion and counter-motion to reform the system of direct provision.  This is a welcome debate and a matter on which I have campaigned and spoken in the House on several occasions.  It is important that, as a Parliament, we reaffirm our belief in the refugee system and recognise our international obligation to those who are fleeing persecution based on race, nationality, political opinion or membership of a social group.  We should say we need and respect the system and recognise our duties in that regard because they are often forgotten in the debate.<\/p><p>  We need only to note the disturbances and turmoil right across the world to realise there are people who must genuinely flee the place they live because of these kinds of pressures.  While we have an international obligation, it is natural to have a system in place to decide who is a refugee deserving of protection and who is not.  A call must be made.  What we have, however, is a shambles and does not work.  In the first instance, we take people very quickly after they get off the plane or other means of transport and throw them into a system without obtaining adequate information or making a correct assessment.  There should be proper legal aid, discussion with the asylum seeker, etc. <\/p><p>  Second, we have a refugee appeals tribunal which, although it has significantly improved, rejected case after case for years.  The Minister of State mentioned the 40,000 people who have been allowed to remain here.  I question how many have been granted refugee status.  Owing to the inadequacies of the legislation and decisions that are so dodgy that they merit judicial review, people spend years in direct provision. <\/p><p>  I came across the plight of those in direct provision before I was even a councillor, back in 2008 when I used to work with Michael D. Higgins.  We used to hold a clinic in the Menlo Park Hotel, opposite Lisbrook House, which was then a refugee centre.  We used to deal with case after case involving people going through the system.  Would the Minister of State believe that I am still dealing with some of them?  There are people in the Eglington Hostel in Salthill, which the Minister of State visited with me, who are in the system for ten or 11 years.  They have children who are ten years old who have spent their entire lives living in the direct provision system.  If ever there were an example demonstrating that the current system is not only in need of improvement but also wrong and not working, that is it. <\/p><p>  There are two steps we need to take.  First, the working group the Minister of State has set up, on which I commend him, needs to put in place a system that works.  Simply putting in place a new combined procedure with subsidiary protection and refugee status and applying it to or grafting it onto the current system is not enough; the current system and its processes, by which people should be treated fairly and in which their applications should be dealt with comprehensively, needs to be examined also.  I ask that the working group do so.  Second, we need to deal compassionately with those who have been in the system for so long and acknowledge the system we have in place is not working and should be made better.  We need to examine the conditions and amount we pay people.  What we really need to do is embrace the reality that the people who have been in the system for ten or 11 years and who have children here are going to stay.<\/p><p>I have not come across one such family which has been told to go home.  Let us get the system working and treat these people with the urgency required, because the nihilism, waste of human potential and emptiness that existence brings with it, of living in and sharing one room and having limited moneys with which to go out and interact with society, have a damaging impact, not only on people's well-being but also on their mental health and ambitions as human beings.<\/p><p> A number of people have attempted to discuss and do something about this issue.  When I used to question the previous Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, about the legislation coming through, he constantly reported that the new protection Bill was just six months away.  That was back in 2011, when I was first elected to this House.  Every time he was asked about it, it was just another six months away.  I am not sure what it is about the Department, but when it comes to reforming this area of law and the asylum system, something is wrong and it cannot get it done.  Will the Minister of State be vigilant and ensure he pushes this reform through, because it seems there is a reluctance to reform it?<\/p><p> I am concerned by and uncomfortable with the fact that Ireland has opted out of the EU common European asylum system.  This common system sets out basic human rights and nothing more.  It guarantees basic reception conditions which incorporate human rights as asserted by the European Court of Justice.  One of these basic rights is the reception conditions directive, which mandates conditions to which people are entitled in asylum seeking centres.  We have not signed up to that directive.  The basic conditions include the right to work and so on.  The European Court of Justice has said this is a basic human right and we need to look at that as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000048#VV00200","speaker":"1045","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412108100,"counter":477,"content":"<p>What can I say after that speech by Deputy Nolan?  It very much encapsulates my views.  I thank Deputy Nolan for the strength of his contribution, both tonight and on other occasions when he has spoken publicly on this issue in drawing attention to the scandal of the system in this country.<\/p><p>  I welcome the appointment of the Minister of State, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, and thank him for the visits he is making to direct provision centres throughout the country, including one in my local area.  It was interesting to get access to a centre and see it from the inside.  I wish the Minister of State luck in making progress on this issue, but he needs to be aware of Deputy Nolan's comment regarding the obstacles he faces, because there are many obstacles to making progress with the system.  These need to be overcome as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>  I heard Deputy Nolan on radio describe our asylum system as the Magdalen laundries of the 21st century.  I wish I could say he was talking rubbish, but I cannot.  If the centres are like the one I visited a week ago with the Minister of State, while the basic provision in terms of shelter, accommodation and food is made, it is provided in such a way as to make it difficult for people to live as individuals or families.  People live in restricted conditions.  For example, last week we saw three unrelated adult women sharing a room.  They probably did not even have the same ethnic background.  We saw a family sharing a room, with parents and children sharing the room for a considerable length of time.  These situations might be fine if they lasted no longer than six months, but they go on.  Yesterday, a man who has been in the direct provision system for ten years visited my advice centre.  He is still being threatened with being sent home and must appear before the Garda National Immigration Bureau every couple of months.<\/p><p>  We need a system in place that will deal with people as quickly as possible.  I am aware the Minister for Justice and Equality has plans for a process that will take from one year to 18 months.  The shorter the period, the better.  The current system is unacceptable.  As many contributors on this have said, the fact that children can be born and live in this situation for years is a bad introduction to the world.  If these children are granted the right to remain in Ireland, what chance do they have of growing up to be decent, upstanding, well-balanced members of the community?  The same goes for their parents.  Some of the problems these people must deal with are mental health issues, uncertainty, boredom and the temptation to go down the wrong track.  I have heard many allegations of prostitution from some of those living in asylum centres.<\/p><p>  We need a solution to this issue.  First, people must be granted a quick decision.  If we could get to that position, people would either be told they cannot stay and must leave the country or they can join the workforce and begin to live their own lives rather than live with their lives on hold.  I look forward to hearing what and how quickly progress will be made.  The Minister of State faces a difficult task, but he must get on with it as soon as possible.  I have one question for him, namely, what legislation, if any, the direct provision system operates under currently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000049#WW00200","speaker":"1011"},{"type":"speech","time":1412108100,"counter":478,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and welcome the debate on this important issue.  There are two extremes in the context of a debate on direct provision and the wider area of immigration.  First is the view that there should be no immigration or inflow of people, whether immigrant workers or asylum seekers, into the State.  The other view is that there should be complete freedom of movement, unfettered and unhindered by national borders.  These views are both extreme and ludicrous.<\/p><p>  It is the State's sovereign right to define its borders and regulate movement into the State.  Our membership of the European Union carries with it a core freedom, the free movement of people throughout the Union.  Ireland does not exist in a vacuum.  It has an economy that has vacancies, some of which can only be filled by persons from abroad who are accommodated by the employment permit legislation.  The jobs in question vary, but they are highly specialised and important for the economy.  In an increasingly unstable world, there are human rights violations on an horrendous scale and we have a duty and obligation to assist those who seek help.  All of these points impact on the direct provision system.<\/p><p>  It is indisputable that there will always be a need for a system to process and address unplanned arrivals into the State.  The current system of direct provision is beset with problems and is inadequate for many of those within it.  Like others, I have raised the issue of reform of the system on several occasions - in May 2011, November 2011, October 2012, December 2013, February 2014, and most recently in June.  Some of the suggestions I have made include permitting the Ombudsman to examine complaints or issues raised by residents in the system, the plans of Ministers to reform the system and the efforts to reduce by as much as possible the amount of time spent within the system.<\/p><p>  Thankfully, the numbers in the system have been falling, but it is an unsettling fact that some people have spent years within the direct provision system.  Families have been and are being reared in single rooms.  Single people must share rooms with people of a completely different culture and in many cases they share no common language.<\/p><p>This is unacceptable.  The appeals system in the area of immigration is also a problem.  It needs to be streamlined and made more straightforward, but the decisions of the various adjudicating bodies also needs to be respected.  We cannot have a system of endless appeals.  The State has the right at the end of the day to adjudicate on behalf of citizens.<\/p><p> Since the restatement of Government priorities, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and the Minister of State, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, have made several important commitments which I enthusiastically welcome.  These include the establishment of a working group to report to the Government on the improvements within the protection system, including direct provision, and also to reduce the length of time that people are waiting within the system.  I also welcome the fact the round-table talks have commenced, and these will set the terms of reference for the working group.  NGOs have outlined a number of areas about which they have concerns, including the allowance for direct provision, the exceptional needs payment, the limitations on the length of time spent, the inspections and complaints procedure, educational issues and the dignity of people within the direct provision system.<\/p><p> It is worth noting that numbers have been greatly reduced but they are still too high, with over 4,500 people within the system.  The number of new applicants has fallen greatly from over 2,000 in 2009 to 404 now, although, again, this is still too high.  The overwhelming majority of people who have been there for a number of years are there because they have this protracted legal procedure to exhaust before a decision is made.  I would welcome any commitment to reduce the time needed for this.<\/p><p> Obviously, the system is not perfect, although I note that it has prevented homelessness in one case.  Unfortunately, as a State, we have many other challenges outside of the direct provision system, including homelessness, social housing shortages and problems with rental accommodation.  There is also a larger issue that has to be looked at.  Sweden is a country that is often looked at as being very liberal in regard to the whole asylum area but it has its own challenges.  It was a big issue in the recent Swedish elections and it has required almost a doubling of the budget over the next four years to try to deal with this situation, given it is handling many refugees from countries such as Syria and Somalia.<\/p><p> I wish the Minister of State well.  I commend him on what he has done so far and commend the Government on its work.  I hope a solution can be found to end the indignity of people having to spend years in direct provision while their applications are being processed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000049#WW00300","speaker":"1110","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412108700,"counter":480,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the motion and the issues surrounding direct provision in Ireland.  Fianna F&aacute;il shares a number of concerns surrounding the policy of direct provision, in particular the excessively long waiting time before an asylum application has been decided.  It is clear to all of us that there is a significant problem surrounding the length of time a person spends in direct provision.  Current statistics show that 46% of residents are there for three years or more and a further 14% have been there for seven years or more.  This is clearly unacceptable, in particular for children whose earlier years are being impacted by the unsuitable living conditions of the direct provision facilities for families.<\/p><p>  Fianna F&aacute;il sought to pass legislation in 2010 - the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010 - which allowed for a new single, integrated process of application for protection which would replace applications for refugee status, subsidiary protection and leave to remain.  This legislative provision has yet to be implemented.  The Department of Justice and Equality has stated that the main factor that contributes to upward trends in waiting time &quot;is the length of time in the protection-humanitarian leave determining process&quot;, including legal proceedings.  We know that one of the biggest factors affecting the time delay in the direct provision system is the lack of a single application process for asylum.  It would seem obvious to us that the bringing forward of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010, or a similar Bill, would go some way towards reducing the delay currently experienced in the direct provision system.<\/p><p>  I believe we in this House would all agree with reform of the current system.  What we need is a system which is humane, fair, time-efficient and effective in dealing with applications.  We need to ensure that Ireland is not seen as a soft target for people who have spurious claims for asylum, in order to protect against people who would seek to abuse our system.  Equally, we need to ensure that those with a genuine application are dealt with and granted asylum with speed.  We also need to ensure that those who seek to undermine our application system, who are not genuine in their approach and who deliberately abuse the processes laid down by the system, are dealt with in equal speed.<\/p><p>  We have a duty, as Members of this House, to protect the interests, safety and well-being of the Irish people while also seeking to fulfil our international duties and obligations by offering our State as a safe haven for those who are persecuted in their own countries.  In previous centuries, it was Irish people who sought asylum in other countries at a time when being a member of a particular faith or political outlook resulted in persecution.  As a country and a people which has experienced political persecution and mass emigration, we must address this issue with the urgency and seriousness required, informed by our own history.  We can only fulfil those duties by putting in place a robust system for dealing with asylum applications and guaranteeing as best we can its integrity and efficiency.<\/p><p>  The current system, I believe, falls significantly short in fulfilling those duties despite significant expenditure on direct provision by the Department of Justice and Equality.  Although there have been reductions in expenditure, in what I assume is in line with declining numbers in direct provision centres over the past five years, the State still spends over &euro;50 million on accommodation costs for this system.  The legal costs per year still exceed &euro;6 million, with judicial review alone costing approximately &euro;2.2 million this year.  Yet, the fact our system currently has an average length of stay of 48 months, and that a total of 1,686 people have spent a minimum of five years in the system, is extremely concerning.  We also have a situation where approximately 604 people have been in direct provision for seven years or more.  This is an outrageous figure and shows there is a failure arising in the State's legal mechanisms to deal with these cases in a manner which is in any way effective, humane or fair.<\/p><p>  One thing we must ensure is that any change or reform to the system as it currently stands must also deal with the people who are currently in the system.  We cannot allow a situation arise where those who are currently engaged in the direct provision system today will not benefit from any proposed reforms of the system.  That would be grossly unfair and something my party could not support.  I hope the Minister might be able to give a commitment in this regard.<\/p><p>  I also put forward that priority should be given to families in direct provision who have been waiting inordinate amounts of time for their applications to be decided.  We cannot allow further delay which may result in young children growing up in Ireland, being educated and making friends here, only to be deported at some unknown date in the future.  That is quite simply playing games with people's lives and is just not acceptable.  The Minister should have some discretion in this regard and be conscious of the impact such a decision would have on any young family in that situation.<\/p><p>  The conditions at direct provision centres for families in general are also a concern.  At a recent protest at a direct provision centre in Cork, a number of mothers who have been living there for periods reaching up to nine years stated they had serious concerns about food but also about the effect on people's mental well-being.  The indefinite duration of the review of their applications served to create great instability and fear in their lives.  While I understand the public finances have been under strain for the past number of years, I consider that proper food should be able to be provided to those in direct provision, given this country's ability to produce some of the best food in the world.<\/p><p>  I want it noted too that the budget of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, has been cut by &euro;5 million since 2011, which may have resulted in further waiting and delay for many in the direct provision system.  The budget allocation, including Supplementary Estimate adjustments as appropriate, for the operation of INIS, including wages and salaries and running costs, was &euro;52.5 million, &euro;43.5 million, &euro;49.5 million and &euro;47.5 million respectively for the years 2011 to 2014.  In response to a recent parliamentary question which I submitted, it was outlined that the staffing levels of INIS, which forms part of the Department of Justice and Equality, ranged from 615 in 2011 to its current level of 519 full-time equivalents.<\/p><p>That is a loss of almost 100 staff in the space of three years, which is bound to have a significant impact on the processing times INIS is able to provide.  The equivalent budget allocations for the direct provision system ranged from &euro;67.5 million in 2011 to &euro;47.5 million this year.  I put it to the Minister of State that the cuts to the budgets of both INIS and the direct provision system have resulted in a slowdown in the advancement of applications for asylum, which has resulted in many of the protests we see at centres across the country.<\/p><p> I urge the Minister of State to introduce legislation to create a system for dealing with asylum applications that will be fair, fast and robust.  The current waiting times for decisions with regard to these applications are embarrassing and must be addressed immediately.  We in Fianna F&aacute;il will support proposals from the Government which will address these issues if they are fair, reasonable and robust.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to bring legislation before this House quite quickly.<\/p><p> My party and I are very concerned about this issue.  I raised it last week with the Minister as a priority question.  In fairness, she is minded to deal with the issue.  I also articulated my opinion that HIQA and the Ombudsman for Children should have oversight capacity in terms of reviewing standards.  I also mentioned the two direct provision centres in my part of the country.  There is one in Mount Trenchard in my constituency and another on the outskirts of Limerick city in Knockalisheen, which is technically in county Clare but is part of Limerick city.  Those people have been engaged in protests recently in Limerick to articulate their concerns.  I am sure the Minister of State is aware of Doras Luimn&iacute;, which acts as a support and advocacy agency.  I take the opportunity to compliment Doras Luimn&iacute; because I work with it as much as I can.  It refers people to my advice centre.  It is a truly fantastic organisation that works not only with refugees and asylum seekers but also with those trapped in prostitution and those who have been trafficked into this country.  It is a truly outstanding organisation and I am sure that when the Minister of State visits Limerick, he will meet it.  I know he has indicated that he intends to visit Limerick in the near future and I would be glad to accompany him to either of the direct provision centres in the Limerick area when he does so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000050#XX00200","speaker":"1057","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412109300,"counter":482,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State's statements on this subject since he took office.  I referenced them last week during Question Time with the Minister.  I must also put on the record again the sheer frustration we felt when we raised the matter with the previous Minister, Deputy Shatter, over the past three years.  Both in this Chamber and in committee rooms, he repeatedly defended this system.  He acknowledged some of the challenges but felt it was the best we could offer.  It has been a really frustrating number of years, which is why a fresh approach is welcome.  I believe the Minister of State will seek to address this issue, but I am a bit concerned about the Minister.  I felt she was not using the same emphasis as the Minister of State in her statements last week.  On reflection afterwards, I was fearful that we might not have a sense of urgency around this - a need to catch up with three lost years.  I made the point to the Minister that, based on her response, I felt that there was a rowing back from some of the statements the Minister of State had made publicly and that there was a more cautious approach and a qualification around some of the comments that were being made.  This is why I welcome this motion tonight.  There is no legislative footing for these direct provision centres and they can be removed if the Government deems it necessary.  I appreciate that the Government needs to put in place some type of system and to deal with the fact that there have been these crazy delays in the application process and that appeals run on for years.<\/p><p>  In 1987, I read a book by the late Ray Crotty which revealed that since the foundation of the Irish State, half of Irish citizens who survived childhood - not factoring in those who died during childhood - emigrated.  From 1922 to 1987 - 65 years - half of all citizens who survived childhood emigrated from Ireland.  That is our legacy.  Today, as we speak, emigration is happening again - to Australia, the US, Canada, Great Britain and all over the world.  Yet again, we are losing our young people to emigration.  We would never for a moment tolerate our young people being treated the way we have treated people who have come to this country.  Can one imagine &quot;Liveline&quot; with Joe Duffy and the discussion on every local radio station?  There would be documentaries every week on every station in this State telling the stories.  We would not put up with it.  We would have dealt with it.  Of all the nations on this earth, I would say that per capita, very few have our emigration levels.  There are very few countries that have had to rely more on their brothers and sisters internationally to give them a future.<\/p><p>  I am not advocating an open-door system.  There needs to be a process to ensure that people who genuinely need asylum are assessed properly.  We have left people in these centres with food that is not culturally applicable.  I listened to one of the reports on RTE radio about deep-fried food and frozen food served every day to people who are used to healthy and diverse choices.  This is one of the less serious criticisms.  I am talking about the way children are treated within the system.  This has been ongoing for years and years.  The way children are corralled into tight spaces is an appalling indictment of the way we made up that policy 14 years ago in response to very different circumstances.  We have not dealt with the fact that they have changed dramatically.  <\/p><p>  I know the Minister of State is sincere about this and is trying to address it, but I hope his senior colleague has the same sense of urgency about this issue.  This will be proved in the next period of time.  We need to give the Ombudsman and the Information Commissioner oversight of the direct provision system.  They have repeatedly asked for it.  The Ombudsman, Peter Tyndall, will appear before the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions tomorrow and I know he is going to ask for it again.  He is also the Information Commissioner.  We need to give oversight of this system to the Ombudsman and the Information Commissioner because it is public money but, more importantly, because it is about people's rights.  While they are not citizens of Ireland, we have received a welcome all over the world.  The least we can do when people are waiting for a decision is to treat them with dignity and have oversight of that.  I wish the Minister of State good luck with his work, and if he continues in the same light he will have the support of this side of the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000051#YY00200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1412109300,"counter":483,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1412109300,"counter":484,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at 9 p.m. until 9.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 1 October 2014.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
