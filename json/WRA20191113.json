Shortly after the introduction of VAT, Revenue allowed the zero rate to be applied to certain food supplement products (vitamins, minerals and fish oils). This concessionary approach expanded as the market developed over the years and resulted in the zero rating by Revenue of further similar products, including products other than vitamins, minerals and fish oils.   <\/p>  <p>  Following complaints from the Irish Health Trade Association (IHTA), Revenue conducted a comprehensive review of the VAT treatment of food supplement products. Based on an expert report and its own legal analysis, Revenue concluded that the status quo was no longer sustainable and issued new guidance in December 2018 which removed the concessionary zero rating of various food supplement products with effect from 1 March 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  Following representation from Deputies and from the industry, I wrote to Revenue outlining my plans to examine the policy and legislative options for the taxation of food supplement products in the context of Finance Bill 2019. Revenue responded by delaying the withdrawal of its concessionary zero rating of the food supplement products concerned. This allowed time for my Department to carry out a public consultation on the taxation of food supplement products. <\/p>  <p>  Based on this consultation, I introduced a provision in this year&rsquo;s Finance Bill applying the reduced rate of VAT (13.5%) to food supplements from 1 January 2020. In the absence of this provision the standard VAT rate of 23% would apply to food supplements, including those that had been concessionally zero rated previously. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to clarify that certain products will not be impacted by the legislative change.  Foods for specific groups such as infant and follow-on formulae and infant foods, foods for special medical purposes and specially formulated foods will continue to be zero rated as they are well established and defined categories of food. Fortified foods, such as yoghurts and cereals fortified with vitamins and minerals, will also continue to be zero rated as they are food.<\/p>  <p>  Folic acid, vitamin and mineral products which are licenced or authorised as medicines by the Health Products Regulatory Authority will continue to be zero rated under a different VAT provision for human oral medicines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300059#WRA01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Industry Regulation","counter":18,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300059#WRA01450"},{"type":"question","counter":19,"qnumday":40,"qnumall":"[46690\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300059#WRA01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will engage with the Central Bank over the use of dual pricing by the insurance industry; and the measures he will take to ensure semi-State companies, such as An Post, do not practice dual pricing.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":20,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[41218\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300059#WRA01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the practice and prevalence of dual pricing in the insurance market and its effect on consumers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1333","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":21,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 75 together.<\/p>  <p>  At the outset, the Deputies should note that the Minister for Finance is responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.

However, as the Deputy is aware, in my role as the Minister of State for Financial Services and Insurance, I have raised the issue of dual pricing with the Central Bank at a recent meeting and sought their views.  In response, the Central Bank has confirmed that they will undertake a review of price optimisation, which includes the practice of dual pricing, as this has been identified as a potential consumer risk by the Central Bank in its sectoral risk assessment of the insurance sector.  <\/p>  <p>  I understand that the first step of this review will be a comprehensive data gathering and analysis exercise to determine the scale and prevalence of price optimisation across the insurance sector and its precise effects on consumer groups.  I also understand that the Central Bank intends to engage with key stakeholders, most notably the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, on the terms of reference of this review and on the nature and scope of any potential remedies.

It is important to understand that these payments serve different purposes and some have been in place for some time:  The levies and contributions are as follows:<\/p>  <p>  The Motor Insurers Insolvency Compensation Fund (MIIC Fund) commenced on 1 December 2018 and was introduced by the Insurance Amendment Act 2018. This is a contribution equivalent to 2% of gross motor premiums and is being provided by motor insurers in order to finance the gap between what the ICF used pay to third party claimants (65%) and the amount which the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland pays in respect of victims of uninsured and untraceable drivers (100% of claim as general rule). This is not considered a levy as the decision rests with the insurance companies as to how they finance this contribution, i.e. either through absorbing it or passing it onto consumers.  <\/p>  <p>  The  contribution rate is subject to an annual review by the Minister and may be varied between 0 and 3% depending on factors such as the amount held in the MIIC Fund and the likelihood of a call on that Fund.  In a steady state, this contribution is likely to be required for a period of 8 to 9 years. <\/p>  <p>  The second contribution that impacts motor premium is the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) levy. This levy was in place from 1984 to 1992 and was reintroduced in January 2012. It currently applies at a rate of 2% of all gross premium income and its purpose is to repay the Exchequer for funding the administration of Quinn Insurance. As there is still a significant amount owing to the State, the levy is likely to be applied for another 10 years or so. The balance on the loan provided by the Minister to the ICF was &euro;800.6m at 31 December 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy may wish to note that there is a stamp duty on non-life insurance premiums that was introduced in 1982. The rate of stamp duty when introduced was 1%, rising to 2% in 1993 and further increased to 3% in the 2009 Supplementary Budget.

It also imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower.  <\/p>  <p>  The European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 transposed the provisions of the Mortgage Credit Directive into Irish law and provide a framework within which all lenders that provide mortgage credit to consumers in the European Union must operate.  The Regulations set out further requirements to protect mortgage borrowers, including requirements in respect of provision of standardised information to consumers and the requirement to carry out creditworthiness assessments.  Furthermore, the Regulations provide that a lender is not to provide residential mortgage credit to a consumer unless the assessment indicates that the borrower is likely to be in a position to meet his\/her obligations in the manner required by the credit agreement.  <\/p>  <p>  The Consumer Credit Act 1995 also includes requirements for housing loans, including buy-to-let mortgages. Under the Act, there are provisions in relation to insurance and duties on lenders to supply documentation and information on a mortgage loan.<\/p>  <p>  The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears applies to all regulated mortgage lenders and credit servicing firms operating in the State when dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears on their primary residence. It provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent way by their lender and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers. <\/p>  <p>  Overall, therefore, there is a robust consumer protection regulatory framework governing the provision and operation of mortgage agreements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300059#WRA02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Tax","counter":40,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300059#WRA02950"},{"type":"question","counter":41,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[46681\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300059#WRA03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on whether the local property tax is likely to become increasingly problematic and regressive due to its link to the property market conditions.","asker":"1238","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":42,"content":"<p>The basis for calculation of the Local Property Tax (LPT) was examined comprehensively in the 2012 report of the Inter-departmental Group on the Design of a LPT. The report advocated the use of market value of residential properties as the basis of assessment and this recommendation was accepted by the Government. The Design Group considered that under a market value approach applied to housing, the market value of a residential property would be related to the characteristics of the building itself, the site on which it was located and the features and amenities of the neighbourhood. There would be a relationship between the market value of a house and benefits to the owners in terms of enjoyment of the amenity value of the property. The charging structure for LPT is progressive. The basic rate of 0.18 percent applies up to property values of &euro;1 million with a higher rate of 0.25 percent applying on the portion of value above the &euro;1 million threshold. <\/p><p>The Inter-departmental LPT Review Group which reported to me earlier this year was conscious of the potential effects of significant changes in LPT liability on individual households and how progressive these might be. Considerable work was done by the Review Group on the estimated impact of changes in property values including a Distributional Impact Analysis. The Distributional Impact Analysis using the ESRI SWITCH Model (Simulating Welfare and Income Tax Changes) tax and benefit micro-simulation model, was used to compare the impact which the proposed reform scenarios would have on household incomes relative to an indicative benchmark position where the property value increases but there is no change in the LPT rate charged.

This study found that, notwithstanding a significant increase in the take-up of electronic payments, cash remains a vital part of the Irish payment system. The study also concluded that a fully cashless society would not be an appropriate objective. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the specific recommendations set out in the report referred to by the Deputy, the quarterly Payments Monitor published by the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland shows that while the volume of ATM withdrawals has remained stable in recent years, the value of cash withdrawn from ATMs has recently been growing and is up 5.7 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  The report finds that cashback in shops is currently only common practice in 11 EU Member States and recommends that it be promoted.

The impacts of these were modelled and estimated in the joint research which was published in March this year. <\/p><p>Under these scenarios, over the medium-term (i.e. 5 years) the level of GDP would be of the order of between 1.9 and 3.3 per cent lower, respectively, compared to a situation where the UK remains in the EU. The negative impacts will be most severely felt in those sectors with strong export ties to the UK market &ndash; such as the agri-food, manufacturing and tourism sectors and also SMEs generally &ndash; along with their suppliers. The impact will be particularly noticeable outside the main cities.<\/p><p>My Department will continue to monitor developments with respect to the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement, and the future relationship with the UK, and will update the macroeconomic and fiscal projections to take account of any developments in the Spring of next year at the latest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300059#WRA04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Unions","counter":64,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300059#WRA04650"},{"type":"question","counter":65,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[46689\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300059#WRA04700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the way in which the industrial funding levy on credit unions will be applied in the coming years; if he will consider exempting credit unions from the levy in view of their social impact; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":66,"content":"<p>Since 2004, the amount of the levy payable by a credit union has been capped at a rate of 0.01 per cent of its total assets as at 30 September of the previous year. The balance of regulatory costs has been funded by the Central Bank in accordance with the provisions of the Central Bank Act, 1942 (as amended). The cost of regulating the credit union sector has increased over recent years with the emergence of the necessity to increase the intensity of supervision of this sector. Given that total assets of the sector have remained relatively static, this has resulted in a significant reduction in the proportion of the total cost of funding provided by the sector as a whole.  In 2018, the credit union sector contributed &euro;1.7 million (circa 9 per cent of the total costs incurred in regulating the sector). <\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I approved the Central Bank request to recover 50 per cent of credit union costs on a phased basis, starting with a 20 per cent recovery rate for the 2019 levy, which will be levied on an arrears basis in 2020, moving to 35 per cent in 2020 (levied in 2021) and to 50 per cent in 2021 (levied in 2022).  In response to the Central Bank's request I also recommended that credit union contributions should not increase beyond the 50 per cent target until:<\/p>  <p>  a. The levy trajectory has reached the planned 50 per cent rate, at which time the impact on the viability of the sector will be better understood; and<\/p>  <p>  b. A public consultation regarding increasing the levy rate for credit unions beyond 50 per cent is undertaken, which would include a regulatory impact assessment of such a change on the sector.<\/p>  <p>  In contrast to this, recovery rates in 2018 for all other industry categories ranged from 65 per cent to 100 per cent, and  the Central Bank intends to increase all to 100 per cent funding over the next number of years.  <\/p>  <p>  Exemptions from levies result in a burden on the tax payer through state subvention.  Given that all other financial services sectors are at, or moving towards, 100% recovery, the move towards 50 per cent in respect of credit unions, with further increases at that time being subject to consultation and Ministerial approval, is measured and takes account of the role that credit unions play in Irish society. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy might also wish to note that the Department of Finance, in collaboration with the Central Bank, held a public consultation on potential changes to the Credit Institutions Resolution Fund Levy. Following this review I announced on 1 October 2019 a reduction in the levy rate which will result in a reduction of &euro;4 million per annum from &euro;9 million in 2019 to &euro;5 million from 2020, or 44 per cent reduction.    <\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Finance I have also reduced the Stabilisation Scheme Levy materially and since 2017 no further levies have been charged by the Credit Union Restructuring Board (ReBo). I have also committed to a further review of the Stabilisation Scheme in 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300059#WRA04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":67,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 58 to 60, inclusive, answered with Question No. 39.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cybersecurity Data","counter":69,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300060#WRB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":70,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[46551\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300060#WRB00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to a recent report by an organisation (details supplied) which states that there is increased vulnerability of payment systems to information technology failures and cyber attacks; his plans to ensure the integrity of payment systems here as businesses and public bodies move increasingly to electronic payments and towards a cashless society; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":71,"content":"<p>My officials were aware of the publication of this report. To first address the point about moving towards a cashless society, earlier this year I launched a study commissioned by my Department benchmarking Ireland&rsquo;s payment industry. That study found that cash remains a vital part of the Irish payment system and concluded that a fully cashless society would not be an appropriate objective.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to payment systems, I am informed by the Central Bank that Ireland&rsquo;s retail electronic payments are processed by pan-European based payment systems, primarily the Eurosystem&rsquo;s large value payment system TARGET2 and EBA Clearing&rsquo;s retail payments system STEP2.<\/p>  <p>  Both of these systems have high levels of reliability and resilience, resulting from the very high standards to which they are held. Both systems are subject to Eurosystem oversight, with the ECB having the leading oversight role. Both are assessed against the Systemically Important Payment Systems Regulation, which imposes strict requirements, including in relation to operational risk, business continuity, credit risk, liquidity risk, settlement finality, and participation default rules and procedures.<\/p>  <p>  From the perspective of the Central Bank&rsquo;s supervision of financial institutions that participate in the payments system in Ireland (i.e. banks, payment institutions, etc.), the risks associated with information technology and cyber-attacks are a key concern given the potentially serious implications for prudential soundness, consumer protection, financial stability and the reputation of the Irish financial system.   <\/p>  <p>  Strengthening the operational and cyber resilience of the financial system is a key priority for the Central Bank.  This includes enhancing the resilience of the firms within that system to operational disruptions due to information technology issues, particularly as these issues can negatively impact on consumers. <\/p>  <p>  The volumes of retail and wholesale payments settled daily are substantial, and issues occur from time to time. Where this happens, the vast majority are resolved within the business day. The Central Bank expects financial institutions to take all necessary steps to minimise the number of occurrences and, when they happen, to respond with appropriate urgency and to minimise the impact on consumers.

As the Deputy is aware, the pricing of insurance products is a commercial matter for insurers and neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, have any function in this matter.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products. Consequently, the Government cannot direct insurance companies to cover certain types of risk, such as those in the leisure sector.  <\/p><p>Unfortunately, there is no single policy or legislative &ldquo;silver bullet&rdquo; to immediately remedy this issue.  In addition, there are many constraints faced by the Government in trying to address it, in particular the fact that for constitutional reasons, it cannot direct the courts as to the award levels that should be applied and as set out above it cannot direct insurance companies as to the pricing level which they should apply.<\/p><p>I wish to emphasise however that insurance issues remains a priority for the Government. The Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG), chaired by Minister of State Michael D'Arcy, TD is continuing to work to implement the recommendations of both of its reports. Its most recent Progress Update was published in July and shows that the vast majority of recommendations and actions due by Q2 2019 have been completed.  To that end, some key achievements to date from the two reports, include the following:<\/p><p>- The enactment of the <i>Judicial Council Act 2019<\/i>, in July which provides for the establishment of a Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee to provide guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum;<\/p><p>- Reforms to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board through the <i>Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019<\/i>to strengthen the powers of PIAB around compliance with its procedures;<\/p><p>- Amendments to the <i>Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004<\/i>to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected;<\/p><p>- The establishment of the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank to increase transparency around the future cost of private motor insurance; the Central Bank is currently reviewing the possibility of expanding is scope to cover business insurance; and<\/p><p>- various reforms of how fraud is reported to and dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including increased co-ordination with the insurance industry, as well as the recent decision by the Garda Commissioner to develop a divisional focus on insurance fraud which will be guided by the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) which will also train Garda&iacute; all over the country on investigating insurance fraud, and the recent success under <i>Operation Coatee<\/i>, which targets insurance-related criminality.<\/p><p>I  believe that these reforms are having an impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from August show that the price of motor insurance is now 27.1% lower than the July 2016 peak).  The Government is determined to continue working to ensure that these positive pricing trends can be extended to other forms of insurance, including those relevant to businesses.  However, undoubtedly the single most essential challenge which must be overcome if there is to be a sustainable reduction in insurance costs particularly for businesses and other operators in the leisure sector is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions, and the establishment of the Judicial Council is crucial in this regard.<\/p><p>In conclusion, I would like to assure the Deputy that important reforms are taking place and that I am confident that if the level of awards are reduced, then the insurance cost and coverage issues that are being experienced by the leisure sector should recede.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300060#WRB00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Budget Contribution","counter":75,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300060#WRB00550"},{"type":"question","counter":76,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[46024\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300060#WRB00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the expected annual increase in the net financial contribution by Ireland to the EU if the UK leaves the EU by the 31 January 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":77,"content":"<p>Given that the UK represents one of the largest net contributors to the EU Budget, Brexit is likely to have a significant impact on the contributions of all Member States, including Ireland&rsquo;s.

In respect of credit applications, the information in this part will include the type of loan product sought and the amount involved.  (However, it should be noted that information on credit reports simply records the fact that a credit application has been made and that it does not record whether or not a credit application was approved by a lender or not taken up by the borrower; furthermore, in respect of credit applications, the name of the lending institution to which a credit application was made will be displayed only on the credit report requested by the borrower).

The Central Bank advises that there is no information to suggest that any individual borrower has been disadvantaged as a result of this incident.  A borrower who believes that they may have been disadvantaged should contact the lender in question to discuss the matter. As already stated, borrowers can also request their credit report free of charge at www.centralcreditregister.ie.

The Central Bank expects that lenders have robust systems and controls in place to ensure the integrity of the data that they submit to the CCR.

Lenders may under data protection provisions also be required to write to customers explaining what has happened and what action they have taken to correct the errors. This may also require a report being made to the Data Protection Commission by the lender.  Private credit bureau operators, which do not fall within the statutory or regulatory remit of the Minister or Central Bank, are nevertheless also subject to these general data protection legislation and requirements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300060#WRB00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Help-To-Buy Scheme","counter":81,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300060#WRB00950"},{"type":"question","counter":82,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[45239\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300060#WRB01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his Department has carried out a study regarding the effectiveness of the help to buy scheme.","asker":"1433","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":83,"content":"<p>In 2017 I commissioned and published an independent review of the Help to Buy (HTB) incentive and last year, I commissioned an independent Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) of HTB.

","asker":"1319","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":86,"content":"<p>I assume from the details accompanying his question that the deputy is primarily referring to natural persons acting as landlords and income tax based measures. <\/p>  <p>  The Report of the Working Group on the Tax and Fiscal Treatment of Landlords examined the general issue raised in the Deputy's question.  It was submitted to me for consideration in September 2017, in advance of its publication on Budget Day, 10 October 2017. The report put forward options for further consideration, rather than recommendations, and any further consideration would require the participation of several Departments and organisations, including my own Department. The ten options are split into short, medium and long-term options. Five potential short-term options were identified as measures which could potentially be implemented within 18 months, i.e. within Budgets 2018 and 2019.<\/p>  <p>  One short-term option was to increase the mortgage interest deduction available to landlords.  In this context, it should be noted that in Budget 2017, a phased unwinding of the restriction on interest deductibility over five years for all residential landlords was initiated. The second step, an increase from 80% to 85% deductibility, took effect from 1 January 2018.  Budget 2019 accelerated progress in this area and, from 1 January 2019, the restoration of full mortgage interest deductibility for landlords of residential property has been in place. <\/p>  <p>  A further option was to consider introducing Local Property Tax (LPT) deductibility for landlords. Earlier this year, the report of the interdepartmental review of LPT noted that LPT is a relatively small expense and therefore is unlikely to make a significant difference to the position of any individual landlord in cash terms and so may not be regarded by landlords as a sufficient measure to encourage them to stay in or enter the rental market. The report also found that the measure would also have a deadweight cost in respect of landlords who do not intend to leave the rental market and would create a more favourable position for landlords of property compared to owner-occupiers, as owner-occupiers cannot claim a tax deduction for LPT. <\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2018 I introduced another of the short-term options, deductibility for pre-letting expenditure for previously vacant properties. This measure applies to residential premises which have been vacant for at least 12 months and which are then let after the date of the passing of the Finance Act 2017, i.e. after 25 December 2017. The expenditure is allowed as a deduction against rental income from that premises. It applies to expenses that would be allowable if they had been incurred while the property was let, such as the cost of repairs, insurance, maintenance and management of the property.  Certain limitations are in place regarding this measure, for example the expenditure must have been incurred in the 12 months before the premises is let as a residential premises.  The total deduction allowed is capped at &euro;5,000 per vacant premises and the deduction will be clawed-back if the property ceases to be let as a residential premises within four years of the first letting. I prioritised this option as it was specifically designed to encourage an overall increase in housing supply by bringing currently vacant property back into residential use.<\/p>  <p>  The final short-term option was to improve the collection and sharing of data on the rental accommodation sector.  A significant issue that hampered the progress of the Working Group was a lack of robust data on various elements of the housing market, due to the differing metrics used by the various agencies. The Housing Analytics Group, chaired by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, is currently active and a number of Departments and agencies are involved in its work, including the Residential Tenancies Board, the Central Statistics Office (CSO), Revenue and the Department of Finance. <\/p>  <p>  Five of the options put forward in the report were medium-term and long-term options. Medium-term options are measures which work with the current tax system but might take longer to develop and implement, and as such would require a longer lead-in period. The long-term options look at the potential for more fundamental changes to the tax system, and so would require significantly greater resource commitments to progress.  Consideration of these options will continue within the relevant time frames.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, taxation is only one of the policy levers available to the Government through which to boost rental and overall housing supply and that, in line with the Tax Expenditure Guidelines, consideration of whether a tax measure is the most appropriate policy tool for a given purpose would be required. Ireland&rsquo;s past experience with tax incentives in the housing sector strongly suggests the need for a cautionary stance when considering intervention in the rental sector. There are many competing priorities which must be considered when deciding which policy measures to introduce and the rental sector is just one of many other sectors that may require assistance and intervention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300060#WRB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Operations","counter":87,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300060#WRB01350"},{"type":"question","counter":88,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[46688\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300060#WRB01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the expected NAMA surplus to be transferred to the Exchequer in 2020; the way in which it will be utilised; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":89,"content":"<p>As part of its Annual Report for 2018, NAMA revised its projected surplus to be returned to the State upwards to &euro;4 billion.

The new rules require insurers to provide policyholders with details of the prior year&rsquo;s premium paid, as well as quotations for each policy option available to them (such as comprehensive, third party fire and theft and third party only). In addition, the renewal notification period has been extended from 15 to 20 working days for motor, health, property and general liability insurance to allow policyholders more time to seek comparison quotes The background to these new rules is a recommendation from the Cost of Insurance Working Group Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance and the changes have been made through amendments to the Non-Life Insurance (Provision of Information) (Renewal of Policy of Insurance) Regulations 2007 (S.I.

This Bill has various provisions aimed at increasing transparency in premiums charged and the management of claims.  A notable change, which is based on a recommendation of the Cost of Insurance Working Group, will be the requirements for insurers to inform policy holders, including small businesses, in circumstances where a claim has been made against them by a third party.

These are separated based on whether a borrower is a first-time buyer (FTB) or not. For FTBs, 20% of new lending to FTBs can take place above the 3.5 times LTI limit. As the 90% LTV limit is already set higher for FTBs, only 5% of new lending to FTBs can exceed this limit. These allowances are targeted to FTBs in that they can only be used for FTB lending. Separate allowances exist for second-time buyer (SSB) new lending. <\/p>  <p>  Within the FTB allowances, there are no rules in place around which types of FTB borrowers would receive the allowances. This is a matter for individual lenders, based on an evaluation of each specific borrower and the lender&rsquo;s own credit policies.

I have no role in the day to day workings of the office or in the decisions which he takes.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Act 2017 which commenced on 1 January 2018 established the Office of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman. <\/p>  <p>  One of the main roles of the Ombudsman is to investigate, mediate and adjudicate complaints about the conduct of financial or pension service providers. The FSPO was established to provide an alternative to the Courts for consumers who have unresolved disputes with a financial or pension service provider and all investigations by the Ombudsman are free of charge to the consumer.  Subject only to an appeal to the High Court, a finding of the Ombudsman in respect of a complaint is legally binding on all parties <\/p>  <p>  The FSPO has advised me that the office has an important role in redressing the balance of power between the individual consumer and provider. The FSPO does this by making its service as informal and accessible as possible. It mediates between the parties and where necessary it investigates and issues legally binding decisions. The Ombudsman has the power to direct a financial service provider to pay compensation of up to &euro;500,000 to a complainant. He can also direct that a financial service provider rectify the conduct that is the subject of the complaint. There is no limit to the value of rectification he can direct. <\/p>  <p>  The FSPO&rsquo;s Strategic Plan 2018-2021 aims to ensure it operates in a way that contributes to promoting the best interests of consumers and actual or potential beneficiaries of financial or pension services in the efficient and effective handling of complaints.  The FSPO inherited 3,178 complaints from its predecessor bodies and received 5,692 complaints in 2018. It closed 4,443 complaints in 2018 leaving a balance of 4,427 complaints on hand at the end of 2018. Such high volumes of complaints cause the FSPO to be unable to process complaints as quickly as it would wish to. <\/p>  <p>  The FSPO&rsquo;s Strategic Plan recognised the increasing number of complaints and anticipates a further increase in the coming years. The overall objective of this Plan is to ensure that the organisation can deal efficiently with this increase and to enhance the experience of its customers by delivering its services faster and better. In order to deliver the objectives in its Strategic Plan the FSPO submitted a Workforce Plan to my Department and I approved the recruitment of an additional 35 staff earlier this year. <\/p>  <p>  The FSPO has been proactively recruiting to fill these posts. However, similar to many public sector bodies, the current buoyant job market is making it difficult for the office to retain staff.  This is mainly because the FSPO&rsquo;s highly trained staff are much sought after in both the public and private sector. The FSPO inherited 53 staff from its predecessor bodies in January 2018. However, despite recruiting and appointing additional 42 staff since then, it currently has 59 staff.<\/p>  <p>  The Ombudsman has further informed me that additional staff will be joining it before the end of the year and that he will continue to recruit and train quality people to assist it to deliver on its mandate. The FSPO will continue to provide the most effective and efficient service possible in spite of the staff losses within the office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300060#WRB03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":120,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300060#WRB03650"},{"type":"question","counter":121,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[46527\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300060#WRB03700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 50 of 26 September 2019, the way in which he can address the unfairness for persons cohabiting, in many cases in long-term relationships, and those without children through other possible measures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1291","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":122,"content":"<p>I am aware of the points raised by the Deputy in her Parliamentary Question of 26 September, 2019 and in her correspondence which has been received in my Department with regard to the operation of Capital Acquisitions Tax.  <\/p>  <p>  For the purposes of Capital Acquisitions Tax, the relationship between the person who provides the gift or inheritance and the person who receives the gift or inheritance determines the lifetime tax-free threshold (the Group Threshold) below which gift or inheritance tax does not arise. As Capital Acquisitions Tax is generally payable by the beneficiary, rather than the disponer, the system promotes horizontal equity in that all individuals with similar circumstances are treated in a similar manner.<\/p>  <p>  It is a long-held principle of inheritance tax that transfers of assets between spouses are exempt. The spousal exemption from inheritance tax was extended to civil partners from 1 January 2011.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the gifting of a shared home, the treatment of gifting was amended substantially in the 2016 Finance Act. In general, it is now only possible to receive a tax-free gift of a dwelling house where it is gifted to a dependent relative.  A dependent relative is a direct relative of the donor, or of the donor&rsquo;s spouse or civil partner, who is permanently and totally incapacitated because of physical or mental infirmity from maintaining himself or herself or who is over the age of 65. This change was made to restore the original policy aim of the relief. <\/p>  <p>  Gifts are generally taxable in the same way as inheritances. There is an annual &euro;3,000 CAT relief available to all recipients of gifts.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the treatment of individuals with no children, gifts or inheritances from them are subject to either category B or C thresholds irrespective of their individual status. There would be a significant potential Exchequer cost with any extension of the Category A threshold to allow individuals with no children to nominate a potential beneficiary of their estate.  <\/p>  <p>  There are some CAT reliefs which are available for co-habiting couples. Cohabiting individuals can avail of the &lsquo;dwelling house exemption&rsquo; to bequeath their principal private residence, generally the most substantial asset owned by an individual, free from inheritance tax which allows for property to be inherited tax-free irrespective of its value where the beneficiary is already living in the house subject to certain conditions. <\/p>  <p>  Section 88A of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 exempts transfers of property made between qualified cohabitants within the meaning of Part 15 of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants (CPCROC) Act 2010. This is a redress scheme which provides protection in law for long-term cohabiting couples and provides safeguards for an economically dependent cohabitant where a relationship has ended, or on death.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of the exemption from gift tax and inheritance tax in these cases did not give cohabiting couples the same tax treatment as married couples or civil partners but simply legislated for the tax consequences of the redress arrangements for cohabitants under the CPCROC Act 2010.  <\/p>  <p>  I would say that any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples, including with respect to CAT, can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples. There would also be potentially significant Exchequer costs in changing the current CAT rules to accommodate the changes sought by the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300060#WRB03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs Availability","counter":123,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300060#WRB03850"},{"type":"question","counter":124,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[46496\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300060#WRB03900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider providing income tax relief for the long-term lease of residential homes to address security of tenure in view of the success of a similar measure in the agricultural sector under section 664 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 as amended by the Finance Act 2014; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1234","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":125,"content":"<p>I understand that the Deputy is proposing that income tax relief, similar to that which is provided for under Section 644 TCA 1997, would apply where landlords provide long-term leases of residential properties.  As the Deputy will be aware, decisions by me in relation to the Tax Acts are made in the context of the annual Budget and Finance Bill process. However, bearing in mind the issues outlined below, I am not minded, at this time, to support a proposal along the lines of that put forward in the Deputy's question.<\/p><p>Generally, rental income, after deduction of allowable letting expenses, is subject to tax as part of the total taxable income of a landlord. Individual landlords are subject to income tax on all their income combined, at the applicable rates, including USC and PRSI where appropriate.<\/p><p>Section 664 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (&lsquo;<i>relief for certain income from leasing of farm land<\/i>&rsquo;) provides for the exemption of certain income from the leasing of farm land, where the land is let under a qualifying lease. This particular relief was designed to encourage longer term leases of farm land, with the targeted policy objective of assisting with the mobility and productive use of agricultural land. <\/p><p>When considering the introduction of any tax expenditure measure, my officials undertake an evaluation of the proposal in accordance with the Department of Finance Tax Expenditure Guidelines. An evaluation will seek to address issues such as identification of the market failure, the policy rationale for intervention, cost, and whether a tax based measure is the most efficient form of intervention. With regard to the latter point, in many cases a market failure may be more appropriately remedied by a direct expenditure measure or through regulation. Other considerations include the potential for deadweight costs, the potential cost of the tax revenue foregone to the Exchequer and the scope for abuse. <\/p><p>Furthermore, Ireland&rsquo;s past experience with tax incentives in the housing sector strongly suggests the need for a cautionary stance when considering intervention in the rental sector. There are many competing priorities which must be considered when deciding which policy measures to introduce and the rental sector is just one of many other sectors that may require assistance and intervention. I must be mindful of the many demands on the Exchequer and the need to maintain a broad base of taxation.<\/p><p>Finally, as the Deputy may be aware, in Finance Act 2018, and with effect from 1 January 2019, I provided for the full restoration of the amount of interest that may be deducted by landlords in respect of loans used to purchase, improve or repair their residential property, as a means to support the rental sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300060#WRB04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Collection Forecasts","counter":126,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300060#WRB04050"},{"type":"question","counter":127,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[45802\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300060#WRB04100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to propose an annual review of performance of his Department in tax forecasting.","asker":"1361","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":128,"content":"<p>My Department periodically reviews its approach to tax forecasting, with the most recent full review published in 2008.<\/p>  <p>  A new review group has been established with a mandate to review and assess tax forecasting methodology over the past decade.

The forecast indicated that the European and the Euro Area economies have weakened over the past year, reflecting a considerable slowdown in external demand and contraction in the manufacturing sector.\u00a0\u00a0While the Euro Area is now in its seventh consecutive year of growth, with growth expected to continue in all Member States, this is at a considerably slower rate than earlier in the decade. European labour markets have remained strong and the unemployment rate has fallen to below its pre-crisis level, fuelling robust wage growth, allowing domestic demand to expand at a relatively steady pace. The labour market is expected to maintain this performance albeit at a slower pace reflecting the broader economy.<\/p>  <p>  The European economy is expected to enter a protracted period of subdued growth and low inflation. The Commission is forecasting Euro Area GDP to expand by 1.1 per cent in 2019 and by 1.2 per cent in 2020 and 2021. The GDP forecast for the EU28 is for growth of 1.4 per cent in 2019 and 2020.

The performance of individual Member States is diverging with some areas (e.g. Central and Eastern Europe, Malta, and Ireland) expanding faster than others (e.g. Italy, Germany).<\/p>  <p>  The Commission also identified a number of risks to future growth in its forecast, including; a less supportive external environment, persisting tension in the international trade environment, a slowdown in Euro Area manufacturing, and uncertainty related to Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  Member states promote stability and growth in their respective economies during the European Semester Cycle. The purpose of the cycle, commencing in November, is to provide a framework for coordination of economic policies and guidelines, delivered in the context of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) and Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure. In Spring\/Summer the Commission makes country specific recommendations based on EU member state plans for macroeconomic, budgetary, and structural reforms.

The nominal values of other key trading partner currencies (as the Euro) are determined by market forces. \u00a0The Commission forecasts are based on a standard technical assumption of unchanged interest and exchange rates from a given cut-off date.

Dedicated measures were announced in Budgets 2017, 2018 and 2019 including up to &euro;600 million that has been made available through the Future Growth Loan Scheme and Brexit Loan Scheme.

It is a matter for each credit institution to set its own lending and deposit rates having regard to cost and competitive considerations and also to make its own lending decisions. Neither I nor the Central Bank have a role in prescribing the interest rates that commercial lenders may charge on their loans, including mortgages, or\u00a0for deposits.<\/p><p>Part of the reason for\u00a0the differential between Irish mortgage rates and those in other countries is the relatively large historical loss experience in the Irish market during the financial crisis and the related legacy issues of non-performing loans, many of which remain on banks' book. Banks are required to make adequate provisions for such loans.<\/p><p>Banks are also required to hold an adequate level of capital against mortgage lending. These capital requirements are calculated with reference to historical loss and default rates with the result\u00a0that Irish banks are required to hold relatively more capital for new mortgage lending than many of their European peers, in some cases substantially more capital.\u00a0 <\/p><p>In addition to their capital requirements, banks are also required to build up additional capital to meet regulatory capital buffers such as the countercyclical capital buffer which is intended to ensure banks can withstand future adverse economic shocks.<\/p><p>The impact of these capital requirements is reflected in the\u00a0interest rates charged\u00a0for mortgages in Ireland.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>Furthermore, the Irish banking system continues to hold a large amount of lower yielding tracker mortgages on their balance sheets and there is currently a high level of concentration in the market for new mortgage credit.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The Central Bank has introduced a number of changes to the Consumer Protection Code that are designed to help consumers make savings on their mortgage repayments; for example, provision 6.5 (g) of the Code now requires lenders at least annually to, inter alia, notify their variable interest (other than tracker) mortgage customers whether they can move to a cheaper interest rate as a result of a change in their loan to value interest rate band and, if the customer is permitted to move, to invite the borrower to contact the lender to discuss the matter.\u00a0 If the consumer is not permitted to move to a lower loan to value band with a lower interest rate, the consumer is nevertheless to be notified that he\/she may be able to avail of a lower loan to value interest rate band from another lender based on an up to-date valuation of the property.\u00a0 It should also be noted that the Central Bank macro prudential loan to value and loan to income residential mortgage lending restrictions do not apply to switcher mortgages.

The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework, aimed specifically at the process to be followed by relevant firms, to ensure borrowers in arrears or pre-arrears in respect of a mortgage loan secured on a primary residence are treated in a timely, transparent and fair manner.<\/p>  <p>  Banks, retail credit firms and credit servicing firms are all required to comply with the CCMA.\u00a0 The overriding objective of the CCMA is to ensure the fair and transparent treatment of consumers in mortgage arrears or pre-arrears, and that due regard is had to the fact that each case of mortgage arrears is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits.\u00a0 The CCMA recognises that it is in the interests of borrowers and regulated firms to address financial difficulties as speedily, effectively and sympathetically as circumstances allow. It sets out the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), a four-step process that regulated entities must follow:<\/p>  <p>  Step 1: Communicate with borrower;<\/p>  <p>  Step 2: Gather financial information;<\/p>  <p>  Step 3: Assess the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances; and<\/p>  <p>  Step 4: Propose a resolution<\/p>  <p>  The arrears handling provisions in Chapter 8 of the Consumer Protection Code (the Code) apply when the loan is not a mortgage loan to which the CCMA applies.\u00a0 Amongst other protections, the Code requires that where an account is in arrears, a regulated entity must seek to agree an approach that will assist the personal consumer in resolving the arrears. <\/p>  <p>  Most loan agreements include a clause that allows the original lender to sell the loan on to another firm. When a loan is sold, the relevant Irish and EU consumer protections continue to apply.\u00a0Under the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2018, which came into effect on 21 January 2019, if a loan is transferred, the holder of the legal title to the credit must now be authorised by the Central Bank as a credit servicing firm.\u00a0 Such credit servicing firms must act in accordance with Irish financial services law that applies to &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo;.\u00a0 This ensures that consumers, whose loans are sold to another firm, maintain the same regulatory protections that they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory Codes of Conduct issued by the Central Bank, such as the Code and the CCMA.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank carries out its supervision of regulated entities, including banks, retail credit and credit servicing firms in a number of ways, which includes both desk based and on-site reviews of various activities. In\u00a0early 2018, I requested the Central Bank to review the CCMA to ensure it remains as effective as possible in the context of the sale of loans by regulated lenders. In November 2018, the Central Bank published a report on this matter. <\/p>  <p>  The review concluded that the CCMA is effective and working as intended in the context of the sale of loans, for borrowers who engage with the process. There was no evidence that retail credit and credit servicing firms do not engage with borrowers in arrears. When a loan is sold by a bank, any existing Alternative Repayment Arrangements (ARAs) in place with a borrower under the CCMA continue to be honoured until the agreed term of the ARA ends. There was no evidence that borrowers, whose circumstances have not changed, were being moved off existing ARAs by retail credit and credit servicing firms during the term of the ARA. There was no material difference in the level of repossessions by retail credit and credit servicing firms compared to banks.<\/p>  <p>  As a follow-up action to the Report on the CCMA, the Central Bank wrote to banks, retail credit and credit servicing firms in August 2019 to set out its expectations of all firms in respect of loan sales. These expectations include that:<\/p>  <p>  - Sufficient due diligence and information sharing takes place at the outset to ensure that complete customer files transfer as part of a loan sale.<\/p>  <p>  - Where a cooperating borrower is complying with the terms of an ARA and their loan is sold, the new regulated entity cannot unilaterally change the ARA.<\/p>  <p>  - The new regulated entity should continue to honour an ARA until review, expiry or by agreement, as appropriate. This includes honouring timelines and terms and conditions for reviews of the ARA.<\/p>  <p>  - Where the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances have changed, any change to the ARA must be appropriate, sustainable and proportionate to that borrower&rsquo;s circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300061#WRC05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Price Inflation","counter":193,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300061#WRC05900"},{"type":"question","counter":194,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[46885\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300061#WRC06000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which his Department continues to monitor specific inflationary tendencies within the economy, including inflated rental prices; his plans to address such issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":195,"content":"<p>Irish inflation has been subdued for a number of years.

In addition, the next periodic review of civil service mileage rates is scheduled to take place in 2020 and all relevant factors will be taken into account in the context of this review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300062#WRD00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff","counter":203,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300062#WRD00800"},{"type":"question","counter":204,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[46830\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300062#WRD00900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the number of times consent has been sought and-or given under the terms of circular 109\/247\/7417 of 17 October 2011 for public servants to undertake paid work, in addition to their own salary, in each of the years 2012 to 2018 (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":205,"content":"<p>My officials have reviewed records held in my Department and I can confirm no records have been found of requests seeking sanction for public servants to undertake paid work, in addition to their own salary, in each of the years 2012 to 2018. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to be aware that in a number of cases, third level institutions were recompensed by various public service bodies for the time given up by an academic staff member while sitting on a State board. \u00a0In such cases, the college was compensated and not the individual.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300062#WRD01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Redeployment","counter":206,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300062#WRD01100"},{"type":"question","counter":207,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[46840\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300062#WRD01200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the steps he is taking to facilitate more civil servants who wish to locate out of Dublin to other locations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":208,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[46841\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300062#WRD01300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the steps he is taking to encourage greater mobility within the wider public service; the progress made in 2018 and to date in 2019 to achieve same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":209,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 107 and 108 together.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Civil Service Mobility scheme which comes under the remit of my Department, and is administered through HR Shared Services, National Shared Services Office, offers an opportunity for staff members to apply for mobility through an open and transparent system. The establishment of the scheme fulfils one of the requirements of Action 15 of the Civil Service Renewal Plan; and Action 14 of the People Strategy for the Civil Service.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme is being introduced on a phased basis. Phase 1 of the scheme went live in 2018 and 2019. This phase is for the general Civil Service grades of Clerical Officer (CO) and Executive Officer (EO) to apply for mobility between and within 46 zones. The location choices for the scheme are based on mobility zones (46 zones) rather than by county or province.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  There has been a high level of interest in the scheme with c.4,700 staff members (24% of the total participating grades) applying for a move through the scheme with:<\/p>  <p>  - the majority of applicants c.2,860 applying for a move either within a regional zone or between regional zones;<\/p>  <p>  - c.1,040 of the applicants applying to move from Zone 46 (Dublin) to a regional location &ndash; representing 12% of the staff in the participating grades in Zone 46;<\/p>  <p>  c.800 staff based in Zone 46 applying for Mobility within the same Zone.<\/p>  <p>  Over 350 moves have taken place since the scheme went live with other moves currently in progress.<\/p>  <p>  Plans are in place to extend the scheme in 2020 to include the grades of Higher Executive Officer, Administrative Officer and Assistant Principal. When this process is complete, mobility will be in place for general Civil Service grades from Clerical Officer up to Principal Officer. <\/p>  <p>  The scheme provides for cross organisational moves within a location that were not previously possible under the former transfer mechanisms that it has replaced. This means that staff members are given opportunities to work closer to home and also to further their career development. The mobility of experienced staff members across the system also supports the business needs of Civil Service organisations.<\/p>  <p>  To date, it should be noted that approximately\u00a075% of the applicants\u00a0have initially declined an offer to move to a zone that they selected as their preferred location.\u00a0This would suggest that\u00a0the actual number of staff members who\u00a0would move from Dublin to other zones is lower than the\u00a0number of current applicants [c.1,040].\u00a0 We will continue to monitor this trend.<\/p>  <p>  Following the full roll out of the Civil Service Mobility Scheme, it is the intention to review and extend mobility over time to provide additional development opportunities and enable greater mobility across the Public Service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300062#WRD01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Programmes","counter":210,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300062#WRD01600"},{"type":"question","counter":211,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[46886\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300062#WRD01700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the issues involving the INTERREG 111a Programme 2000-2006, priority 2, measure 3: renewable energy and an application by a company (details supplied); if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the Belgian public prosecutor has opened a file regarding allegations of fraud against the programme; and if he will consider registering an interest in the investigation with a view to assist if necessary.","asker":"1291","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":212,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the INTERREG IIIA programme (2000-2006) was an EU co-funded cross-border cooperation programme between Ireland and Northern Ireland.\u00a0 The company in question proposed a project for funding under Priority 2 Measure 3 of the INTERREG IIIA Programme in April 2003.\u00a0 I understand that the project proposal was subsequently appraised and an offer of funding was made, subject to certain conditions.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  However, the company in question did not accept the offer of funding, and the project did not proceed under the INTERREG IIIA Programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300062#WRD01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":214,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300062#WRD02000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation Provision","counter":213,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300062#WRD01900"},{"type":"question","counter":214,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[46728\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300062#WRD02000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to arrange for the provision of cr&egrave;che facilities on the site for a new primary and post-primary school (details supplied) alongside the schools in view of the need in the area for childcare places; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1242","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":215,"content":"<p>My Department&rsquo;s responsibility is to provide sufficient accommodation to meet 20,000 new and replacement school places each year to ensure that every child has a school place.

A detailed Annual Report from Garda&iacute; on crimes involving racism<\/p><p>2.  The systematic monitoring and\u00a0reporting of cases involving racism by the Courts Service<\/p><p>3.  Additional resources for the\u00a0Garda&iacute; and the training of &lsquo;ethnic liaison officers&rsquo;<\/p><p>4.  Establishment of consultative\u00a0forums across all Garda Divisions to liaise with minority communities<\/p><p>5.  Initiatives to encourage reporting\u00a0of crimes<\/p><p>6.  Support for victims&rsquo; bodies\u00a0including adequate training<\/p><p>7.  The requirement for all local\u00a0authorities to include policies to address racism in their strategic\u00a0planning process.<\/p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that the majority of these recommendations have been implemented in the intervening period.<\/p><p>The Department keeps all legislation under review on an ongoing basis.<\/p><p>The review of the 1989 Act being conducted at present by my Department is designed to identify how our legislation on hate speech, including incitement to hatred, can be made fit for purpose in a modern democracy. This review is one part of a suite of measures which will include the development of new legislation on both hate speech and hate crime.<\/p><p>As part of the review, I launched a public consultation process on 24 October,\u00a0which is open and will gather the views of communities, experts and all interested persons on how our incitement legislation should be changed to make it fit for purpose. Details of the consultation are available on my Department&rsquo;s website. The consultation runs until 13 December 2019\u00a0and I encourage all those who wish to contribute to go to the Department&rsquo;s website at www.justice.ie for further information.<\/p><p>Separately to the work on incitement, my Department is finalising research on the effectiveness of the different legislative approaches to tackling hate crime in other countries, in order to learn from experience elsewhere and use this information to identify the approach that will be most suitable for Ireland. When this research has concluded I will bring forward proposals for new hate crime legislation. These will be published and the views of experts, communities and the public will be taken into account.<\/p><p>This work is complemented by the work of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, who are preparing legislation in relation to the regulation of tech companies in respect of harmful content. This provision for a regulator to oversee online safety, which has been widely discussed and is in line with the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission Report. This legislation is where issues such as codes of conduct for tech companies, requirements to put measures in place to deal with harmful content and so forth will be dealt with.<\/p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that this is a complex area but the approach being taken - including research and providing the opportunity for experts and\u00a0members of the public to provide their views through consultation\u00a0- will\u00a0help\u00a0to ensure that the legislation we develop will deliver a safer, fairer and more inclusive Ireland for everyone. <\/p><p>Finally, alongside the criminal law, my Department has also been responsible for bringing forward a number of inclusion strategies which are designed to promote equality and inclusion and to tackle discrimination and prejudice.\u00a0 These strategies include the Migrant Integration Strategy 2017-2020, the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021, the LGBTI+ National Youth Strategy 2018-2020 and the National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020. We will shortly launch a National LGBTI+ Strategy. The Progress Report for the mid-term review of the Migrant Integration Strategy identified the need for strong actions to combat racism and these are currently being advanced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300063#WRE05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","counter":314,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300064#WRF00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Strategy","counter":313,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300064#WRF00200"},{"type":"question","counter":314,"qnumday":144,"qnumall":"[46880\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300064#WRF00300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the degree to which her Department continues to monitor global trade or financial markets with a view to identifying opportunities to compensate for Brexit; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":315,"content":"<p>While the UK is and will remain a major market for Irish companies, expanding the Irish export footprint in markets beyond the UK is a key priority. In that context, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy is to support Irish exporters to be more innovative, competitive and market diversified. <\/p>  <p>  The Irish exporting landscape is strong and companies in Ireland are succeeding in winning business worldwide for their products and services.  Enterprise Ireland client companies achieved record levels of exports in 2018 of &euro;23.8bn, against the backdrop of Brexit uncertainty. In 2018, the Eurozone region, which is a key focus of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s diversification strategy, saw growth of 7.6% to &euro;4.8bn, with Germany, France and the Netherlands each exceeding &euro;1bn in exports.  Exports to North America increased from &euro;3.87bn in 2017 to &euro;4.08bn in 2018, an increase of 5.5%.  Our Enterprise agencies are now opening new offices around the world to support our companies in competing and thriving in global markets.  <\/p>  <p>  Ministerial-led Trade Missions support the Government's major drive towards market diversification.  The majority of trade missions are taking place to the Eurozone, North America and Asia Pacific, which represent the strongest growth opportunities for Irish companies.   These Trade Missions focus on promoting the innovative capabilities and competitive offerings of Irish companies to international buyers in sectors including internationally traded services, fintech, high-tech construction, engineering, ICT and lifesciences.<\/p>  <p>  As well as the global efforts supported by our agencies, key to our success has been our commitment to trade liberalisation in order to open new markets for our indigenous sectors. The EU has successfully concluded a number of important trade agreements with trading partners and is in the process of negotiating or upgrading its agreements with many more. The existing suite of EU Free Trade Agreements and new trade deals will continue to be very important for Ireland. With a small domestic market, further expansion in other markets is essential to our continued economic growth and, in this regard, Ireland will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements, opening new markets for Irish companies and increasing export and investment opportunities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300064#WRF00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":316,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300064#WRF00500"},{"type":"question","counter":317,"qnumday":145,"qnumall":"[46828\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300064#WRF00600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the funding available to a non-profit centre (details supplied) that wishes to expand to Letterkenny, County Donegal; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1250","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":318,"content":"<p>I am not aware of an application for funding from this body to my Department or its Agencies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300064#WRF00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Jobs Initiative","counter":319,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300064#WRF00800"},{"type":"question","counter":320,"qnumday":146,"qnumall":"[46656\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300064#WRF00900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if she will report on the launch of Future Jobs Ireland on 11 November 2019.","asker":"1224","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":321,"content":"<p>Some two hundred attendees from enterprises, representative bodies, academia, public sector and civil society attended the national Future Jobs Ireland Summit on 7th November in Tangent, TCD&rsquo;s Ideas Workspace.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach addressed the Summit which also featured a key note address by Ms Saadia Zahidi, Managing Director of the Centre for the New Economy and Society of the World Economic Forum.

Together with my Department and its enterprise Agencies, I am focused on strengthening investment and job creation all over the country. In 2018, 56% of all net new jobs created by IDA Ireland were in locations outside Dublin. Similarly, every region in Ireland, including the South-East region, posted net gains in jobs last year. <\/p>  <p>  When it comes to foreign direct investment (FDI), site visits do represent a valuable tool through which investors can be encouraged to invest in regional areas. However, as I have said before, site visit activity does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as a significant percentage of all new FDI comes from existing IDA client companies. In 2018, there were three site visits to County Wexford while Carlow and Kilkenny hosted seven and five site visits respectively. Site visits to these counties are trending in the right direction with four site visits to Wexford, seven site visits to Carlow and 12 site visits to Kilkenny as of the third quarter of this year. <\/p>  <p>  The overall outlook for FDI is positive for Wexford, Carlow and Kilkenny. In 2018, there was a 5% increase in employment by IDA client companies in Wexford with 152 net new jobs added last year. Carlow has witnessed a 31% increase in FDI employment with 275 net new jobs added last year. While there were no new FDI-supported jobs created in Kilkenny in 2018, it is encouraging to note a number of recent announcements by Security Risk Advisors and AB Agri with both companies planning to create 50 new jobs each.<\/p>  <p>  While progress has been made in helping to generating new investment in Wexford, Carlow and Kilkenny, the Government remains determined to attract more FDI to the South-East region.

For the purposes of\u00a0the departments activation services all long-term unemployed jobseekers on the Live Register, aged between 18 and 61 years old inclusive, are categorised into groups based on their duration of unemployment (e.g. 1- 2 years, 2 &ndash; 3 years etc.). Selection for referral to receive employment activation services from a JobPath provider is by means of system based stratified random sampling using these groupings; the objective being to ensure equity in selection and also that people referred to JobPath are a representative of the long term cohort on the Live Register.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The duration of a person's jobseekers claim is recorded in terms of days of unemployment, any two such periods not separated by more than 52 weeks are considered to be the same continuous period of unemployment - this is known as linking the claims. Long-term jobseekers that may have left the live register to go into employment for less than a year are still considered to be long-term if they reopen their claim within that 52 week period.<\/p>  <p>  The linking of claims allows the client to retain certain entitlements (for example no waiting days and other supplemental benefits) and they are also available for selection for activation services including JobPath. <\/p>  <p>  For those people who are referred to the JobPath service after a short period of work, the support and assistance of their personal advisor will ensure that the skills and experience they have gained in the job are built on if necessary and, that they are factored into all future job applications.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Between July 2015 and October 2019, some 244,219 jobseekers had commenced their engagement period with the JobPath service. Of this number some 33,360 or approximately 14% were working part time &amp;amp; in receipt of a jobseekers payment.<\/p>  <p>  JobPath is a payment by results model and all set-up and day-to-day operational costs are borne by the companies. JobPath providers receive a registration fee each time they register a jobseeker for the service. However the Jobseeker may be withdrawn from the service if they have a change of circumstances. Some common examples of a change of circumstances are for jobseekers to avail of a back to education opportunity or move to another payment, for example disability allowance, illness benefit or carer&rsquo;s allowance. If after their education course has finished they remain unemployed they may be re-registered to a JobPath provider.\u00a0 Clients who move address to an area operated by a different provider of the JobPath service will also be re-registered to the new JobPath provider. Registration fees are only incurred when a client engages with the JobPath service and agrees a personal progression plan. <\/p>  <p>  Between July 2015 and October 2019, 156,787 registration fees have been paid for clients who have been referred once. In the same time period 81,714 registration fees have been paid for 40,857 jobseekers who have had two referrals, of which 27,920 jobseekers were those referred after completing a full previous engagement with the service. The balance of 12,937, were withdrawn from JobPath due to their circumstances changing but subsequently re-referred as they reinstated their jobseekers claim. <\/p>  <p>  4,908 registration fees have been paid for 1,636 jobseekers who have had three referrals, of which 1,330 were those referred after completing two full previous engagements with the service.

As the Deputy is aware, my Department is committed to the active management of this species within the National Park and, as part of its regular ongoing management operations, carries out localised annual species' counts on State lands, where appropriate. A number of surveys, censuses and reports on the species population have been conducted in recent years, including a comprehensive survey and report in the winter of 2016 on the distribution, population density and population structure in Killarney National Park. This was followed by further census in both the spring 2017 and winter 2018.\u00a0 Preliminary reported results indicate that the population density of one breed is in the region of 11.31 per square kilometre (c. 896 ) and the density of the other breed \u00a0is in the region of 6.71 per square kilometre (c. 532 ). <\/p>  <p>  As a result of the  population increasing, certain management issues arise, such as culling. The animals have the potential to impact significantly on woodlands, including the iconic yew, oak and also wet woodlands within the Park, for example by bark stripping of mature trees and preventing regeneration. Therefore, where deer species are increasing in range and numbers, depending on the annual count and instances of damage caused by them to habitats, culls need to be carried out to ensure that populations do not reach levels that would have negative ecological consequences. More than 240 animals were culled between 2015 and 2018. The figures for the 2018-19 cull  totalled 272 animals which included both breeds. The cull for the 2019-2020 season is just underway in line with the current Open Season order. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy can see, our management of the species\u00a0in the National Park is extensive and appropriate. However, as I have repeatedly informed the Deputy, management of animals outside of the National Park and in the wider Killarney valley area is a matter for private landholders and culling and control  is not the responsibility of my Department, beyond the issuing of section 42 permits.<\/p>  <p>  While the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department licenses the hunting of the animals, the Department does not own the  population, they are wild animals and they roam freely throughout the countryside. Wild animals in the State are protected under the Wildlife Acts, however, there is an annual open season during which this species\u00a0can be legally shot under licence. The open season operates generally from the 1st September to the last day of February, depending on the species and gender. Landowners may also apply to the Department for a permission under section 42 of the Wildlife Acts to cull  where necessary outside the annual open seasons. These permissions offer a facility whereby a person can obtain a permit, on a case-by-case basis, to prevent serious damage caused by individual animals on specific lands. Permissions are only issued where there is evidence of such damage.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the issue of fencing Killarney National Park as I have previously outlined on several occasions, there are no plans to fence the National Park. Fencing is simply not a viable solution and would not achieve the desired results for a number of reasons. Firstly, the presence of the species is not confined to the National Parks and consequently fencing of these properties would serve no practical purpose in terms of wild deer control or management. Secondly, the Park is over 10.000 ha in size, including some rugged terrain. Fencing this area would be an enormous task that is unlikely to result in the desired objective. Thirdly, some smaller animals\u00a0are capable of going under fencing that is eight inches off the ground, while others are capable of knocking down fences. Finally, the erection of a fence this size could also impact on the sensitive habitats within the Park.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the issue of Road Safety, this is a matter for the Road Safety Authority and the relevant Local authority. Nevertheless, I am of the view that improving sight lines for motorists as well as improved (possibly larger) signage is likely to be the most effective measure to assist motorists to be vigilant when driving through areas where populations of the animals\u00a0can be expected. Officials from my Department have previously discussed this with Kerry County Council.<\/p>  <p>  To conclude, the Deputy can appreciate that species management is a complex and multi-faceted process. There is a significant challenge in attempting to balance the demands of agriculture, forestry and conservation with the need to ensure that  populations occupying the same land resources are managed at sustainable levels, and in a responsible and ethical manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111300068#WRK03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"}]
