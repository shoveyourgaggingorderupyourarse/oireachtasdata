In that time, I was involved in any amount of housing grant applications.  Although one did not always get the desired outcome, I never came up against a case as unfair and inexplicable as this one.  I do not say that lightly and, as the Leas-Chathaoirleach knows, neither am I in the habit of tabling Commencement matters on individual issues such as this.  The Minister of State's office has been advised of the particular and unique circumstances surrounding the application.  It is my hope that he will see how shabbily the lady in question and her loving and supporting family have been treated and that he will, even at this belated stage, intervene.<\/p> <p>The Government and everyone else in these Houses know full well that we are in a crisis as far as public housing is concerned.  The programme for Government sets as a high priority people who make a genuine attempt to house themselves, and rightly so.  Far too many go for the easy option of putting their names on a housing list and waiting until someone comes along and hands them the keys.  Many will refuse the first or second houses on offer for any variety of reasons until they get exactly what they want.  Their houses will be fully furnished and equipped and, for the rest of their days, they will be will be maintained to the highest possible standard and the people to whom I refer will never be burdened with worries about mortgage.  In the meantime while they wait, the State will assist them with all necessary supports, including rent allowance and income supplements.  We all know what a burden that is placing on the Exchequer and how it perpetuates an unending cycle where demand will always exceed supply.<\/p> <p>The lady in question chose another route - a more difficult and unselfish route.  With tremendous support, financial and otherwise, from her devoted parents and siblings, she went about housing herself.  She was fortunate enough to secure a suitable house adjacent to her family home.  For reasons that I will not put on the record but that are known to the Department, this was crucial, because her personal circumstances made proximity to her parents essential to her being able to achieve independent, stress-free living.  The house was purchased through a combination of family support and borrowing.  It is a wonderful listed building and she has restored it to its former beauty completely in line with Kerry County Council's regulations, which were stringent.  Prior to that, the building had become an eyesore in a lovely town that, as the Leas-Chathaoirleach knows, was this year's overall TidyTowns winner.<\/p> <p>The story of this application for State funding makes for sad and disappointing reading.  What was sought was recognition for her efforts and the fact that, instead of being a lifelong burden on the State, she just got on with the job of housing herself.  She would have been a very high priority for local authority housing at God knows what cost in perpetuity, but no.  She received a grant from Kerry County Council that would be deemed meagre under any circumstances, never mind in the context of her particular life history.  I have been involved in facilitating grants for housing renovations paid out to some of the State's wealthiest citizens, people for whom the grant was just a welcome bonus and not a necessity.  They were entitled to it and they got it, but that is not the point.  I have worked with the officials and staff of Kerry County Council my whole life.  No one admires them more.  They are helpful and diligent at all times, but in this case something seems to have gone radically wrong.  This has given rise to disappointment on my part in our local government system, with which I have been involved all my life.<\/p> <p>Will the Minister of State set an example?  He has reply that was prepared by civil servants but it is time that people in his position stand up and reward those who, like this young woman, want to help themselves.  He should find a way to address her case and afford her and her family some much-needed financial relief.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071000002#B00900","speaker":"1394"},{"type":"speech","time":1562751000,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Senator O'Sullivan for raising this case.  I also thank him for his honest appraisal of the housing situation and how, despite being potentially complicated, it can work in many cases and help people who choose a different route and try to help themselves.  There are systems and processes in place and it is important that we try to work within them.  That works two ways, of course, and everyone on both sides must play his or her part.  The Senator has given an honest description of the complications encountered in trying to house people.  While there is still a major housing shortage, a great deal of progress has been made in every county, including Kerry, where the county council is meeting its targets, delivering many new houses, buying and refurbishing many more and bringing others back into use.  There are many solutions.  In every debate on housing in this and the Lower House, I stress that there is more than one solution and approach to the question of social housing, for example, purchasing, new builds, Part V, leasing, voids being repaired and brought back into use, the repair and leasing scheme, and the buy and renew scheme.  There are many schemes, and I am glad that the majority of councils are beginning to avail of them.  That is what we want to do, but it means that we will have to adapt our ways as we see different and better solutions.  If they accommodate people, we will attempt them.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator O'Sullivan for raising this case and giving me the opportunity to provide an update insofar as my Department is concerned.  A representation regarding the case was received from the Senator and acknowledged by our Department in February.  There has been ongoing consultation since then between departmental officials and Kerry County Council on this and many other cases.  Where it makes sense and represents good value, every local authority is encouraged to acquire houses.  Sometimes, people approach me about other issues, but I wanted to be clear on that point.<\/p> <p>It is important that I indicate for the record that the detailed administration of the housing adaptation grants, including the assessment, approval and payment of individual grants to applicants, is the responsibility of the relevant local authority.  While officials at my Department oversee the national budget for this programme - we have increased the budget in recent years, including for this year - and work with our local authorities to ensure all funding is spent effectively and the grants are implemented fairly and consistently, it is logical that the local authorities make decisions locally, based on the guidelines set nationally, and use their local knowledge of individual applicants and their personal circumstances.  As a former councillor, Senator O'Sullivan will have tried to intervene down the years and bridge the information gap so that decision makers were not missing facts about cases.<\/p> <p>In this particular case, Kerry County Council assessed the proposal as a derelict cottage in need of significant reconstruction and funding of &euro;13,775 was awarded in October 2018.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=10\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The approach the council took in this case is in accordance with the guidelines.  However, the Department always emphasises to local authorities that they should make the best judgment in each case commensurate with the level of need and the circumstances of the applicant within the guidelines.<\/p><p>My Department raised this case with Kerry County Council, which agreed to revisit the application to consider other possible approaches to assessing the grant application concerned while remaining within the guidelines.  There is some challenge and complexity to the case.  The Senator referred to the purchase of a property, which can complicate application for certain grants because there are processes to be followed.  Everyone had the best of intentions in respect of the case, but matters can sometimes become a little complicated.  In the circumstances and based on the discussions between the council and my Department, I can assure the Senator that council officials will contact the applicant shortly to look at an alternative way to assess the housing adaptation grant application and see if there is a way to achieve a higher level of support.<\/p><p>The Senator outlined the details of the case and the amount of funding required.  He will appreciate that I cannot pre-empt the precise outcome, given that decisions on applications of this kind are a matter for the local authority and not my responsibility.  I am not allowed to intervene on any particular case and do not have the power to so do.  I assure him that the objective is to bring about the fairest possible outcome for the applicant and recognise the reality of the situation.  I trust that the prospect of a better outcome will satisfy the Senator for now, while allowing time for the council to re-examine the application.  I recognise his work on this matter in recent months.  I trust also that the follow-up by the council directly with the applicant will take place shortly such that the matter can be brought to a more satisfactory conclusion.  There are many solutions to housing.  Houses often need to be adapted because the residents may be of various ages and abilities.  We try to facilitate that as we want to make the best use of our housing stock.<\/p><p>I know Listowel quite well.  The Senator referred to it as a lovely town and clarified that the house in question is a listed building.  The town was recognised at the national Tidy Towns awards and I am aware of the work done there early in the morning and late into the night by its Tidy Towns committee and many others.  The preservation of houses and restoration of buildings within the town boundaries is to be encouraged.  We try to facilitate such works through the many grants that are available.  The grant in this instance is very often used to fund the adaptation of a house and is not essentially designed to be used for restoration.  However, we try to encourage the usage of grants for various purposes.  They are there to help people.  We will continue to increase the number of adaption grants made available in the years ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071000002#B01000","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562751000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reasonably satisfactory response, including scripted and unscripted comments, and his understanding of the uniqueness of the situation and the bigger picture.

The latter is a town in north County Dublin with a population of approximately 8,000.  I am one of the people who live there.  Donabate is expanding rapidly, with a significant amount of construction taking place.  There is planning permission for 900 homes, with many hundreds more to come.<\/p> <p>Last year, the Government announced plans for a new 16-classroom primary school for Donabate to open in September 2020.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, previously confirmed that the patronage of the school will be decided through a patronage process in consultation with patronage bodies and parents living in Donabate.  This will allow the parents of the area to give their preference on school patronage.  The three excellent primary schools in the town are an Educate Together school, a girls' Catholic school and a boys' Catholic school.  There is significant demand for a new school, given the level of construction and the growing and very young population in the area.<\/p> <p>The Minister previously confirmed that the patronage process would begin well in advance of the school year.  September is rapidly approaching, as is the beginning of the school year.  It is very important that the patronage process begin immediately because parents need time to plan and see what are the choices in the area in order to decide on their preferred schools.  It can be difficult to decide what is best for one's child and family.  In addition, parents need to prepare children for entering primary school.  It is a significant milestone.  As the mother of a child who is starting primary school in September, I know that one needs to prepare oneself and one's child for that significant transition.  The child needs to know where he or she is going to school and what will happen there.<\/p> <p>I ask the Minister of State to confirm when the patronage process for the new primary school in Donabate is due to start.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071000002#C00400","speaker":"1376"},{"type":"speech","time":1562751000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this very important matter.  I will respond on behalf of the Minister who cannot be present.  It gives me the opportunity to set out for the Seanad the position with regard to the patronage process for the new primary school in Donabate, County Dublin.  As the Senator may be aware, in April 2018 the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years, namely, 2019 to 2022, including a new 16-classroom primary school to be established in 2020 to serve the Donabate school planning area.  The announcement followed nationwide demographic exercises carried out by the Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country.  The four-year horizon enables increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure.<\/p> <p>A patronage process is run after it has been decided, on the basis of a demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  The process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons.  The preferences of parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned for each patron, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in respect of the outcome of the process.  The patronage process for new schools is overseen by an external independent advisory group, the new schools establishment group, NSEG.  Following its consideration of the Department&rsquo;s assessment reports, the NSEG submits a report with recommendations to the Minister for consideration and final decision.  The assessment reports and NSEG recommendations for all such patronage processes are made available on the Department&rsquo;s website.  An online patronage process system, OPPS, has been developed by the Department to provide objective information to all parents which will allow them to make an informed choice about their preferred model of patronage for their child&rsquo;s education.  Parental preferences were previously collected based on direct engagement with patron bodies.<\/p> <p>The patronage process for the new schools to be established in 2020, including the new primary school to serve the Donabate school planning area, will commence later in 2019.  The Minister asked me to highlight that the patronage process for the remainder of the new schools will be run at a later date which will be significantly ahead of their due opening.  Updates on further patronage processes will be announced on the OPPS website and the Department&rsquo;s website.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy John Halligan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2315\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2315&amp;amp;pid=JohnHalligan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=10\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The patronage process for the new schools to be established in 2020, including the new primary school to serve the Donabate school planning area, will commence later in 2019.

There were scheduling difficulties in the last couple of weeks in arranging for that.<\/p> <p>The Minister will be well aware of the motivation for tabling this Commencement matter.  The Irish Coast Guard does extremely valuable work.  The more than 700 volunteers who operate in the various Coast Guard stations around the country do vital work in supporting the emergency services.  They are available and on call 24-7, but they are not paid for doing the work as they are volunteers.  However, these people could find themselves on a search and recovery mission for days, at which point they must take leave from work.  They are using up their annual leave and in some cases are taking unpaid leave.<\/p> <p>Not all the 700 people are necessarily happy with the manner in which the Coast Guard does its business.  All of them are very dedicated and proud of the work they do, and the connectivity they have with the sea and with helping people is extremely admirable.  On many occasions they take their lives into their hands when they go out on both search and rescue and search and recovery missions.  My reason for tabling this matter is that every organisation has grievance mechanisms to deal with grievances and when the mechanisms in the organisations do not work there is usually an independent process as a last recourse.  People who are not satisfied they are getting a fair hearing within the structures that are available can appeal to the independent body.  Most people who are in employment are able to appeal to outside bodies.<\/p> <p>I am asking for a structure to be established under the auspices of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport whereby the few volunteers in the Coast Guard who have grievances and who are not satisfied with the manner in which their grievances have been dealt with can appeal to an independent body overseen by the Department.  I recommend that this be established and that it be headed by a retired High Court or Circuit Court judge.  The body would also be tasked with recommending improved practices in the Coast Guard.  I also recommend that this body should look at cases which have concluded where volunteers are not satisfied with the manner in which they have been dealt with.  There has already been a case where a volunteer ended up going to court and being reinstated by the court.  We do not wish to see that type of thing.  It was reported in the media recently.<\/p> <p>Essentially, I wish to enhance and improve the Coast Guard and to provide a mechanism within the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in which volunteers in the Coast Guard can feel confident that their grievances will be properly investigated and adjudicated.  As I said, these people are volunteers and are not paid.  That is a separate issue and I believe the country must examine that.  In this case, however, it is only reasonable that there would be an independent structure to which they could appeal, and that this independent structure would look at previous cases as well.  It is something that must happen and I urge the Minister to make it happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071000002#D00600","speaker":"1416"},{"type":"speech","time":1562751000,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Conway for raising this issue.  He is second to none in his respect and advocacy for the Coast Guard.  I salute the Coast Guard and the work it does.  We both want to see any grievances in the Coast Guard resolved in a way that is satisfactory, independent and fair.  We have met on many occasions to discuss this issue with the Irish Coast Guard.  On at least one occasion we met Bernard Lucas, the widower of Caitr&iacute;ona Lucas who died in a tragedy.  That was a particularly moving meeting and I hope the response I give today will be well received by him as well.<\/p> <p>Senator Conway has raised the concerns of a number of Coast Guard volunteers that existing procedures for handling grievances need to be improved.  The proposal to establish an independent body to deal with such grievances has been raised by the Senator.  To be clear, the number of grievance cases currently stands at three.  This represents less than 0.5% of the total volunteer cadre.  That is not to demean them in any way but just to point out that any response should be proportionate.  It is not in any way to denigrate the grievances or to make a judgment on them.  I wish to look closer at the manner in which grievances are currently managed in the Coast Guard.  The relevant key documents involving volunteers are the Irish Coast Guard code and the grievance and complaints procedures.<\/p> <p>Last year, the Coast Guard completed a review of the code.  It includes sections on performance management, disciplinary procedure and a positive volunteering environment.  This review was conducted with independent expert input from a human resources consultancy to ensure that the Coast Guard's processes were fair and fit for purpose for an organisation of its type.  The review also involved a consultation process with the volunteers which was managed through the coastal unit advisory group.  This group is a representative structure for the volunteers made up of six members elected by the units independently of full-time staff in the Coast Guard.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Shane Ross:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1974\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1974&amp;amp;pid=ShaneRoss&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=10\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The HR consultants recommended various modifications and a revised code was published late last year.  These independent experts confirmed that the code represented good practice, particularly given the voluntary nature of those involved. <\/p><p>In terms of grievances, all volunteers have access to a process to address issues about any aspect of their volunteer duties or how they are managed.  Volunteers who are unhappy in their role or have a grievance they wish to discuss may approach their designated line manager or where they do not wish to go that route, they can escalate their grievance to their coastal unit sectoral manager.  These are full-time staff in the Coast Guard.  The matter is dealt with in a private manner and in line with the Coast Guard's human resources standards.  Various checks are in place to ensure that where one or other party is not happy with how a grievance is being handled, he or she has recourse to independent mediation.<\/p><p>In terms of the independence of human resources processes within the Irish Coast Guard, the existing system has been enhanced over the past six months.  As mentioned, a human resources company has been procured to provide reassurance about the procedures and offer the aforementioned independent mediation, where requested.  This ensures a sufficient level of independence within the existing system proportionate to the level of grievances.  The Coast Guard management accepts that the new code will take time to bed down and, to this end, training is being organised at all levels throughout the organisation, including for volunteers.  The Coast Guard is also committed to reviewing its code on a regular basis.  In looking to further improve the system, the Coast Guard has recently created an additional external review process for volunteer grievance investigations, disciplinary and appeal processes.  This policy has been developed in the interests of ensuring that the principles of natural justice are upheld for volunteers involved in grievance investigations, disciplinary and-or appeal processes.  Under this new policy, the intention is to allow for a further external review of a case, whether grievance, disciplinary or appeal, to be conducted by a competent third party, most likely a HR company.  Its focus will be to determine whether procedures were followed correctly.  Such a review would be triggered where all other internal review options have been pursued.  A volunteer who requests such a review would, naturally, be informed of the outcome of the review and relevant findings.  Effectively, this new process will, hopefully, ensure a final independent arbitration relating to grievance and other processes or seen under the code.<\/p><p>The Coast Guard remains a vital component in our search and rescue service.  I reassure Senator Conway that its interests are at the core of the significant transformation that is taking place in the search and rescue system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071000002#D00700","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562751000,"counter":31,"content":"<p>Clearly, there have been some advances in the months since Christmas.

The fact that there are three formal grievance cases does not mean that other members of the Coast Guard who have not triggered formal complaints are happy and would not like to see the current system strengthened.  I request the Minister to instruct the Coast Guard to have the independent external body review all grievance cases closed in recent years to see if correct procedures were followed and make recommendations.

The medicine is used to treat advanced Parkinson's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder that affects 12,000 people in Ireland.  The uncertainty around the availability of this treatment option for people with advanced Parkinson's first arose in June 2018.  At that time, there was an expectation that certainty of supply would be achieved within three to four months.  In cases where patients were in critical need of this medicine it was made available through an access programme provided by AbbVie, the company that manufactures the medicine.  However, as of 30 April of this year, this route is no longer available to patients or treating consultant neurologists.  I understand that 81 patients were treated under this programme.  The 82nd patient and subsequent patients will be denied access to the treatment.  One such patient is a man from Cork who was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease at the age of 30.  He is now married with young children and is still in his 30s.  He is significantly affected by his condition and urgently needs to be treated with Duodopa now, not in one month or two months, to ensure he does not miss the window of opportunity during which the treatment can have its maximum benefit for him, as a patient who is suffering unnecessarily.  <\/p> <p>Last week, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE, stated on its website that the health technology assessment, HTA, for Duodopa had been completed, which is one year after the reimbursement ceased.  The issue needs immediate attention.  I ask the Minister of State and her ministerial colleagues to lend their support to ensuring this matter is expedited to ensure reimbursement for this medicine and equitable access to it.  People should not have to travel to the UK and beyond to access the deep brain stimulation, DBS, services as some people have been forced to do.  The Minister of State knows that Duodopa is a proven and tested product.  The positive impact it can have on patients and their carers is immeasurable.  Combining a  specialist nurse service with this treatment will keep patients out of hospital and, therefore, money is saved and space in hospitals is freed up. <\/p> <p>The costs of every other medicine for Parkinson's disease are covered.  Why is Duodopa not covered?  Patients do not opt for the treatment without first giving it great consideration and when it is not critically needed.  However, when it becomes necessary for patients to access this treatment, they must be able to do so.  The Minister of State will be aware of the procedure involved in taking this medicine.  The treatment requires the medicine to be administered through a patient's intestine and is unpleasant.  When there is no other option, however, this treatment becomes necessary.  We urgently need a timeline or date for when we can expect to see a long overdue decision on Duodopa.  There are a number of patients for whom this medicine provides a lifeline and constitutes their only sense of hope.  The matter is, therefore, urgent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071000002#E00900","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1562751000,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this Commencement matter today.  Unfortunately, the Minister for Health cannot be here, so I will take this opportunity to clarify his position on the availability of levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel, LCIG, for patients with advanced Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.  As the Senator may know, the HSE has been given statutory responsibility for medicine pricing and reimbursement decisions by the Oireachtas, under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  That Act specifies criteria for decisions on whether the State will reimburse medicines, a statutory process in which the Minister for Health has no role.  The HSE's decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, including on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE.  The NCPE conducts health technology assessments, HTAs, for the HSE, and then makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions.  The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess a drug&rsquo;s clinical and cost effectiveness as a health intervention.  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible.  However, because of the significant moneys involved, it must ensure the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro ongoing investments.  This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.<\/p> <p>On 14 June 2019, the NCPE completed an HTA on LCIG for patients with advanced Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.  The NCPE recommended that LCIG should not be considered for reimbursement, unless cost-effectiveness can be improved relative to existing treatments.  That recommendation is available on the NCPE website.  The HSE&rsquo;s final decision on reimbursement will take the statutory criteria in the 2013 Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act into consideration.  Under an interim agreement between the HSE and the manufacturer, dating back to 2014, the HSE has agreed to fund this drug for up to 81 patients.  The manufacturer agreed to fund the treatment of any new patients above that cap through a medical access programme.  This interim agreement was dependent on the manufacturer delivering two things, namely, additional clinical evidence and a new HTA dossier to enable the NCPE to complete a full HTA on this product.  However, the HSE has informed the Department that the manufacturer has unilaterally set aside this agreement.  Furthermore, the company announced that it would not be enrolling any new patients in the free of charge access programme after 30 April 2019, which the Senator has already mentioned.  The manufacturer stated that it would continue to provide the drug free of charge to patients already on the access programme, which is a total of 24 patients.  I want to make it clear to the Senator that the HSE has yet to make a final decision on this reimbursement application and the statutory process is still ongoing.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071000002#F00100","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1562751000,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her response.

I cited the example of the 30 year old patient earlier.  We are not playing with numbers here, but with people's lives.  If the HSE sits down with the manufacturer and works out a price, then it can be agreed, as has happened in many other cases.<\/p> <p>The effectiveness of the drug treatment is borne out by the fact that it is approved in other countries.  It cannot be different for an Irish person living in London or somewhere else in the UK than it is for someone living here.  We cannot force patients to go abroad.  I am no friend of drug manufacturers, and they need to decrease their prices, but we cannot expect them to continue providing treatment free of charge indefinitely either.  There has to be some fairness there.  I ask the HSE to sit down with the drug company at the earliest possible moment and negotiate the price, within weeks rather than months.  I am concerned that we are now going into the holiday period.  Is there is any way this could be done before the end of July, so that the uncertainty will be removed for these patients going into August and September?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071000002#F00200","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1562751000,"counter":41,"content":"<p>The Parkinson's Association of Ireland, among other groups, has been in contact with the Minister.

Accordingly, the HSE alone will make the final decision on whether LCIG will be reimbursed.

I asked previously that the Minister come to the House to specifically speak about pensions because there is so much to discuss in that regard and a significant number of people who are living in poverty.  Different circumstances such as health, geographical location and carer's duties mean that the standard amount simply does not suffice for pensioners.  I previously gave the example of a pensioner who has to travel from Belmullet to Galway for a hospital appointment.  That is a six-hour round trip and it costs more than &euro;200 in a taxi.

The North was in advance of us at that stage and it is regrettable that this has been let lie.

We were discussing the use of the Seanad Chamber.  I fully approve of Travellers and I have a track record in the area.  However, I do not approve of subsidiary sections dislodging the proper business of the Seanad.  The heckling from the Leader dislodged me from a point I was trying to make, namely, that one of the important points that was being debated at the time was the non-representation in the Oireachtas of the Traveller community.  I speak from experience; it took me ten years and six elections, including by-elections to get elected, because people were suspicious of me.  Travellers are a minority and, sadly, they are not universally popular.  It will take quite a while to get somebody from the Traveller community elected to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I strongly suggest that after the next election the Taoiseach of the day, whoever he or she is, make a deliberate decision to appoint somebody from that community as a first stage.  I have a candidate in mind, namely, Rosaleen McDonagh, who is not only a Traveller and a very effective spokeswoman for Travellers, but she is also handicapped.  She is in a wheelchair.

We are delighted to have them here today and I hope they have a lovely day.  Today I want to talk about the general data protection regulation, GDPR, which is a year old this month.  A most complex piece of legislation, the regulation was an attempt to unify existing legislation enacted after the 1995 directive across the European countries.  This regulation was designed to guide organisations across the EU on how to protect the personal data of each citizen.<\/p> <p>The Irish Data Protection Commissioner reported over 6,000 GDPR related complaints in this first year of legislation, of which approximately 90% were deemed valid.  There is massive confusion about the regulation.  There is a widespread lack of awareness, a shortage in skills across all sectors and quite a lot of enforcement of regulation without actually complying with it.  My colleagues have raised the matter previously but more and more people are coming into my clinics with issues about the regulation.  Clarity is needed going forward in order for the legislation to work for people.  The GDPR significantly strengthens the rights of individuals but it is important to know that it increases organisations' responsibility as to how they collect and use personal data.  For many organisations, there is unfamiliarity with the regulation, in some cases to a staggering degree.  People coming into my clinics are complaining that they have been denied access to their own information.  According to the regulation, everyone has the right to access to data which has been collected concerning him or her.  Others in my clinics and on social media have complained because they have received mobile phone text based direct marketing when they had not opted in to receive such texts.  There really is massive confusion.  Now that we are one year into it, I would like to see more effort being put in to making people more aware.  I appreciate that the several investigations by the data commissioner may raise such awareness but I would like to see more done in this regard.  This is huge.  It is one of the biggest issues to face Senators and Deputies.  We need to make sure people have proper information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071000002#J00300","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1562751000,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I would like to follow on from the statement by my colleague from Limerick, Senator Kieran O'Donnell, regarding the Mercosur deal.  There is exceptional unrest in the beef industry.  In the last 18 months it has seen a dramatic deterioration in prices.  The proposed Mercosur deal will see an increased volume of beef coming into the European Union, which will also deflate prices.  The outlook for the beef industry for the next few months is very poor.  If we see the price decline that is predicted for the next few months, we are going to have a real, extended crisis in our industry.  The point about Mercosur is that it has come already.  The confidence is gone from the market and the suppliers.  Beef farmers who came to my clinics last week will not buy weanlings when it comes to the autumn and will not be investing in sheds or in their industry because they do not have the confidence to keep going.  That is going to become a serious issue for our suckler and beef industry.<\/p> <p>The Minister has been proactive in this space and has said it is a bad deal for the beef industry.  We need to start up the momentum of getting our European friends involved in the debate.  Our association with France in particular has to be built upon.  The Oireachtas, through friendship groups, the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Seanad itself, has to build those connections to ensure we can win support in Europe to get this deal changed.  For this to happen, everyone here has to be involved.  The Seanad should send a delegation to France and should become a real catalyst of change to ensure we can get those doors opened.  We will not change it all by ourselves and it needs to be changed.  The confidence of our beef farmers is drained out of their veins in the last few months.  This has been the final kick.  We need to move into a different space, build alliances and get change.  With that, hopefully, we can get what the beef sector requires.  Nor is it just about beef.  The poultry sector will be decimated and will have no hope if the proposed margin of poultry product comes into the EU.  It is about fighting for this section of society and it is about an agricultural split.  Dairy will survive but the beef, pig and poultry industries need a change in this deal, otherwise they will be on a slippery slope, and confidence is at rock bottom at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071000002#J00400","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speech","time":1562751000,"counter":57,"content":"<p>There are serious concerns in the south Inishowen area at activities on what was known as Grian&aacute;n Estate.  It is the largest farm in the country.  This estate was purchased by Glenmore Estate in 2017 and earlier this year <i>The Irish Times<\/i>reported that it was estimated that hundreds of trees including ash, sycamore, birch, whitebeam and willow, had been destroyed and miles of hedgerows torn out on this farm.  The matter has been raised with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and with the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  This massive estate borders an internationally renowned bird and wildlife sanctuary.  Right now it is subject to an ongoing  Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine investigation.  The wider community is outraged by the dramatic change to the landscape in a much loved area.<\/p><p>Recent developments have turned concern into absolute outrage.  The owners of this farm operate an anaerobic digester and one of the by-products of this is digestate, which is spread on the land.  Rural people who live in these areas are used to slurry spreading and farming practices going back as far as anybody can remember.  They are not people who would have any difficulty with that.  However, the smell of ammonia is just an assault on a large area of south Inishowen.  Apparently our current legislation is allowing this to happen.  We would expect the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and Donegal County Council to defend the interests of the community.  A confirmation day was totally ruined in the local hotel because the smell was utterly overwhelming and suffocating.  We had a situation recently where somebody was holding a wake for their loved one and the house was overcome.  Everybody's home is devastated by the smell.  There is need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment to be made aware of the serious and profound problems that have arisen.  There is a need for legislative change.  The Ministers have to pull together with the EPA, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Donegal County Council to solve this problem on behalf of the local community and hold this business to account for what is an assault.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2321\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2321&amp;amp;pid=PadraigMacLochlainn&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=10\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It might be technically legal to do what they are doing but it is utterly unethical to do what they are doing right now and it has to stop.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071000002#J00500","speaker":"1400","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562751000,"counter":59,"content":"<p>Well said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071000002#K00200","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1562751000,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I congratulate Commissioner Phil Hogan on his nomination for reappointment to the European Commission.

I call for a debate on the issue either  today or tomorrow.  If we cannot have it on either day , I hope it can proceed when the House returns in September.  Many issues arise from the deal.  One is the original 275,000 tonnes of beef already coming into Europe.  How much of that is coming to Ireland?  Reference was made to the poultry industry.  As previous speakers indicated, the deal will have devastating effects on our beef and poultry sectors and on the pig industry as well.

I have raised this issue on several occasions.  Dublin Port is highly important to Ireland.  The port does not operate on a 24-hour basis and there are difficulties with that.  Maybe the expansion envisaged will help that.  A &euro;1 billion plan is envisaged for the port and a planning application has been lodged with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I hope these plans will come to fruition in the not-too-distant future and that Dublin Port goes ahead with them.  It is vital that Dublin Port works efficiently and effectively.  Dublin Port has indicated that it will not take any cruise ships this year.  Cruise ships are important not only to the city of Dublin but also to the country as a whole.  The sector is not putting any pressure on bed nights in Dublin or anything like that because most of the people stay on board.  This would be a major loss to the State and the Exchequer.  I welcome the plans put forward by Dublin Port.  Perhaps the issue could be debated in the Chamber in the not-too-distant future as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071000002#K00300","speaker":"1380"},{"type":"speech","time":1562751000,"counter":61,"content":"<p>Like other colleagues, yesterday I attended a briefing on the Mercosur deal organised by the Irish Farmers Association.

This morning, as we speak, outside Leinster House a large demonstration is gathering to express fears and concerns from the farming industry about the uncertainty that the deal presents and the negative consequences that may result.<\/p><p>Yesterday, I listened to the Joint Committee on Agriculture Food and the Marine discuss the merits of afforestation and the replanting of trees in order to address climate change and meet some of our obligations.  It is with this in mind that I prefer to speak on a positive note rather than focus on negatives.  It is timely that we are having this discussion because only a few days ago a report was published in <i>Science <\/i>by Professor John Crowther, a professor in environmental systems science at Eidgen&ouml;ssische Technische Hochschule Z&uuml;rich in Switzerland.  At Queens University Belfast, we work with this university on a regular basis as partners in a European food project called EIT Food.  Professor Crowther states that planting billions of trees is our best chance of saving the planet.  He claims there is room on earth to plant 1.2 trillion extra trees and cut our carbon footprint by 66%.  I am of the view that the claims are valid.  Professor Crowther states, &quot;This new quantitative evaluation shows [forest] restoration isn't just one of our climate change solutions, it is overwhelmingly the top one&quot;.  The researchers believe that a worldwide programme could remove two thirds of all emissions pumped into the atmosphere by humans.  They have calculated that 1.7 billion ha of land on which trees are not currently growing could support trees naturally.  This equates to an area roughly the size of the US and China combined.  They took into account that different areas would support different densities of trees and they excluded urban areas and all fields currently used to grow crops.  Furthermore, grazing land was calculated as supporting a few trees, something that would actually be beneficial to cattle and sheep.<\/p><p>This works clearly demonstrates that people do not need to start believing in climate change or change their lifestyles.  It does not require major advances in science or technology.  It simply involves citizens engaging to support, donate, assist or facilitate the planting of trees.  Many world-renowned scientists support this theory, as well as the idea that national governments should have this as a primary component of any plans to deal with climate change.  Ren&eacute; Castro, assistant director general at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, as stated, &quot;We now have definitive evidence of the potential land area for re-growing forests, where they could exist and how much carbon they could store.&quot;  Initial estimates suggest that a global cost of $300 million would restore over 1 trillion trees.  This is by far the cheapest option yet proposed.<\/p><p>We need to consider how the men and women on the street today outside Leinster House can contribute and be rewarded for doing so.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ian Marshall:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2486\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2486&amp;amp;pid=IanMarshall&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=10\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Telling a farmer to plant a forest is akin to telling people in Dublin to build a house in their garden that they cannot sell for 40 years.

I would encourage Senator Ardagh, respectfully, in light of that very recent chilling example of what the British law can amount to, to think about whether it is a matter of sweetness that the British Parliament should threaten to impose an extreme abortion law on Northern Ireland.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=10\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is neither patriotic nor wise to be happy about the British Parliament imposing or threatening to impose any laws, especially on socially sensitive areas in a jurisdiction such as Northern Ireland.

I raised the case of the Hyde family recently.  They moved to Australia and their application for permanent residency was denied because their child had been diagnosed with cystic fibrosis.  That incredible decision was thankfully reversed as a result of a last minute intervention by the immigration Minister in Australia and the family will be allowed to remain after all.  While that is a great outcome, certain concerns about the case remain.  One is the media blackout about this case in Ireland.  If Donald Trump's America had refused a visa to a child with cystic fibrosis, we would rightly be talking about it continually.  I am concerned about what I see as the hands-off position taken by the Government on this issue.  When I raised it as a Commencement matter, the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, said that it would not be possible for the T&aacute;naiste to comment on the visa procedures applied by other sovereign states.  That is a curious statement when we rightly, constantly, pass comment on American procedures and our Government rightly expends time, money and manpower on actively lobbying the Americans to change their visa procedures and laws.  If one was a cynic, one would conclude that the Irish lobby in the US is large, well-funded and regularly wines and dines the leadership of the largest political parties.  No such lobby exists in other countries.<\/p><p>I ask the Leader to agree that it is not acceptable for the State to take a hands-off approach to issues which affect its citizens, neither in ordinary situations nor <i>a fortiori<\/i>when there is a child with cystic fibrosis who, for a time, appeared to be at the receiving end of a harsh decision.  As a State, our policy should be to assist the best possible outcomes for Irish families so that they can live, prosper and contribute to whatever society they want to live in, all things being equal.  There should never be any discrimination on the grounds of a family member's disability of any kind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071000002#M00400","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1562751000,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I second the amendment to the Order of Business from my colleague, Senator Devine.<\/p> <p>I call for a debate on the hospitality sector.  Sinn F&eacute;in's National Minimum Wage (Protection of Employee Tips) Bill 2017 continues to progress in the D&aacute;il.  I record my disappointment that Fine Gael opposes a legal right to tips for hospitality workers.  The issues in the hospitality sector go beyond that.  I refer to the Workplace Relations Commission's reports for the last three years.  Some 48% of the food and drink sector was rated non-compliant with basic employment law in 2016, with 58% non-compliance in 2017, and 67% non-compliance in 2018.  In other words, the majority of our restaurants and hotels are not compliant with basic law such as issuing a work contract, complying with the National Minimum Wage Act, the Organisation of Working Time Act and the Payment of Wages Act.  The standards in this sector are shocking.<\/p> <p>I refer specifically to Limerick.  Limerick City and County Council provides hundreds of thousands of euro each year to two hotels, the Strand Hotel and Savoy Hotel, neither of which recognise trade unions.  Is it not time that we as a country decide, when we are going to award taxpayers' money, that we at least insist on a level of decency?  We should call on those hotels to recognise the rights of their staff to join a trade union and be recognised as trade union members.  This has gone on for far too long and the Workplace Relations Commission's evidence shows that it gets worse each year.  A 67% rate of non-compliance with basic employment law is not good enough.  We need a debate on the matter and we need politicians across all parties to act on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071000002#M00500","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speech","time":1562751000,"counter":82,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071000002#M00600","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1562751000,"counter":83,"content":"<p>We are coming up on budget time.  I had a communication this morning from a member of the public who is concerned about the contributory old age pension.  Every year, the Minister announces increases in social welfare benefits.  Generally speaking, we hear that pensions were increased by &euro;5.  Since 2012, six streams have been introduced in the pension scheme based on the number of contributions that one has paid.  This member of the public has set out for me the pension rates in 2018, starting at &euro;243.30 and working down to &euro;97.20.  The Minister has announced a &euro;5 increase in the pension but it is <i>pro rata<\/i>for the contributory pension while it is not <i>pro rata<\/i>for the non-contributory pension.  The person on the bottom of the scale, with an average of ten to 14 contributions, would have got a pension of &euro;97.20 in 2018 and, following the 2019 budget, an increase to &euro;99.20, which is not an increase of &euro;5.  If nothing else, when the Minister addresses it in October, we should clarify the language that is used, since &euro;5 is not being given across the board, but a <i>pro rata<\/i>increase for people on a contributory pension.  A man has put together a very genuine case, which I will forward to the Leader's office today, and he might forward it to the Minister.  It causes him and many of his neighbours who are on contributory pensions a great deal of distress.  Some &euro;5 is a lot of money if one is trying to live on &euro;200 a week, and it is an awful lot if one is trying to live on &euro;97 and only gets a &euro;2 increase.  I will forward that information to the Leader and, if needs be, we can have a Commencement debate in the early part of the new session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071000002#M00700","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1562751000,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I ask the Leader to facilitate statements and a debate on the future of Moneypoint in the first week that we are back in September.  Staff in Moneypoint are currently engaging with management and their unions about job losses.  It is quite serious.  What will happen in the future to Moneypoint?  The ESB has committed to coal burning there until 2025 but much more importantly, what will happen post 2025?  The Minister will have eight or nine weeks over the summer to prepare for this debate and I encourage the Leader to facilitate it.<\/p> <p>I was at a briefing in Buswells, hosted by a former colleague, Averil Power, who is now CEO of the Irish Cancer Society.  If Members have not been there already, I encourage them to go there.  While we have achieved much related to cancer care, especially with the centres of excellence and the fact that so many people survive cancer, there are still many challenges.  Some of the requests the Irish Cancer Society has in its pre-budget submission are very reasonable.  One is a reduction to a &euro;100 limit for people under the drugs payment scheme.  It is looking for an upgrade to and moving forward of trials, the people covered and the funding available.  As we will all have experienced in our offices, it is critical that when people are diagnosed with cancer, a more lenient approach should be taken by the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, when allocating medical cards for treatment.  It is extremely traumatic and distressing for a person to have cancer and the last thing that he or she should be worried about is whether he or she will get a medical card.  In the upcoming budget in October, the Minister needs to do something to make it easier and more flexible for medical cards to be provided to people who are diagnosed with cancer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071000002#M00800","speaker":"1416"},{"type":"speech","time":1562751000,"counter":85,"content":"<p>The Leas-Chathaoirleach might recall that he recently chaired the Seanad Public Consultation Committee when it addressed the matter of small and medium enterprises.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071000002#M00900","speaker":"1431"},{"type":"speech","time":1562751000,"counter":86,"content":"<p>Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh did a tremendous report, if I may say so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071000002#M01000","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1562751000,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach.

That debate must include a discussion on procurement.  The Exchequer will spend some &euro;100 billion in the next five years on public procurement, of which SMEs will receive approximately 3% to 4% in value terms.  If we could double that allocation, it would make a huge difference to SMEs and to the whole economy.  The procurement process must be totally overhauled.  Will the Leader ask the Minister to come to the House for a debate on that issue?  Ireland is 12th in Europe when it comes to SME share of Government contracts.  The contracts these companies do get are small, with none securing a project worth more than &euro;300,000.  The percentage of SMEs tendering in this country is much smaller than is the case in any other country in Europe, where they secure three times as many contracts as Irish SMEs do here.  It is an issue that requires serious examination.  We have great SMEs that are run by passionate people.  We need to give them a fair crack of the whip.  The last thing they want is an advantage or privilege, but they must have a fair chance.  I thank the Leader and the Cathaoirleach for all the support they have given me in my role as rapporteur for the report on the SME sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071000002#M01100","speaker":"1431","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562751000,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I thank the 20 Senators who contributed to the Order of Business.  Senators Ardagh, Norris, Feighan and Mullen referenced the decisions in Westminster yesterday that affect Northern Ireland.  I congratulate Mr. Conor McGinn, MP, on his stewardship of the marriage equality debate yesterday and the decisions arising from it.  It is an important decision for the UK Parliament and one which I very much welcome.  Senator Ardagh had every entitlement to come into the House today and give her view on this matter, as did Senator Mullen.  To be fair to Senator Ardagh, she has long been a champion of equality and women's reproductive rights.  Senator Mullen has a different viewpoint.  The UK Parliament has now taken a decision on these issues as they operate in the North, as did the Irish people in respect of this State.  There are people in the North today celebrating the granting of marriage equality, which was previously denied to them.  Ironically, this comes at a time when there is a lacuna of representation in Stormont.  We all recognise the need to have the Assembly back up and running as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>Senator Ardagh referred to jobs in the HSE.  I do not have the answers to her questions.  I do find commonality with her point that if a person is given a job and the relevant process is followed from A to Z, it should not take an inordinate amount of time to implement that appointment.  Every contract takes a period to be issued, but we need to look at the delays the Senator highlighted.  The HSE has been recruiting staff in the first quarter of this year and it is my understanding that there is no public sector freeze on recruitment.  If Senator Ardagh has an issue concerning a particular individual, she should take it up with the Minister, or I can convey her concerns to him.<\/p> <p>I agree with the Senator that the delays on the part of Bank of Ireland in processing social welfare payments are not acceptable.  They place a significant burden and strain on people waiting for those payments.<\/p> <p>Later today, after a further two hours of discussion, we will have completed 102 hours of debate on the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017.  I will say no more on that other than to point Senators to what is proposed in the Order of Business.<\/p> <p>Senator Conway-Walsh referred to poverty among pensioners.  To be fair, the Government has done more than its predecessors in respect of the restoration of social protection payments to elderly people.  Everybody qualifies for a pension, with means and circumstances deciding whether one is eligible for a non-contributory pension or a contributory pension.  The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, introduced the homemaker's scheme, which has afforded recompense to some women who look after children in the home.  The social welfare budget has increased every year under this Government.  I do not wish to be discordant but all of us in this House who are active in our constituencies understand the difficulties people are facing.  There is an issue in regard to how efforts to reduce energy consumption may impact on elderly people.  I will be happy to have that debate when we return in the autumn.<\/p> <p>Senator Norris raised an issue yesterday regarding the schedule, which he clarified today.  His proposal for the appointment of a member of the Traveller community to Seanad &Eacute;ireann is deserving of support.  The hearings of the Seanad Public Consultation Committee are an important part of our work in this House, giving us an opportunity to deal with issues that might not necessarily be debated in the normal course of business.  Our ability to have those hearings enables people to serve as rapporteurs and to present issues that might not otherwise be to the fore in our deliberations.<\/p> <p>Senator Kieran O'Donnell referred to the report by Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill on victims of abuse.  I understand the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, is in the D&aacute;il later today and will address the report, which the Government has accepted.  We all look forward to that work being concluded.<\/p> <p>Senators Kieran O'Donnell, Lombard, Paddy Burke, Gallagher and Marshall raised issues concerning the EU-Mercosur deal.  I facilitated a discussion on this matter last week in the House, which was attended by the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Heather Humphreys.  It is important that we continue to have these discussions as there is a long way to go on the deal.  The briefing yesterday by the Irish Farmers Association gave a strong flavour of the view from the farming sector.  Others, such as Mr. Dan O'Brien, have a different view.  We need a running debate on the issues, which I am happy to accommodate in the new term.<\/p> <p>Senator Murnane O'Connor noted the one-year anniversary of the GDPR and pointed to several issues with the regulation.  Third-party compliance is challenging and we have seen some &euro;56 million in fines this year already.  However, compliance must be a prerequisite for everybody.  I am happy to have a debate on the matter.<\/p> <p>Senator Lombard's proposal that a delegation from the Seanad might travel to France to discuss the Mercosur deal with colleagues there is worth considering.  I hope we can have a discussion in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on how that might be facilitated.<\/p> <p>Senator Mac Lochlainn spoke eloquently about an important local issue in south Inishowen.  I do not have information on this particular matter, but I am happy to convey the Senator's concerns to the relevant Ministers.<\/p> <p>I join colleagues in congratulating Mr. Phil Hogan on his nomination for a second term as a European Commissioner.  He has done an extraordinarily good job, notwithstanding the comments around Mercosur.  I hope he will remain in his current position or receive an elevation.  We congratulate him on the very good job he has done.<\/p> <p>Senator Paddy Burke highlighted issues relating to Dublin Port.  The port's readiness for expansion and the other issues to which he referred are worthy of debate in the House.<\/p> <p>Senators Marshall and Humphreys referred to climate change.  We should all reflect on Senator Marshall's contribution, particularly his comments on afforestation, and Senator Humphreys's points about the EPA's report on air quality in Dublin.  The findings in the report underline the importance of implementing the recommendations in the climate change action plan regarding electric vehicles, cycling, park-and-ride facilities, public transport and the elimination of vehicles that run on fossil fuels by 2030.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=10\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is why it is important that the Ministers, Deputies Bruton and Ross, will return to the House in the new term to discuss the matter raised.<\/p><p>If I am interpreting Senator Devine correctly, she is proposing an amendment to allow for a debate on her Private Members' Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071000002#N00200","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562751000,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I am sorry, but I did not hear the Leader.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071000002#O00200","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1562751000,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I am happy to accept that amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071000002#O00300","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1562751000,"counter":93,"content":"<p>Good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071000002#O00400","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1562751000,"counter":94,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her contribution.<\/p><p>Senator Byrne raised the issue of the <i>Ilen<\/i>, which is a wonderful example of how a project can be put together and brought to fruition through a community education programme.

I do not want to use the word &quot;victory&quot;, but I congratulate the family on obtaining the right to stay in Australia.  The Irish Government plays a role in helping our citizens with visas, although I am not familiar with the level of involvement in this particular case.  The Senator had tabled a Commencement matter on the subject, but we now welcome the decision.  Thankfully, the issue has been resolved.  The Senator referred to there being various lobby groups, but the media had covered the story beforehand and afterwards.  To be fair, there is a strong Irish diaspora in Australia that is engaged with Irish civic life and the promotion of many issues.  We might consider setting up an Oireachtas subgroup to progress that further.  A child's disability should not be a barrier to remaining or entering any country.<\/p><p>I have not read the report of the WRC, but I concur with Senator Gavan that any breach of employment law is unacceptable.  We have employment law to ensure that there are rights and standards in the workplace.  I am not familiar with the issues that the Senator raised regarding the two hotels in Limerick, but I have a simple - perhaps too simple - view on this, that being, someone should be able to join a union.  I was a member of one, and I would encourage workers to enhance their rights collectively by becoming union members.  That is why we have employment law.  I would be happy to arrange for such a debate in the new term.<\/p><p>Senator Craughwell raised an important issue concerning the budget.  I will take that information from him later.

As he correctly stated, the jobs need to be preserved post 2025.  The transition must be planned for.  I take the Senator's point in that regard.  He also referred to the briefing given by the Irish Cancer Society.  I congratulate him and join him in his comments about the Primary Care Reimbursement Service, PCRS, and the provision of medical cards to patients who have been diagnosed with cancer.  That they have this benefit is a necessity, not a luxury.  Dealing with cancer in itself is stressful and people should not have to worry about medical politics.<\/p><p>I concur with Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh regarding public procurement and small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs.  For SMEs that want to tender and be considered for contracts, the cost of tendering is a significant issue.  A former Minister of State, Mr. Brian Hayes, did some work on this question.

Due to their highly technical nature, these amendments have been the subject of extensive consultations between my Department, the Courts Service, including the Taxing Master's office, and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 1 proposes amendments to section 27 of the 1995 Act, which deals with additional powers of the Taxing Master of the High Court and of a county registrar exercising the powers of a taxing master.  The proposed new subsection (12) clarifies that section 27 shall not apply to the adjudication of legal costs under Part 10 of the 2015 Act.  That Part provides for the establishment of a new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicators, which will replace the Taxing Master's office.  Accordingly, section 27 will not apply to the new office, but it will continue to apply to county registrars in respect of matters of taxation.<\/p> <p>The proposed deletion of sections 27(6) and (7) is in line with the proposal to amend the 2015 Act to allow for a lodgement and tender process in the field of costs adjudication.  This will be set out in respect of the proposed amendment of section 154(10) of the 2015 Act, which I will address shortly.  The existing subsections (6) and (7) represent an impediment to the lodgement and tender process, as they fetter the allocation of liability of the parties for the costs of an adjudication or taxation of costs.  Accordingly, the deletion of the two subsections is proposed.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 2 proposes a new section of the Bill providing for a number of amendments to four sections of the 2015 Act.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Charles Flanagan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=10\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->If the Acting Chair agrees, I will address them individually.<\/p><p>Section 3(a) of amendment No. 2 provides for the insertion of a new subsection (6) into section 141 of the 2015 Act.  The section in question deals with county registrars in the context of Part 10 of the 2015 Act which addresses the matter of legal costs.  The purpose of this section of the amendment is to align the provision of reasons for legal cost determination by a county registrar with a similar obligation placed on a legal costs adjudicator under section 140(4) of the 2015 Act.  This arises in regard to the maintenance by the county registrar of a register of taxation or legal costs, being determinations under the Act.  Under section 140(4), costs adjudicators do not have to publish reasons for the determination where they are of the opinion that the adjudication concerned does not involve a matter of legal importance.  The proposed section 141 uses identical language to that in section 140(4) to provide for a similar exemption for county registrars.  The amendment is put forward in response to concerns raised by the Office of the Taxing Master and country registrars that an unqualified obligation to provide reasons for a determination as currently applies under section 141 would be unduly burdensome at a practical level and create a disparity in how the register of determinations is applied across the board.<\/p><p>Section 3(b) proposes amendment of section 154 of the Act, subsection (10) of which deals with matters relating to the work of the Office of Legal Cost Adjudicators which can be subject to rules of court.  The purpose of this section of the amendment is to provide for the introduction of a procedure to enable a party liable for payment of costs to make an offer to settle those costs or a particular item of costs which, if acceptable, would obviate the need for an adjudication or reduce the scope of adjudication.  This procedure is known as the lodgment and tender process.  To provide an incentive to a party seeking costs to engage with such procedure, it is necessary to provide that a party which unreasonably refuses to accept an offer to settle the amount claimed would be liable to bear the costs of the expense of the adjudication process from the point at which the offer is made.  The proposed additional provisions in subsection (10) would enable the making of court rules to facilitate such a procedure and set the respective liability of the parties for the cost of an adjudication where the amount offered is not exceeded by the amount of the costs determined to be paid.<\/p><p>Section 3(c) provides for the amendment of section 160 of the 2015 Act.  Its purpose is to correct an erroneous cross-reference.  The reference should be to section 163 which deals with the power of the legal costs adjudicator to specify forms in connection with the application for the adjudication of costs.  The cross-reference in section 160 should be to section 163 rather than to section 166 which deals with information, documents and records.<\/p><p>Section 3(d) provides for the amendment of section 172 of the 2015 Act and deals with the advisory committee on the grant of patents of precedence.  A grant of patents entitles a legal practitioner to whom it is granted to use the title of senior counsel.  The purpose of the amendment is to correct the omission of the President of the Court of Appeal from the membership of the advisory committee on the grant of patents of precedence.  The omission arose due to the fact that the Court of Appeal Act and the Legal Services Regulation Act crossed each other in time in coming to enactment.  Accordingly, the amendment includes the President of the Court of Appeal in the list of members of the advisory committee.  It also provides for a temporary alternative member of the advisory committee in the event of the death or retirement of the President of the Court of Appeal in a similar fashion to procedure in the cases of the Chief Justice and President of the High Court.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071000002#O03100","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1562751000,"counter":122,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1562751000,"counter":123,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 2:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1562751000,"counter":124,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1562751000,"counter":125,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 3:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1562751000,"counter":126,"content":"<p>The amendment seeks to amend section 30 of the 1961 Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act which deals with the retirement age of a judge of the District Court.  The effect of the amendment is to increase from 65 to 70 years the age of retirement of a judge of the District Court.  The new retirement age will overtake the current practice of continuing a District Court judge in office from the age of 65 to 70 years by means of an annual warrant, which means that in each year the judge concerned must be extended in office.  Subsection (1) provides for the increase to 70 years, amending the 1961 Act in a straightforward manner through the substitution of 70 for 65.<\/p><p>Subsection (2) provides that the increase to 70 will apply to serving judges when the amendment is brought into operation.  In particular, it clarifies that the increase generally to 70 years applies to a judge who, having already reached 65 years, has been continuing in office by means of a subsisting annual warrant made under section 2 of the 1949 Courts of Justice (District Court) Act.<\/p><p>Subsection (3) further clarifies that an increase to 70 years applies in the case of an annual warrant made retrospectively under the 1949 Act in the circumstances provided for by section 1 of the Courts (No. 2) Act 1988.  The circumstances referred to include where the omission to make a warrant is attributable to error or oversight.  I was in the House when that Bill was passed.  It arose in regard to a specific District Court judge who served in my district at the time, district No. 14.  I make that point to underline that <i>tempus fugit<\/i>.<\/p><p>I am proposing this straightforward amendment in response to pressing views expressed by the Courts Service and the Association of Judges of Ireland seeking implementation of this measure so as to standardise the retirement age of judges of the District Court with that of other judges and to do away with the system of annual extensions from the age of 65.  It will enhance court administration and the continuity of any District Court proceedings concerned.  The amendment is based on section 59 of the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017 as passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and which is currently before this House.

A woman published an interview she did with me in 2000 or 2001, and I wanted to take libel action against her but could not find a barrister prepared to take the case.

The amendment reinforces that, regardless of any recommendations made by the commission, the appointment of judges remains a power vested in the Government, and that is what the Constitution requires.  Any deviation would necessitate a referendum.  Further, or in the alternative, if a conflict arises between this Act and the Constitution, the Constitution is what is relied on.  This is a very important point.  Senator McDowell is raising constitutional issues.  He is reinforcing the fact that, regardless of recommendations made by the commission, the power of appointment of judges would remain solely a Government function.  It is vested, under the Constitution, exclusively in the hands of the Government.  There should be no attempt whatever to dilute or weaken this, and it should be implemented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071000002#U00700","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1562751000,"counter":277,"content":"<p>This is an issue that has bothered me the whole way through this Bill, namely, that the absolute power with respect to the appointment of judges rests with the Government under the Constitution.  Regardless of the findings or deliberations of any commission or committee, at the end of the day, the Minister for Justice and Equality, advising the Government, can pick a candidate who has not come before this commission.  As Senator Norris has just said, it would require a referendum to change the law if we were to change the way judges are appointed.  I will withdraw the amendment while reserving the right to reintroduce it on Report Stage.  However, it is a question that we need to answer when the Minister comes back on Report Stage as to how exactly we can compel a Government to accept the nominees, which I do not believe we can do under the Constitution.  I will await the Minister's advice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071000002#U00800","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1562751000,"counter":278,"content":"<p>We will come back to this.  I note the Senator has withdrawn the amendment while at the same time reserving the right to re-enter it on Report Stage.  I merely want to flag a reason for my inability to accept the amendment, which I am sure will also be the case at a later stage when we are discussing the Bill.  I specifically sought the advice of the Attorney General on this matter.  There is an issue with the requirement in the amendment which would have the result of posing obvious legal issues by ousting completely the jurisdiction of the courts to deal with any legal or constitutional issue surrounding the process for a judicial appointment.  It is the belief of the Attorney General, which I share, that this would be liable to constitutional challenge.  I do not accept for one moment that Senator Craughwell wished to see that in the amendment.  Let both sides reflect further on it.  I am assuming the amendment will be re-entered in this or a similar form.  However, I ask the proposer of the amendment to bear in mind the advice of the Attorney General as given to me on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071000002#U00900","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1562751000,"counter":279,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Minister's willingness to engage on these matters.
