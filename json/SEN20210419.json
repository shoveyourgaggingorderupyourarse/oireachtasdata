When I tabled this Commencement matter prior to Easter, I was reflecting a frustration as I have been continuously raising this issue about the pension scheme for community employment supervisors and assistant supervisors, along with others, for quite some time but I am glad that we now see that we have had progress over this weekend.  I hope that a deal will be in place.  I understand that SIPTU will be considering the matter today.<\/p> <p>I thank my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath.

We have to acknowledge the enormously valuable service that community employment, CE, schemes provide within our communities, particularly the training and support they provide to participants who are, in many cases, long-term unemployed, as well as the fact the schemes represent enormous value for money.  As we come out of this pandemic, these schemes will be more important than ever.  We will need an economic recovery but we will also need a community and social recovery, and in that context, CE schemes must be part of any Government strategy.<\/p><p>This deal has been a long time coming.  As the Minister of State knows, the Labour Court recommendation dates from 2008.  The reason we have industrial relations machinery in this country is to try to avoid disputes, and while I accept there can be problems with implementing recommendations, it is not acceptable that it has taken 13 years, effectively, to get to a stage where we now have a deal.  In 2008 the Labour Court found against the funding agency, namely, the State, rather than any of the nominal employers, that is, the voluntary organisations concerned.  It does not make sense that where the State 100% determines the terms and conditions of CE supervisors and expects them to act effectively as case officers on behalf of scheme participants, it would then seek to deny it is the employer.  The approach that was taken on this until recently was wrong.<\/p><p>I have a number of questions about the deal that was announced at the weekend and I hope clarity can be provided.  Clarity is certainly needed if we are looking at a gratuity lump sum.  What are the tax implications of that?  That issue must be considered.  Will it be possible for those who are still employed as CE supervisors or assistant supervisors to roll the redress lump sum into an existing pension fund?  Current supervisors will get the lump sum but will that be used in future as part of the pension fund?  It is important we have clarity on this but I am very happy it now seems we have a deal on the table.  After 13 long years, we have finally seen progress and for that I am grateful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021041900002#B00300","speaker":"1638","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618824600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for consistently raising this matter.<\/p> <p>Community employment, CE, is the largest employment activation and training programme administered by the Department of Social Protection.  One of its main objectives is to provide work experience and targeted training interventions for long-term unemployed people to assist them to find new jobs.  The CE programme is delivered by independent CE sponsoring authorities that receive public funding.  The total expenditure for CE in 2020 was &euro;341 million, while the budget for CE in 2021 is &euro;362 million.  There are currently 865 CE schemes in operation with 19,315 participants and 1,291 supervisors.  CE schemes provide a range of services, including meals on wheels, social and healthcare, and all schemes provide valuable services to local communities and many have been particularly important over the past year in particular.  CE scheme participants and supervisors are employees of the independent CE sponsoring authorities and the Department provides funding for participants and supervisors payroll.  The Department is not the employer of CE participants or supervisors.<\/p> <p>For several years CE supervisors and assistant supervisors have been seeking, through their union representatives, the allocation of Exchequer funding to implement the 2008 Labour Court recommendation relating to the provision of a pension scheme for CE supervisors who are employed by CE schemes.  The issue of CE supervisors' pension provision was considered by a community sector high-level group chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in 2017.  A detailed scoping exercise was carried out with input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES, on the potential costs of providing Exchequer support for the establishment of such a pension scheme for employees across the community and voluntary sector and not just for CE supervisors.  This exercise estimated a significant potential cost to the State, depending on the numbers involved, if it covered all employees in this sector.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Joe O'Brien:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=JoeOBrien&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> This explains the complex and difficult context in which we are seeking to resolve the specific CE supervisor pension issue and accounts for the time taken to get to where we are today.  In particular, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform had to have regard to any potential Exchequer exposure associated with dealing with the specific issue relating solely to CE supervisors arising from the Labour Court recommendation.  Any proposal to resolve this specific issue can and will only apply to CE supervisors and assistant supervisors.  In this context, officials from the Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform held discussions on proposals to progress and resolve this issue over the past number of months while having regard to the wider budgetary framework.  Officials from the Department also held discussions with unions representing CE supervisors and assistant supervisors during the same period.<\/p><p>I am very pleased to report there was a successful outcome to discussions between both Departments late last week.  On Friday last, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and my colleague, the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, reached agreement in principle on proposals to resolve this issue.  This includes a financial package.  This is a significant step forward and I thank all those involved in getting us to this stage.<\/p><p>The next step is for these proposals to be put to the trade unions representing CE supervisors and assistant supervisors.  This will be done today.  It would be premature to go into further details of what is proposed in advance of these plans being put to the unions but the Senator may rest assured the matter will be progressed without delay in order to bring this long-standing issue to a satisfactory conclusion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021041900002#C00200","speaker":"1563","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618824600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank her for coming in.  Over the last number of months, I have received many representations from parents in south Kildare who are exhausted trying to get any level of assessment and help for their children.  Their loved ones are being put on waiting lists that are getting out of control while the development and needs of these same children are not being addressed.  It would seem that, on the back of prolonged delays in assessments of need for families in the area, the HSE decided to redeploy a number of staff to this much-needed resource but this has resulted in unacceptable delays for families whose children were dependent on seeing these specialists or, in the case of some families with whom I am dealing, whose children have moved along the age groups and are now waiting on specialist therapy.  The result of these moves seems to be only heartache for families, forcing them to borrow money, if they can, and turn to private practices for assessments, if they can get them, given the importance of early intervention for their children about which everyone tells them.  Many families have turned to online support groups where families in similar situations share their experiences and support one another as best they can.  All the families I have spoken to do not blame the staff they deal with at the end of the phone or, if they are lucky enough, meet at a clinic.  They recognise those still working in the system are doing their very best but cannot cover the gaps in the service that are all too evident for so many families in Kildare.<\/p><p>It is also important, as I think the Minister of State will agree, to allow these families to tell their story.  I will take time to outline some of the heartache these families are facing as it is important to put their stories on the record of this House.  Last week, I outlined the worries Samantha had for her daughter but today I will tell the House about Aileen.  She tells me that at a young age they noticed things were a little different with their youngest daughter.  Over time and after many attempts and calls, she received a phone call from a primary care doctor who said her daughter's needs could not be met by them and that the network disability team, NDT, would be needed as her loved one was non-verbal and showing signs that could indicate autism.  She filled in and sent off every form required and still has not even been given an assessment officer.  Her application was received on 16 November 2020.  From the few people who have answered Aileen, she has heard she is facing a wait of 12 to 14 months, probably longer due to the impact of Covid-19.  Meanwhile, she says, all her family can do is fumble along blindly, not knowing how to help her youngest child.  She asked me if I had any idea how heartbreaking it is to watch one's young child struggle so much and not know how to help, not be able to communicate her needs and have a system that leaves her in the dark with no support or guidance.  Aileen says she and her husband are sleep-deprived, heartbroken for their little one and seriously struggling to figure out ways to make her world adapt to her child.  She said they need help, support and guidance.<\/p><p>Another lady I am dealing with, Nicola, says the HSE diagnosis for her daughter is that she needs intervention for occupational therapy, speech and language, psychology and physiotherapy.  Her daughter has now been discharged from the early years team onto the school age team but she is still waiting for her custom and fitted shoes.  The day her moulds were taken for them she received a phone call in the car park outside as she was strapping her daughter in to say they were discharging her to the school age team.  She asked who would be her point of contact and was told there was none.  She asked if she receive a letter about the transition from one team to the other and was told they do not do that and that she would not hear from the school age team unless she contacted it to tell it her daughter needed something.  Her email to me read:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWhen your child has significant needs you think that being accepted by the likes of the NDT will be the turning point, you think it will be the beginning of the intervention your child needs so desperately and absolutely deserves.  Well, I thought wrong, we are in this alone.  We pay &euro;80 for under an hour of Occupational Therapy as there's no choice but to do this. <\/blockquote> <p>She finished by saying that she did not have any fight left in her.<\/p><p>I am sure the Minister of State has been made aware of similar cases.  I could give her many other examples of what families are facing and how they are desperate for answers for their loved ones.  Solutions must be found.  There is a generation of young children not getting early intervention.  I hope the Minister of State can bring something to them that will make a difference and allow their families to breathe once again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021041900002#E00200","speaker":"1684"},{"type":"speech","time":1618824600,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I wish to thank Senator Wall for raising these important issues today and for sharing the heartfelt pleas of Aileen and Nicola for support.<\/p> <p>Both the Government and the HSE recognise the challenges in meeting the demand for children's disability services and are acutely conscious of how this impacts on children and their families in these most difficult and challenging times.  Nationally, children's disability services are undergoing significant change as the HSE progresses towards the reconfiguration of services into children's disability network teams under the national programme, Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People, for those aged up to 18 years.  The key mission for this programme is to provide a clear pathway and fairer access to services for each child with a disability and his or her family based on his or her need and not on his or her diagnosis or where he or she lives or goes to school.  <\/p> <p>South Kildare, in conjunction with the rest of County Kildare and west Wicklow, was reconfigured under this programme in 2014.  Consideration is now being given to realigning the Kildare-west Wicklow children's disability network teams with the community healthcare networks which were not in place at the time of the reconfiguration in 2014.  The remainder of CHO 7, where south Kildare is based, should be reconfigured by the end of June 2021.  This reconfiguration will improve access to services and waiting times for intervention.<\/p> <p>The vision for children's disability services going forward is to have easy access to the services children require, fairness in providing services and families and health services and schools working together to support children in developing their potential.  This will result in consistency and equity in delivering disability services for children and young people.  <\/p> <p>Significant additional resources have already been redirected to the assessment of need process in CHO 7 to work through the backlog of applications.  This project is addressing the backlog to deliver assessments to each child as quickly as possible.  There are a number of disciplines working on the backlog, including psychology, speech and language therapy and occupational therapy, enabling assessments to be fully completed as quickly as possible.  It is expected that all diagnostic assessments will be completed by the teams by the end of May 2021.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has put a huge amount of time and effort into trying to deal with the waiting list for the assessments of need.  Huge progress has been made.  It is expected that all diagnostic assessments will have been completed by the teams by the end of May 2021.<\/p> <p>Clearing the assessment of need backlog is important because it will ensure that resources can be targeted to provide the appropriate therapeutic interventions children and young people need.  Funding for an additional 100 new therapy posts was allocated as part of budget 2021.  Some of these posts are allocated to CHO 7 and it is expected that a number of them will be in place by the end of quarter 2.  This will also help to strengthen service provision in the region.<\/p> <p>I trust that this clarifies the issue raised  by the Senator.

These service improvements, which I referred to in my earlier contribution, will ensure better access to services for all children who need supports.  I know from working closely with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, in the Department of Health that she meets each area lead on disability services in each CHO on a regular basis.  Two CHOs have already met their target of seeing all children who are waiting for an assessment of needs.  The Minister of State expects, notwithstanding the difficulties with Covid and face-to-face interactions, that all should be met by the end of May.  I have no doubt that with the 100 extra therapists put in place, this should happen.<\/p><p>The critical need for and importance of disability supports for people and their families at this unique time in our history are acknowledged.  The impact of Covid on people's lives continues to be significant.  The primary objectives of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, and the Government as a whole are to restore face-to-face services and ensure continuity of services in a safe way for children and adults.  The common goal of families, health services, schools, public representatives and society is to work together to support and empower children in developing their full potential.  It is also important to point out, because the issue got a lot of traction in the news in recent weeks, that the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has agreed with the HSE to pause the removal of therapists from all special schools who deliver on-site therapy while further engagement takes place.  I should note, on behalf of the Minister of State, that this work has been done.  I will bring the Senators' comments on the letters back to the Minister and I thank them for their time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021041900002#F00300","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Homes Support Scheme","time":1618824600,"counter":26,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021041900002#G00150"},{"type":"speech","time":1618824600,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for being in the House to take this very important Commencement debate on the fair deal scheme, which is a good scheme when it works but for farm families and the families of small business owners the system is anything but fair.  I welcome the support the Minister of State has given on ensuring that elderly people can stay at home and access extra home care hours.  It is very important to do everything we can to avoid older people having to go into nursing homes.  Some people will still need to have extra care that cannot be provided at home.  It is very traumatic for any family when someone has to go into a nursing home to receive that level of care.  It is made even worse when the family runs the risk of losing a family farm or business to pay for necessary care.  We can imagine the anxiety it causes to older people and their families.<\/p> <p>While fair deal is a lifeline for many, farmers and small business owners have been treated very harshly under the current conditions of the scheme.  As we know, under the scheme an annual levy of 7.5% on farmland applies to all elderly farmers for every year they avail of long-term nursing care.  For most people, this 7.5% per annum levy is limited to the first three years of the nursing home care but farmers and business owners face indefinite contributions on their assets, which in some cases threatens the very viability of their farm or business.  This clearly discriminates against the agricultural community and causes terrible hardship for young farmers who hope to inherit farmland.  It renders non-viable many farm holdings in rural Ireland.  This needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  A review was done in 2015 but the previous Government did not do anything in response to it.  The matter is now under the watch of the Minister of State and I hope she will be able to do something about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021041900002#G00200","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1618824600,"counter":28,"content":"<p>The fair deal scheme at its heart should be fair.

The 7% is deducted annually, meaning that someone who is in nursing home care for up to 14 years will lose the farm completely.  That is not something that anyone wants to see.<\/p><p>The scheme's true impact is that older people are not going into nursing home care when they need to.  This is not because of greed or a desire to hold on.  Rather, it is because they fear they will lose everything that they have worked to build and put together over their lives - the family farms and small businesses that are their legacies &ndash; and that they want to hand on to the next generation.  The fear of losing their legacies is putting pressure on elderly people at a stage in their lives when they must make a choice and should not have such stress.  They are choosing not to go into nursing home care because of their fear that their farms or small businesses will not be there to hand on to the next generation.  That is the crux of the issue.<\/p><p>A promise has been given to make changes.  There is a proposal on the table to cap the contribution made by the family farm or small business to nursing home care at three years.  That would be a fair outcome.  The Minister of State has committed to delivering on this promise and many farming families and small business owners across the country are waiting and hoping to see its delivery in the near future.

As they will know from working with me over recent years, this matter is close to my heart.<\/p> <p>The House will be aware that the fair deal scheme is a system of financial support for those in need of long-term nursing home care.  It aims to ensure that such care is accessible to and affordable by everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.  The scheme was introduced in 2009 and is built on the premise of fairness and equity, but there are always some unintended consequences.  Unfortunately, those have affected farmers and small business owners whose loved ones have been in nursing homes for in excess of three years.<\/p> <p>Participants in the scheme contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The less one has, the less one pays and the more one has, the more one pays.  That is fair.  Under the scheme, the capital value of an individual's principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of his or her time in care.  During my work on the legislation, it was interesting to note that, as of November 2020, the average length of stay was 3.3 years but that 37% of all persons in the scheme left it within six months of entry.  That said, we want to make the scheme as fair as possible for those who are in nursing homes in excess of three years so that they can afford to stay there.<\/p> <p>It is recognised that the scheme in its current form does not place caps on the financial assessment of family-owned and operated farms or businesses when calculating the means to pay for nursing home care.  Under existing provisions, caps only apply in cases of sudden illness or disability.  I well appreciate that this may place a potentially onerous burden on family successors and could challenge the future viability of these productive assets.  The imminent legislative amendment to the scheme seeks to address this issue by introducing additional safeguards in the scheme to protect further the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation of the family.<\/p> <p>The change to the scheme proposed by the Department of Health is to cap financial contributions based on farm and business assets at three years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset.  This change was approved by the Government and underwent pre-legislative scrutiny in the previous D&aacute;il.  Unfortunately, progress on the development of the Bill was negatively impacted by the dissolution of that D&aacute;il and the Covid-19 pandemic.  The response to the pandemic has been and continues to be a national and public health priority.  When I was appointed last July, though, this matter was one of the priorities that I wanted to progress as quickly as possible.  I thank the Attorney General for all his support in that regard.  A team was put in place in my office last November or December to work on this issue.  We have finally come to a conclusion, which is welcome.  Officials in my Department and draftspersons in the Office of the Attorney General have been working intensively.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Mary Butler:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2445\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2445&amp;amp;pid=MaryButler&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am pleased to say a finalised draft of the Bill has now been signed by the Attorney General.

This is quite a technical Bill, although people might think it is not.  There are 26 sections in it.  The Attorney General went back to the drafters in the Department of Health seeking 136 clarifications, so there is quite a bit of work on the question of a successor, who is working a farm and all the details that have to be put in place.  That is also the case with small businesses.  In some cases there are operations that function with small businesses and farmers.  There was quite a bit of technical work.<\/p> <p>Strategic reform of the model of delivery of care for older people is currently under way in pursuit of the policy goal of supporting older people to remain living independently in their own homes and communities for as long as possible, as I have always sought, with the correct wrap-around supports.  This will involve a demonstrable shift in the provision of care from hospitals to community settings and significant investment has been made in intermediate care and home supports in 2021 to advance this goal.  Nevertheless, long-term residential care is part of an overall continuum of care and will, at a certain point, be a necessary option for many older people in order to meet their healthcare needs.<\/p> <p>The Covid-19 pandemic has brought into sharp focus the vulnerabilities of many older people, especially those living in long-term residential care.

They can also experience sensory overloads, which can be overwhelming.<\/p> <p>Mainstream schools and their curriculum were not the appropriate environment for these children.

This group of parents, principals and professionals, through surveys and questionnaires, helped everyone, including the NCSE, to see all these children, whether they were in the wrong environments, on reduced hours, had home tuition grants or travel long distances outside Dublin 15 and Dublin 7 to access education.  This group still knows better than anyone what the children need.<\/p><p>In February 2019, Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education and Training Board, DDLETB, came on board and offered a site for a special school at Riversdale Community College as a patron.  In April 2019, the official letter went to the then Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, outlining the insufficient special school and special class capacity in Dublin 15 for September 2019 and beyond.  In September 2019, Danu was opened.  It welcomed its first student on 28 November in temporary accommodation on the site of Hansfield Educate Together Secondary School.  Danu has worked incredibly hard to look after these children, even through Covid, caring for them and teaching them skills in an environment and a building that is not purpose-built for vulnerable children with complex needs while sharing a site with a secondary school.  Hansfield Educate Together Secondary School was only ever to be temporary accommodation, and the plan was to move to Riversdale Community College, also in temporary accommodation that would require appropriate work to make it suitable and safe while a new school building was constructed on a site beside it.  We were told that that new school building would take approximately five years.  Everyone was on board, even though the temporary accommodation would never be ideal, even though Danu is sharing a car park and vehicle access with a mainstream secondary school and even though many of these children are flight risks and require safety procedures and protections all the time.  However, it now seems that the temporary plans at Riversdale are to become permanent, to include six classrooms, a staff room, a principal's office, a secretary's office, toilets and other rooms, and that the classrooms will be smaller than they are currently because they are dealing with existing rooms.  They currently accommodate four children but that will increase to six, and the plan is for more work on the site.  They will have a separate door.  The buildings will be divided but the schools will continue to share the same site, even though the adoption of older buildings is not necessarily ideal for children with complex needs.  From a basic perspective, I am thinking about safety and windows that need to be high up.  There is a site behind the school that could accommodate a purpose-built, dedicated school building and school grounds for children with specific and complex needs.<\/p><p>I would welcome a statement on this.

Second, it is consistent with the use of a shared educational campus, which is the preferred model of the future development of educational infrastructure, where feasible.  Third, the building project is being funded under the Department's additional accommodation scheme 2021.<\/p><p>The Senator is aware that approval was granted only in February of this year for the refurbishment of 1,150 sq. m of existing permanent accommodation in Riversdale Community College for the benefit of Danu Community Special School.  She correctly outlined the various accommodation that will be included, including six general classrooms, staffroom, principal's office, general office, meeting room, multisensory room and general purpose area.  It also includes the relocation of an existing home economics room and a science laboratory, and also upgrade work to internal doors and the alarm system.  It is important to note that the project is currently at stage 2A of the architectural planning process, which is the detailed design.  Planning permission is not required for this either, and both the fire safety certificate and the disability access certificate have already been secured.  It is anticipated by Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire ETB that this project will advance to tender stage in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>I understand from the Senator's contribution that this is not ideal for the community but it is a lot of progress from where we were originally.

When vouchers were first issued for cancelled flights, if the person did not use the voucher by the expiry date, which is after one year, a refund would be issued.  Airlines then issued vouchers for a period of five years so that they would not have to pay out on them.  That was not an issue for most people because they knew they would use the voucher within that period.  Customers who have accepted vouchers from airlines under EU Regulation 261\/2004 can reject the voucher and receive cash at any point.<\/p><p>I ask for clarity and certainty to be given to the travelling public and also to travel agents who are receiving calls and emails from people.  The issue relates to travel agents and members of the travelling public who have been dealing with airlines in terms of the honouring of vouchers when the 12 months are up.  As many of us know, this time last year we thought we would not be in this position with travel curtailed.  People are now looking to travel in May, June, July and August of this year and they cannot.  I ask that certainty and clarity be given to members of the travelling public regarding EU law and its relationship to the people here in Ireland in terms of the five-year expiry date.  Clarity should also be given to travel agents whose clients have been given a one-year extension.  Could that be extended to five years?  The customer, under EU Regulation 261\/2004, retains the right to a cash refund.<\/p><p>I am calling on the airlines to be fair and honest with people in terms of the honouring of vouchers.  I ask them to be flexible and work with the IATA and its customers regarding the matter.  The website <i>flightrights.ie<\/i>is where people can find their entitlements and what can and cannot be done.  I appeal to the airlines and the Government to ensure that the rights of the travelling public are upheld.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I also make an appeal for the expiry dates for airline vouchers to be extended and for a flexible approach to be taken in this regard.

Many analysts are predicting that it will take several years for the sector to return to 2019 levels.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, has met all key aviation stakeholders and her officials continue to engage with airports and airlines.  She remains concerned that the current uncertainty around international travel, as well as the less positive prospects for summer 2021 than all of us would have hoped for, are leaving Irish consumers exposed to financial loss as a result of complying with public health guidelines.  The impact and strain of the current trading environment on airlines and their staff are fully acknowledged.  The financial and commercial pressures that persist for so long as international travel is restricted are fully understood.<\/p> <p>The Government has responded to the crisis impacting businesses, including airlines, through varied supports such as the wage subsidy scheme, grants, low-cost loans, the commercial rates waiver, which has been extended into 2021, and deferred tax liabilities.  In addition to the economy-wide measures, on 10 November 2020, the Government announced an &euro;80 million funding package for Irish aviation.  This provided an extra &euro;48 million in supports for 2021, in addition to those announced in budget 2021 of &euro;31.3 million.<\/p> <p>In the EU, travel and transport service consumers, not just those using airlines, are protected by law, particularly in the instance of cancellations of services by the travel provider.  In the case of cancelled flights, the rules under the air passenger rights regulation, known as EU 261\/2004, are clear.  The passenger must be given the choice of a refund or alternative flights later at no extra cost.  The EU rules allow for passengers to accept a refund ordinarily by cash or bank transfer but also by way of a voucher.  The passenger must give their consent to accept a voucher rather than cash.  Once that voucher is issued by the airline, it has fulfilled its lawful obligation.<\/p> <p>The EU's passenger rights regulations do not cover situations where passengers cannot travel or want to cancel or postpone a trip on their own initiative, for example, by following Government advice not to travel.  However, the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, has taken many opportunities to impress on the main Irish airlines that their treatment of passengers who choose not to travel, for example in following Government advice, needs to be fair and reasonable.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State recently sought clarification from both Aer Lingus and Ryanair on their current rebooking policies.  She has specifically requested the airlines to set out their respective policies in respect of their voucher and rebooking options for passengers who choose not to travel under the current rules governing international air travel; how they propose to provide for future bookings by passengers should travel restrictions persist; how they propose to handle customers who previously rebooked 2020 travel likely at an extra cost for travel in 2021 or beyond; or those who previously accepted a time-limited voucher but have not yet rebooked their flight.<\/p> <p>Aer Lingus has indicated that its book-with-confidence policy, covering all flights scheduled to run until the end of 2021, as well as available to passengers up to the end of September at least, including those who may have already rebooked for a future travel date, allows customers to change their travel date free of charge, as many times as they wish up to two hours before their flight.  It also indicated that passengers may swap their booking for a voucher and that their vouchers are valid for five years.<\/p> <p>Ryanair has clarified that the expiry dates for vouchers that were issued for flight cancellations last year are being extended to enable passengers to make bookings when travel is open again.  The Minister understands from their response that rebooking can be made with no flight change fee for travel before 31 October 2021.  Ryanair has also informed the Minister that vouchers that were offered to customers whose flights were cancelled can be converted to cash at any time or can be redeemed for future bookings.<\/p> <p>While it is recognised that airlines will keep such policies under review, it is incumbent on them to ensure that they deliver on these policies in a way that is easy to access by their consumers.  In continuing dialogue with the airlines, the Minister of State will ensure that the passenger experience is kept in focus in order that the passengers can have confidence to travel with their preferred airline when the conditions allow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021041900002#N00200","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1618824600,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister's response, as well as the commitment from both Ryanair and Aer Lingus to honour the arrangements put in place for the travelling public.

We have also tried to ensure, in allowing refunds or vouchers, that the aviation sector has been able to remain in operation so that when we open up and travel is allowed, people will actually have an industry to avail of and be able to travel.  It is about supporting consumers and the sector to make sure that when people are able to travel and, hopefully, when we navigate our way through Covid-19, we will have a sector that is fit for purpose.

As she will be aware, one of the many repercussions of the lockdown policies has been the dramatic increase in the incidence of domestic violence, with vulnerable women and children bearing the brunt of it.  In light of this, I will put a few issues and questions to the Minister for her consideration.<\/p> <p>I have heard reports that the family law system further endangers women and children experiencing domestic violence.  Abusive parents can be granted unsupervised access to children.  Victims' concerns about child abuse are minimised.  Custody arrangements that escalate domestic violence can be ordered by the courts.<\/p> <p>Are there any responses from the family justice oversight group with regard to regulation and the establishment of the database of court-appointed child welfare assessors?  I understand that these assessors are unregulated currently, and that the Courts Service of Ireland does not maintain any database of them.  Simultaneously, the involvement in proceedings of the criminal courts or the family law courts in the child protection system are not unusual in families affected by domestic, sexual and gender based violence services, DSGBV.  This can lead to considerable difficulties.  A mother, for example, may be required by Tusla to leave an abusive partner to protect her children, while in family law proceedings the parental rights of the abusive partner may supersede the child's right to safety, sometimes giving rise to unsupervised access to abusive partners.  This re-traumatises the affected child or the abused mother and places them in direct conflict with welfare conditions arising from involvement with Tusla.  A conviction for violent abuse of the victimised parent, frequently the mother, may be deemed irrelevant in a custody or access case because the offence was not against the child.<\/p> <p>Can a fit-for-purpose and joined-up legal and welfare mechanism ensure that these matters are fully considered in terms of the emotional abuse element with regard to the child's welfare?  Has An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na started training officers in domestic violence refuge services to facilitate and encourage victims to report crimes?  What are the statistics on the breaching of domestic court orders under the Domestic Violence Act 2018?  How are repeat offenders being dealt with?  How many DSGBV prosecutions have there been since the pandemic began in March 2020?  How does this compare with other years?<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Sharon Keogan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Can the Minister update the House on the legislative proposal for domestic violence leave, which aims to give workers who experience domestic violence the stability they need to leave a violent relationship or to ensure the victims or their families are safe?  Professionals who provide the vital supports and services needed by women and children in their communities must be adequately resourced.  They are very much front-line workers.<\/p><p>The third DSGBV is due at the end of 2021.  Do we have the luxury of waiting until then for these findings, knowing that this problem is escalating, under-resourced and under-reported?  Can preliminary findings be published?  An audit of accommodation by Tusla is due at the end of April.  Why is it taking so long?  We know escalating violence is emerging.  It is clear we do not have enough refuge places.  Hundreds of women and children in dire need are being turned away.  What other accommodation measures are being put in place for fleeing victims?  Is a multi-annual funding model being developed at departmental level to ensure and enable proper planning and development of DSGBV services?<\/p><p>A new feature of DSGBV has emerged during the pandemic, namely, the deliberate breaching of Covid public health advice and restrictions.  This places children and adults, particularly those with underlying medical conditions and disabilities, in danger.  These offences are difficult to prove to a criminal threshold and it is equally difficult for victims to protect themselves or their children from them.  How are those allegations and complaints being dealt with?  Finally, I repeat the call for more funding for services for victims and for an increase in the number of refuge places.  What is the Government's response?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021041900002#O00300","speaker":"1664","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618824600,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising such an important issue.  Unfortunately, Covid-19 has highlighted this as an issue, although it existed long before now.  I have said many times that while we have been asked to stay at home and home is a sanctuary for us, it is anything but that for others.  It has placed additional pressure on individuals and, in particular, victims of domestic sexual violence.<\/p> <p>This is a priority for me.  Covid-19 has created unprecedented challenges, particularly for those experiencing domestic abuse and the front-line organisations that provide the support and services.  At the outset, my Department developed an inter-agency plan to address and prioritise tackling domestic abuse during the pandemic.  It is now leading efforts to try to identify lessons that can be learned.  While the work is ongoing, we are trying to ensure we can learn lessons from everything we are doing.  Domestic abuse cases continue to be prioritised by the Garda, the Courts Service and the Legal Aid Board.  The courts continue to deal with applications to renew domestic violence orders that are due to expire and to put in place arrangements to deal with matters remotely.  Under Operation Faoiseamh in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, garda&iacute; are working to ensure victims of domestic abuse are supported and protected at this time.  The Senator will be aware of the work being done in County Meath by Garda Stacey Looby and others to highlight domestic violence and to raise funds for vital organisations locally.  In this area, I welcome recent convictions for coercive control.  This is something we have seen for the first time in the past few months.  I hope that as more convictions follow, others will feel confident to come forward and tell their story.<\/p> <p>Through the Still Here campaign, my Department is working with front-line service providers, continuing to tell them that services are still available regardless of the level of restrictions and, in particular, that restrictions on movement do not apply to people seeking help as a result of domestic abuse.  We will continue to convey that message, and I stress it today.  We are also providing Covid-specific funding to organisations working in the area of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence to help during this difficult time.  That is separate from funding that would normally be provided for these organisations.<\/p> <p>How we best provide for the physical and emotional needs of victims into the future is an absolute priority.  The Justice Plan 2021, which I launched a few months ago, is a detailed action plan for delivering our five high-level goals.  One of these goals is to strengthen community safety, reduce re-offending and support victims and to combat domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  One of the key actions being undertaken is an audit, which the Senator mentioned, of how domestic, sexual and gender-based violence policy and services are organised under the Government.  This work, together with the audit of accommodation, is being undertaken by Tusla and work is being done to implement the \"Supporting A Victim's Journey\" plan.  All three of these will provide the analysis that is necessary to ensure we address any gaps in our national approach and to ensure that it is effective and, most importantly, victim-centred.  The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, and I met the auditors last week and we look forward to receiving the report shortly.<\/p> <p>I will refer to a few points the Senator mentioned.  Under the \"Supporting A Victim's Journey\" plan, I met the implementation group and the community and voluntary sector last week.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Helen McEntee:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2394\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> The Senator raised a point regarding family courts, namely, that civil and criminal proceedings often take place at the same time when there is no connection between them.  We are very conscious of that and would like to address it but it is difficult.  For the reasons outlined by the Senator, we need to ensure those two elements of the courts speak to each other and there is engagement between the group implementing the Supporting a Victim's Journey report and the family justice oversight group, which is doing substantial work to try to overhaul the family justice structure.<\/p><p>With regard to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na training, the garda&iacute; involved in the divisional service protective units, all of which have been rolled out, have all received their training.  Work is under way to ensure all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na receive updated training on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.<\/p><p>We are working on a model that would see organisations receive funding on a multiannual basis.  This is part of the task of mapping a victim's journey, where we identified what supports are available, how they are being provided, where there are gaps and how we can provide further funding and support for these organisations to increase funding.  This will obviously require a commitment of longer than one year, which is why we are looking at multiannual funding.  I will come back on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021041900002#P00200","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618824600,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and extend every good wish to her and her husband, Paul.

Much more work needs to be done on this matter.

The work we are doing to support victims through Covid-19 will continue as long as it is needed.

Once again, yet another woman has died in this country because of domestic violence and the violence of a man - her partner, someone she trusted and knew.  She leaves behind her two children, family, friends and neighbours, who are all devastated by her loss.  I take this opportunity to extend my deepest sympathies to her family, friends and children on their huge loss.  I am glad to see that the perpetrator, Gavin Murphy, her partner, has been charged and will face the full rigour of the law for his actions.<\/p> <p>Today marks the beginning of Reusable Nappy Week.  It is quite a novel idea.  Many people will have raised eyebrows - possibly some sceptical eyebrows.  I would have been the same.  I commend the work of my colleague on Meath County Council, Councillor Deirdre Geraghty-Smith, on her campaign on this issue.  She became a first-time mother a number of months ago and, to her credit, is using cloth nappies full time.  She has done much work and research on this.  We are all very familiar with disposable nappies.  I must put my hands up because I used these with my son.  I was not educated or informed about the other options but thanks to Councillor Geraghty-Smith, I am now and it is something I would love to try if the opportunity arose again.  Disposable nappies have been around since the 1960s so we have all been in them and used them but they largely comprise wood pulp, plastic, which is the key, and many chemicals used to form what is called the absorbent layer.  Following a recent study of 4,000 nappies in France, manufacturers were issued with a warning by the French health agency, which found that the nappies contained elements of a dangerous chemical called glyphosate.   Glyphosate is probably best known to people as the main ingredient in the weedkiller Roundup so that was certainly a shock to me.  The figures are startling and speak for themselves.  It is estimated that in Ireland, more than 600,000 plastic nappies are disposed of in household waste every day.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lisa Chambers:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This year alone, the most conservative estimates indicate that 75 million nappies could end up in household waste.  That is a colossal figure.  Each nappy takes between 200 and 500 years to break down in landfill and each baby is estimated to generate between 3,000 and 5,000 nappies from birth to potty.  This equates to 2.5 tonnes of single-use plastic waste per child.  In fact, more than half the household waste in a family with just one baby comprises nappies.  Those figures floored me.  <\/p><p>Other countries, as often is the case, have moved ahead of us.  A good example is the UK, where many local authorities are proactively supporting the switch to cloth nappies by offering so-called cloth nappy libraries where parents can hire kits, running awareness campaigns, providing grant schemes and offering cash back to parents who purchase the cloth nappy system.  In addition, they offer advice and support to parents.  That is what is needed when starting out, to know this is doable and is not as big a task as one might think.  Again, this is something I learned from talking to Councillor Geraghty-Smith and her experience over the past number of months with her baby girl.<\/p><p>Councillor Geraghty-Smith is a full-time working mother.  She did her research, got organised and managed it.  She says it is a very easy and green way of doing things.

It was absolutely horrific listening to those two women this morning.<\/p> <p>Over the weekend, I was contacted by a number of people in Northern Ireland with respect to what is expected to be a week of rioting and violence by young unionist men, particularly.  The way the message was put to me last night was that the old guard has lost control and these young guys are out on the street.  The comments I listened to this morning from Deputy Mary Lou McDonald of Sinn F&eacute;in, and her apology regarding Lord Mountbatten, were really welcome.  All these things change the perception of how we are seen in the Republic.  There is a need for the European Union to engage directly with the political parties in Northern Ireland.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs could facilitate that type of engagement.<\/p> <p>I understand the sensitivities of the alleged border down the Irish Sea.  I understand how some deeply committed unionists feel it is an attack on them.  I compliment Northern republicans, at this stage, for maintaining their counsel and not getting involved in the spat that is going on up there.  The people who contacted me over the weekend are extremely concerned at what is taking place.  They think it will not take an awful lot to tip it back to where it was in the bad old days.  Thankfully, one side of that equation is very measured in their movements at the moment.  However, these young men apparently feel they can do better than their forefathers with respect to maintaining the union.<\/p> <p>I ask the Leader to discuss this particular issue with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and ask if there is a way we can bring Northern politicians to Brussels to engage directly with the Commission and see whether we can find a way around this problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021041900002#V00200","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speech","time":1618824600,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that No. 13 be taken before No. 1.

I acknowledge that the Leader has arranged a debate with the Minister on the forthcoming gambling legislation on Friday next.  I also acknowledge that colleagues on every side of this House have spoken previously of the urgent need for legislation on gambling to be enacted.  However, I am asking that this House supports this legislation which, in my party's opinion and in the opinion of those working with those who have developed a gambling addiction, is urgently needed.<\/p><p>A 2019 survey estimated that as a country we spend &euro;9.8 billion on gambling every year - the seventh highest per head of population in the world and the equivalent of &euro;379.51 for every person in this country.  Over the past number of months and in advance of introducing this Bill, I have spoken to so many people who have lost their homes and their families because of their gambling addiction and debt.  They would tell you that they are still tempted by these advertisements that they read on their laptops and on their mobile phones, and, indeed, in the newspapers.  Recently, we in the Labour Party, in advance of introducing this Bill, carried out our own survey, called \"Beat the Ads\".  The results were worrying, indicating that 75% of respondents knew somebody who had a problem with gambling.  The results of this survey indicate that 80% of respondents have noticed an increase in the number of gambling advertisements.  Other surveys have found that there is a 75% chance of seeing a gambling advertisement during any sports event being shown on our television screens.  These are odds that nobody should have to face while enjoying sport.  The issue here is, of course, that the gambling companies have tried with much success to normalise the relationship between sport and gambling.  They want us to think it is okay to have a bet, that all one's friends are doing it, it is a great social occasion and one will not enjoy that match, race or any sporting event unless one has a bet.  The reality is, of course, that those who develop a gambling habit most of the time gamble in complete isolation, keeping their addiction away from their loved ones with the reality of the problem only coming to light, the experts will tell you, when it is too late and much damage and heartache has already been done.<\/p><p>Of course, my party's Bill does not set out to ban those who want and can afford to have a bet.  It is, however, an attempt to break the stranglehold that the gambling companies have on how we enjoy sport in this country.  It is an attempt to reduce the normalisation of sport and betting that these companies send through our screens and print in ever increasing numbers.  We need to protect our younger population and an ever increasing percentage of our female population who are being targeted by gambling companies day in, day out.  I look forward to Members supporting this Bill and ensuring its passage through the Oireachtas as quickly as possible.  I also look forward to the Minister coming before us on Friday to debate this and many other problems in this industry at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021041900002#V00300","speaker":"1684","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618824600,"counter":68,"content":"<p>First, I want to cover the great news today from the Minister, Deputy Ryan's Department, and the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton's, office regarding support for regional airports.  There will be &euro;6.3 million allocated to Shannon Airport at a time there has been zero flights, which, in itself, causes considerable hassle for regional tourism in the area because it is one of the main ways people come in to visit the west coast.  It is great news today.  It is positive, not only for the airport but for the entire region because so much depends on that.  I also welcome the fact that they will be able to use it for flexibility to roll out incentives, charge rebates and in consultation with airlines with a view to support recovery and growth of connectivity.  That is important because we have to get back to where we were at least.  We also have to look at the balance between Dublin flights and flights to other regional airports, including Shannon.  At present, more than 90% of flights that are coming into Dublin come in and just leave the country.  There is such good value to be given to flights coming in to other regional airports.  It is also less of a carbon footprint, for example, to land in Shannon Airport.  I welcome that great news today of &euro;6.3 million for Shannon Airport, and other regional airports also benefiting.<\/p> <p>The second issue I wanted to raise only came to my attention on Friday.  I was talking to an academic about an academic matter in Galway and she ended up almost breaking down in the middle of the conversation over nothing to do with what we were talking about.  She is a new mother.  She has been breastfeeding her child for the past six months and she has struggled repeatedly with that.  On her most recent visit to her GP, her own doctor was not there and a second doctor came in.  He told her she was mad, that she should have given that up ages ago and at four months you should give up and get the solids going.  I got so mad.  My son is 22 since Saturday.  We fought for and supported breastfeeding rights back in the day, with La Leche League and other groups.  Twenty-one years ago I was at this craic and to think that a doctor in this day and age can say that to a woman makes me so mad.  Not only is breastfeeding best, it can be challenging, which is why one should never discourage a woman from doing it.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RoisinGarvey&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->They need all of the encouragement in the world.  Often women give up because they think they are failing.  They are not failing but it is difficult, sometimes, to establish; it took me six weeks.  There is a myth that it is best and therefore is easy but that is not the case.  We need to get the message out that while breastfeeding is best, it can be challenging at the beginning but if one perseveres, one will succeed.  The fact that a GP in this day and age would be in any way discouraging a woman from breastfeeding, as long as she wants to, is just appalling.  We must nip that in the bud.  It is 2021, for God's sake.  The main reason the female body of any animal has breasts is to feed its young.  I cannot believe that in this day and age we still have qualified people giving such ridiculously bad misinformation.  It is important to note that breastfeeding is much cheaper than bottle feeding.  It saves money and makes women feel good about themselves because they are doing the right thing for their child.  It is also much healthier and much more hygienic.  In 2021 we need to put a stop to any myths around breastfeeding and say that not only is it the best thing, it is better for the mother and the child.  Everybody should be encouraging mothers to breastfeed.  We need to stop throwing money at multinationals and their brands like SMA and Cow &amp;amp; Gate for the gack they are making and pushing on people all over the world.  We have to stop that and represent the rest of the world.  We are a developed country and we know what is best.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021041900002#W00200","speaker":"1659","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618824600,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I do not want to dwell on this topic but this is my first opportunity to raise, since the break for Easter, the disturbances that took place in Belfast last week and the week before.  I want to use this platform in the Seanad today to thank those community, youth, political and church leaders who put themselves out on the ground to try to ease and resolve intercommunity tensions.  In one example on the Springfield Road, political, community and youth leaders dismantled a barricade by hand.  We also saw them form a human chain to keep young people away from being drawn into violence at interface areas.  They are an absolute credit and a lifeline in terms of what they do, regardless of the macropolitics that some allege are at play here.  Without those people on the front line and at the grassroots, the situation would be much worse.<\/p> <p>I wish to touch very briefly on Senator Craughwell's point.  It is really important to remember that members of the loyalist community, the same as the republican and nationalist community, have a vote and they elect the DUP and the UUP to represent them.  The protocol that we have was delivered as a result of their Brexit.  I have been involved for a long time in cross-community engagement and will always champion that and advocate for it but we must put all of this into perspective.  We cannot be using inflammatory language or, even inadvertently, raising concerns about the protocol because these were isolated incidents.  The groups involved in this are criminal gangs and drug dealers.  They are misusing and abusing young people by putting them out onto the street and placing them in great danger.  The place to negotiate and talk is via our elected representatives in this instance, at the Executive, the North-South Ministerial Council and any other table that is available.  <\/p> <p>On a completely different note, I want to wish a belated happy 80th birthday to President Higgins and a belated happy birthday to Senator Garvey's son.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021041900002#X00200","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1618824600,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Two great Clare people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021041900002#X00300","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1618824600,"counter":72,"content":"<p>That might be a controversial comment.<\/p> <p>We are all very proud of President Higgins and have a deep affinity with him.

Again, we are talking about domestic violence against women and it honestly is really shocking.<\/p><p>I wish to talk about the findings published last week by the Health Research Board in its report entitled Alcohol consumption, alcohol-related harm and alcohol policy in Ireland.  At a time when the health service is almost at breaking point due to the pandemic, it is interesting to establish the huge strains that problematic drinking puts on our resources.  Alcohol is responsible for three deaths every day and for up to 40,000 alcohol-related hospital discharges every year.  During this pandemic the stress and pressure on people is sometimes overwhelming and can lead to increased alcohol consumption.  There has been a marked increase in reports of domestic abuse, as I highlighted earlier.  A survey of violence against women in 28 European states, including Ireland, found that prevalence of physical and sexual violence by a current partner was significantly higher among partners of women who got drunk frequently.<\/p><p>Alcohol-related harm can also affect persons other than the drinker, especially family members, which is an area in which I am specifically interested.  The stress and suffering experienced by family members, especially during this pandemic, has been exacerbated by the lockdowns.  I am familiar with this from my own organisation, the RISE Foundation; which has a huge list of family members who are waiting to get into our services.  An interesting figure is that the total estimated cost of alcohol's cost to others was &euro;863 million and this does not include the costs that do not have monetary value, such as fear, pain, suffering and loss of quality of life.<\/p><p>Another interesting fact in this report is that the public has a very poor knowledge of the health conditions related to alcohol, including cancer.  This lack of knowledge could be offset if the introduction of alcohol health warning labels, as provided for in the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018, was implemented.  On that point, I received a text message this morning from Ms Paula Leonard from the national community action on alcohol network.  She also highlighted that there are three groups they were particularly worried about.  The first is young people, who need more effective age verification at point of sale and point of delivery.  Second, delivery to intoxicated persons may pose a risk to themselves or others as it is impossible to gauge intoxication with phone or Internet sales.  The third group is delivery drivers.  This all concerns delivery of alcohol at the moment and off-licences that are delivering.<\/p><p>The health of the people could be significantly improved if policies were introduced to reduce <i>per capita <\/i>alcohol consumption.  Alcohol consumption can only be reduced if policies which increase the price of alcohol, restrict its availability and reduce its promotion and advertising are introduced.  I know, from being a campaigner for the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018, that there was a lot of pressure exerted by vested interests to try to prevent the Bill becoming law.  I now call on the Minister for Health to implement all the outstanding provisions of the Act as it would be of great benefit to people's health and would dramatically relieve pressure on our health service.  My colleague Senator Seery Kearney will probably talk more about the delivery and what is happening around that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021041900002#Y00200","speaker":"1632"},{"type":"speech","time":1618824600,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I welcome the recent decision by An Taoiseach that there be a review of the North-South interconnector.

From what I am hearing from the community, as I am sure the Leader is, the people of the affected areas are annoyed, angered and feel they are being discriminated against because all major projects of this nature have been put underground except this one.

A significant number of early years services located in some of the most disadvantaged parts of the city, and throughout the country, that work with children coming from these challenging backgrounds, now face the prospect of having to turn away some of these children and not cater for children who need these services the most.  The reason is the new national childcare scheme fails to support adequately the children of parents who do not work and children whose parents do not work but are seeking work at this point in time.  Many will say the whole point of a childcare scheme is to support families who work but this ignores the reality of the experience of the most disadvantaged families in the State.<\/p> <p>The new national childcare scheme threatens to undermine years of incredible work by many services, particularly in the area I am most familiar with, which is Dublin's north inner city, and in other parts of the country.  They provide services that are vital to the development and care of these children.  As one service memorably informed me, it was established in the early 1920s to support the poorest children in the city.  It survived the onslaught of the Black and Tans but may not survive the new national childcare scheme.  This is how bad it is for services now facing the prospect of having to close, particularly after-school services.  I call for the Minister with responsibility for children to come to the House to account for the design of the new national childcare scheme, undertake a review of the scheme and do what was done in the past, which is to put in place specific provisions for these services that look after the most disadvantaged children and families in the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021041900002#BB00200","speaker":"1683"},{"type":"speech","time":1618824600,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I extend my sympathies to the family of Jennifer Poole.

It has not gone away and has been compounded by the pandemic.

Everyone in the Oireachtas must use this term to do all we can to address this crisis of affordability and supply.  I urge every Senator to engage on two game-changing Bills, those being, the affordable housing Bill and the Land Development Agency Bill.  Under the latter, the Land Development Agency will work with local authorities, approved housing bodies, AHBs, and NGOs to deliver social and affordable homes.  The affordable housing Bill has the potential to double the number of social and affordable homes that are delivered in private developments and give local authorities the power to deliver affordable homes for purchase and rent.  I urge every Senator to engage with and support these Bills.<\/p><p>We must go further, though.  We must ensure that every local authority completes a housing needs assessment urgently and sets targets for the next three, five and ten years for the delivery of affordable homes for purchase and rent.  The Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Housing, Local Government and Heritage must accelerate the approval process and reduce it to six months for every application they receive from local authorities for social and affordable homes.<\/p><p>I will finish on my next point.  The Cathaoirleach is being patient, but it is important.  The Minister for Finance must introduce a tax on the vacant properties that the Leader and I know are in Dublin.  Given that there is a housing crisis, it is unacceptable that there are vacant residential properties.  I urge the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to use some of the moneys that will not be used in the serviced site fund to give a grant to convert vacant properties in rural towns and urban centres to residential use.  Will he also update the rural housing guidelines?  They have not been updated since Fianna F&aacute;il was last in power.  Now that we have a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister with responsibility for housing, it would be appropriate that the rural housing guidelines be updated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021041900002#BB00300","speaker":"1656","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618824600,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I echo the advocacy of my colleague, Senator Black, regarding the action that needs to be taken to support the work of the Irish Community Action on Alcohol Network, ICAAN, in particular.  Last week's report by the Health Research Board contained shocking statistics.  There was a doubling of alcohol-related discharges from hospitals, a trebling of cases of alcohol-related liver disease and an average of three deaths per day related to alcohol in the country.  That is frightening.<\/p> <p>For nearly a year, I have been advocating on changing the legislation on alcohol deliveries to homes or addressing the practice through regulation, which is possible.  Experts in the field predict that a tsunami is approaching of people who have relapsed from their alcohol abstinence and are using alcohol as a coping mechanism during this period.  Could we at least arrest deliveries to homes where there is no checking of IDs or the capacity of the person receiving the alcohol to take it on board?  Unfortunately, it is not unlawful currently.  These types of checks are exhibited by supermarkets carrying out deliveries or in off-licences or pubs.<\/p> <p>With the support of Ms Constance Cassidy, SC, and Mr. David Dodd, both of whom have volunteered their services from the Law Library, ICAAN has identified where the regulations could be changed.  I support its work and call on the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, to address this issue as quickly as possible.  He is open to doing so.  We need to address alcohol consumption and alcohol deliveries.<\/p> <p>I thank the Minister for Health for last week changing the arrangements around families involved in surrogacy coming home from Ukraine.

The article rightly pointed out the absolute need for microchipping and to encourage all dog owners to ensure that their family pets are microchipped.  It is not only the law, it is also the single best step that people can take to ensure that they can be reunited with their pets if they are stolen or lost.  I encourage anybody who has not had their dog microchipped to get it done.  The article to which I refer did not, however, state that the current microchipping system is not fit for purpose and must be improved.  We have four separate databases in this regard that are not linked to each other.  Many pet owners are also not aware of the need to update the database when their pet dies, either through euthanasia or as a result of an accident, for example.  Therefore we do not even have a complete audit of the number of dogs in the country.  It is the same with the information on the Europetnet.  I ask people if they want a dog to go to a rescue centre but if they buy online, they are advised to check the Europetnet database.  All that database indicates is that the animal is a dog.  There is no description or indication of age or gender.  It is not fit for purpose.<\/p> <p>It is the law in this country for dog owners to have licences for their animals and to have them microchipped but the two items of legislation are completely separate and do not work together.  I could go to the An Post website today to get a dog licence without having to include the microchip details of my dog.  I have been informed by animal welfare organisations which deal with this matter on a daily basis that individuals are obtaining dog licences hours before going to animal welfare offices to try to claim ownership of dogs.

This follows the decisions of Ulster Bank to do the same and of Bank of Ireland to close 88 of its branches in our State later this year, causing much distress in many Irish towns.  As it is clear that private banking is not serving us well, it is time to reconsider our options.  Public banking has been a policy of the Green Party for a long time.  In 2019 the Indecon report on public banking stated there was no need for a public bank because the level of competition in the Irish market was so strong.  This, however, is clearly not the case any more.  Before that, in 2018, the Government of the day commissioned the Local Public Banking in Ireland report, which, interestingly to me, examined the possibility of piloting such a bank in the midlands, suggesting it should be headquartered in Mullingar, with branches in Tullamore, Port Laoise, Athlone and Longford.  We should consider such a pilot.  The midlands in particular have had a tough time of it in recent years.  Public banks keep money in a community.  What is generated there stays there and is pumped back into new ventures or expansions.  Credit unions already do this to an extent but are limited in their ability to function as banks.  An Post also offers a range of financial services but they are similarly limited.  A full public banking system could remove the barriers to microbusinesses, which are often turned down for credit.  I am talking about the local caf&eacute; or hairdresser, those enterprises we have missed so much during this lockdown and which have suffered badly.  Think also of new tourism ventures such as bike hire or small food-producing enterprises.  Public banking allows for greater financial inclusion, and this has been linked to stronger, more sustainable economic growth.  This is why so many countries support public banking.  Public banks are already a successful part of the banking sector in 21 EU countries.  In fact, the well-known German system of Sparkassen has been operating successfully since the late 1700s.<\/p> <p>No doubt there will be much discussion about the future of Irish banking in light of these recent developments, and a banking forum involving all stakeholders, including the Department of Finance, would be a good place to start.  Public banking needs to be part of that discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021041900002#EE00100","speaker":"1661"},{"type":"speech","time":1618824600,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I agree with the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, on the proposal of a public bank.

A lot of work can be done in advance of the tourism sector's reopening.  This work is critical and we need a debate on it.  In the first instance, Shannon Heritage last year faced quite an amount of uncertainty.  This has not been clarified; the uncertainty continues this year.  We learned recently that the head of operations has now moved on from Shannon Heritage.  We need clarity on the future of Shannon Heritage.  We need to know whether it will remain with the Shannon Group or whether it will move to the Office of Public Works, OPW, which would be a far more appropriate home, with the knowledge, infrastructure and marketing capability for Shannon Heritage to achieve its potential.  Similarly, we have no clarity whatsoever regarding the position of the chair of the board of Shannon Group.  The last incumbent, who lasted a day, resigned in the middle of February.  We are now towards the end of April and we still have no clarity whatsoever as to who will take up this extremely important role in chartering the future of Shannon Airport, which in turn will drive the economic development of the entire midwest region, including County Clare.<\/p> <p>Finally, many of the Government measures for the hospitality and tourism industry are welcome, including the announcement of funding for restaurants and so on to buy infrastructure for outside dining and to become capable of outside dining and that the outside areas of their premises would be brought into use for outside catering.  However, this funding needs to extend to all establishments doing food.  The position regarding pubs is absolutely ridiculous, many of which throughout the tourism areas of Clare, Kerry and other parts of the country provide dining and catering facilities.

Having seen the departure of KBC Bank from significant parts of the Irish market and following the planned closure of quite a number of retail bank branches, it is very clear we are lacking competition in the Irish market.  We know that Irish consumers are already paying interest rates roughly double those of other European countries.  Therefore, I welcome the call for a full debate around banking and finance in Ireland.  However, it needs to be broader.  As part of that, we need to give the Central Bank specific statutory responsibility for promoting competition across the financial services market.  The Central Bank does not at present have that power to try to ensure we have competition.<\/p> <p>If the forum on banking is only comprised of the traditional players, it will be a failure.  We need it to be much broader.  I worry that if it is the traditional players, it will be like getting horse and cart owners to debate how we make horses go faster while the motor car is being developed at the same time.  It is essential that we have consumers in there and, if anything, teenagers and those in their 20s have a greater idea around where the financial markets are and where the products are going.  That is part of the debate we need to have.  If we look at where the rapid growth is happening in the Irish banking market, with Revolut, N26 and digital accounts, what consumers are looking for is to be able to make instant payments, and the banking sector here has not responded to that.  We need a debate around the adoption of the digital euro because Europe is falling behind.  I am particularly looking at what is happening in China with regard to the introduction of a digital currency there and what has happened with WeChat and Alipay.  We are not competing at a sufficient level in Europe.<\/p> <p>With regard to financial literacy, in the leaving certificate review we need to look at the question of the knowledge of financial literacy and taxation to be provided for students at second level.<\/p> <p>This is a crucial question for the future of this country.

We know that the national lottery provides a number of different products, from the lotto to scratch cards.  What is very important is that it also provides a social dividend for the people of Ireland.  Approximately 28 cent out of every &euro;1 that is spent on national lottery products in Ireland goes back into a good causes fund that benefits communities and people throughout the country.  That is very important.  It is not true to say that of gambling companies or private gambling outfits in the State.  Similarly, the national lottery has in place protocols to protect people who play its games, who cannot gamble after a certain time and cannot spend more than a certain amount of money every day, which is very important.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, some private gambling and bookmaking outfits in Ireland now use national lottery products to piggyback for the purposes of allowing people to bet on the outcome of the national lottery.  With that, there is no positive outcome for the taxpayer or the country.  We must prevent profiteering by those private gambling organisations which are piggybacking on the national lottery infrastructure without providing that same social dividend for the citizens and people of Ireland.  While the national lottery funds innovation, community organisations and local projects throughout this country, private bookmakers make no such altruistic contribution.  Important national and local funding is provided by the national lottery to sports, arts and culture, health and well-being, heritage, community and youth organisations.<\/p> <p>It makes no sense to me that we should continue to allow those private organisations to profit from the lotto and other products that are put in place by the national lottery.  I will be introducing the national lottery (amendment) Bill 2021, which will make it an offence for a profit-driven bookmaker to hitch a free ride with the licensed and regulated national lottery.  The Bill will also extend the provisions of the National Lottery Act 2013 to increase penalties and allow the prosecution of corporate entities, as well as individuals.<\/p> <p>We recognise that the national lottery provides a service, that it does so under licence and does so with a social dividend.

It is very welcome.  The national lottery, as an organisation, does tremendous good.  It provides enjoyment for people, notwithstanding that we have been talking about gambling and will be talking about it later this week in the Seanad.  One of the most enjoyable programmes for some of our citizens in the past year has been &quot;Telly Bingo&quot;, which is broadcast every week.

The announcement of KBC last week was yet another significant blow, not least for the customers of KBC in Ireland but particularly the 1,300 people who earn their livelihood working for that bank.  In the past ten to 15 years we have experienced a real lack of competition in banking in this country.  We have had a variety of players who were supposed to induce competition and we know that for the clients and the Irish customers, that has not materialised.  Now that the numbers of banking players here are reducing significantly it is time we revisited the report from a number of years ago in which Indecon said that the Irish society marketplace - the infrastructure - did not suit a public banking system.  That society has changed a great deal since that Indecon report was produced.  I believe there is a real need now, and Senator Hackett gave a very good example of it.  I note Mr. Noel Kinahan has, on a number of occasions, asked that a public pilot for a public banking system be conducted .  I believe it would be worthwhile for us to do that now.<\/p><p>I support the calls for a banking forum.  I would say to Senator Byrne that the only concern I have is that we tend to talk ourselves to death in this country.  What we need now is action.  We do not need another 12 or 24 months of navel-gazing and talking to ourselves about what needs to be done.  We all know what needs to be done, which is that serious competition, even if it is by the State, must be introduced into this marketplace.

Michele Rohan is a wonderful woman and a CE supervisor in Galway.  She has been doing significant work, as have all our CE supervisors for time immemorial since the programme was established.  I know from first hand that, on the ground, they actually do a hell of a lot more than what it says in their book.  It gave me great pleasure to hear there was a breakthrough and acceptance by the Ministers for Social Protection and Public Expenditure and Reform of the negotiated agreement which had been conducted over the past several years.  I wish them well and hope the CE supervisors will be happy with the proposals put to them today.  We all look forward to a speedy resolution because, by God, they have been waiting for it long enough.<\/p><p>Senator Crowe talked about the hospitality sector.  It is a real concern that many in that sector may have got employment elsewhere, if they were lucky enough.  It is nice and fills us with hope that we are now starting to talk about recovery plans for certain sectors.  I will bring the Senator's concerns to the Minister's attention.<\/p><p>I am sorry that Senator Mullen did not receive any correspondence from the Department of Health.  That is a real shame.  Archbishop Martin's comments this morning reflect the views of a large part of our society for whom worship is an incredibly important part of their lives.  It is a real shame what was done over the weekend.  I will endeavour to get the Senator a direct answer today.  I will come back to him later.<\/p><p>Senator Kyne talked about the healthcare plans in Galway.  There is a need for a debate on Sl&aacute;intecare.  I will try to arrange one as quickly as we can.

This was the first political issue in which I ever got involved.  Having run, unsuccessfully, in the general election of 2007, I recall the first meeting on this matter was held in a hotel in Trim with more than 7,000 people.  That is how long - 14 years - EirGrid has been pig-headed on this issue.  The refusal still to even acknowledge the possibility of putting the North-South interconnector underground defies logic.  The announcement last week that the Kildare-Meath line will be put underground has only served to incense those who live in Meath, Cavan and Monaghan.  I have no doubt that Senator Gallagher is right when he says EirGrid has wasted a decade.  If it does not come down off its pig-headed stance, it will be wasting another decade.  The people of Meath, Cavan and Monaghan will not accept being ignored for much longer.<\/p><p>Senators &Oacute; Donnghaile and Craughwell both raised the issue of what will be a significant week in Northern Ireland.

The former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, made a good suggestion yesterday that it might be time for an American envoy to come in, bring some clarity to the issues and find a way out of the path that people are expecting we will end up on this week.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Senator Garvey spoke about regional funding for airports.  It really is welcome.  The Senator also spoke with passion about breastfeeding.  It is something she has advocated for in excess of 20 years.  It is very annoying to think that a doctor would so easily dismiss a woman's attempts to try to breastfeed her baby by saying, \"Just get the baby onto solids\".  It defies all of the logic and all attempts by the State to try to encourage women to do it in the first place.<\/p><p>Deputy Chambers spoke about something that made me smile.  I have only one little brother, who is 12 years younger than me, so it is a long time since we had nappies in buckets and the lovely little packets that one had to bring to the toilet.  Senator Chamber's point is something about which we should seriously concern ourselves, given that our climate agenda is very topical and is on all our minds.  We should be highlighting the amount of waste caused by nappies.  Fair play to Senator Chambers for bringing the matter up.<\/p><p>I wish to talk about the two women who spoke so eloquently this morning about their experiences.  Stalking is probably one the of the most hideous and insidious things any person can do to another human being.  It goes to the root of a person's own personal security.  This is as true of being stalked online as it is true of being stalked in person.  I commend the two ladies this morning on baring their souls and allowing people to hear the realities of it.  It also highlights that we have a serious problem with sentencing in the State for crimes that we do take seriously.  It shows that maybe the State and society do not really deem the crimes to be as serious as they are for the people who have experienced them and who must live through them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021041900002#GG00100","speaker":"1653","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618824600,"counter":97,"content":"<p>Senator Mark Wall has proposed an amendment to the Order of Business: \"That No. 13 be taken before No. 1\".

Having had a debate on the Bill and given further consideration to issues raised in both this House and the D&aacute;il, the Bill is returning to this House with some Government amendments that were introduced on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il and passed through all Stages.<\/p><p>Before turning to these amendments, it might be useful to revisit briefly the purpose of the Bill, although I realise Members know and understand it.  Before the DPP <i>v<\/i>. EC case in October 2020, there was a view that section 252 of the Children Act 2001 did not prevent the publication or broadcasting of material that might identify a deceased child unless it would lead to identifying a living child who was also a victim or a child who was a witness in criminal proceedings.  Even in that instance, there were situations where that could be overruled.  The purpose of this Bill is to restore that position.  The Bill does this by disapplying or removing the restrictions on proceedings that relate to the death of a child, subject to the exceptions I have mentioned.  I will give three scenarios outlining the effect of the Bill.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Helen McEntee:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2394\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The first is that if there is a deceased child and no other child involved, then there are no restrictions on the identifying the deceased child.  Second, if there is another living child, who is perhaps an accused or a witness in the proceedings, then there are no restrictions unless naming the deceased child could identify the living child.  Third, and very importantly, after that, if naming the deceased child could identify the living child, accused or witness, then the court must decide whether the deceased child can be named and subject to what conditions.  It is not an absolute.  If naming a deceased child could potentially identify a living child, witness or victim, there will be a provision allowing for the court to decide whether it is in the best interests of that child.<\/p><p>The best interests principle does not necessarily usurp all of other interests in a case and will not always be the single overriding interest.  There may be other competing interests at stake and the court will consider these.  However, in accordance with the principle, the interests of the child must be the subject of active consideration.<\/p><p>The Bill is only concerned with section 252 of the Children Act.  Section 93 exists separately and we are not trying to amend it.  Section 93 relates to an accused child.  There are already provisions under the Children Act whereby the first response is that one does not name the accused child.  However, there can again be certain circumstances, such as public interest or otherwise, where that can be allowed.  We are not changing or amending that.  It will simply still apply.<\/p><p>Turning specifically to the amendments made in the D&aacute;il, the first two relate to subsections (1A) and (1B).  They are technical and seek to make it clear beyond doubt that any restrictions on publication only relate to the protection of the interests of living children.<\/p><p>The purpose of the third amendment is to put beyond any reasonable doubt queries that have been raised by Deputies and Senators who were specifically concerned that subsection (2A), as proposed in the Bill, might be misinterpreted or cause confusion as to the flexibility that a court has where there is a deceased child victim, and another child victim or child witness to the proceedings.  I asked the Attorney General to look at this again, and to reflect on the wording and the drafting.  It has been recommended that we make these changes to clarify the matter.  The amendment provides for the existing subsection (2) and the proposed subsection (2A) to be replaced by a new subsection (2)(a) and (b).<\/p><p>Subsection (2)(a) deals with proceedings relating to the death of a child.  The word \"shall\" is used, imposing an obligation on the court to dispense with any restrictions relating to a deceased child unless the interests of a living child who is a witness in the proceedings or an accused will be affected.  The court then has to consider the matter and, for example, assess in the case of a child witness whether there are conditions that could be imposed when naming the deceased child to protect the best interests of a living child witness.  Subsection (2)(b) deals with proceedings where there is no deceased child.  It is left to the court to decide whether it is in the best interests of a child to allow publication or broadcasting of material that might identify that child victim or witness.  If there are other child victims or witnesses involved, the court must take into account the best interests of those children.<\/p><p>Once again, I thank Senator McDowell in particular for his considered contributions and collaboration on this Bill.  I am satisfied that the amendments clarify the concerns raised and I am hopeful that we can now finalise the legislation in order that it can be commenced without delay.<\/p><p>Many of us have been contacted in recent months by parents who wanted to publicly remember their children but who, unfortunately, have been prevented from doing so.  Every parent should be allowed and able to speak about their child publicly in order to secure the child's legacy.  We made a commitment to those parents that we would move quickly to solve this problem.  I am glad that, working together, we have all kept to that commitment.<\/p><p>The Bill will now go to the President, with the support of those in the House, for his signature.  I will not delay in signing a commencement order once that is done.  The law can be changed on 3 May at the latest and the parents affected will thereafter be able to share their precious memories of their children once again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021041900002#MM00400","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618824600,"counter":129,"content":"<p>The speaking order will be Senators McGreehan, McDowell, Keogan, Bacik, Boylan and Seery Kearney.

I want to express my happiness that the legislative process has addressed the difficulties that arose from the interpretation by the Court of Appeal of the Children Act 2001 and, in particular, section 252.  The Court of Appeal invited the Oireachtas to look at this issue if it was unhappy with the outcome of their decision.  Everybody wanted to reverse to some extent the implications of that decision.  Some people may have thought that the decision itself was a bombshell.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It seems to have been correct technically so this shows it is important that when we legislate in this House, we look very carefully at what we are doing.  It was not so much a bombshell as an unexploded bomb.  The problem was that it had to be dismantled in a way that preserved other very important and vital safeguards.  I wish to make two points in respect of that.  Supposing an intruder broke into a house, murdered one child and raped another, which, happily, has never happened, it might well be the case in that if one named the victim of the murder in court proceedings, one might end up identifying what happened to another child in the house.  This strange situation could occur where the interests of two different children who were part of a horrific set of circumstances may have to be balanced by the court in a way that is not immediately obvious if we just look at this matter on the basis of first principles.  I welcome the fact flexibility has been introduced here and that the court must balance a number of rights and conflicting interests in a situation such as that.  There are other much more mundane matters where child victims of other crimes are covered by section 252.  The rights of child witnesses who testify in such cases must be protected as well.  Changing the law was not as simple as was thought at the very beginning.  I acknowledge the efforts of the Department of Justice and the Office of the Attorney General to get the balance right.  <\/p><p>The law in section 252 is fairly narrow.  It talks about reports of court proceedings not being broadcast in such a way as to identify individuals.  It should be borne in mind that it does not prevent the parent of a child who was murdered from saying afterwards, \"My child was murdered\".  The law is strictly concerned with reports of court proceedings.  While the media and people are constrained from saying things about it, in the end, the law does not say that I can in any circumstance be inhibited from saying that my child was murdered if that is the case, which is an important point, nor, on the face of it, does it prevent me from ever saying who did it as long as I am not purporting to report a court case.  I am just making the point that people interpret our law in a way that is perhaps slightly overly strict.  The James Bulger case in England preserved anonymity for the perpetrators of that terrible crime into their adulthood but section 252 is not that rigid.  It does not say that somebody can be screened for the rest of his or her life from the fact that he or she murdered somebody.  All it says is that reports of particular court proceedings cannot be published in a particular way.  I say that because I think it is important that whatever decisions a court may make about the reportage of an individual case, it is not the case that in any circumstance, the parent of a child could ever be afterwards denied the right to say his or her child was murdered or name the child in that context.  This simply will not be the law in the future.<\/p><p>I will finish by thanking the Minister, Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Justice for the very careful and reasonable way we have tried to craft this legislation to balance all those rights.  I hope what we are doing will in early May, as the Minister said, lift what was an unjust situation from the shoulders of bereaved families.  We had the odd situation where the victim of a crime in East Wall in Dublin was named but as soon as court proceedings started, the cloak of anonymity seemed to come down on that situation and the media found itself in the peculiar position where it could not identify the child about whom it was speaking two weeks earlier as a child affected by the particular crime.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I thank the Minister and express my appreciation that the legislative process has worked, slowly, perhaps, but very carefully.

I acknowledge his diligence, expertise and sterling work on the Bill.  He engaged with the Minister for Justice and her Department to ensure that this matter was addressed as quickly as possible.  I welcome the passing of the Children (Amendment) Bill 2020 by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is important legislation that should help to recalibrate the law arising from the judgment of the Court of Appeal in DPP and EC <i>v<\/i>. <i>The Irish Times<\/i>and others.  The court interpreted section 252 to mean that reporting restrictions in respect of offences against children also applied in circumstances where the child was deceased or had turned 18 years of age, and the identity of the persons responsible for the child's death should not be published if this would directly or indirectly reveal the child's identity.<\/p><p>The new Bill addresses this issue and removes the gag on media reporting.  It means that where there is a deceased child, and no other child witness, the identity of child and perpetrator can be reported without any court involvement.  Other situations are also legislated for and give some latitude to the court to decide whether reporting restrictions are to apply.  I am glad, particularly for the sake of the grieving family members of a deceased child, that a child can be remembered and, indeed, for the sake of the child, the perpetrator can be named.  <\/p><p>I defer to the opinion of the architect of the Bill as initiated, Senator McDowell, on this matter, but it is regrettable that the Bill was not broader in its scope.  The original Bill gave the court discretion to waive reporting restrictions for offences other than child murder, allowing even greater scope and flexibility for the Judiciary to balance the different interests and come to a reasoned decision as to where the public interest, in particular, lay.  The original format of the Bill, which substituted a completely new section 252 for the old one, was more accessible than the Bill as passed by the D&aacute;il.  This is regrettable because the law should be as clear and accessible as possible.  Notwithstanding this, I welcome the passing of the Bill, as will many parents of children who have lost their lives. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021041900002#PP00200","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speech","time":1618824600,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.

On behalf of the Labour Party, I very much welcome it.<\/p><p>I also thank the Minister more generally for her engagement, not just with Senator McDowell on this Bill, but with many of us in opposition on different Private Members' Bills.  That has been a real strength, if I may say, of the legislative process over recent months.  I thank her for her engagement with the Labour group in this House on the Born Here Belong Here campaign and reform of citizenship law.  I also thank her for her engagement with my colleague, Deputy Howlin, on his Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020, or Coco's law, which we were also glad to see come into effect.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister to take note of reports at the weekend, in particular the piece in Saturday's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>by Jennifer O'Connell, recounting the experience of a young University College Cork, UCC, law student, Alicia O'Sullivan, who was a victim of image-based sexual abuse and identity theft, effectively.  She reported the matter to the Garda under Coco's law and, unfortunately, did not receive a very empathetic or helpful reception.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It reminds us that it is not only about passing legal reforms to assist victims but also the need for training for members of the Garda, particularly front-line members who are taking reports from individuals where offences have been committed or allegedly committed.  While training for the Garda is hugely important, so too are public awareness campaigns in order that people generally, as well as police, are aware that new laws such as Coco's law have come into effect and are aware that the sort of behaviour that Alicia O'Sullivan had to bring to the Garda's attention is a criminal offence.  The report in the newspaper recounted that the social media host, which was Instagram, reacted swiftly but, of course, that is not always the case.  Clearly, where criminal offences of this magnitude are involved, the Garda needs to take the matter much more seriously than they appeared to have done.  While my party welcomes the passage of this legislation and welcomed Coco's law, I ask the Minister that consideration be given to a public awareness campaign on Coco's law and to training for members of the Garda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021041900002#PP00300","speaker":"1631","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618824600,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I welcome the passage of this legislation.

This is a relatively short Bill whose primary purpose is the introduction of preliminary trial hearings.  The need for these hearings has been agreed for many years and is a priority action in the programme for Government and my Department's justice plan.  A number of reports have highlighted the benefits of such hearings, including the report of the expert group on Article 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights, or the McDermott report, from 2013; the report on efficiencies in the criminal justice system, or the Fennelly report, from 2012; the review of protections for vulnerable witnesses in the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences, or the O'Malley report, from 2020; and, most recently, the review of structures and strategies to prevent, investigate and penalise economic crime and corruption, or the Hamilton report of 2020.<\/p> <p>Victims have spoken very clearly about the impact on them when they have mentally prepared for a trial and it does not, unfortunately, go ahead, or when something unexpected arises during the trial that results in interruptions while difficulties or arguments are dealt with by the court.  We cannot take away the fact that a trial is an adversarial process, that an accused person is entitled to defend himself or herself robustly and that events can unfold in unexpected ways.  However, preliminary trial hearings should make trials more predictable for participants and help them to run more smoothly.<\/p> <p>From the point of view of an accused person, if a trial is going to fail because of the inadmissibility of certain evidence, for example, this should be uncovered as early as possible to avoid the person being put through a full trial unnecessarily in a case that was inevitably going to fail.  It is also in the interest of juries that the information presented to them during a trial should flow more smoothly and without interruption, insofar as possible.  Preliminary hearings have great potential to reduce delays and increase efficiency in how our criminal trials are run.  They should reduce the length of trials which we know can be considerable, in part owing to repeated adjournments.  They will not, however, deal with matters which currently must be dealt with when the jury is present.<\/p> <p>In practical terms, preliminary hearings will mean that it is less likely that the jury will be sent away immediately after being sworn in, or sent away multiple times during the trial, which often happens.  There will be a reduced impact on the victim because the trial is more likely to be ready to proceed on the appointed day, with the necessary practical arrangements in place and at least some of the contentious issues decided in advance.  The trial is also less likely to be interrupted, potentially multiple times, which would drag out the experience and make it more difficult, especially for victims.  There will be significant resource efficiencies where trials are ready on the day they are due to start, and more likely to proceed smoothly to a conclusion.  Finally, matters which would ultimately prevent a case being submitted to a jury will now be more likely to be identified in advance, thus avoiding the empanelling of a jury and the subjection of a person to an unnecessary trial.  These are important benefits which I believe will be supported by all sides in this House, and which will result in significant efficiencies in the criminal justice system.<\/p> <p>I now turn to the Bill itself and outline the main points.  Part 2 is the main Part of the Bill and deals with preliminary trial hearings.  A judge can order a preliminary trial hearing for any indictable offence where he or she thinks it is needed.  A preliminary hearing can be also requested by the prosecution or the defence where the trial is for a relevant offence as set out the Bill.  These relevant offences are offences which carry a maximum sentence of ten years or more, including a life sentence and offences which the Minister has specified by order.  When specifying an offence as a relevant offence, the Bill sets out what the Minister must consider, including the nature of the offence concerned and the relevant complexities that generally arise in the prosecution of such offences.  The court must agree to at least one preliminary hearing for a relevant offence where either the prosecution or the defence has requested it.<\/p> <p>The Bill specifies the timing for a preliminary trial hearing, which must take place before the jury is sworn in or, in the case of trials in the Special Criminal Court, before the trial has commenced.  It provides that if it is in the interests of justice, an accused may be arraigned at a preliminary trial hearing.  The Bill also specifies the types of orders or decisions which may be made at a preliminary trial hearing.  At the preliminary hearing, the court can assess various case management matters and make orders or rulings to ensure the just, expeditious and efficient conduct of the trial.  Such matters include the availability of witnesses, whether any particular practical measures or technology may be needed, the extent to which the trial is ready to proceed, including any long-standing issues with regard to disclosure, and how long the trial is likely to be.<\/p> <p>The Bill also provides that the court can make a decision or order at a preliminary hearing in regard to: whether a number of persons charged in the same proceedings can be tried separately; amending an indictment under section 6 of the Criminal Justice (Administration) Act 1924, for example, to allow offences to be tried separately; under section 15A of the Juries Act 1976, to provide for additional jurors where the trial is likely to be long; allowing for evidence by written statement, or proof by formal admission under sections 21 and 22 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984; an application to question the victim in a rape offence about their prior sexual history in accordance with section 3 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act 1981; decisions around how evidence may be given from behind a screen, via television link, including from outside the State, or via an intermediary under various sections of the Criminal Evidence Act 1992, as well as whether cross-examination by the accused in person will be permitted, and determination of issues around disclosure of the victim's counselling records in a sexual offences case under section 19A of that Act; under section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999, whether a witness who is in fear or subject to intimidation may give evidence through live video link; under section 67 of the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008, whether a witness outside the State may give evidence by live television link; leave to call an expert witness, under section 34 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2010; under section 21 of the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017, where a victim needs to be protected from secondary or repeat victimisation, intimidation or retaliation, whether to permit questioning or evidence about the private life of that victim; and finally, to allow for evidence via video link under section 25 of the Civil Law and Criminal Law Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2020.  In addition to this list, at a preliminary hearing, the court may also make a \"relevant order\", which is an order relating to the admissibility of evidence.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Helen McEntee:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2394\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Finally, in this part of the Bill, there is a general power for the court to make any other order that could be made in the absence of the jury, or any order relating to the conduct of the trial as appears necessary to the court to ensure due process and the interests of justice are observed.  As Members can see, there is a wide range of important orders provided for in the Bill which will now be able to be dealt with at a much earlier stage in the proceedings, which will be to the benefit of all parties involved.<\/p><p>It will not generally be necessary for the same judge who presides over a preliminary trial hearing to preside over any subsequent hearings or the trial of the offence.  An exception to this is a preliminary trial hearing dealing with the admissibility of evidence where, other than in exceptional circumstances, the same judge must preside over the hearing and the trial.  There is also a general power in the Bill for the court to decide that the same judge must preside over subsequent preliminary trial hearings and the trial of the offence, if that is in the interests of justice.<\/p><p>Orders made during a preliminary hearing will be binding and may not generally be appealed until the conclusion of the trial.  An application may be made to vary an order only if there has been a material change in circumstances since the time at which the order was made.  The only appeals permitted between a preliminary trial hearing and the trial of the offence relate to significant decisions excluding evidence as inadmissible.  If such a decision results in the case against the accused being very significantly weakened, then it is in nobody's interest for the trial to have to proceed to a conclusion before the related appeal can be determined.<\/p><p>Participants who would be entitled to legal representation and legal aid for the trial will have the same entitlements for any associated preliminary trial hearings.  In general, preliminary trial hearings will be conducted in public.  However, there is a power for the judge to exclude the public from any portion of, or all of, a preliminary trial hearing where that is necessary, and to prohibit the publishing or broadcasting of certain details until the trial is complete.  This may be necessary to protect the accused person's right to a fair trial, particularly given that the jury will not yet have been sworn in and material may be discussed at the hearing which should not be presented to the jury, for example, evidence that is later ruled inadmissible.<\/p><p>Part 3 deals with the provision of information to juries.  This arises from a recommendation of the Law Reform Commission in its 2013 report on jury service that the types of information available to juries in complex financial trials should be extended to juries in trials for all indictable offences.  This part of the Bill implements that recommendation.<\/p><p>Part 4 makes various small amendments to criminal procedure legislation.  The changes regarding evidence by written statement will allow the court to require a person objecting to the admission of written evidence, rather than oral testimony, to give his or her reasons for doing so and, having considered those reasons, to admit the evidence in written format where this is not contrary to the interests of justice.  The other amendments are technical in nature or adjustments to existing provisions that are necessary to reflect the introduction of preliminary hearings.<\/p><p>The Criminal Procedure Bill 2021 contains important provisions which will enhance the powers of our courts in conducting efficient criminal trials.  A better trial process is in the interests of everyone concerned: the accused, the victim, the courts and members of our juries.  I look forward to hearing Senators' contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021041900002#ZZ00300","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618824600,"counter":149,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire ar ais go dt&iacute; an Teach.

I welcome the provisions of the Bill, which are common sense measures that will help the flow of the criminal justice system.<br\/><br\/>I will speak on the primary function of the Bill being the establishment of preliminary trial hearings.  In Dublin, there has been for a long time a trial in respect of what are called pre-trial hearings but they have been hampered very substantially by the points the Minister has raised, insofar as they cannot deal with certain issues because there is no provision in law, essentially, for evidential or other pre-trial issues to be dealt with in a conclusive way before a jury is sworn in and the accused is put into the hands of the jury.  I welcome that we have a clear legislative statement that there is a way we can do this that makes sense and avoids the necessity for a drawn-out trial process which results in very little efficiency.<br\/><br\/>In acknowledging that, under the current system, when a trial starts it is open to either side to raise an issue of procedure, admissibility of evidence or whatever it might be with the trial judge at that time.  Only when that judge has been put <i>in situ<\/i>and the accused has been put into the hands of the jury can those processes properly be adjudicated.  The result of that is damaging in many ways.  It prolongs the process for the defendant or accused person in the first instance.  The accused is a seldom considered party in these proceedings, for obvious reasons.  However, people are innocent until proven guilty when they go before the court and are entitled to be treated with respect and efficiency.<br\/><br\/>Perhaps more important, as we have acknowledged in this House on a number of occasions, are the difficulties faced by complainants who come before the courts.  It is a tremendously stressful and difficult experience for somebody who is accusing another person of a crime, particularly where that is a violation, a sexual crime or something like that, to come before the court as a witness.  Until now, victims or complainants who come to court often do not know when the case will be heard.  They know it is listed for a certain day and might get on that day.  Even if it gets on, there might be days of wrangling and legal argument over particular issues.  That happens only after the trial starts so complainants might come to court on the first day of the trial ready to give evidence, make their claim and say what happened, only to find there are two or three days of legal argument where they sit in the victim suite in the Criminal Courts of Justice or in a room in a court elsewhere in the country waiting for that legal argument to subside and be resolved.  The effect on such persons is that they are sitting around for days waiting for the real process to start, as far as they are concerned.  In that scenario, it is unfair that complainants who come to court and the accused person should have to wait around.<br\/><br\/>Another party that is perhaps sometimes forgotten when we discuss criminal justice matters is jurors.  In every case, 12 ordinary citizens have given up their time and life experience to come and pass judgment on the facts in a case and decide about the guilt or innocence of an individual.  The system does not work without those citizens who come and give their time.  They are an incredibly valuable part of it.  Invariably, people who been have involved in jury service will express frustration that they must be excluded from discussion about evidential issues.  One cannot ask a juror to unhear a piece of evidence that has been ruled inadmissible, for example.  They must be removed from the courtroom and they sit in the jury room awaiting the conclusion of that legal argument before they are told whatever it is they might be told.  I know from many friends and colleagues who have done jury service that they find it incredibly frustrating.  They are told the trial starts on a certain day and will take X number of days.  However, the first three days may be spent sitting in the jury room, waiting for legal argument to be completed.  It is the wrong signal to send out to people about our criminal justice system, which can be more efficient.  This Bill will make it more efficient.  It will avoid the necessity for juries to be discommoded and avoid the stress for complainants or other persons who are parties to the trial, including witnesses.  It circumvents much of that and makes perfect sense that we resolve these issues by way of a preliminary trial hearing before the process gets going.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the process.  I think it is progressive.  I note what the Minister said about the provision of information to juries, which is addressed in Part 3 of the Bill and arose from the report of the Law Reform Commission.  I have referred a number of times in the House to the importance of the good work done by the Law Reform Commission.  In that regard, I welcome that its work is being taken on board in the Bill.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Barry Ward:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I welcome the fact it has been taken on board.<br\/><br\/>I might just raise a few technical issues in respect of the Bill.  Section 6(2), which falls under the preliminary trial hearing heading, states:<\/p><blockquote>\t(2) Without prejudice to the generality of <i>subsection (1)<\/i>, the trial court shall, where&mdash;   \t(a) an accused is charged with a relevant offence, <br \/><br \/>(b) the prosecution or the accused makes an application to the court for a preliminary trial hearing to be held, and <br \/><br \/>(c) no preliminary trial hearing has previously been held in respect of the trial of such offence, <br \/><br \/>hold such a preliminary trial hearing.   <\/blockquote><p>The fact that section 6(2)<i>(c)<\/i>states that &quot;no preliminary trial hearing has previously been held&quot; appears to suggest that there can only ever be one preliminary trial hearing in respect of an offence.  Perhaps I am misreading that.  However, I wonder if we are unnecessarily restricting the ability of the courts to deal with an issue that might arise, for example, between the preliminary trial hearing and the start of the trial itself.  As I said, maybe I have misread that.  I am quite happy to be corrected if that is the case.<br\/><br\/>In respect of Part 3, which deals with the provision of information to juries, it is a progressive measure that I welcome.  In many trials, particularly trials that go on for a period of time, it is most important that juries have access to certain documentation.  I note the list provided in section 12(2).  It is fairly normal at the moment for juries to get access to maps, reports and other documentary pieces of evidence that come before the court.  However, they do not get opening and closing statements from counsel or the judge's charge.  The judge's charge is an important document because it allows juries to see what the judge said about the trial and the decision he or she has to make.<br\/><br\/>I have some concerns about the provision of opening and closing statements made by barristers in the course of a trial, because they are not evidence.  They are merely the manner in which a particular barrister is setting out the facts in the trial as he or she sees it.  I have some concerns about juries having access to those documents because they are not evidential documents; they are merely the expressions of a point of view of one party to the case.  I have a small concern, particularly in respect of the opening statement, that it might colour the judgment of the jury inappropriately in circumstances where the opening statement is usually only made by the prosecution.<br\/><br\/>I also wish to address two other matters.  In respect of sections 13 to 15, inclusive, which amend the Criminal Procedure Act 1967, I wonder if there has been a missed opportunity there for us to perhaps fix other things that exist, particularly amendments that were inserted into the 1967 Act from section 4(a) onwards.<br\/><br\/>Finally, under section 18 a change is made to the period that is allowed for the defence to provide expert reports, extending that period.  Currently, the defence must disclose expert reports to the prosecution at least ten days before the start of the trial.  This period is extended to 28 days under the Bill.  I wonder if that is a necessary provision, given all of the resources that are available to the prosecution in any given case.  Does it make sense to further hamper the defence in bringing an expert report?  I wonder if consideration has been given as to what effect this will have on the defence.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the Bill.  It is a huge step forward in eliminating unnecessary red tape.  It will make the trial process much smoother.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021041900002#AAA00200","speaker":"1685","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618824600,"counter":152,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  I also support this Bill and I agree with much of what Senator Ward just said.  This Bill implements one of the many welcome recommendations of the O'Malley report published last August.  However, I question why this one issue has been carved out of the report and introduced in a stand-alone Bill, and whether it would not have been better for more of the O'Malley proposals to be introduced in a more comprehensive Bill rather than in piecemeal fashion.  Given the extremely constrained amount of D&aacute;il and Seanad time we have at present, there might have been an argument for that.  However, that is not to cavil at the welcome that this Bill deserves.  <\/p> <p>Pre-trial hearings are important.  There is a certain irony here that the concept of pre-trial hearings is of great day-to-day familiarity to ordinary citizens, even if it is not the practice in our own courts.  Pre-trial hearings feature in courtroom scenes in legal dramas such as \"The Good Fight\".  They have entered Irish popular culture long before they have arrived in our legal system.<\/p> <p>Of course, a courtroom drama is no way to judge the effectiveness of any set of procedures or reform, but it gives an accurate, even if simplistic, indication of how such hearings operate.  The hearings can be used to weed out legal issues which might arise in a full trial, or in some cases prevent a trial from proceeding at all in a case which the process shows to be without merit, either for legal reasons or for want of evidence.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Like so many good changes that have simplified our legal system, the proposal being dealt with today has been in the ether for a long time, at least 20 years at this point.  Listening to Senator Ward I found myself wondering why it takes so long to do things that make such obvious sense.<br\/><br\/>The O'Malley report refers to two previous studies on the issue, namely the working group on the jurisdiction of the courts chaired by Mr. Justice Niall Fennelly in 2003, and the McDermott report in 2013.  However, I also recall that there was another report by the Law Reform Commission in 2006, then chaired by Mr. Justice Hugh Geoghegan, which dealt with prosecution appeals and pre-trial hearings.  This report contained an interesting examination of the pros and cons of pre-trial hearings, and looked at the experience in England and Wales.  Ultimately, the Fennelly report found that the evidence in favour of pre-trial hearings was, in its words, &quot;inconclusive&quot; but it did recommend a study into the impact that <i>voir dire<\/i>has in practice on the ability of juries to fully appreciate the evidence before them.  These are the proceedings that take place in trials conducted in the absence of the jury to determine matters that henceforth will be dealt with in pre-trial hearings.  It is important that the concerns and caveats flagged by Mr. Justice Fennelly in 2006 are borne in mind when implementing pre-trial hearings. <br\/><br\/>The proposal is a win-win for everybody who will be involved.  It will reduce the stress on victims and complainants by shortening trials and allowing difficult issues, such as questioning on sexual history, to be dealt with before the start of the trial proper.  This reform will also be good for future jurors, because it will shorten trials and cut down on the amount of disruption in their lives through endless suspension of trials for <i>voir dire<\/i>discussion.<br\/><br\/>I might say as an aside that jury selection is another area that needs to be addressed seriously in the years to come.  The jury selection system is messy and chaotic, and that is putting it charitably.  I would recommend, if she has not already done so, that the Minister read any of several interesting opinion pieces written by the barrister James McDermott on the topic.  The Irish jury selection process and juror experience is stuck in the 19th century, often resembling something out of Dickens.  It badly needs to be modernised.<br\/><br\/>Pre-trial hearings will also, hopefully, benefit the taxpayer, by shortening the length of trials, shortening court lists, and reducing costs.  This reform will also vindicate and strengthen the rights of accused persons, by allowing issues to be ironed out at an early stage in a way that will not contaminate or prejudice the jury.  In a society that values the rule of law we should never be ashamed of any measure that would vindicate the rights of an accused who, as Senator Ward has just said, is innocent until proved guilty.  We should never apologise for being scrupulous about ensuring due process for the accused.  Not all those put on trial for criminal offences are guilty.  We should think of this especially in the fraught context of sexual offences, which frequently come up for discussion.  It is for this reason that our Constitution guarantees a presumption of innocence and a right to silence.  I was very glad that the O'Malley report rejected calls from various quarters that would effectively have eroded the presumption of innocence in trials of sexual offences.<br\/><br\/>I hope it goes without saying that the O'Malley report should not be the end of our review of the effectiveness of the criminal courts.  We should constant looking for new ways to streamline the system and make it fairer for all those involved.  The nature of criminal trials in Ireland, and indeed in any common-law system, is that trials are adversarial in nature.  This is in contrast to the Continent, for example, where the civil law system has led countries to adopt a different, less adversarial and more probative, style of conducting trials.<br\/><br\/>I recently read some detail on the criminal process in operation in Belgium, where the trial process seems to be somewhat more free-flowing than the rigid and almost formulaic structure of criminal trials here.  The thought struck me that perhaps there are some aspects of the continental system which we could learn from and adopt here, perhaps in a limited way.  Within the confines of the constitutional framework for the trial of offences and the rights of the accused, there are surely reforms we could introduce nonetheless that would make the process of criminal trials more probative and less adversarial.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->A discussion of that would go well beyond the scope of this Bill, whose introduction I welcome and passage I intend to support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021041900002#CCC00200","speaker":"1673","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618824600,"counter":155,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.<\/p> <p>We in Fianna F&aacute;il are happy to support this Bill, which puts in place practical reforms to improve the operation of criminal trials and has been called for for some time.  It provides for pretrial hearings, which will significantly enhance the trial process for sexual offences, white collar crimes, organised crime and other complex offences.  These fundamental changes will make the process easier and reduce the likelihood of juries being sent away during trials, making the court process faster and more effective.  Most importantly, it will make it less likely that victims who have to prepare mentally for a trial will be subject to stressful delays.  We tend to overlook the stress and annoyance felt by victims, and the trauma that goes with it, when they are built up for a trial process.  Even the experience of walking into a courtroom for the first time can be stressful.  Some of our learned colleagues in the Chamber do it on an almost daily basis, but for the ordinary citizen and his or her family, it is a stressful experience.  This legislation, when enacted, will go a long way towards minimising that, which is to be welcomed.<\/p> <p>The Bill will provide for preliminary trial hearings in Irish law for the first time.  These hearings will enhance the operation of criminal trials, benefiting victims, the courts, defendants, witnesses and jury members.  There is often too much delay or disruption in trials because issues that should have been dealt with in advance, for example, the admissibility of evidence, are subject to legal argument in the absence of the jury.  A practical arrangement to determine the availability of witnesses would help to speed up that process.  The Bill will reduce the prospect of a jury being sent away immediately after being sworn in to allow for legal argument or being sent away numerous times during the trial, which can be frustrating for all concerned.  The Covid-19 restrictions have had a negative impact on criminal trials, but this Bill will support case management and help to ensure that parties are ready to proceed on the day of the trial.  It will also deliver efficiencies, given that certain criminal trials will now have fewer delays.<\/p> <p>Several reports over the years, some of which have been mentioned by my colleagues, on making the criminal trial system more efficient, tackling white collar crime and corruption, and increasing protections for vulnerable witnesses in sexual offences cases, have recommended the introduction of pretrial hearings.  Delays, postponements and suspensions of the start of a trial and multiple adjournments have considerable negative impacts.  The trial process can be a stressful experience and victims may have prepared themselves mentally for the trial to start on a designated day.  When a trial is postponed at the last minute or interrupted multiple times for legal argument, it can make a victim's experience all the more difficult.  Importantly, the Bill will reduce the impact of numerous delays on victims of serious sexual offences.<\/p> <p>Pretrial hearings will also mean that matters that could ultimately lead to the collapse of a trial can be identified before a jury is sworn in, preventing lengthy legal argument mid-trial and helping to ensure that trials start when they are supposed to, thereby delivering significant efficiencies and savings for the court.<\/p> <p>The Bill's provisions have been developed in close consultation with the Courts Service and the Director of Public Prosecutions to ensure that they will be workable in practice and achieve the desired outcome.  Senator Mullen lamented that it had taken us a long time to reach this point, but I hope that having had all stakeholders involved in the process will help going forward.<\/p> <p>The principal purpose of the Criminal Procedure Bill is to provide for the introduction of preliminary trial hearings.  Part 2 is its main part and deals with preliminary trial hearings, the principal purpose of which is to deal with certain matters ahead of a trial so as to ensure that all parties are ready to proceed on the day of the trial and to minimise interruptions of an untimely nature while the trial is in train.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Robbie Gallagher:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2471\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Part 3 of the Bill deals with the provision of information to juries to assist them with their deliberations.

Part 4 of the Bill makes various amendments to criminal justice legislation.<\/p><p>As I have said, I very much welcome this legislation and I thank the Minister for bringing it to the House this afternoon.  It may be difficult for the Minister to give a definitive answer but when does she hope this legislation will be up and running for the benefit of everybody?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021041900002#EEE00200","speaker":"1658","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618824600,"counter":157,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as ucht teacht isteach chun labhairt ar an Ch&eacute;im seo don Bhille.  The Acting Chairperson might forgive me if I smile the whole way through the course of this contribution because I have just been able to book my vaccine for tomorrow in the North.  The process has just opened for my age bracket, although I will not say which bracket it is.  Nevertheless, it is good and I am happy.<\/p> <p>As colleagues have acknowledged across the House, the purpose of this Bill is to introduce preliminary trial hearings.  Many of the features of the Bill are good and positive and Sinn F&eacute;in supports them.  They are needed for a number of reasons.  As people have said, some trials are becoming increasingly complex and lengthy due to technological advances and legal innovation.  An informed and relaxed jury is an important part of the justice system.  Part 3 of the Bill deals with the provision of information to juries to assist them in their deliberations.  This arises from the Law Reform Commission and its 2013 report on jury service.  It made a number of recommendations, including that the source from which jury panels would be drawn would be broad and efficient, that jurors would be funded for their service and to make it easier for disabled people to serve on juries through making court buildings accessible and disabled-friendly.<\/p> <p>A provision to allow some arguments to take place before a trial is also welcome.  Section 6(6) states that where an accused has not been arraigned, the judge may direct the accused to be arraigned at the start of a pretrial hearing.  If we are serious about the presumption of innocence, that provision should be tightened up.  Also, if the prosecution seeks a pretrial hearing, it seems only fair that all disclosures should be provided to the defence before that takes place.<\/p> <p>The Bill also provides for hearings on matters such as the availability of witnesses and issues related to discovery.  The discovery aspect is particularly important due to developments in technology and complex books of evidence.  The report on the future of policing envisions better Garda resources in cybercrime.  Complex discovery and admissibility matters are well suited to pretrial hearings and it is important to maintain a balance between prosecution and defence at all times.  The Bill will give a right to request a hearing, the sharing of information and notification of the use of expert witnesses.<\/p> <p>The availability of witnesses and their suitability or otherwise to take the stand is also key.  There is unfortunately a disturbing trend where young people under the age of 18 are witnesses to high-profile criminal and violent crimes.  In those circumstances the causes of crime are rarely addressed, and neither are the need for early interventions and targeted resources, as well as other matters like community policing, education, housing, social care and community-led initiatives such as restorative justice practices.<\/p> <p>A fit-for-purpose youth justice system is badly needed and we do not have one at present.  In a report involving the University of Limerick it was stated that 1,000 children were involved in or in danger of being involved in criminal gangs.  Although the transfer of youth justice functions from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to the Department of Justice may deliver developments, it carries a risk.  That risk is that young adults and children might be treated within the same resources and processes as adults, which would be entirely inappropriate.  A stand-alone youth agency properly resourced is crucial.<\/p> <p>The Bill before Members will be one part of a solution but wider policy and societal issues must be also be considered and addressed as we move forward.  The Bill contains a welcome provision to extend legal aid services to cover costs incurred during pretrial hearings.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Some judges can be difficult about extending legal aid certificates, as some of our learned colleagues across the House will probably recognise.

I was actually speaking to Alicia O'Sullivan and Jennifer O'Connell about the issue I raised in the House earlier today about Coco's Law.  I wish first to speak on Second Stage of the Criminal Procedure Bill before us but also, briefly, if I may, to refer again to some comments on Coco's Law and other relevant legal reforms.<\/p><p>First, on behalf of the Labour Party, I very much welcome the Criminal Procedure Bill and the provision it makes, indeed its principal purpose, to legislate for preliminary trial hearings.  These have been recommended over many years by many different reports and reviews of the criminal justice system.  As long ago as 1998, in an EU-funded study I conducted with colleagues in Trinity College Dublin on the legal process and victims of rape, we recommended that pre-trial hearings be brought in to ensure that issues with the conduct of the trial would be dealt with in a way that would least impact the victims and indeed the jurors.  It is very welcome then to see that that is what is proposed in this legislation.  It is welcome also to see in section 6 that the interests of the victims as well as jurors are recognised.  I note also that this will make trial processes more efficient.<\/p><p>My colleague, Deputy Howlin, in the other House, also welcoming this Bill, referred to an important study into judges and juries in Ireland conducted last year by Mark Coen, Niamh Howlin, Colette Barry and John Lynch for the UCD school of law.  It was the first empirical study in which judges were interviewed.  On the issue of pre-trial hearings, which they also recommended, the authors noted the frustrations judges expressed about lack of progress on the introduction of pre-trial hearings, one judge saying they believed it was very disrespectful of a jury to be sworn in and then sent away for long periods while issues were resolved in the absence of a jury, as is currently the case.  I recall several trials when I was in practice in which the juries were sworn in and then the <i>voir dires<\/i>were held and legal argument took place in the absence of the jury, often for days at a time.  The juries would then be left in a state of suspension.  Clearly, that is not ideal for jurors or victims, who are also often left wondering what is going on.  I therefore very much welcome the provision for pre-trial hearings in this legislation.<\/p><p>I also wish again to commend the Minister for her work with Deputy Howlin on Coco's Law.  I ask again, however, that we look again, in the light of the experience of a young UCC law student, Alicia O'Sullivan, as recounted at the weekend, at how garda&iacute; who take complaints, particularly complaints relating to sexual abuse, including image-based sexual abuse, are trained to respond in an empathetic manner and then to refer to the divisional protective services unit.  I pay tribute to Chief Superintendent Declan Daly who has overseen the important roll-out of specialist units within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na across the country to take statements where gender-based violence or sexual crimes are reported.  I think what is lacking still, however, is sufficient training of garda&iacute; on the front line in Garda stations who take these complaints in the first place.  They should be able to refer them swiftly onwards to garda&iacute; who are specialised in taking statements.  This will facilitate, I think, more efficient prosecution and investigation of such offences.<\/p><p>I also wish to raise with the Minister a related issue regarding criminal justice reform raised earlier on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; by two very brave young women, Una Ring and Eve McDowell, who, like Alicia O'Sullivan, have gone public about their experience, in their case experience of very serious and life-threatening stalking.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Their concern is that our current legislation does not adequately deal with stalking of this sort of violent nature.  They suggested that section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, which provides for the offence of harassment, does not adequately deal with the sort of physical violence that they experienced in stalking, and it appears more reflective perhaps of persistent communication through non-physical means.  While we did increase the penalty to ten years in section 10 of Coco's Law for the offence of harassment, I wonder if it is time for us to look at creating an offence of aggravated harassment that would more directly encompass this sort of stalking, where people are followed at their workplace or to their home, or their property is broken into, and where there is a physical threatening presence that causes them to fear for their lives, as recounted by the two women who spoke.<\/p><p>Perhaps we need to look more generally at how our criminal laws reflect the experience of victims.  This Criminal Procedure Bill goes a substantial way towards recognising the needs of victims and trying to make the trial processes more efficient, but we also need to look at our language more generally.  Why do we not have an offence known as stalking?  Why do we not have an offence of domestic violence?  Why do we use language that does not necessarily reflect the experience of victims by talking about harassment, which does not seem to encompass the more serious type of behaviour?  We need to name these experiences.  Back in 2018, when we passed the Domestic Violence Act, pioneered so ably by the Minister's predecessor, the former Minister, Frances Fitzgerald, through our work in the Seanad and the D&aacute;il we created a new offence of coercive control.  That language more accurately reflects the experience of those who go through what we now know to be coercive control.  Similarly, while I am very glad we have a Domestic Violence Act, we still do not have an offence of domestic violence, just as we do not have an offence called child sexual abuse.  I have spoken before about the myriad of different sexual offences and the piecemeal nature of reforming legislation brought through the House.  I should say I acted for the State years ago in cases defending some aspects of those pieces of legislation.  It is a real source of frustration to anyone involved in supporting victims of sexual crime or gender-based violence that the legislation and the law does not seem to quite match the experience of victims.  It is about looking at our language.  It is a little bit like our outdated criminal law still talking about a defence of insanity, when insanity is now seen as a deeply problematic and outdated expression in mental health and psychiatry practice.  It is about looking at our language and about ensuring that the offences we create are reflective of the experience of victims.  I know the Minister is very sympathetic to these views.  I wonder, then, whether we should be looking at that offence of harassment and how we can align it more with the experiences of those who have suffered the sort of very severe, physically threatening stalking behaviours that have been recounted.<\/p><p>Like others on today's Order of Business, I want to finish by saying again that gender-based violence is very much in all of our minds today, with the news of the tragic killing at the weekend of Jennifer Poole.  I want to extend my own sympathy and the sympathies of my Labour Party colleagues to her family and friends and all who knew her.<\/p><p>I welcome the Bill and welcome the way in which it is framed so as to create a more responsive criminal justice and trial system.  However, there are other reforms that we also need to look at.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021041900002#GGG00300","speaker":"1631","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618824600,"counter":161,"content":"<p>The Minister is welcome to the Chamber, as always.

They are very different but in recent years the civil law has made good inroads.  I am thinking of the retired judge, Mr. Justice Peter Kelly.  The Commercial Court was a positive step in the right direction in terms of pre-court issues being determined.  Case management of disputes is very important.  In a sense, this is the first tangible progress we have seen where the criminal courts are catching up on the civil courts, although there is still a long way to go in terms of both courts.<br\/><br\/>I refer to <i>voir dire<\/i>, which is an essential part of a criminal trial.  If any of those matters can be dealt with before a jury is impanelled it would be very welcome.  A jury is impanelled sometimes on a Wednesday and within minutes the members could be told that they are not needed until the following Monday or to come back on Friday at 12 noon and they will see where they are at that time.  The jury turn up on the Friday and are told that it might be the following Monday or Tuesday.  That is not just a delay in justice or suspending the role of a jury; it is in a sense putting on hold their thought process.  The jury should not deliberate and make a decision until they hear all the evidence but if any of those big delays can be resolved at a pre-hearing stage it would be fantastic and a win-win for everyone.  If an issue emerges during a trial latitude will be shown because people's liberty is at stake.<br\/><br\/>The order of a judge in a pre-hearing application under section 6(<i>a<\/i>) is binding.  That is very welcome but I hope there is sufficient latitude in section 6(<i>b<\/i>) because occasionally, and I do not want it to be the norm, something may arise and there is so much at stake that it would not make sense to go through a long, drawn-out trial.  That is very hard on the victim.  I refer to an indictable offence when one knows there is a clear ground for an appeal in a matter which a trial judge makes an order on at a preliminary trial hearing.  Section 6 (14)(ii) should cover it where it states: &quot;... where the court considers it appropriate and so directs, have effect as though it had been made in the course of the trial ...&quot;.  If we look at that in reverse, the judge may have sufficient latitude because there could be other trials backed up when this novel point arises and it might well be in the interests of everyone, from the taxpayer to the victims, to have it settled rather than going through a long case.  I believe there is just about enough latitude in the Bill for the judge to operate his or her inherent jurisdiction, which he or she should be free to do in a criminal matter.<br\/><br\/>I welcome all the measures in respect of juries but they are only tinkering at the sides, so to speak.  This country needs to get real and have a complete overhaul of jury selection.  Only one in five attend.  I think it was an English commentator who said many years ago that jurors are largely middle aged, middle minded and middle class.  Despite what the judge might communicate to prospective jurors before they are impanelled, they do not understand that a stipulative number of objections are made without cause shown.  There could be more transparency in the process.  For instance, there is a danger in terms of those objections on a specific matter before the jury for consideration and deliberation.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Vincent P.

It is the just the way the ball rolls and if there are a number of objections, one can tell the next 20 coming before it with the majority of a particular sex.  It is just something to look out for but that is for another day.<\/p><p>I hope the Minister will give us a commitment that she is prepared to look at a radical overhaul of jury selection.  It could be made more representative of our country.  We need to look at an employer's grace which allows an employee to do jury service.  Is there a possibility of some form of remuneration?  Some people just cannot afford to be on a jury.  It is part of our criminal justice system and I would like to see jury service and participation open to many more people.<\/p><p>This legislation is a step in the right direction.  The Minister should be commended that within a year of taking office, we are seeing such progress.  I look forward to the Bill going through its different Stages in the House.  The Green Party supports these common-sense and progressive initiatives, which will be to the benefit of the victim, as well as the accused, who is presumed innocent until proved guilty.  It will be easier on the judges when a set system is in place.  They are doing their utmost but we need some ground rules.  Now these will be on a primary legislative footing.  It is important society always has trust and confidence in the jury system and knows it is beyond reproach.  We must always protect the jury trial system.  This legislation supports the criminal law system by expediting and progressing in a constructive way how one gets to the trial hearing.  The Courts Service will say the waiting times are coming down.  However, in certain cases there is still too big of a wait for some people to get their case on.  All the other initiatives are to be welcomed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021041900002#HHH00200","speaker":"1667","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618824600,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy McEntee, to the House.

It is appropriate that we look at modernising the way we operate the jury system with legal argument.

When a case proceeds to trial, there are unforeseen circumstances and unaccounted for scenarios where legal argument is necessary.  We live in a democracy and have a proper legal system where that must be facilitated and has to be permitted.  It would be very worthwhile, however, if this type of thing could be ironed out as much as possible at a pretrial hearing.<\/p><p>I agree that the corporate and civil courts have certainly advanced significantly in modernisation.  The criminal side is sadly lacking and has a lot of catching up to do.  During the past 12 months, we have seen an intent, a determination and a focused energy to bring it into line with best international practice.  I do not believe that we should be striving to be on a par with international practice.  Ireland should be leading in that regard.<\/p><p>I am glad also that there has been an improvement in the time delays with cases in the Four Courts.  That  remains a problem.  Thankfully, we are seeing that things are being escalated and cases are being dealt with a little bit quicker than previously.  That is to be welcomed.  We have, however, a large body of work to do in this House to modernise criminal legislation.  There is a great deal that needs to be done.  It has not at all been victim-centred until recently.  It should be victim-centred.  It should always be victim-centred.  It in no way compromises any justice system to ensure that the feelings and attitude towards victims is centred on them in all proceedings.  I could talk and give examples and case studies of experiences that come through my office, but I will leave that for another day.  This legislation is important and I hope it gets all-party support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021041900002#KKK00200","speaker":"1644","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618824600,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I welcome the principle behind the Bill, but I want to sound a few warnings.  Senator Conway has just spoken about the speeding up of trials.  That is illusory at the moment on two fronts.  Ireland has a very poor record on the timing between the detection of an offence and the trial relating to that offence.  A cynic told me recently that Bernie Madoff would probably be on his second preliminary judicial review had he been arrested in Ireland.  Mr. Madoff was convicted and in prison in the United States of America, and unfortunately, is now deceased.  This also goes to the trial of Derek Chauvin for the killing of George Floyd, which is happening now in America.  In Ireland, that case could probably take place some two years or 18 months hence.  It took place roughly within ten months of the offence happening and very shortly after the decision to prosecute took place.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Second, I welcome the idea that juries should not be sent out, time after time, for every point to be argued in their absence.  I did a fair amount of criminal prosecution in my time and I can tell Members the situation has worsened very considerably compared with what it was when I was both a prosecutor and a defender.  In my time, it was possible to have burglary trials and, indeed, sexual assault trials completed in two days.  That was the norm.  A three or four-day case was considered very substantial.  However, everything has become much more complicated, fought over and disputed.  That is why the preliminary determination of issues is important.<br\/><br\/>We got rid of the preliminary investigation in the District Court to see if there was a <i>prima facie <\/i>case and we pushed the matter on to circumvent that in order to speed up the hearing of cases.  It may have had a beneficial effect, but we must also bear in mind that we are incredibly slow in the prosecution of offences, even compared with the United Kingdom.  For people in rape cases and the many types of victim crime, it is a harrowing experience.  It is also so from the point of view of the accused if the accused is, in fact, innocent.  The fact that it takes years for an adjudication is very wrong.  I am a great fan of jury trial, and I believe that the constitutional guarantee of jury trial, other than in minor cases, should be upheld.  However, I must make the point that one of our problems is delay.  The Minister might not like me saying this, but one of the side benefits of the massive delay in our system is that the prison system is able to cope with a much more elongated criminal justice system than would be the case if we had speedier trials of criminal offences.<br\/><br\/>I wish to raise a point.  Senator Ward pointed out in his speech, which lasted eight minutes, some things which should be considered.  The time he had was obviously inadequate, and the time I have is inadequate too.  I would love to say many other things about this legislation.  I do not believe, for example, it would be great for opening speeches to be made available to juries.  That would probably confuse juries because, as Senator Ward said, there is a major difference between evidence and what an articulate advocate might make of the prosecution case or the defence case or the claims that may be made in such a speech.<br\/><br\/>The second point I wish to make relates to when there is a <i>voir dire<\/i>, a preliminary decision on the admissibility of evidence, which is what this is all about.  If the issue is, for example, whether a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na said to the person outside the interview room that if he or she does not confess inside, his wife or her husband is going to be arrested and their children will be taken from them or, alternatively, the member says &quot;I have given you a thump and I will give you another thump&quot;, that issue, if it is determined in advance by a judge, is currently determined on the criminal standard, or is supposed to be.  In many respects, that is questionable philosophically.  I will finish shortly, Acting Chairperson.  If a judge is confronted with a conflict of evidence, such as &quot;He did say that to me&quot; and &quot;No, he did not say that to me&quot;, can a judge reasonably say he or she is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he did not say that, if it is just one person's word against the word of another?  There are cases where issues such as that should go directly to the jury for it to decide.  Some admissibility issues are better left to the jury to decide, such as whether a threat was made before the confession was made.  Public satisfaction with the outcome of trials could be severely impaired if admissibility is determined by a judge purportedly on the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt in circumstances where he or she, effectively, has to brand the accused a liar before the evidence goes in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021041900002#LLL00200","speaker":"1669","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618824600,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for their important contributions to this debate.

Again, that is something the court would have to decide, if that is suitable or not.<\/p><p>On the second point made by the Senator, and Senator McDowell raised the same point, about the opening statements, this is something we had looked at.  Obviously, there was consideration by the Law Reform Commission.  It is based on those recommendations that it is included now but I take the point made.<\/p><p>In terms of time for expert witnesses, etc., there is a provision for ten to 28 days.  It does not mean it has to be 28 days.  There is flexibility for the court again and it is for the judge to decide that it can remain at the ten days.<\/p><p>Senators Mullen and Martin mentioned jury selection.  There was quite a lengthy discussion in the D&aacute;il when we discussed the Criminal Procedure Bill.  There is a great deal that can be done and be of huge benefit in the jury selection system being modernised.  That is something the Department is looking at and I take on board a number of different points raised.  The fact that, as Senator Martin rightly pointed out, one in five people takes this up is a clear indication that we need to reform the system for some of the very reasons outlined, and that is something we are looking at.<\/p><p>On the specific point Senator Bacik made about Coco's Law and training, part of supporting a victim's journey, which is the implementation of the O'Malley recommendations, is a clear focus on training not just for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but for the legal profession, the Judiciary and any person who comes into contact with a vulnerable person.  Training has been conducted and rolled out to all of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the divisional service protective units.  Work is currently under way with Detective Chief Superintendent Declan Daly and others to ensure training is rolled out to all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I expect that will be part of the overall training of this year.<\/p><p>As was said, it is not just about introducing and implementing legislation but it is about making sure the people who are actually enforcing the legislation understand it and know it is there, and that those who need to benefit from it can do so.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile made a point about arraigning the accused.  Therefore, it is not always needed, perhaps, where one has an initial case management scenario but wherever the court thinks it is appropriate, then obviously this is something that is possible.<\/p><p>In terms of disclosure being complete before a preliminary trial hearing, one of the purposes of a hearing is to deal with disclosures, where needed, so this is not workable but, hopefully, this will be of great help in dealing with difficulties with disclosure.<\/p><p>I thank Senators for their positive responses to this Bill.  Senator Mullen suggested we could have included this as part of other legislation, and that we would try to be more effective.  This is something that has been discussed not only since the report in 2012 but before that in the 2006 report and for me it was really important that this legislation was introduced for all of the reasons we just outlined, to make sure we have a more efficient and a more effective criminal justice system and for those going through the system, be they defendants, those prosecuting and jurors, that it is a more efficient and a more effective system for them.  While this Bill is technical, the changes in it are quite profound.  Our courts and those who use and work in them deserve to encounter a system that is modern, efficient and fit for purpose in this day and age.  I hope this legislation will go some way towards doing that.<\/p><p>I wish to acknowledge the engagement and assistance of everyone who has contributed to the legislation, in particular I thank the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, the members of the legal profession who have given their insights into this problem and the Attorney General who has worked very closely with my Department to find solutions that are practicable and workable in the very complex arena of a criminal trial.<\/p><p>The reforms in the Criminal Procedure Bill are designed to streamline a trial process to ensure the legislation on our Statute Book supports the effect of an efficient running of criminal proceedings.  This Bill presents and achieves that aim and I, therefore, commend the Bill to the House.<\/p><p>On the question as to when we hope this Bill will be enacted, we may have Committee and Remaining Stages in the Seanad next Monday but that needs to be fully agreed.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Helen McEntee:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2394\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Obviously, once that happens, it will go to the President for signing.

<\/blockquote> <p>It is a huge honour to bring this motion before the Seanad today.  It calls on the House to recognise that clean water is a basic human right of every inhabitant of this country and to acknowledge that access to clean water and sanitation is also a UN sustainable development goal to which Ireland has signed up.  We must protect it from source to sea and everything along the way, including rivers, lakes and groundwater.<\/p><p>I will now go through the commitments we made in the programme for Government, many of which were agreed following engagement with various NGOs.  As per the motion, Seanad &Eacute;ireann notes the commitment to ensure that the provision of safe drinking water and the proper treatment of wastewater will remain a priority for this Government and to refer its place in the Constitution to the relevant joint committee for consideration.  The Government is committed to retaining Irish Water in public ownership as a national, stand-alone, regulated utility and to ensuring that Irish Water is sufficiently funded to make the necessary investment in drinking water and wastewater infrastructure.  This Government will mandate Irish Water to develop plans to ensure security of supply and sufficient capacity in drinking and wastewater networks to allow for balanced regional development and will fund Irish Water&rsquo;s capital investment plan for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure on a multi-annual basis and deliver the &euro;8.5 billion funding package committed to in Project Ireland 2040.  The Government is committed to supporting the take-up of Irish Water&rsquo;s small towns and villages growth programme 2020-2024, which will provide water and wastewater growth capacity in smaller settlements that would otherwise not be provided for in Irish Water&rsquo;s capital investment plan and ensuring that the rural regeneration and development fund supports the development of such projects.<\/p><p>The programme for Government contains a commitment to support continued investment in reducing leakage across the network and to fully consider the review from the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, of Irish Water&rsquo;s proposed approach to the water supply project for the eastern and midlands regions.  The Government is committed to developing a scheme between local authorities and Irish Water to provide drinking water fountains nationwide to reduce plastic bottle litter, as modelled in Ennistymon, County Clare.  The Government will continue to help fund upgrades to wells and domestic wastewater treatment systems, including septic tanks.  The programme for Government further commits to review and work to improve the inspection regime for 500,000 domestic wastewater systems and incentivise upgrading works and to ensure that Irish Water progresses works to reduce the number of schemes on the remedial action list of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  This Government is committed to supporting Irish Water in its programme to remove lead pipes from the public supply system.  It is also committed to ensuring that the State complies with the EU water framework directive which mandates a catchment-based approach to water resource management.  Irish Water is mandated to implement this and must be sufficiently funded to do so.<\/p><p>The programme for Government also contains commitments to expand programmes, including the agriculture sustainability support and advisory programme, ASSAP, and work with farmers, industry, and advisory services, to protect and deliver badly needed improvements in water quality.  The Government will launch a new revised and strengthened river basin management plan in 2022, drawing on a collaborative approach between all stakeholders.  The Government is committed to ensuring that Irish Water develops drinking water safety plans to protect abstraction sources and reduce public health risks.  This Government will continue to support the local authorities' water programmes and expand the community water development fund.  In this context, the Government is committed to supporting the National Federation of Group Water Schemes to ensure that issues of quality and security of supply are addressed and to continuing investment in a multi-annual capital funding programme to improve the quality of drinking water in group water schemes, while protecting water quality.<\/p><p>The Government will support the work of the water services innovation fund, which aims to investigate solutions for promoting greater efficiency in water usage and will continue to work with An F&oacute;ram Uisce to review and develop water quality strategies.  The Government will commission a range of research projects to explore innovative ways of improving our water infrastructure and reducing consumption.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RoisinGarvey&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Government will reorient the agri-environment to deliver more in the short term on water quality through an ambitious eco scheme under pillar 1 of the CAP, rewarding farmers who deliver enhanced environmental performance, including improving water quality.

I formally second the motion.  In doing so, I acknowledge the near-lifelong commitment of the proposer, Senator Garvey.  A schoolteacher by trade, she has visited hundreds of schools, especially in the counties of Galway and Clare, extolling the virtues and benefits, and emphasising how vital clean water is and how important water conservation is for us all.<\/p> <p>That is because water is life.  Without water we cannot live, nor can the millions of species which inhabit the Earth.  If pollutants flow into the sea, including discharges of untreated wastewater, the coastlines wither.  We have seen what happens in Dublin Bay when untreated effluent is discharged into the sea.  Not only is it dangerous for swimmers but it is damaging fragile coastal ecosystems on which birds, sea plants and others depend.  Ireland has a rich diversity of ecosystems and wildlife in its lands, its freshwater and its marine environments.  Much of Ireland's richest diversity can be found in the marine environment where there are high numbers of whale and dolphin species, large seabird breeding colonies and cold water coral communities in the deep seas.<\/p> <p>Peatland restoration policies will contribute to the regulation and flow of quality water.  In my home county of Kildare, we are working on an initiative to establish a new peatlands park.  This is because County Kildare has the scientific, educational and the tourism infrastructure to be not just a gateway but the heartland of the national peatlands park of Ireland.  This will recognise and celebrate our peatlands' cultural and ecological heritage and ongoing contribution to our economy and society in the midlands.<\/p> <p>Buffer strips along water bodies are often used to reduce the run-off of nutrients, chemicals and sediments from farming.

They show damaging concentrations of these nutrients in our watercourses.  Eminent Kildare environmentalist Lorraine Benson is on record as saying the era of over-polluting must come to an end.  We must rebalance nature and return the land, our water and our ecosystems to a natural equilibrium.<\/p><p>The most recent data on water quality were provided from 2019 by the EPA in the water quality indicators report, which highlighted that agricultural activities are the most significant source of pollution in Irish waters, with a direct impact on 53% of the 1,460 water bodies monitored.  While agri-environmental schemes are helpful and to be welcomed, the issue is that there is too much fertiliser and slurry being spread across huge areas of the country.  What is necessary is a fundamental shift in intensive farming practice and a recognition of the issues and the ambitious actions required to remedy the problem.<\/p><p>In remedying the problem, farmers, who are doing their best in tough, challenging times, must be incentivised.  We are pushing an open door with farmers but we must incentivise the custodians of the land to make what I am suggesting feasible.  We have to support farmers.  In order to get where we want to go, there should be no diminution in quality of life or income for farmers.  I know and can safely say that the proposer of the motion, Senator Garvey, who is from rural Ireland, would 100% advocate that.  Farmers need support.  If they are given it, they will rise further to the challenge.<\/p><p>As the national environment officer with An Taisce, Dr. Elaine McGoff, recently stated, significant changes will be necessary in our agricultural model if we are to align it with policies such as the EU farm-to-fork and biodiversity strategy.  It will require concrete action and difficult decisions, not just noble ambition.<\/p><p>I look forward to a robust debate.  Motions have a place in this House, as have Bills.  The Green Party has a number of Bills coming before the House in the next couple of months, all going well.  Of all the motions one can think of, is there anything more important than the water that keeps us all alive?  We should set aside a regular time to debate water, the quality of water, and how to improve it for the betterment of society.  The Opposition does not need any advice from me, but it should hold the Government to account and challenge the Government.  At the end of the day, there is a way to achieve a win-win.  A rising tide lifts all boats.  Striving for and achieving improvement in our water system in producing cleaner, safer water is a win-win for this generation and for generations to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021041900002#WWW00200","speaker":"1667","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618824600,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his time.

It is early days yet, not even a year since the Government was formed, so we have to be fair and reasonable in opposition.

It is interesting that only a few sentences were left out.  That tells its own story.  <br\/><br\/>The sentences are as follows.  On page 40, under the heading of &quot;Conservation&quot;, it is stated: &quot;The Government will continue to provide a generous free allowance of water to every citizen to meet their basic everyday needs and provide an extra free allocation to people with specific health needs.&quot;  That is one of the five sentences that were left out.  The second reads that the Government will: &quot;Conduct a feasibility study examining how further assistance can be given to low-income households for the installation of water efficient appliances.&quot;  Again, for the record of the House and for the benefit of the stenographers, the sentences are on page 40 of the programme for Government, should anyone wish to check.  There is another section about energy that is not mentioned and one on forestry, which I will not go into.  Two or three sentences were missing.  That is telling.  I have not yet been able to find out why they were missing, which is of concern to me.<br\/><br\/>I agree with everything in this motion.  I have no difficulty with it.  I want to zone in on a few points.  In particular, I wish to focus on Irish Water.  We know what Irish Water it responsible for the production of over 608 billion litres of fresh water each year.  It is also responsible for wastewater treatment before it is returned to our rivers and the sea.  Water services are essential to the daily lives of our citizens and to our economy.  We all know that and agree with it.  It is no big mystery.  They are critical to achieving sustainable development and a clean environment and to protecting the environment.  It is important that we address the issues at hand.  I will specifically spend my time addressing the issues relating to Irish Water.<br\/><br\/>Irish Water administers this amazing resource for us.  We must be conscious of the needs and expectations of the citizens in respect of water, and specifically fresh water supply, both commercial and domestic.  We must ensure that we recognise international standards in respect of water, whether they relate to environmental concerns, water consumption, health, and all those issues.  We must also support the principles of social, economic and environmental sustainability.  Nobody has a problem with that.<br\/><br\/>I now wish to turn to the Water Sector Transformation Policy Paper, entitled Irish Water: Towards a National, Publicly-Owned, Regulated Water Services Utility, which was published on the Government's website on 23 February 2021.  I am now displaying the cover of the document so that it is clear for all Members tomorrow and the next day what we were talking about and what might have been suggested.  The paper states that the Government will amend legislation to make Irish Water a publicly-owned, national stand-alone company.  It raises serious concerns about the 3,200 local government workers, who are groundsmen, grafters, engineers, plumbers and administrators.<br\/><br\/>This group of people are on the ground.  Our 31 local authorities have done an exceptionally good job.  I have spoken to many local authority councillors, chief executives and members of staff.  They have talked about the importance of knowledge transfer and what is happening on the ground in these 31 local authorities.  They have talked about the importance of their relationships with city and county councillors.  They have also spoken of their concerns in relation to Irish Water when they face a problem.<br\/><br\/>Interestingly, as part of my research, I came upon a case that was reported in <i>The Clare Echo<\/i>.  It detailed that in Miltown Malbay in County Clare, which the Senator knows very well, residents went without fresh water for 72 hours in February of this year.  It was reported that there was complete uncertainty and a lack of knowledge as to what was happening and when the fresh water supply would return.  I have also heard about a case in Lettermore in Connemara, County Galway, in which over 900 homes were issued with boil water notices for a whole month.  When local authority staff tried to get an answer from Irish Water as to what was happening, nobody had one.  In essence, what I am saying is that the value of water is important.<br\/><br\/>I thank the trade union movement which has been heavily involved in this work and in supporting the local authority workers.  I want to see greater emphasis on, and support for, the workers in these local authorities.  I want to see greater continuity between Irish Water and local authorities so that we can deliver good quality, fresh and healthy water, and protect our environment.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I have no difficulty in fully accepting what the proposers of the motion are attempting to do, which is to reinstate what is policy in the programme for Government, which should come as no surprise.

I do not think there is any Senator, as Senator Martin said, who is more passionate about water and water quality than Senator Garvey.  The Minister of State will recall that she and I tabled a Commencement matter on this last year.<\/p> <p>The commitment in the programme for Government on water and water quality, as Senator Boyhan has said, is very strong.  It is very clear the Government will have to deliver.  It is pretty clear, even if any of us forget it, that Senator Boyhan knows it line by line and will hold us to account on it.  I agree with a number of Senator Boyhan's points on Irish Water.  Irish Water makes sense in terms of dealing with major infrastructure projects but taking away the daily maintenance of the system was a mistake.  When local authorities had responsibility, it was easy for a councillor or anyone else to ring up the local engineer to say there was a leak on a particular road or a problem with the water supply and the engineer was able to address it.  It was a mistake to take those powers away from local government, which had maintained our water system for 120 years.  We needed a national agency to deal with water infrastructure and this is very clear.  We need major investment in water infrastructure.  I entirely agree with the comments made by previous speakers so I will not repeat them.<\/p> <p>I will put this issue in the context of our rural future, the Government strategy, strategies on remote working and how we will get balanced regional development.  If we are to get balanced regional development and people living in our small villages and rural communities, what we need are the three \"Ws\".  We need Wi-Fi, water and wastewater.  If we are to move away from the strategy of one-off rural housing, and I do not want to get into that debate here, and encourage people to live in nearby villages to ensure those villages are sustainable, then we have to have water and wastewater supplies in those villages.  In most places throughout the country, and the Minister of State knows Kilkenny, which is the same as Clare, Wexford, Waterford or any other county, those villages do not have the water and wastewater supply.  I look at my area of north Wexford, where we have huge demand for housing in Gorey and the water system is under pressure.  In only one village in all of the surrounding areas is there any water or wastewater capacity.  People cannot live in their local village.  It is incumbent on the Government to address the question of water and wastewater infrastructure for our small villages if we are to have any form of balanced regional development.  There is no point in talking about our future rural strategy if we do not put that infrastructure in place.<\/p> <p>We often hear the statistics, and Senator Garvey was correct.  When we look at the EPA figures that are published annually, which are about how our rivers and water supplies are deteriorating in places, the most recent figures show that 53% of rivers, half of our lakes and only 38% of our estuaries have satisfactory ecological health.  For a country that is supposed to value water that is not good enough.  We often speak about these statistics but we when we think about the real impact I am very conscious of the Ounavarra River that flows into Courtown Harbour near my home.  Earlier this year, there was an oil spill that had huge knock-on implications for the ecological life of the river and for local fishermen and fisherwomen who wanted to fly fish in the river.  The river flows out into the sea.  We are very fortunate that Seal Rescue Ireland is based in Courtown Harbour and it has a concern about the oil that will continue to flow.<\/p> <p>If we are going to speak about protecting our blue flags and the importance of our blue flag beaches, addressing some of these challenges is very important.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Malcolm Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We cannot stress enough how important that is, not just in its own right, but in how it impacts on many other aspects of Irish life.<\/p><p>I wish to make two further comments, the first of which is on the important role of the group water schemes and the community and voluntary work done in that regard across the country.  Interestingly, the role played by women, particularly that of the Irish Countrywomen's Association, in the development of rural water schemes is often under-acknowledged.  These schemes have done a great deal to clean up our water down to the years and it is important that support be made available to them.<\/p><p>Second, clean water is not just important nationally.  As a country, we should continue to advocate strongly for clean water globally.  Some 700 million people do not have access to clean drinking water and approximately 2.5 billion lack sanitation.  I am happy that our overseas development aid policy prioritises clean water.  For example, we support the UNICEF project in Zambia and Liberia.  The challenge of ensuring clean water globally will be significant.  Climate change has an impact on it, just as it does here.  Consider the salinisation of the Bangladesh delta and what is happening in parts of Africa.  Globally, we need to be a beacon of light on the question of clean water.<\/p><p>I strongly commend Senator Garvey, who is a wonderful advocate on this issue, and I support the motion.  I urge that all of the commitments in the programme for Government, which Senator Boyhan can rightly quote, be implemented but that we also go beyond them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021041900002#ZZZ00200","speaker":"1638","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618824600,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and commend my Green Party colleagues on tabling a comprehensive Private Members' motion for consideration.  The motion is consistent with the comprehensive water policy commitments set out in the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future.  The Senators have rightly included the detail of all of those in the motion.  Strong progress is being made in delivering on that broad range of water policy commitments.  Over the coming years, we will develop, enhance and improve our water services and the protection of water quality by enacting legislation and strengthening investment programmes through Irish water.<\/p> <p>The main thrust of the motion calls for greater investment in the quality of our water service systems and in protecting the quality of our water bodies.  Since 2014, Irish Water and our local authorities have been working hard on unifying our systems.  There are some who question the merits or demerits of that work, but we all agree that having a world class water system that is integrated and has full investment is positive.<\/p> <p>The White Paper that the Government agreed to last month charts the future for Irish Water.  The Minister of State will agree that, in that context, it is important that the negotiations between all parties be handled delicately and that staff be at their centre.

In that context, it is important to note that development plans are being devised by local authorities across the country and it will be important for Irish Water to follow the lead of local authorities in their development plans, as opposed to the other way around, whereby Irish Water might try to dictate to local authorities about investment priorities.  I ask the Minister of State to take that message on board.<\/p><p>We must be careful at all times when talking about the impact of agriculture on water supplies.  I have always found the agricultural community to be willing to change and to embrace that change.  They have done this for generations and I have absolutely no doubt that they will do it in future.  There is, however, a tendency on the part of some outside the Chamber to try to talk down to the agricultural community, saying it is the problem and the reason for all the ills.  As politicians, we all know the only way we can bring people along is to have dialogue and incentivise people.  I have absolutely no doubt that if we do this, the agricultural community will not be found wanting in this regard.<\/p><p>In respect of the rural water services programme, it is estimated that 11% of Irish people get their water from private water supplies.  I raised a Commencement matter in this regard after Christmas, to which the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, responded.  There is an 85% grant of up to &euro;5,000 for sinking a new well and it is generally sufficient but the &euro;1,000 treatment grant where there is poor water quality is not sufficient in many cases.  The Minister of State indicated this would be reviewed after 12 months, which will be in June and I ask the Minister to take this on board.  We need to look at revising the criteria and at inserting an \"and-or\" clause, in order that the funding can be used for either a new well or treatment or both, in light of the fact that treatment often costs more than &euro;1,000.<\/p><p>I wish the Minister of State well and I thank my colleagues in the Green Party for bringing forward this very important motion on water quality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021041900002#AAAA00200","speaker":"1647","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618824600,"counter":190,"content":"<p>I may not use all my time.

I pay tribute to the Green Party Senators for their Private Members' motions.<\/p> <p>Like others, I hope agreement can be reached between Irish Water and local authority members before the July deadline.  From a Labour Party perspective, it is critical that the terms and conditions of workers in local authorities are protected.

With that in mind, we need to have a conversation about our investment in water infrastructure, which has reached a crisis point and, with climate change gaining speed, is likely to reach even more of a crisis point.  Meaningful water quality has to mean investing in upgrades of pre-existing wastewater treatment plants.  There is no point in talking about a revamped national development plan and national planning framework with bespoke solutions for increased housing in places such as Cork, Waterford and Galway if the infrastructure is not there to deliver the increased capacity that would be required to build those houses.<\/p><p>I now move to the important public health issue of wastewater discharge into our environment and the important investment that is needed in this regard.  Last September, the Water Advisory Body basically admonished Irish Water and the Government for their slowness in addressing the legacy defects in Ireland's wastewater treatment infrastructure.  The Water Advisory Body stated that the pace at which Irish Water was doing so \"is too slow and there are repeated delays in providing treatment to many areas\", that \"19 large towns and cities ... [do] not meet European Union standards set to protect the environment\" and that 33 towns and villages will continue to discharge raw sewage after 2021 because they will still not have a wastewater treatment plant.<\/p><p>One thing I have seen during the Covid pandemic has been the increased popularity of sea swimming, but with that comes a greater focus on the quality of the water in Dublin Bay, which is a biosphere.  SOS Dublin Bay last month published a survey it had done of swimmers in the area.  In March, 1,200 people were interviewed, and 21.8% of the participants declared they had been ill or had suffered adverse health effects as a result of swimming in the sea daily, which should be the safest, or at least a semi-safe, natural and normal thing to do.  SOS Dublin Bay analysed data between 2017 and 2020 which it says show that 8.9 cu. m of untreated sewage and stormwater was discharged into Dublin Bay, mainly from the Ringsend treatment plant.  To put that into context for people such as me who are not experts in this area, it means 3,550 full-sized Olympic swimming pools of untreated water over the four-year period, or 74 every month, dumped into Dublin Bay.<\/p><p>We need to get serious about investment in water infrastructure.  I am certain that the Green Party in government will prioritise and progress this, but we all need to have a long-term commitment to this.  For all the debate surrounding Irish Water in 2016 and 2017, from which I am still traumatised, one of the things I think everybody on a cross-party basis agreed was that Irish Water needs to stay in public ownership and we need to invest in our water system because it is at a critical crisis point.  When any long-term weather event takes place, be it snow or too much sun, we tend to have water shortages.  We need to work on a cross-party basis in the House to ensure we invest in that water infrastructure.  It is not necessarily popular and it is not often called for but it is absolutely critical to future growth and the health of our population.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021041900002#BBBB00200","speaker":"1672","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618824600,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I add my voice to the welcome for this motion brought forward by the Green Party.  It opens by stating that Seanad &Eacute;ireann \"recognises that clean water is a basic human right of every inhabitant of this country\".  I completely agree, but it is incumbent on states to give effect to such rights.  In 2010, there was a resolution before the UN General Assembly and, unfortunately, the Irish Government, of which the Green Party and Fianna F&aacute;il were both members at the time, abstained on it.  Thankfully, it passed without the support of the Irish State, but in 2014 the very successful European Citizens' Initiative gathered 1.8 million signatures from citizens across the EU member states calling for that right to be recognised in EU law.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Boylan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The European Commission then ignored the Right2Water European Citizens' Initiative.  In 2015, I was the rapporteur for the report passed by the European Parliament that echoed the calls from citizens across EU member states for the human right to water and sanitation to be recognised in EU law.<br\/><br\/>It is now 2021 and the EU and Ireland have yet to give effect to the UN resolution on the human right to water and sanitation.  We have a proud history with regard to the right to water in this country.  People were not going to take regressive water charges lying down.  They mobilised through trade unions, civil society organisations and community groups and built a real movement in the form of Right2Water Ireland.  Those mobilisations we saw were the largest in the history of the State and they caught the attention of water rights movements across the globe, including in Bolivia, the US, Canada, Italy, Spain and Germany.  <br\/><br\/>International organisations such as Food &amp;amp; Water Watch as well as the Blue Planet Project co-founder and author of multiple books on the human right to water, Maude Barlow, rightly praised zero water poverty in Ireland as being a direct result of not having domestic water charges.  I have spoken in many countries and engaged with multiple academics about household metering not reducing water use and in some cases actually having the opposite effect of increasing usage.  Not only that, but individual household meters add to the cost of water provision, whereas district metering facilitates leak identification without significantly increasing the cost of water provision.<br\/><br\/>I will use the rest of my time to highlight some other areas of concern regarding water, specifically data centres.  Owned by large multinationals, such as Facebook and Amazon, these centres use vast amounts of water.  As Killian Woods reported last summer in the <i>Business Post<\/i>, these facilities require &quot;millions of litres of water every day to cool down their servers&quot;.  That revelation came after a hosepipe ban had been introduced to cut back on household water usage due to drought conditions.<br\/><br\/>I highlighted some of the issues with data centres previously, especially regarding their impact on our greenhouse gas, GHG, emissions and increasing demand on the grid.  It all boils down to the fact that the planning authorities, which are local authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la, are not required to take account of the cumulative impact these data centres are having on our infrastructure and on reaching our climate targets.  Instead, they can only consider each data centre individually on its own merits, including with regard to water usage.  The usage of a data centre may not seem huge but the cumulative effect is considerable.  <br\/><br\/>Climate change also means that Ireland is becoming more susceptible to water scarcity.  This is especially the case in the eastern part of the country, the region that has seen the mushrooming of data centres in recent years.  Environmental impact assessments, EIAs, fail to consider this, as An Taisce has correctly highlighted.  The UN resolution on the right to water obliges states to take deliberate action to prevent third parties such as corporations from interfering in any way with the enjoyment of the right to water.  However, we have a Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, headed by the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, which is enthusiastically encouraging more of these data centres to be established here without putting adequate protections in place.<br\/><br\/>I also raise the issue of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, and the threat it poses to the right to water.  The UN special rapporteur on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation has remarked that states, in entering into agreements regarding trade and investment, must ensure that such agreements do not limit or hinder a country's capacity to ensure the full realisation of human rights to water and sanitation.  We must be alive to the threat that CETA poses to our water and sanitation.<br\/><br\/>We oppose investment treaties that prioritise corporate rights over human rights.  The arbitration chapters of trade agreements like CETA allow private companies to sue governments for legislation which affects their legitimate expectations of profit.  There have already been significant investment disputes regarding water under the Energy Charter Treaty, ECT, and the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, with both cases resulting in settlements in favour of investors and against the states in question.  Article 1.9 of CETA clearly states: &quot;If a Party permits the commercial use of a specific water source, it shall do so in a manner consistent with this Agreement.&quot;  Commercial use is, therefore, subject to CETA trade and investment rules.  Under CETA's negative list, all public services are threatened because they are all covered in the agreement unless explicitly ruled out by the Government.  The Government has made no effort to protect the ownership or regulation of education, health, water, transport, waste disposal, oil, gas, energy and-or grids, among other important sectors.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Boylan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As I thought I had more time, I also want to move on to the issue of fracking, which wreaks havoc on water supplies.

Is the Government just going to flag it up so the companies can get their applications in before the ban comes into place?  We know that the Shannon liquefied natural gas, LNG, terminal is still on the projects of common interest, PCI, list until September 2021.  Therefore, we need that ban on the importation of fracked gases.  We have rightly banned fracked gas here because of its impact on water.

It is very important and certainly one that my party supports without any shadow of a doubt.  It is consistent with the comprehensive water quality commitments set out in the programme for Government.<\/p> <p>The overall policy approach of the Government is based on a shared understanding that a significant programme of transformation is absolutely necessary to ensure that modern and effective systems for the delivery of water and wastewater services develop over time in Ireland.  Indeed, in my town in Newbridge at the moment, we have roadworks all over the place because of the delivery of a &euro;38 million project extending the water and wastewater system.  While we can constantly be negative about roadworks or being stopped in our paths in terms of traversing the town, it is still absolutely crucial to recognise the importance of that investment in the infrastructure and how important it is that we all have access to a safe and secure supply of water.<\/p> <p>Many of us will have had experiences otherwise.  I remember, perhaps ten years ago in Rathangan, that for four full days nobody in the village had access to any water whatsoever in the middle of the hot summer.  When something like that impacts on us, we know absolutely to our detriment how important and vital water is to our very being.  While the supply of water to our homes is hugely important, having clean water around us is also essential.  I am very lucky to live close to a canal and a river.  We see the water sports that are available and we have seen so many people, particularly over the last 12 months, rediscovering swimming, etc.  It is important that all our waterways are kept clean in order that we can all avail of them in the way we wish.<\/p> <p>This motion, therefore, is an opportunity to set out the progress that is being made on our water services by the Government.  It is fair to say and to acknowledge that strong progress is being made on the broad range of water policy commitments aimed at developing and improving water services and protecting the quality of our water environment by advancing appropriate policy and legislative reforms, and by strengthening our investment programmes.<\/p> <p>I know the Government recently approved a policy paper on Irish Water and that the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, brought forward a further paper to the Cabinet committee on the environment on proposals for Ireland's third river basin plan.

The national development plan estimates that close to &euro;14 billion will be required over the period from now to the mid-2030s.

I thank the Green Party for bringing forward this important motion today.  I grew up in an area where water was very scarce, and we spent our summers filling water for cattle and digging wells.  Then we had the advent of the group water schemes and they played a very important role throughout the length and breadth of the country.  They provided a great source of water for farmers and communities at large.  Group water schemes made mistakes at the beginning, but they made big advances.  As an extensive county like Mayo could not always justify a large public water scheme, the group water schemes came into being and they filled the gap where the State was not able to provide water.  In many cases the State made large contributions to group water schemes as well.<\/p> <p>I wish to be parochial and speak about a new group water scheme for Downpatrick, just outside Ballycastle, County Mayo, for 29 houses.  Those involved are at a loss as to the reason they cannot advance the scheme but it is due to the lack of finance.  The scheme is very small.  The area suffers from naturally occurring iron oxide and arsenic in the water.  This is a very scenic part of the country that includes Downpatrick Head, which is a focal point from a tourism point of view and is visited by thousands of tourists every year.  The public toilets that are provided are dry, which is surprising in this day and age.  The people involved in the scheme cannot drink the water, use it for washing clothes or taking showers.  They tried several approaches, including developing a small scheme themselves and they have dug wells but the corrosive nature of the iron oxide and the arsenic affects the pipes and a well might only last a couple of years.  A scheme has been presented to the Department, which has contributed up to &euro;10,000 per house, but those concerned are short of approximately &euro;130,000 for the scheme in addition to what the Department is willing to give at present.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paddy Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1866\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1866&amp;amp;pid=PaddyBurke&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I ask the Minister of State to look favourably on this scheme.

I live approximately 7 miles from Eyre Square.  At 45 years of age, I can remember heading over to the neighbour's as a young lad to get buckets of water from the well and turn on pumps to pump water from the river.  Fortunately, group water schemes were put in place throughout rural Ireland in the 1970s and 1980s.  There was very much a hands-on approach by rural residents to improve their lot, with support from local authorities and the State.  It was not much appreciated during the debate on the establishment of Irish Water and the introduction of water charges that people in rural Ireland had done so much to improve their lot and avail of clean drinking water.<\/p> <p>When I was elected to Galway County Council in 2004, there was a huge list of wastewater projects that had not been developed across County Galway.  There are still some projects to be completed but, fortunately, in the intervening period, and certainly since the establishment of Irish Water, there has been much progress on a range of schemes, including in Headford, Claregalway, Milltown, Oughterard, Leenane, Letterfrack, Clifden and Kinvara.  There are other areas that need work, some of which Irish Water is progressing through planning permission, including in An Cheathr&uacute; Rua, where there are difficulties in terms of planning, An Spid&eacute;al, where planning has been granted, and Roundstone, where the process is under way.  Other areas like Clarenbridge, which is a fine town that has a network, do not have a proper sewerage scheme.  There is still an amount of work to be done.<\/p> <p>One of my concerns regarding Irish Water is that it is very much focused, for financial reasons and out of necessity, because of pressure from the EPA on dealing with the list of towns and villages with which the agency has issues.  There must be more strategic thinking in terms of areas that need to be primed for development.  For example, what was called the east Galway main drainage scheme, which is east of Galway city and encompasses the Athenry, Clarenbridge and Oranmore areas, is a strategic project for delivery, involving areas that are identified for growth in Galway city and environs in the national planning framework.  It is very much a critical project that Irish Water needs to take hold of and deliver.<\/p> <p>I welcome the Green Party's motion.

By 2019-20 every one of them had been remediated.  In one case, in Ballinlough, west Roscommon, 3,000 people were on a boil water notice for two years.  At that time, RT&Eacute; and others were reporting every second week from Roscommon about boil water notices.  People went through sheer hell.  There is no doubt about that.  In some cases, water tankers had to be brought in to supply people.  We are sometimes critical of our local authorities and Irish Water.  If there was ever a time when officials from Irish Water and our local authorities were deserving of a pat on the back, it was in respect of their remediation of the 13 water supply issues in Roscommon in 2015.  I know there is still some work to be done in the county but that work was a major step forward.  <\/p><p>There is another area about which we need to be careful.  I refer to the Irish Water public water supply monitoring programme.  A recent report referenced a situation in the Ballinasloe area where the water was affected by pesticides.  I am sure Senator Dolan is aware of that report.  In the Ballinasloe-Connemara area there were nine instances of the pesticide limit having been exceeded in the public water supply.  As Senator Dolan will be aware, in the Ballinasloe area much of the supply comes from the River Suck.  I know from my horticultural work that products such as MCPA and 2,4-D are horrendous products.  The problem was caused by run-off from those products.  Many farmers are very careful.  Some farmers told me recently that they want to reduce their use of nitrogen.  A form of urea is available now that is not as damaging, but farmers are concerned about run-offs.  As I mentioned earlier, there have been run-offs into rivers that support the public water supply.  We have to ensure they do not occur.  We must work towards having a supply that is safe for everybody.  <\/p><p>It is good to have the Minister of State here to debate this important and positive motion.

I am part of a community group that has fought this for the past four years.  Permission was granted last Friday in spite of numerous expert reports submitted about the impact on the water supply.  We won in the High Court in 2018 because of the adverse impact on our water.  The River Bunowen flows into the River Suck, from where the drinking water is taken.  This is what the people in the area drink.  We just got the all-clear from the EPA on water, yet a decision was made to allow this.

I recall when investment was planned a long number of years ago when I started in the House, and the Irish Water model was proposed.  People protested in the streets.  Paying for water is appropriate if people can afford it because it is a finite resource.  It is not limitless and costs money to purify.  It is regrettable to think that of the &euro;1.2 billion spent two or three years ago to purify our water, &euro;600 million went to waste because of poor infrastructure and leaking pipes.  Irish Water is doing its best to some degree.  Certainly any time I have engaged with it on humanitarian issues, when people have found themselves in difficulty because of significant leakages but were not in a position to discharge the bill, it has very much had an open door to listening to the stories and working with them to find a resolution.  I acknowledge this because Irish Water can often be criticised, a lot of the time justifiably so but certainly sometimes not.<\/p> <p>I come from County Clare where a number of villages need new group water schemes and improved infrastructure.  These include Doolin, Cooraclare, Carrigaholt and Broadford.  These villages cannot develop any further because they will not get planning permission because of the poor waste water and water facilities infrastructure.  We have had meetings with the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, on this particular issue.  We were told there may be a pilot scheme but we are still waiting for the details of it.  Such a pilot scheme would be welcome.  I can speak about these four villages in Clare off the top of my head but there are probably another 40 that could benefit from investment.  If we are serious about regenerating rural Ireland, and I acknowledge much has happened and there is much genuine commitment to doing so with announcements as late as this morning in this regard, we have to get the infrastructure right.  There is no point building a house unless the foundation is secure.  The foundation of any village is to have good quality drinking water and proper waste water infrastructure.

One of the first things she said on entering the Seanad was that her number one priority was water.

The issue of water might not be at the top of the agenda for members of green parties in other parts of the world but as an island nation where 20% of the land is wetland, this is the number one green issue because water gives us life, but also because 40% of species here are reliant on wetlands, rivers, lakes and seas for their survival.  It is 100% down our alley as members of the Green Party that we get this right.<\/p> <p>That is why it is important to mention all the things that have been achieved so far.  Previous speakers have mentioned some of them.  Senator Cummins stated that it is important to recognise what has been done already while the Government has been in power.  The White Paper was released last month.  It is appropriate that we do not go into the details of it, but it shows that this is a priority.  There is so much in the programme for Government on the issue of water that I feel very confident that we will tackle these issues.  One of the first lines of the motion notes the commitment in the programme for Government to refer this issue to a joint Oireachtas committee.  That is the right place for it.  Let us have a proper all-party conversation on the issue of water, which is so essential to life.<\/p> <p>According to a 2019 report produced by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, half of water in this country is not being treated correctly.  That is a significant proportion.  It is about life but it is also about the homelessness and housing crises.  In rural Ireland in particular, we are very much dependent on getting water right in order to get houses right.  As regards Gaeltacht areas, we cannot properly invest in Gaeltacht areas, in tourism or small businesses in Connemara until we get wastewater treatment right.  Senator Kyne mentioned many of the ongoing projects and I really look froward to seeing those progress.<\/p> <p>Senator O'Loughlin quoted W.H. Auden.  I am going to be somewhat poetic as well.  I was listening to RT&Eacute; Lyric FM this morning and heard Marty Whelan speaking about the fact that in the 1980s no one had heard of bottled water.  Now we all know about bottled water.  That is partly because there is a problem with our water but it is also because the trust and confidence of people have been lost when it comes to the quality of water, and rightly so in the context of reports such as that from the EPA.  <\/p> <p>From an international and global perspective, some countries are in drought as a result of climate change.  It is predominantly women and children who are impacted by drought in some of the poorest parts of those countries.  That is a consequence of climate change.   These things go hand in hand.  It is about investing in Irish Water but it is also about getting the climate right if we are to get water back to where we need it to be.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Pauline O'Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=PaulineOreilly&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> The investment in Irish Water of &euro;1.3 billion in 2021 by the Government restores the previous levels of investment.  That shows that this is not a motion about what we will do but that these measures are already being taken by those of us in government.  One of the legacies of our three parties in government will be sorting out this problem.  We have had a negative legacy up to now when it comes to water but the effort being put into this issue means that coming out of government we will have sorted it out.  <\/p><p>I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House to listen to everybody's views.  I know he is an expert in the area and I can see that he is taking it all in.  I look forward to engaging with him further on it.

There is a great deal in it.  I hope the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, negotiations work very well and that the local authority employees feel comfortable about all the changes that are coming.<\/p> <p>I came to the whole water issue a number of years ago having had the experience of working in Rwanda and seeing at first hand what happens when an entire community is impoverished when it comes to water and has to struggle with the provision of water.  Thankfully, through Irish Aid, a water pump was installed and the entire community got the benefit of that.  I saw that at first hand and, consequently, when it came to the idea of us paying for water, I had no inhibitions about that and felt it was the right thing to do.  It is right that we are responsible and that we recognise this is a finite and precious resource, with all the caveats that those who cannot pay would not be denied access to water.  I do not believe it was ever suggested that anybody would be denied water.  However, I appreciate that there were challenges when it came to the issue of who could afford to pay.<\/p> <p>I have also had the experience of having to negotiate on behalf of people whose residential development was a legacy of the Celtic tiger period in having to deal with its wastewater treatment.  They were living in the middle of nowhere and were left there with a system that was at the mercy of a developer who would or would not accept responsibility for it.  There are legacy issues such as that one that need to be considered and dealt with also, especially when those estates from the Celtic tiger era are being taken in charge now.  Councils cannot step back and not take responsibility for something that was not the residents' fault.  They bought their properties out of desperation on the outskirts of Dublin within the commuter belt, be that very far away from the city.<\/p> <p>I draw the Minister of State's attention to the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Act, which I know is not under his remit but that of another colleague.  There is a provision in that Act that the Office of Public Works removes riverside trees and vegetation with heavy machinery that are affecting wildlife habitats.  Can we review the necessity for that in the context of all of this work on water?<\/p> <p>I fully support and would like to see us move as soon as possible towards a statutory provision to have our water always in public ownership.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021041900002#LLLL00400","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1618824600,"counter":220,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it chuig an Seanad.  I agree with much of what has been said previously.  There has been a focus on inland waterways, particularly on inland water courses.  I might turn the focus on our coastal regions coming as I do from D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  One of the major problems we have now in Dublin Bay, notwithstanding the fact that it is a UNESCO biosphere and that it enjoys the protection under planning legislation of being a special protection area, SPA, and a special area of conservation, SAC, is an increased number of people sea swimming in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and Dublin Bay, especially at places like the Forty Foot, Seapoint, Hawk Cliff and Killiney beach that Members would have heard of.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Barry Ward:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is welcome but the reality is that the water quality there at the moment does not match what people are doing.  Too often, it is not safe.  The strange thing is that we have had this problem for a long time.  We have a Victorian sewer system in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  This means rainwater and run-off from the road goes into the sewer system to the treatment plant at West Pier and is pumped underwater to Poolbeg for treatment as if it were sewerage, even though we know that it is not.  Much of that could run safely into the sea.  That works most of the time but there is limited capacity in West Pier.  Every now and then when we have a strong rainfall event or, for whatever reason, there is a large volume of water in the system, the attenuation tank and pumping station in West Pier cannot handle the capacity or volume of water, including run-off, that goes into the station.  What happens?  It simply overflows into the sea at the back of West Pier in an area we know as \"The Gut\", right next to Seapoint Martello tower, where people swim all the time.  As disgusting as that is, that it usually happens before people are told that it is happening.<\/p><p>I heard Senators referring to a figure of billions of euro.  It will cost billions to put in place a modern-day sewerage system that separates grey water from brown water, to use that terminology, or to separate the run-off from what comes out of domestic sewage systems.  The aim is that we treat whatever needs to be treated but either recycle or discharge what does not.  This means grey water can be recycled into houses.  We had a fantastic system in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown with a social housing scheme that started in 2009 when I was on the council.  It was at Benamore in Blackrock and used a sustainable urban drainage system.  It cut all the rainwater and brought it into a small treatment unit within the housing development, treated it and used it then to flush the toilets within the complex.  That effective use of water can be achieved, but it requires investment.  Until we put that investment in place, water quality in Dublin Bay will not be what it should be.  It is neither okay for swimming nor for the ecology, marine life or the fish and shellfish that we eat from the bay.  I am conscious that the Minister of State has listened attentively to the debate.  I appeal to him to include Dublin Bay and our coastal communities in plans to refine and improve water quality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021041900002#LLLL00500","speaker":"1685","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618824600,"counter":222,"content":"<p>I call the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan.

We should never underestimate the significance or importance of such debates in the Seanad.  They are important.  We can never debate the issue of water enough, either in this House or in the D&aacute;il.  Moreover, I thank everyone for the passion they have brought to the debate.<\/p> <p>The Programme for Government: Our Shared Future sets a high level of ambition around sustainable water management.

If I can address any specific issues, I will do so but I appeal to Senators who have raised specific matters to contact me directly and I will try to address them.<\/p> <p>The past decade has seen a significant period of institutional reform in the approach to the delivery of water services as well as the governance and practice of water protection.  However, significant and complex challenges remain.  We must continue to build on these reforms.  We will continue high levels of investment in water service infrastructure and strengthen measures to address water pollution.<\/p> <p>Irish Water is now delivering a coherent approach to water services and is firmly established as the national public water utility.  It has strengthened the delivery and management of water services investment.  A robust policy and funding architecture is now in place for public water services following the report of the Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services published in April 2017.  Robust governance, accountability and oversight arrangements are in place, with economic regulation by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities and environmental regulation by the EPA.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->An F&oacute;ram Uisce and the Water Advisory Body have specific roles to oversee the performance of Irish Water.  As we heard during today's debate, Ireland's waters are subject to growing environmental pressures.  While some water bodies have improved in recent years, overall water quality is in decline.  This is primarily due to nutrient pollution in rivers.  Today, just over half of Ireland's surface water bodies meet the standards set out by the EU water framework directive to achieve \"good\" status or higher.  Reversing the deterioration within the statutory timeframe set by EU member states at 2027 is a formidable challenge and effective measures are now required.  The condition of remaining surface water bodies is \"moderate\", \"poor\" or \"bad\".  Groundwater is in better condition, with more than 90% of bodies achieving \"good\" status.<\/p><p>The excessive loss of nutrients from farmland and waste water discharges represents the most significant impact on water quality, followed by siltation due to sediment run-off into rivers and changes to flow patterns in rivers.  These pressures were set out again in the EPA state of the environment report, published on 24 November 2020, which highlights raw sewage discharges to water from 35 towns and villages, loss of pristine water quality status from more than 500 areas in the 1980s to 20 in 2020, and increasing nutrient damage in rivers and marine environments.<\/p><p>To meet these challenges in a sustainable way, Ireland must act on three fronts.  We need to continue with the institutional reforms that will ensure Irish Water, in particular, delivers on its potential to become a world-class public utility to serve current and future needs of the Irish people, acknowledging, as was raised by Members, current issues around SLAs, local authorities and those talks.  We need to provide the investment required to ensure we meet our EU drinking water and waste water services obligations, while supporting balanced urban and rural development.  We need to protect our rivers, lakes and groundwater by including improved measures in the next river basin management plan, including by modernising our legal framework and working across Government to address water quality, climate change and biodiversity losses in an integrated way. <\/p><p>In terms of institutional reform, Irish Water and local authorities have made real progress, working together since 2014, in unifying our public water systems nationwide.  The programme for Government includes a commitment to \"retain Irish Water in public ownership as a national, standalone, regulated utility\" while ensuring it is sufficiently funded to fulfil its role.  In February, the Government published a policy paper on water sector transformation, which charts the course for completing the institutional reform programme by fully integrating water services operations within Irish Water's structure by 2022.  The aim of this is to achieve a world-class, publicly owned national water services utility and bring greater coherence to managing water services and delivery in its environmental impact across the country.  The Workplace Relations Commission has been asked to work with all parties to progress the significant change programme which is required to deliver this.  The Government believes it will be possible to reach a collective agreement which will address the interests and concerns of all key stakeholders, including workers, local authorities and Irish Water, while delivering a world-class utility for citizens.<\/p><p>Separately, the Government will shortly publish the general scheme of a Bill to establish Irish Water as a stand-alone utility separated from the Ervia group, which is hoped to be enacted this year.  This is an important step to providing reassurance on the development of a national, publicly owned water utility.<\/p><p>In terms of investment, the water services policy statement 2018-2025 sets out the broad vision and policy objectives for the development of water and waste water services in Ireland.  The statement's three thematic objectives of quality, conservation and future-proofing are aligned with the national development plan, NDP, the national planning framework and the river basin management plan for Ireland, 2018-2021.  Irish Water's investment plans are framed in this context.  The NDP is based on a forecast spend of almost &euro;8.5 billion in public water services by Irish Water over the ten years from 2018 to 2027.  This was based on known investment needs, at the earlier stages of Irish Water&rsquo;s establishment, to support the continued operation, repair and upgrading of the country&rsquo;s water and waste water infrastructure to support sustainable social, economic and environmental progress.  These forecasts will be updated as part of the current review of the NDP.  Approximately 80% of Irish Water&rsquo;s funding requirement is met through the Government&rsquo;s Voted Exchequer investment in Irish Water.  This stands at &euro;1.3 billion in 2021 and it is directly related to the cost of providing domestic water services.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This high level of investment will be maintained to achieve greater environmental compliance, overcome challenges in water and wastewater treatment infrastructure, address unacceptably high water leakage rates, service future housing and development needs and ensure security of supply across the country.<\/p><p>The programme for Government also commits to supporting the take-up of Irish Water&rsquo;s small towns and villages growth programme.  This was devised by Irish Water to provide water and wastewater growth capacity in smaller settlements through an investment fund of almost &euro;100 million with the approval of the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU.  Irish Water expects to notify local authorities of successful projects on a staggered basis over the coming weeks and months as project details are decided.<\/p><p>Equally important is the Exchequer support provided through the rural water programme for water and wastewater services in areas which are not served by the public water system.  I acknowledge the incredible voluntary contribution of group water schemes in maintaining the vibrancy of rural communities.  Approximately 6% of the population has its drinking water supplied by community-run group water schemes.  In addition, almost 10% of the population relies on private wells.  Nearly 30% of households are not connected to public wastewater services and depend on septic tanks, group wastewater treatment schemes or other arrangements.  The rural water programme provides for priority investment needs which will support proper planning and sustainable development in rural areas.  It also helps Ireland meet its water framework directive commitments.<\/p><p>In terms of the wider environment, Ireland&rsquo;s second River Basin Management Plan 2018-2021 outlines the measures adopted to improve water quality in Ireland&rsquo;s groundwater, rivers, and lakes, estuarine and coastal waters during the current planning cycle.  Its priorities include compliance with EU directives such as the urban wastewater treatment directive; prevention of deterioration in water status; meeting the objectives for designated protected areas such as bathing waters and shellfish growing waters; protection of high-status waters; and implementation of targeted actions and pilot schemes in priority areas aimed at targeting status improvements in water bodies close to meeting their objective while addressing more complex issues that will build knowledge for the next cycle.<\/p><p>Key actions have focused on addressing agricultural discharges and investment in wastewater infrastructure as two areas of significant pressures on waters.  Despite decades of success in addressing industrial pollution and major urban discharges, we are now experiencing declines in water body status mainly due to diffuse pollution.  The third cycle river basin management plan will seek to reverse this trend.  Building on the new governance structures implemented under the second plan and adopting a cross-Department, multi-agency approach, the plan will set out the environmental objectives to be achieved up to 2027, as well as identifying the measures needed to achieve these objectives.<\/p><p>In preparing this plan, three critical phases of public consultation are to be completed.  The Department has recently completed the second phase of consultation on the significant water management issues.  Informed by the results of this consultation, a draft river basin management plan is currently being prepared.  It will be opened for another phase of consultation before being finalised for publication by the end of this year.  This third plan will include strong additional measures such as new rules around the protection of drinking water sources; the limitation or mitigation of agricultural inputs; the management of Ireland&rsquo;s 500,000 septic tanks; careful afforestation practices; controls on the abstraction of water; and actions to prevent soil run-off, among other responses.  Ireland&rsquo;s water environment legal code also needs substantial attention to give coherent effect to relevant EU directives.<\/p><p>The recent Environmental Protection Agency state of the environment report has also usefully drawn attention to the interconnectedness of our environmental challenges, along with the consequent need for integrated policy responses and an overarching environmental policy statement.  Every such opportunity will be explored in finalising Ireland&rsquo;s third river basin management plan to ensure actions and methodologies required to tackle water quality issues will also serve to address climate change obligations and biodiversity losses.  By working coherently in this way, we can achieve better environmental outcomes all round.<\/p><p>I have set out in broad terms the Government&rsquo;s water services policy programme, which is centred on completing necessary institutional reforms, ensuring the required level of investment and protecting our rivers, lakes, estuaries, coastal waters and groundwater.  Demonstrable progress is being made in addressing the challenges we face.  The Government will continue to deliver strongly on the ambitious commitments to water services contained in the programme for Government.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This work includes: the recent publication of the policy paper on water sector transformation, which charts the course for the full integration of water services operations within Irish Water&rsquo;s structure by 2022; advancing the general scheme for a Bill to establish Irish Water as a national, stand-alone, regulated utility in public ownership, with a view to its enactment in 2021; updating Irish Water's investment programme under the national development plan review to ensure enhanced support for sustainable urban and rural development; finalising Ireland's third river basin management plan in order to deliver on our obligations to protect our water bodies from further decline and to restore water quality in a manner that is consistent with climate change and biodiversity objectives; and strengthening the rural water programme.<\/p><p>In this way, we are ensuring that effective arrangements are in place to \"provide for the management, treatment and distribution of safe water through systems in public or community ownership, ensuring the protection and restoration of the ecological status of water bodies,\" as called for in the motion before the House.

We could probably talk about water all day.  If we do not sort out water, we will not and cannot sort out housing.  We know that housing is one of the top issues in Ireland, along with health.  Health and housing will never be sorted if we do not sort out water.  This is a very serious issue.  It is actually a crisis but we do not call it a water crisis.  It is time that we started using the word \"crisis\".  We have a climate crisis, we have the health crisis and we need to start using the word \"crisis\" with regard to water also.<\/p> <p>I have mentioned Miltown Malbay on several occasions in the Seanad.  Not only have households there lost water for 72 hours, they have lost their water supply more than 72 times in the past six months alone.  My village of Inagh had no water for six weeks.  The state of water in this country is one of the main reasons that drove me to enter politics.  The water cycle is taught in every school but we, as a people and as a Government, seem to forget our part in that water cycle.  We are here to represent the people of Ireland who all have issues with water, be it wasting money on plastic bottles of water, problems with sewerage or not trusting the quality of water when it comes to swimming in it.  There are many issues and this is our job.  We need to do this to sort out water for people.<\/p> <p>I referred to the need for funding for infrastructure in several ways, but it is also key that we look to nature-based solutions in the context of poor water quality.  When we look to nature, we see how it can be done and often at a lower cost.  I have seen, for example, how reed bed systems and services work for 56 houses in one small village.  We will have to do a lot more research on that.  It is not all about hard engineering and wasting loads of money on consultants here and there all around the country.  We need to do it well and we need to do it with nature in mind.  I look to the Minister of State and his expertise in that field in bringing this to the Department because he is an expert on nature based solutions around water issues and catchment area solutions.<\/p> <p>With regard to farmers, we must be very careful because there are all kinds of farmers and all kinds of people responsible for this problem.  Maybe some farmers are contributing, but not all farmers.  There are lots of different farmers all over the country and I hate to generalise by using the word \"all\" about, for example, all the Greens, all the women or all the people from Clare.  We must be careful because there are many brilliant farmers who are not polluting the waters.  There are plenty who do but we have to make sure that we treat people individually.  We spend millions of euro on water treatment, but nearly half of our treated water is lost through leaks.  People can get sick from poisons in our water.  I have had two families in touch with me whose children suffered kidney failure.<\/p> <p>It is good that Senator Boylan mentioned fracking.  There is a difference between talking about things and doing things.  I started Fracking Free Clare back in the day.  It led to Clare County Council being the first council in Ireland to ban fracking.  I made a documentary about the matter, which we showed all over Ireland.  It led to a national ban on fracking.  I feel very strongly about liquid fracked gas and I have often spoken about the contaminated water that comes with fracked gas.  It is important that if we are contributing that we contribute in a solution-based way.  We are all aware of all the problems but saying that something is bad and actually doing something about it are two very different things.<\/p> <p>We need to start using rainwater harvesting.  This topic has not come up today.  I have friends who were plumbers in Australia where it is illegal not to have rainwater harvesting equipment on one's roof.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RoisinGarvey&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I know from talking to my plumber at home, Mr. Joe Hegarty, that if I had a rainwater harvester, I could buy 1 cu. m, or 1,000 l, of water for &euro;80 in my local co-operative in Ennistymon, fit the harvester onto the roof of the house and use an infrared light to make the water palatable and usable.  That is something we must consider at local level.  At a wider level, I believe there is no rainwater harvesting infrastructure in Ireland worth mentioning except for a few domestic systems.<\/p><p>We have a great deal to do, but we cannot do it overnight.  In the meantime, I ask that we improve our communications with individuals when they lose their water or have water issues.  Sometimes they get very frustrated not just about the lack of water but also about the lack of communication from Irish Water or the local authorities.  When one has a problem, half of it is the problem itself and the other half is not being able to communicate about it or knowing what is going to happen, how it is going to be resolved or what the cause of the problem is.  I asked my colleagues to dress in blue today because I feel very blue about this issue.  It is a serious issue and, as the Minister of State said, we should talk about it more often.  Perhaps other parties could raise it in another motion.  There is much work to be done on legislation for it as well.<\/p><p>I did not even mention flooding and the many other issues we have.  However, I will conclude on that note.  I appreciate the support we received from Senators, both those in opposition and those on the Government side.  It is important that we work together and push the Minister and the Minister of State on this matter.  We owe that to the people who put us in this House.
