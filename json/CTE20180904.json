As members will know, 2018 has presented the agricultural community with some of the most challenging weather conditions in recent memory.  Significant storms and an exceptionally wet spring period was followed almost immediately by two months of exceptionally dry hot weather.  This placed an unprecedented level of pressure on fodder supplies on livestock farms but also significant challenges for the wider tillage and horticultural sectors.  Over the last number of weeks, thankfully, there has been some welcome return of rainfall and more normal growing conditions in some regions and this is now providing conditions that will be beneficial in terms of late season production.  While welcoming the improvement in growth conditions, I would like to give the committee a full account of the actions and measures that have been put in place to support the sector in meeting this challenge.<\/p> <p>  Following the fodder difficulties of last winter and the spring I put in place a stakeholder group, chaired by Teagasc, which included representatives from the co-ops, banks and farm bodies, among others, to co-ordinate advisory messages to farmers this summer.  At that time, its clear focus was around replenishing depleted stocks of fodder.<\/p><p>During the summer period, I requested that the group co-ordinate advice on managing grazing and fodder conservation throughout the extended period of extraordinarily dry weather and I personally engaged with the meetings of this group.  In addition to co-ordinating advice, the group has also delivered a range of initiatives, including zero-interest credit facilities by some co-operatives to members to support the necessary purchase of feedstuffs and fertiliser, along with price rebates by some co-operatives on the main feed and fertiliser inputs for when the growth returns.  Furthermore, tailored practical advice is being shared across the group on dealing both with the current weather and on filling the significant fodder gap.<br\/><br\/>On 26 June, I asked Teagasc to launch a national fodder survey through its client network, as well as clients of the other fodder group stakeholders.  Initial results indicated a national fodder deficit of 18% but Teagasc estimates that the national fodder deficit was closer to 28% as a result of additional supplementary feeding taking place at the time.  Based on this survey evidence, the overall priority was to conserve as much fodder nationally for the coming winter when the opportunity arose and to take advantage of growth as it resumed.  This would be supplemented by imports as required.  A further survey is being undertaken to provide an updated position and this will be repeated again later this autumn giving us a clear view of progress.<br\/><br\/>A dedicated helpline was established to provide advice to farmers affected, thereby providing valuable guidance and an opportunity to share the challenge.  This support was supplemented by a series of local meetings or clinics by both Teagasc and the major co-operatives where farmers obtained direct support from advisers on the spot.  This helpline service and local clinics were open to all farmers, including non-Teagasc clients.<br\/><br\/>I met the main banks on issues relating to the agrifood sector and to highlight the need for access to finance for farmers.  They gave a commitment to service the financing needs of the sector and specialised response products have been introduced.  <br\/><br\/>In July I highlighted the difficulties facing Irish farmers with my EU ministerial colleagues at a meeting of agriculture Ministers in Brussels and on 24 July, I met Commissioner Hogan and briefed him on the impact on Irish agriculture of the dry spell.  I secured early agreement from the Commissioner to pay higher advance payments this autumn following this meeting.  Advances for Pillar 1 and 2 payments will be increased to 70% and 85%, respectively, resulting in &euro;260 million in additional cashflow for farmers at a vital time of the year.  I also proposed certain flexibilities for participants under the GLAS scheme, which would replenish their fodder stocks for the winter period.  I am delighted to have secured the agreement of the European Commission for these measures, which are now in place since last Saturday, 1 September, and which together bring a potential additional 270,000 ha into fodder production.  Specifically, the two measures are first, an amendment to the specifications for 2018 to provide for the use of low input permanent pasture parcels for silage or hay production in the period 1 September 2018 to 1 December 2018.  There are 37,800 GLAS participants with the low input permanent pasture action covering an area of over 269,000 ha.  The second relates to the environmental management of fallow land.  For 2018, off-takes will be permitted on a once-off basis in the period from 1 September 2018, after the nesting season, to 1 December 2018.<br\/><br\/>For those farmers growing catch crops to fulfil obligations under the ecological focus area, EFA, element of the greening scheme, flexibilities have been secured with regard to the species sown and the time period for which the crop must remain in the ground.<br\/><br\/>On 3 August, I announced a &euro;2.75 million fodder production incentive for tillage farmers.  This is a new measure aimed at encouraging tillage growers to actively engage in the fodder market by increasing the production of fodder this autumn on lands that could otherwise lay fallow over the winter months.  This measure will provide an incentive of &euro;155 per ha for tillage growers who grow a temporary crop of short rotation grasses for fodder production over the winter months and &euro;100 per ha for those growing catch crops such as fodder rape, turnips and brassica crops.  Currently, more than 23,000 ha of catch crops are supported under the agri-environment scheme, GLAS.  This additional funding commitment aims to incentivise a doubling of this area.  I am confident this measure will support tillage farmers to supply into the market for fodder.  Tillage farmers are a critical part of our agricultural sector who supply the brewing and distilling industry, as well as grain to the feed industry and straw to the livestock sector while also delivering other benefits.  This measure is therefore focused at supporting tillage farmers, who also have encountered a difficult spring and summer while also aiming to maximise additional short-term fodder production.<br\/><br\/>Following agreement with my Government colleague, the Minister for Planning, Housing and Local Government, an extension to the closed period for spreading of chemical and organic fertilisers has been granted.  This is in place to allow farmers to capitalise on autumn grass growth for fodder production.  This extra two weeks will allow application of manures up to 30 September and 31 October, respectively, and again maximise the opportunity for grass and fodder production.<br\/><br\/>Additionally, given the identified shortfall in national fodder availability, I announced details of a &euro;4.25 million fodder import support measure for autumn 2018.  The measure will reduce the cost to farmers of imported forage including hay, silage, haylage, alfalfa and others from outside the island of Ireland.  The measure will operate through the co-operatives or registered importers and will cover forage imported from 12 August 2018 to 31 December 2018 and will be subject to EU state aid,<i>de minimis<\/i>, rules.  I wish to confirm that while the measure will operate through the co-operatives or registered importers, the beneficiaries will be farmers who need supplies of fodder.<br\/><br\/>I announced in budget 2018 that my Department is considering the development of potential further Brexit response loan schemes for farmers, fishermen and food businesses, following on from the success of previous schemes.  My Department has worked with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Investment, the Department of Finance, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, and the European Investment Bank and European Investment Fund, to develop a longer-term capital financing loan product to be available to farmers, fishermen and SMEs, including food businesses.  I hope to announce progress on the agrifood elements of this loan product soon.<br\/><br\/>On the working capital needs of farmers, I continue to liaise closely with the main banks and other stakeholders.  I believe the loan schemes delivered by my Department to date have stimulated the development of welcome new initiatives on both short and longer-term credit by financial institutions and some dairy co-operatives.  I have encouraged these initiatives and will continue to keep working capital requirements under review.<br\/><br\/>It has been a very challenging year, including mentally, for farmers who are coping with the conditions.  I am confident that taken together, the range of measures I have introduced to date, which are primarily targeted at producing as much fodder as possible from our own land, provide the most effective response to a fodder shortfall.  It is also important to recognise that the support that was made available through the helpline and workshops that have been organised by both Teagasc and the co-operatives was invaluable in allowing farmers discuss the challenges on their own farms.  A problem shared is a problem halved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#A00300","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1536067800,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his opening statement.

He concluded by saying that a problem solved was a problem halved.  He has undertaken some initiatives but the financial undertaking needed to tackle this problem is far greater than what the Government has done thus far.  I welcome some of the initiatives that have been undertaken but the situation on Irish farms is dire.  We are completely dependent on a good autumn of grass growth and a good spring.  There was frost this morning in my county, and we are still in a drought situation.  The first signs of autumn are coming and we are relying on grass growth at the back end to get us out of the situation we are in.  It is not going to happen.<\/p> <p>  The situation on farms is extremely serious.  Farmers are under great pressure.  There is a huge cashflow problem and a huge level of merchant debt.  We probably had the worst spring in a long time and debt levels were already high by 1 May.  Unfortunately, farmers have been feeding at winter levels all through the summer and consequently, merchant debt has risen to enormous levels.  Large tax bills are due to be paid in October, which will also put severe pressure on cashflow, contractors are waiting to be paid and all that is without the living expenses of keeping a household going.  There is no cashflow and farmers are under extreme pressure.  <\/p> <p>  The Minister referred to debt levels at co-operatives and to co-operatives giving money out, which comes at a great cost.  Can we expect co-operatives and merchants to keep carrying the level of debt that the industry is currently experiencing?<\/p><p>It is disappointing, to say the least, that the measures promised in the budget in respect of low-interest loans still have not been put on the table.  We need them as quickly as possible.  They were discussed in the context of Brexit.  They were envisaged to try to offset some of the huge challenges that Brexit will present.  We are in a situation where there will be huge demand for credit.  As a Minister, Deputy Creed cannot renege on his responsibility and he cannot leave it to the banks, co-operatives and merchants to organise this because it will not happen.  When the low-interest loans were announced in 2016, I remember saying in the D&aacute;il that the amount of money put aside would not be nearly enough to cater for the demand that was there.  I was ridiculed at the time and informed that there were adequate funds.  Unfortunately, I was proved right within a couple of days because the money was taken up rapidly.<br\/><br\/>If we have another scheme of low-interest loans put in place, which there has to be, the demand will be absolutely massive.  Bank of Ireland announced a scheme today in which it is talking about making &euro;100 million available to farmers at something of the order of 3.8%.  We need low-cost finance and we cannot just abdicate our responsibility to the banks to administer this.  When what was promised in 2016 was done, many of the farmers who needed the money the most, who were under the most pressure, were not able to get access to it.  That cannot be allowed to happen.  I take it for granted that we will make a significant amount of low-cost money available to farmers.  If we do not, our whole industry will crumble.  Contractors, private merchants and co-operatives will not be able to carry the burden.  We have to ensure that the money gets to those who need it the most.<br\/><br\/>The importation of fodder is not a matter of dropping one bale here and one there as happened in previous springs.  Farmyards will need to have loads of fodder delivered by articulated lorries.  We are talking about significant shortages.  Teagasc figures from June are now irrelevant because we had seven to eight weeks of winter feeding on an awful lot of farms during June, July and August where huge quantities of what should be fed next winter have been used.  I was reading an article in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal<\/i>on building up grass supply for the autumn.  To say that the position in this regard is frustrating for those of us who are still in drought situations would really be understating it.  There is no facility to build up a grass bank because growth cannot match the demand and nor will it do so.  Temperatures are starting to drop and there is no hope of that happening.  We have seen the problems with live exports to Turkey in the past couple of days.  There have been predictions in the agricultural media about the beef stock coming from the dairy herd and what price they will make at the end of this year.  The predictions that the agricultural media are making in that regard are frightening in the extreme.<br\/><br\/>We have to get live export markets going again.  We have to put competition in place for those cattle, whether weanlings or year-and-a-half animals, and put some competition back into that trade.  Every boatload that we could move out of the country would have a twin impact in that it would obviously reduce the demand for fodder here but also put competition into the trade at ringside.  Unfortunately, that is completely lacking at the moment.  People who traditionally bought stores will be selling what fodder supplies they have to those who are out of fodder and will take the profit they can make from selling the fodder rather than buying store cattle.  That is a huge problem which is coming down the tracks extremely quickly.  Resources have to be put into Bord Bia to see where we can get live exports going and it has to be done as a matter of urgency.<br\/><br\/>Meat factories are letting down the sector.  Unfortunately, they have an impeccable record in this regard.  As soon as drought hit in late June and early July, they immediately dropped prices.  This week, they dropped prices in the factories again and the predictions are that they will be cut further next week.  Factories need to be monitored in order to identify what exactly is the return in the marketplace.  I am convinced that there is no reason why factory prices should be reduced in the way that is happening at present.  Some farmers put cattle into sheds in the summer to try to reduce the demand for grass on their farms.  Some of their cattle are now getting ready for slaughter and factories are making unjustified cuts.  The Minister set up a beef forum a couple of years ago.  If ever there was a need for a beef forum, it is now.  We need to examine exactly what the market is returning for beef and let the factories show that the price reductions being made are warranted.  It has really shaken confidence in the trade to have these price drops happen at this time.  That demands serious scrutiny and the factories cannot be allowed to exploit the situation.  The feed lots and the price for which they will be able to fill those lots at the end of this year will put those factories in a hugely advantageous position next spring in the context of manipulating the price to farmers.<br\/><br\/>I also want to mention the pig sector.  It can be forgotten, but it is under huge pressure.  Feed prices are rising and unfortunately the price for pigs has dropped fairly significantly.  It is a sector which is under extreme financial pressure.  I know it is restricted to a small number of producers, but it is under huge pressure and needs aid and help to survive.  When Brexit hit, the mushroom sector was badly affected.  The pig sector is under massive pressure and needs an aid package to get over this.  The availability of raw materials for concentrates for the back end of this year and next spring will become a huge issue.  This drought is not just an Irish problem, it is a worldwide issue.  We have seen the price of concentrates lifting significantly.  That will cause huge pressure.  When one hears our millers talking about whether they will have the raw materials available next February and March, it really sends a chill up one's spine.  That needs to be examined and all possible routes for getting raw materials for concentrates need to be explored.  We need to build up a stock to ensure we have enough in this country.<br\/><br\/>The Minister has extended the spreading of fertiliser for two weeks and that is welcome.  The cartel that operates in respect of fertiliser prices has been shown again clearly, with fertiliser prices rising significantly.  As soon as demand for fertiliser goes up, the price automatically goes up.  Those involved are exploiting the situation.  Farmers are under dire pressure for cash and are being forced to pay more for fertiliser.  This matter needs to be examined.  For what price should fertiliser be sold?  Why, when demand is at its highest, does the price for fertiliser always rise?<br\/><br\/>We see that other countries, including Germany and the United States, have stepped in and given a significant amount of money to their farmers to get them through the crisis.  This Government has to step up.  The three main challenges on which we have to focus are: to get finance at a low cost to farmers; to get fodder into the country; and to get live exports out of the country.Farmers are often accused of crying wolf and exaggerating the effects of a crisis.  This crisis is immense.  It is putting families under huge mental pressure.  The mental strain that farmers are under is severe.  Our industry needs help more than ever before.  We face major challenges.  We talked in this room about the challenges relating to Brexit.  We depend on weather to get us through this.  We need a good back-end to the year and we need an early spring.  Most of all, farmers need immediate financial help.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#B00300","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1536067800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>It is apparent that extreme climatic events will be part and parcel of our lives going forward.<\/p><p>They will be the order of the day.  It is going to have to be all hands on deck to deal with what is to be an ongoing crisis over the next period of time, which I stated at this committee last January and before that in November.  It is very important that everybody plays a role, including the farmers, as to management of stock and various matters.  I know the Minister is very committed to Food Wise 2025 and so on.  I would like to see these things achieve their objectives, but they should be subject to review in the context of the targets that have been set.<br\/><br\/>I welcome some of the things that the Minister has been doing.  He has not been idle.  I do not subscribe to that idea.  The extension of the greening measures from last week to help alleviate the fodder crisis and the Minister's work with the EU Commission in that regard, in allowing farmers to consider some winter crops as cash crops, is extremely important.  Allowing some of those cash crops to be pure crops rather than mixtures are all very practical issues to shorten the eight week period.  Much of this can be achieved.  The EU, however, is a bit slow.  I was disappointed as everything is going to be retro-active if one is to take steps.  Deputy Cahill is correct.  This is not just an Irish problem.  This is now Europe-wide.  What worries me about that is that some of those places and sources from where we were able to potentially import fodder will no longer be available.  That is a cause of concern and is something that has to be taken account of.<br\/><br\/>The fodder transport measures were previously very important for farmers in the west and north west in helping to deal with glaring fodder deficits there, with money being provided for transport costs.  The Minister is clearly looking at this in terms of the &euro;4.25 million.  The first measure is a typical Department one.  There were more red lines and bells and whistles to it that rendered it almost self-defeating.  I believe the Minister is removing a lot of these in this respect as he extends this nationally, and gets rid of any restrictions that might be there, which I believe is important.<br\/><br\/>I live in a predominantly beef area and the factories are behaving as expected.  They hammer people into submission and they increase their prices at a whim.  They have their own feed lots to bring their cattle on stream so as to ensure that farmers get less and have to take less and become price-takers.  Some farmers in the beef industry will see that it is more profitable to sell their fodder and to get rid of their cattle.  Funnily, many dairy farmers are eager to purchase the fodder, so they have a ready-made market which would be a more profitable.  That is a worry because our beef industry is absolutely critical in terms of rural employment and the generation of rural income.  We need to watch out in relation to this issue.<br\/><br\/>If one wants to have a bullseye impact, the Minister will have to do away with his reticence to consider meal vouchers.  They will be critical in the future.  I am aware of the reasons the Minister is concerned.  It is important to have it targeted but it is one of the few ways to proceed.  There may not be a huge element of fodder available to import because of the widespread nature of this crisis.  The meal voucher will, therefore, have to be looked at in this regard.  I am aware of some of the work that is ongoing and that some of the co-ops are working with their members and charging zero interest rates and so  on, but I only hope that more of them do that.<br\/><br\/>One of the concerns I have is in regard to the banks.  I do not believe a word they ever say and I notice they have many schemes in operation.  I noticed that the last time they came in here, they said that there was not a big uptake in overdraft interest.  How could anyone take up overdraft interest?  I had occasion to ring up about overdraft interest in recent weeks and I nearly fell off the chair.  They are charging 8.5% interest and if one is a business, I was told it would be 13%.  They make Al Capone look like a decent boy who would not rob anybody.  They will come in here and will be almost in tears.  I have had enough of them.  The Government is letting everybody down.  We proposed the Sparkasse model to take on those boyos.  A shower of bureaucrats drew up a report, the points of which will be repudiated over the next number of weeks.  This report was written by people who were intent on ensuring that the pillar banks would be protected.  The SBCI was involved in administering the low-cost scheme.  I read two weeks ago that there are no banks interested in getting the money from it when they can get it cheaper in the markets.  This is another waste of time.  It is time to hijack them and send them off into oblivion.  Bring in something like the Sparkasse model where money can be provided in sectoral and regional areas for farmers, for other self-employed people, for innovation and for business.  That is what has to be done.  This is going to be an ongoing problem.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Cahill is correct.  Low-cost schemes for farmers are absolutely critical.  The last one was at 2.95% interest rate and was a very good scheme.  I am aware that the Minister has many issues to deal with.  I am aware that many people come in here and pretend that one does not have to deal with <i>de minimis<\/i>rules and such matters.  The Minister has to deal with many issues and I understand that and I will not try to get a headline and say he can do this or that.  The low-cost scheme, however, is absolutely critical.  I do not want the Minister, however, to be depending on the banks because they are legalised robbers.  They are getting money for nothing in that they are paying out nothing on deposits.  One nearly has to pay them to store that money.  They then seek to charge 8% or 9%, which is ridiculous.  It is no wonder that there is nobody taking that money.<br\/><br\/>Very often farmers and self-employed people have tor resort to overdraft facilities.  Why would one resort to that when it is that type of money is charged?  I do not want any crocodile tears from the banks when they appear here in a few minutes.  They will be telling us all sorts and sizes.  I do not want to be listening to that type of nonsense.  I have had my fill of them.  If I had my way, they would have competition with the Sparkasse model and that would put a bit of steam under them.  There are too many vested interests within Government, however, to make sure that does not happen.<br\/><br\/>I want to conclude by saying that it boils down to the provision of money at affordable rates.  When money goes over a 3% interest rate, one is in trouble on a farm.  The returns are not there.  Those cattle farmers I spoke to need about &euro;4.40 or &euro;4.50 per kilogram to try to make the cattle pay, and they do have not a chance of making that with the way the beef factories operate.  One needs some way of getting imported fodder and I am concerned about that as this a Europe-wide issue.  In fairness to the Minister, he is trying to tackle that.  He did not sit on his hands.  He was working during the summer, as I know from contact I made with him in relation to this issue, and I acknowledge that.<br\/><br\/>The Minister has to look at the meal voucher situation and see if that can be introduced.  It should be part of the Teagasc review and studies.  It should be looked at to see how it can be achieved.  Overall, the approach should be all hands on deck.  We have a management situation as well and we have to be careful.  We all know what it is going to take.  We all know we are into seven tonnes per animal in the winter period and that is at least a six month period, if not more.  We have to manage this at farm level and take cognisance of the overall global and climatic environment that we are all now faced with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#C00200","speaker":"1370","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1536067800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  Before we go back to the Minister and to the other members, I have a couple of questions I would like to put to him.  I was neither horrified nor surprised when I read in the <i>Farming Independent<\/i>this morning that County Carlow is the driest county in the country at the moment.  Myself and Deputy Cahill are arguably in the eye of the storm.  The south east is the area where there has been the greatest difficulties in the past number of both weeks and months.  The concern I have for the future is that the south east has been the most productive area in the country in terms of producing fodder for the rest of the country.<\/p><p>Traditionally, it supplied the west of Ireland in particular with hay, silage and whatever else.  That will not now be available as there is not enough in the south east to look after the animals in the south east, let alone the rest of the country.  There may have been a reference earlier by Deputies Cahill or Penrose to the idea of a small supply of fodder coming in from other countries.  My understanding is that it is scarce enough abroad currently.  How will we look after what is in the south east, let alone the other parts of the country?  With the greatest respect to Deputy Penrose, whom I admire in many ways, meal vouchers to look after the highly productive area in the south east will probably not achieve much.  Other options might need to be considered in that regard.<\/p><p> What is the Minister's opinion on the potential difficulties there may be with high culling rates over the next number of weeks that might have a knock-on effect on the price of cattle in factories?  The Minister indicated there is another review ongoing or a census of fodder.  Will there be any positive progress in this respect over the next number of weeks?  The second cut silage was due to be cut in the first week in August but we will be doing well to see it cut in the middle of September, which is now a fortnight away.  Growth has slowed, although there has been some rain recently.  We are heading for a challenging time in the next number of weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#D00200","speaker":"1268","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1536067800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies Cahill and Penrose, as well as the Chairman, for their questions.  I should emphasise that I acknowledge that it has been extremely challenging inside the farm gate physically, financially and from a general well-being perspective for a profession that is practised substantially in isolation.  We should never underestimate that particular aspect of this challenge.  The overwhelming emphasis in everything that I and the Department have been trying to do over the past several weeks has been about closing the deficit ourselves and using all the instruments and leverage available to us.<\/p> <p>  There already has been some commentary on imports but we should bear a couple of factors in mind.  We have put forward a substantial package to support imports between now and the end of the year.  We anticipate it will be approximately 85,000 tonnes, which is a multiple of what was imported earlier in the spring.  The cost is &euro;4.25 million and it is likely to be only a fraction of the deficit.  It is the most expensive aspect of the initiatives announced but it was deliberately the last of those announced to date because we did not want to raise the matter of imports to the level that it would be seen as the solution to the fodder crisis.  Even if we commandeered all the trucks and boats, we could not import enough if we were at it flat out from now until May Day next year.  That is even if the volume of fodder needed was available, and there are issues around its availability.  This is not just an Irish problem.  There were forest fires in Greece and Portugal, as well as in the Arctic.  It is an issue.  Culled cows in Sweden have an impact on the price of beef here and it is normally a strong market for us in the summer.  This is a pan-European matter.  Interestingly, in that context, we have recently concluded an overall analysis for the Commission requested of every member state on the impact of this issue.  It is a problem for the whole of western Europe.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Penrose correctly indicated that we are living with the realities of climate change, namely more frequent and intense extreme weather events.  In the past two years we had issues with the harvest of 2016, flooding in Donegal in August last year, the events of this past winter and the drought.  We had Storm Emma and Storm Ophelia.  It is the effect of climate change.  I thank each and every participant in the stakeholder group, as it really worked in identifying issues and proposing solutions.  I include colleagues in the Department and those in Teagasc, as well as the farm organisations, banks, dairy processors, co-ops and advisory services, including Teagasc.  Each of those were constructive and proactive.  There are a number of deliverables from the stakeholder group but the most significant action of the group was to give advice to farmers.  The advice continues to be to avail of every opportunity between now and the end of the growing season to conserve the maximum amount of fodder that we can before we take stock.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman made a point about the south east and all the indications are that the soil moisture deficit is highest in the south and south east in particular.  That clearly has an impact on the capacity to conserve fodder for the winter ahead.  This is why concessions relating to the GLAS regulations are very important.  Previously, migration of fodder might have been from the south and south east to the north and north west, to some extent.  Generalisation is dangerous but many of the participants who will now benefit from the relaxation of regulations under GLAS, particularly with respect to low-input permanent pasture, are in the areas of the country not as challenged by the drought as the south and south east have been.  There was a maxim during the economic war or the Second World War that there would be \"one more cow, one more sow, one more acre under the plough\".  Farmers in certain areas may have sufficient fodder for themselves but they should use every opportunity between now and the end of the growing season to conserve as much fodder as possible because there will be a domestic market for it.  Certainly the 270,000 ha liberated from the normal regulations under low-input permanent pasture between now and December offer significant potential in conserving fodder.  We should look at that.<\/p> <p>  The import of fodder will play a part and as I mentioned, we have &euro;4.25 million set aside for that, anticipating it will bring 85,000 tonnes of fodder.  To put that in context, in the spring we imported 16,000 tonnes or 18,000 tonnes.  We are anticipating a substantial ratcheting up of the volume imported, although it is nowhere near meeting the shortfall.  The resolution to the shortfall is still, substantially, in our own hands and in what we can conserve between now and the end of the year.<\/p> <p>  Live exports have always been a priority and I can provide some figures to Deputy Cahill, as they are still important.  A total of 188,093 live cattle, comprising 102,672 calves and 85,000 adult cattle, were exported during 2017.  That represented a 30% increase on 2016 numbers.  To date in 2018, live exports are up by 30% on 2017 numbers, with an increase of 46,366 head.  In the year to date, 151,687 calves were exported, a 50% increase on the same period last year, with 42,424 adult cattle being exported.  The record is there.  I acknowledge its importance, and that is why significant effort has gone into those live exports.  There was an initiative regarding the veterinary export fee and the export of calves has significantly increased.  Those markets are very important.  North African countries and Turkey are really important for weanling exports.  We continue to engage, whether it is with the Turkish, Libyan or Egyptian authorities.  We are engaged across all potential markets.  There are visits that have concluded or are imminent, and contact is ongoing because of the importance of the sector.  It is a significant part of the competition within the beef sector.  I share the Deputy's commitment to ensuring that live exports remain really important.<\/p><p>On finance, I listened with interest to Deputy Penrose and I know that this committee intends to engage with the banks and others soon.  Access to finance is important and we have had a number of achievements in this area, including the initial &euro;150 million loan fund for working capital which benefitted 4,249 farmers.  It is not the panacea for the fodder sector.  Deputy Cahill made the observations that the fund was insufficient and that those who really needed it most did not get funding.  He must bear in mind, however, that whether one is referring to a State-sponsored or banking sector initiative, repayment capacity will always be part of the eligibility criteria.  In terms of the pillar banks which were partners with SBCI and the State in the last scheme, repayment capacity was an issue for anyone who applied and the loans provided were low-interest.  Deputy Cahill referenced the fact that new loan products have been launched in the market as recently as today.  I did a quick calculation on a three-year repayment of a &euro;30,000 loan for working capital under the latest initiative by one of the pillar banks in comparison to the State's &euro;150 million loan initiative and the difference in repayments is &euro;12 per month.  Our objective with the initial &euro;150 million scheme was to address the problem that existed while also acting as a stimulus to encourage greater competition in the industry and, to be fair, there is evidence that the industry is responding.  The credit union movement is also responding.  Deputy Penrose made reference to other models of financing that were under consideration but the credit unions have responded too.  There are now several products available to the agricultural sector from credit unions which is welcome because all additional competition is important.  This is not just about the banks but also about what the co-ops themselves have done.  All of them have responded, either by providing low-interest or zero-interest credit facilities.  <\/p><p> The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is not a comfortable fit with providing banking products.  We responded because there was a deficit and initiated the &euro;150 million loan scheme.  A &euro;300 million fund was developed in conjunction with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and 40% was ring-fenced for the agrifood sector.  We are developing a product for capital investment for the industry as well.  It is clear now that the industry is responding in a competitive way and I look forward to the committee's engagement with the pillar banks and SBCI later today.  Context is everything and in the context of the capacity to be competitive, we were impacted by the crash through which we went through.  That said, there is evidence that relative to what we did with State assistance and the &euro;150 million loan fund administered through SBCI and delivered by the pillar banks, that those banks are somewhere near that themselves in terms of their latest product offerings.  That is a sign that there is a degree of competition in the market, which is really important.<\/p><p> I touched on the fact that fodder problems are Europe-wide and Deputies Penrose and Cahill asked whether concentrates would be available.  It is the case that there is a shortage in Europe because of climate issues but recent reports indicate that the global supply is sufficient.  Grain production is growing in Russia, the USA and in South America but Europe is in deficit.  My conversations with the co-operatives rather than with private millers indicate that they have been active in the market in terms of forward buying and so forth.  I am not hearing anything alarming at this stage in terms of the capacity to source fodder but we will keep the matter under observation.  <\/p><p> Interestingly, in the context of the Chairman's point about culling and Deputy Penrose's references to Food Wise 2025 targets, Glanbia conducted a survey of its own supplier base recently which indicated, notwithstanding the challenges, that there is no significant rush by farmers involved in the survey to use culling as an instrument to manage their way through the situation.  Dairy production is back up and, in fact, is ahead of where it was this time last year.  While farmers are impacted financially, they obviously see some advantage in continuing to milk cows for the longest possible period to drive income.  They do not see culling above and beyond the normal routine culling of cows as necessary.  I would make the point, however, that in terms of overall efficiency, we need to keep improving genetic merit, whether in beef or dairy.  <\/p><p> The Chairman comes from a strong tillage area.  The target under the tillage initiative is 25,000 ha.  There is a strong take-up from the seed houses and, in fact, they estimate that they have sold seed equivalent to a lot more than 25,000 ha in recent weeks.  Some of the resolution in the Chairman's own area of the south and south east may come from that partnership between tillage growers and livestock farmers. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#E00200","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1536067800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

At the outset, I wish to express my disappointment with the fact that this meeting was not convened earlier.  We requested a meeting with the Minister and his officials in mid-August but the earliest available date was not until today.  Overall, the situation facing farmers is causing real fear.  The farming community is under immense pressure because of the unprecedented weather conditions with which it has had to deal in recent weeks and months.  We have had two fodder crises in the last five years but we have never been in a situation where we were discussing a looming winter fodder crisis in September.  Last spring it was not until very late in the day, in April, that there was a recognition by the Minister and the Department that there was a real fodder crisis.  Until that point in time, the default position was that there was enough fodder in the country but we saw what happened in that instance.  Following on from that, with fodder reserves completely depleted, we now have a situation where we have a very real problem facing us in the year ahead.<\/p> <p>  I ask the Minister to clarify his view and that of his Department on the current fodder situation in terms of the actual deficit.  The Minister indicated in his opening address that initial Teagasc estimates indicated an 18% deficit rising to 28%.  The Minister has indicated that an assessment is ongoing at the moment in terms of the rest of this year and what can possibly be made up and saved over the coming weeks will feed into that.  Certainly we all hope that it will work out as well as it can but given that the Teagasc assessment and report to the Minister indicated a deficit of 28%, that is a massive shortfall to make up.  The Minister indicated in his response to Deputy Cahill on fodder imports that the objective is to provide 85,000 tonnes through the fodder import scheme.  He also indicated that he expected that to represent only a tiny fraction of the overall need.  I would like to hear more from the Minister about how he envisages the rest of the deficit being made up and where he sees that coming from.  A few short weeks ago, the deficit was reckoned to be at 28%.<\/p><p>We do not know at this stage how early the winter will be or how late the spring will be.  The more time goes on, the further our options for addressing it will shorten.  That is a real problem.<\/p><p> On this occasion, there is more pressure across northern Europe and our neighbouring countries in respect of feed and fodder supply.  Whatever comes in at the start of the winter and over the harvest period will be important because as the winter goes on, if it is harsh, it is going to be very difficult to source supplies.  Unlike in previous years, when we go looking for it it may simply not be there.  The Minister might update us on how the fodder import measure is going at the moment.  How much is actually coming in?  It is now that it needs to be coming in, not later on.  <\/p><p> Deputy Cahill outlined the key aspects that are needed.  Without a doubt, first and foremost is credit flexibility for farmers to be able to get through the crisis winter that is facing them.  Also key is getting fodder in and getting cattle out.  I know live exports always have to be a priority.  What engagement has the Minister had with Bord Bia in terms of increasing the number of cattle that can go out in the next weeks?  <\/p><p> We will hear from the banks later on about where they are at from a commercial point of view in terms of their own products.  The budget last year allocated a &euro;25 million Brexit loan fund.  We are now just a few weeks away from the next budget and there is still no sign of that being delivered.  This reflects exceptionally poorly on the Minister and the Government in terms of a total lack delivery.<\/p><p> The Minister indicated that he is pleased to see that rates are somehow coming down.  He stated that was an objective of his introducing the previous loan fund, which was snapped up very promptly.  An objective of the Department over the next period has to be to deliver real support to farmers to help them through the winter ahead.  It is not sufficient for the Minister to say that he has seen a drop in interest rates from banks over the last months.  It has to be an objective of his Department to ensure that a suite of supports is there to help farmers get through what is going to be a very difficult winter.  To that end, the Minister needs to be delivering another loan fund tailored specifically for the farming community.  The Minister indicated that repayment capacity will always be key in terms of how the banks work with their customers.  What happens this year for some of those farmers who will be struggling with repayment capacity and will not be able to show they can meet repayments?  Undoubtedly, if things do not improve, there will be some farmers in this situation.  What suite of measures will the Minister provide to ensure they can be better supported and given the increased flexibility they may require to get through the year ahead?<\/p><p> I believe we are going to need a hardship fund to support farmers who will find themselves in very particular difficulty.  In Germany over the last weeks, the Minister for agriculture has introduced a drought compensation fund to help farmers who have suffered from the impact of drought and have seen, on average, a 25% drop in crop yields.  I remind the Minister of his own Teagasc figures indicating that forage and fodder yields for this year are down 28% at this point.<\/p><p> On the catch crop support, in respect of which some feedback indicates take-up has not been what was expected although the Minister seemed to indicate otherwise in his comments, can he give us further clarity?  It can be looked at again and that needs to happen very quickly to see if further supports can be provided.  On the low-input permanent pastures flexibilities for GLAS schemes, which 40% of farmers are in, the Minister has indicated that the flexibility there is that fodder can be gathered between September and December.  What is happening in respect of fertiliser inputs for those crops and that land mass, which amounts to almost 300,000 ha?  I understand the Minister did engage with the European Commission with regard to facilitating additional fertiliser flexibility to be applied on that land.  As things stand, the maximum is 32 units per acre or 40 kg per hectare.  Without application of fertiliser, there is not going to be much to gather off that over the next period to try to help the situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#F00300","speaker":"1244","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1536067800,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his officials.  A lot has been covered.  We are all on the ground and know the situation we are in and how it has evolved.  People tuning in to today's meeting are not doing so to hear what I have to say on the thing.  They are all very well aware of it.  They will have been cocking their ears for what the Minister might have had to say.  Unfortunately, there is nothing new in what I have heard.  While I welcome a lot of what was done, I do not think it is anywhere near enough.  The Minister's statement did not highlight the depth of the crisis that exists out there.  He needs to be talking to individuals on a one-to-one basis about their own circumstances.  We are only at the tip of the iceberg.<\/p> <p>  When we had Teagasc before the committee at the end of last winter's fodder crisis, it was recommending to farmers to build up a two-month feed buffer for the coming year.  Then we walked into a drought which I know Teagasc did not orchestrate and could not have predicted.  Now the figures indicate that we are 28% down on the normal year, irrespective of getting our two-month buffer for the winter that could lie ahead and to replace stocks that were used up last year to get over the winter crisis then.<\/p> <p>  All we are hearing about is importation.  Sky News would not be very agriculture-friendly but last night, for the first time in a long time, it featured the drought crisis in agriculture in the UK.  There is no point in going to the UK.  Wherever else we are targeting to import this fodder, the UK farmers are going to be there also along with farmers and agricultural co-ops from the different countries that have been mentioned in which there is also a fodder crisis because of drought.  There is going to be a queue in Russia if the food is available there.  We need specifics as to what quantities are available for import and what quantities we have pinpointed and targeted and on which we have first call, and at what price.  If there is more than one person interested in buying any commodity, the price is going to increase.  There is going to be a queue of countries going to wherever this limited forage is.  Importation is nice on the ears and can be relieving to hear about but it is not the solution.  It ticks the box and lets people think it will be a solution down the line but, realistically, it is not the solution.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the schemes the Minister has introduced already.  In respect of low-input permanent pasture, what the Minister is going to take off that will satisfy hunger.  However, the biggest issue we have, as I know from being on the ground, is the quality of what is gathered up.  There are fellows making second-cut silage at the moment that should have been made a month ago.  As Deputy Cahill has already said, we were down to 3&deg; Celsius last night.  The quality is going to be gone out of that grass very soon.  It will get cattle over the line and keep them alive but without supplement, without a meal voucher or some system of supplementing that forage, cattle are only going to be kept alive.  It is obvious on the ground.  I am from a suckler farmer area.<\/p><p>In some areas, farmers are ashamed of the calves they will bring in to wean off cows shortly.  A cow that is living on clay and hay in the month of July will not produce a good weanling.  In many cases, that is obvious.  Farmers have run out of money to buy supplement.  Farmers who would creep feed in normal years are not doing so this year because they have had their money tied up from the back end of last year to purchase additional fertiliser.  With the best will in the world, a person running any business at a loss will not be able to pay back a loan no matter the interest rate on it.  Suckler farmers, in particular, are facing an enormous loss this year.  In many cases, the cows went out in poor quality because they were getting feed that was only keeping them alive at the back end of last year, they were only maybe coming around a small bit with a flush of grass when the grass disappeared again and now they are coming in with poor quality calves.  There are the domestic economic issues in Turkey which will have a serious effect on the live exports and now the traditional fatteners, who might have bought weanlings off suckler farmers, are looking at their figures, and the price of fodder and forage, and they have some such available, and are beginning to decide that they might have a better year if they buy no cattle and sell the feed to the dairymen.<\/p><p> The Minister quoted the figures.  It is said, \"There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics\".  Dairy production is up, but at what cost?  Deputy Cahill is a dairy farmer and he will tell the Minister his milk is up over the past couple of weeks, but what meal is he feeding?  What is it costing him?  If one burns the candle at both ends, it burns out eventually as it meets in the middle.  This perfect storm is only escalating.  We are at the tip of the iceberg.<\/p><p> I was hoping the Minister would come in with something new today, but he did not.  Anything that is there we have heard already and if the Minister is talking to men on the ground, they will tell him anything that is there will not do it.  Men and women, and families, out there are in desperation.  At this stage, for many of them it is about keeping their animals alive until next spring and paying debts, and hoping that they have a better year next year.  The 70% payment coming in October will be gone before it comes.  It is still owed since last spring, never mind the summer.  The contractor is owed.  The co-operative is owed.  Using the suckler herd as the example, the income from the sales at the end of the year will be down also which adds to the perfect storm.<\/p><p> We need a lot more action.  Much of what is going on is unprecedented but this is just the start.  We cannot merely talk about promising imports as the solution when the dogs in the street know what we are talking about importing is not out there, and if it were, there would be a queue to buy it.  Can we afford it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#G00200","speaker":"1383","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1536067800,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I met a group of farmers last week.  It would be fair to say they represent a broad geographical spread but, mainly, from the south and the south east.  Coming away from the meeting, one could not be but impressed by the stress that these farmers are under, not only about feeding animals but also the financial pressures.  As one man put it, it is not only a question of no fodder - they have not funds to pay for fodder - as in some cases, because of their financial situation, they have no funds to pay for loans.<\/p> <p>  The credit side is critical.  At this point, it is a key issue to be addressed.  The Minister mentioned making a low-cost loan available to farmers shortly but the reality, as the figures in co-operatives and merchants would bear out, is that they are carrying more debt than ever, not only on account of now but in the past year.  There is a cash flow problem across the board in this sector and a cash injection is required.  I am very concerned.<\/p> <p>  The Minister mentioned the previous loan scheme that offered low-cost loans to farmers but capacity to pay is an issue.  I take the point that not all farmers' circumstances are the same but some farmers are under severe mental pressure.  From some of the stories we are hearing, it is quite desperate.  We must adopt a holistic approach to cater for farmers in all circumstances so that in some critical cases, they do not feel like they have no place to go.  They must have some place to go.  They have no control over the weather.  Many of them have ramped up dairy production.  They have invested big time.  They are repaying considerable loans and now they have this problem before them.  The impression I got is that the finance side of it has to be sorted out and there has to be room for them to manoeuvre to restructure existing loans.  That is critical.<\/p> <p>  Not everybody is being accommodated by merchants or the co-operatives.  Not everyone is in a position to be accommodated.  We all talk about the high interest rate overdraft cost of working capital.  Notwithstanding the efforts that are being made, unless we put something clearly on the table that farmers can subscribe to that is away from the vagaries of the lending market and the banks, we are not tackling the fundamental component of the problem we have here which goes beyond fodder.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the work the Minister has been undertaking in Teagasc, the fodder production incentive and the fodder import support measure.  Colleagues here have underlined the fact that there is a problem throughout Europe and there has been a drought throughout Europe, and it is not as straightforward as being readily able to access fodder elsewhere.  We are in the eye of the storm and we have not taken all the steps we need to navigate our way out of it as safely as we can.  There is a storm.<\/p> <p>  We also are faced with people shortly being asked to pay their preliminary tax bill.  I refer to dairy farmers who will be asked to pay tax on the basis of whatever their incomes were last yea and to farmers who generally pay tax.  In my part of the world, many farmers do not end up paying tax such is the low income that they receive.  They were, however, in a position to cut second silage and are hoping to save it but the reality is, if one has suckler cows and beef, the farmers on whom they rely to finish off these animals do not have money to buy them.  A few farmers I spoke to at Balla mart on Saturday last commented on the absence of the buyers who are normally there and that they are not happy with the prices they are getting for their animals currently.  This has a knock-on effect.  Farmers in the west rely on farmers elsewhere who are most badly impacted by the lack of fodder.  There has to be some dialogue with the Revenue or there has to be some flexibility in dealing with these farmers.  The Revenue, above all bills, is most feared for good reason.  This is another financial difficulty or hardship coming down the line for these farmers.<\/p> <p>  On the crisis fund set up by the German Government, the Minister mentioned that Teagasc is seeing a national fodder shortage at this stage of 28%.  In July, Dairygold in Munster conducted its own survey and came up with 25%.  There is no reason to believe it is not worse.  It would be in keeping with the figures of Teagasc.  Bearing in mind that some farmers do not have the ability to repay, I wonder at what point the Minister will make decisions about making a similar fund available for farmers who are in dire straits because of the situation they find themselves in.  It is serious for some farmers.<\/p> <p>  That brings me to another issue.  Many of these farmers were concerned, not just for themselves but for their neighbours, about the emotional and mental pressure on farmers.  They were concerned as to whether farmers are being reached out to in an appropriate and proper way, not only through words and counselling and support which we all know is important, but through solutions.  There must be a port of call for solutions.  They should know that there is always a solution, and that the Minister, working with all the agencies available to him, can bring about these solutions.<\/p><p>Farmers must be reached out to further as some people think they are in a very dark place at the moment.  They are in a hole.  I urge the Minister to take action as soon as possible, especially on the credit side.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#H00200","speaker":"1425","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1536067800,"counter":24,"content":"<p>The work of the stakeholder group, the Department, Teagasc and, indeed, myself has been ongoing across the summer and through the month of August.  The question Deputy McConalogue poses is how to close the gap.  There is no single instrument that will close the gap.  I could not agree more with Senator Paul Daly that imports alone will not solve the problem.  The fear was that in flying that flag, we would import and people would see it as the solution.  It is not.  It is only a small part of it and an expensive one at that.  The real solution, in so far as there is a solution to be had, is to use every available opportunity between now and the end of the growing season, whether by availing of our tillage initiative or our low-income permanent pasture concessions in the context of GLAS participation.  In that context, our negotiations with Brussels on GLAS concessions and LIPP were about securing payments which for those farmers are worth &euro;85 million per annum.  We want to ensure that we secure the payment, deliver the environmental benefits under the scheme and have it liberated for the period post 1 September for a harvest.  We have managed to secure the payment, which is really important, and, where it was previously not eligible, farmers now have those lands available for harvest.  That is 270,000 ha.  I acknowledge that a lot of it is not suitable and will not deliver baled silage, but some of it will and that is part of the solution.<\/p> <p>  Tillage is also part of the solution, as is culling.  There is a host of instruments which need to be used to get us out the far side of this.  There is no single one.  In many instances, it will depend on the circumstances in the individual farmer's yard.  I emphasise that a significant part of the solution relates to those who may determine that they have enough themselves for the winter, but who may not be inclined to avail of the flexibility.  They should really look at the opportunity presented to them now because the migration will not be from the south east.  In fact, if there is surplus fodder anywhere in the country, it will be moving in that direction I suspect.  That is why those concessions are really important.  In terms of delivering and if cash flow is the problem, &euro;1.3 billion will be paid to farmers between now and the end of the year across pillar 1 and pillar 2 payments.  That is on the basis of the concessions secured in Brussels to pay them earlier and to pay them at the maximum rate.  That is an important cash flow.  While members may counter that it is their money and it was coming anyway, it is coming earlier and it is coming at the maximum permissible rate.  As such, it is additional cash flowing to the system, which addresses part of the problem.<\/p> <p>  Senator Paul Daly referred to clinics and one-on-one advice.  That is one of the things the stakeholder group delivered.  If one was buying any of the farming publications over the last several weeks, one saw significant advertising on the appropriate measures to take.  That has been supplemented by co-operatives on the ground organising meetings for their client bases and through the organisation of advice by Teagasc for its clients as well as those who are not its clients on a free basis.  There are tailored messages for individual farmers, including one-on-one advice.<\/p> <p>  The Senator's said there was no point going to the UK.  That safety valve is not as reliable as it was because the UK faces similar challenges.  The point was made about where we were at regarding imports.  The funding will cover approximately 80,000 tonnes.  As I understand it, approximately 17 importers, co-operatives and others, are approved under the scheme and approximately 40,000 tonnes has already been identified by some of the key players.  Some is already in the country and options have been taken elsewhere.  Whereas the announcement on these negotiations was made some weeks ago, we were in constant contact with all of these parties, in particular the bigger importers and processors with established track records.  They were aware of our thinking and deliberations on all of these matters and they have been out in the marketplace to source fodder and to take options.  I cannot emphasise too greatly Senator Daly's point that this is really only a small part of it.  The best chance we have of getting out of this is to avail of the window of opportunity provided between now and whenever the growing season ends.  Whether it is sooner or later, we must maximise every opportunity through the tillage scheme, farmers getting a second and, where possible, third cut, and GLAS concessions.  GLAS may not be an opportunity for oneself, but it may be for one's neighbour or someone else.<\/p> <p> I refer to the credit issue.  As I said, we will be making an announcement in the context of the engagement we have had with all of the partners on the next loan, which is a capital investments piece.  It is not a working capital piece.  I dealt with the issue around working capital earlier and the response of the industry in that regard.  However, it is also the fact that all co-operatives have responded in some shape or form, which has been really important.<\/p> <p>  I have dealt with the issue of live exports.  We continue to engage, not only with Bord Bia, but directly on these matters through officials in my Department with competent authorities in other jurisdictions.  It is not so much a function of Bord Bia, albeit it has a role to play.  A great deal of the engagement is at a technical level between officials and that continues whether it is Turkey, Libya or anywhere else.  Those meetings have been continuing.  The proof of our commitment to live exports is in the figures.<\/p> <p>  Senator Mulherin spoke about credit.  I have engaged with the banks around the need for them to respond.  They can outline that response in detail themselves.  That engagement has also been about understanding the financial pressure farmers are under and engaging with farmers, not late in the day but in anticipation of issues around repayment capacity and parked interest to take account of that.  I was encouraged by what I heard, but I also made the point to the banks that one client with his or her hand up to say he or she was not treated well would cause a problem for all of us.  I have been reassured by the banks that they appreciate the concern and have responded by way of product.  They are also prepared to respond by way of engagement directly with individual clients who may have difficulties.  It is extremely stressful and difficult and I appreciate the looming deadlines in terms of tax returns and tax liabilities which are also important.  Farmers should be aware that there is someone they can talk to about those issues.<\/p> <p>  On the income tax code, we have also introduced an opt-out in the five-year income averaging scenario, which some farmers find beneficial, albeit it is not for everyone.  It is a consequence of an understanding of the way farming works.  It is volatile and in some years one can experience a significant drop in income.  The opt-out from income averaging is important in that context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#J00200","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1536067800,"counter":25,"content":"<p>Before I move on to the next speaker, I note the potential cost of whatever product is being imported.

I will not go over what has been said because it has been dealt with comprehensively by people who probably know a great deal more about farming than I do, which is positive.<\/p> <p>  I have a few questions.  One relates to an ongoing issue that arises ultimately from climate change.  There have been extreme weather events over the past year and the Minister has said a number of times that this will be the norm from now on, or that he expects that something similar will be the norm.  In terms of taking a long-term view on this crisis, what is the Department's view on stocking levels nationally?  Will they have to be controlled or even reduced?  I am reminded of previous years when I was a member of this committee and the discussion was about increasing the milk quotas.  There was enthusiasm at that time about the volume of beef that would be available and that dairy farmers could grow without limit.  Before it had even happened, however, there was a reduction in prices and so forth.  At what stage do we have to start considering controlling the herd or moving back, and what impact will that have?  What long-term view has the Department taken on considering that, if weather events are going to be the norm rather than the exception?<\/p> <p>  With regard to the banks and the cost of finance, how much of the finance that is being made available is to pay the banks for providing the finance?  How much can that cost of finance to farmers be controlled and what would be the impact of that? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#K00100","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speech","time":1536067800,"counter":28,"content":"<p>The Chairman will appreciate that I am trying to run between two committee meetings.  I welcome the Minister and his officials.  The issue with fodder is that almost every year there is a fodder shortage in the north west.  That area is traditionally where it has always happened, mainly due to rain and bad weather.  This year we have a unique situation where it is occurring mainly in the south east due to an absence of rain.  The situation is reversed.  As Deputy Penrose said earlier, it points to the change in the climate, the impact that is having and the unpredictability of that.  We have to deal with the crisis.  I appreciate that the Minister has brought some measures forward but he will have to go much further to deal with this comprehensively.<\/p> <p>  A point was made earlier about cereal crops and the need to get more feed produced.  One of the problems is that farmers in the areas that traditionally produced feed and cereal are now going into dairy farming and they are taking feed rather than producing it.  That problem will have to be recognised and forward planning will have to be undertaken if that is to continue.  The price of feed will be an issue, not only here but also internationally.  When we import feed, we have that problem as well.  The Department has opposed meal vouchers but I spoke to the Minister about this even last year.  If the Department met with the merchants and came up with a solution to deliver feed directly to farmers at a keen price, it would work.  Teagasc can identify the people who need it.  The best way forward is to do something that will put feed directly into the hands of the farmers who need it at this time.<\/p> <p>  Forage is an issue because we need more of it.  The idea of growing a winter crop on the land that traditionally would be left bare over the winter is a welcome part of the solution.  In my part of the country, people are busy with good grass growth and cutting good second cut and third cut silage.  In the north west, the land holds the water well, unfortunately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#K00200","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1536067800,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I was there recently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#K00300","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1536067800,"counter":30,"content":"<p>It holds the water well and that means we continue to have growth.  Even though we did not have a great deal of rain, we had a lot more than other areas.  As the Chairman pointed out, what is traditionally the most productive part of the country is the part that is suffering currently.  The solution to this will have to be getting feed and fodder in from abroad to some extent, as well as long-term planning.  We need to plan for this if we expect that these changes are going to happen.  We have seen over the past five or six years that the change in climate has generally been about more rainfall over a longer period of time, with a wetter harvest or wetter spring and farmers unable to get as much pasture or fodder as a result.  This is a unique situation and we hope it does not return every year even though people like hot summers.<\/p> <p>  A drainage scheme would resolve this in the areas that usually have that problem.  If a scheme was put in place, particularly on marginal land in the north west, we would extend the pasture period, get more land into meadow and get more forage from it.  That would help in the future.  It might appear to be the reverse of where the problem is now but that part of the country is usually the area where we encounter this problem.<\/p> <p>  It is essential that farmers can secure finance at a keen and proper rate.  My big gripe with the banks is that they are borrowing money from the European Central Bank at the same rate as every other bank across Europe yet they are charging three and four times the level of interest.  That applies to everyone, including farmers and everybody who has a mortgage.  It is daylight robbery and something must be done about it.  It is not this committee's job to do something about it but there must be a recognition nationally that we have a problem with our banking sector.  It is screwing the public and must be held to account for it.  Unfortunately, the Government has not held the banks to account.  That must happen, and quickly, because it is a problem not only for agriculture but for every other sector, including the possibility of developing an innovative sector that will hopefully bring rural Ireland back to life.<\/p> <p>  Is the Minister prepared to buy the fodder farmers need?  Is he prepared to ensure that a scheme is put in place, be it through vouchers or otherwise, to get feed to farmers who need it quickly so they know they can keep their stocking rates up?  Many farmers are in a position where they will sell their cattle quickly and not keep them because they do not have the fodder for them.  The problem in my part of the country is that the farmers are now producing weanlings and nobody is buying them.  The weanlings were traditionally fattened in the midlands and the south east and those farmers will have little or no fodder for the winter.  There will be a crisis there as well as the prices are going to fall hugely.  We are faced with a crisis and there must be a long-term solution to it.  There also must be a means of dealing with the immediate problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#K00400","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1536067800,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for arranging this meeting.  I welcome the Minister.  He has not been sitting on his hands but more has to be done.  Incentives are being provided but they are not good enough.  The Minister said he will bring forward the EU payments again.  The payments have been brought forward in the past couple of years.  If right was right in accounting, farmers should expect a second payment this calendar year given that we have brought the payments forward so much in the past few years.  We are allowing farmers to dig a deeper hole for themselves.  All financing will go back again into the banks for finance and refinance.  Ultimately, those loans must be paid back.  We are only prolonging the agony for many farmers who have faced various crises in the past couple of years, such as price volatility, wet weather and now drought.<\/p> <p>  Not enough has been done to highlight the problem that exists.  The country should be more aware of it.<\/p><p>They could see how important agriculture is to this country.  The reason I bring this up is that Senator Paul Daly mentioned earlier that from watching Sky News and Euronews, which I also watch, he saw that as early as last July, the British were talking about a climate summit for British farmers in London and there has been no word about what is happening in Ireland.  Two weeks ago the Germans were quick out of the blocks with a major package for their farmers.  I know it is a bigger country but agriculture as a percentage of GNP and GDP does not have the same importance there but at the same time, they were prepared to throw out this enormous package to all sectors of the agricultural community.  I add one proviso through the Chair to the Minister and it goes back to his predecessor.  Tillage farmers were being compensated for the loss of crops in Germany.  I remember when I came here first as a Teachta D&aacute;la in 2016, I met tillage farmers from the south west who had lost their crops through soil drift and they got no recognition whatsoever.  The Government failed to acknowledge the need to give them compensation - they did not get one penny for the loss of crops in that time - whereas we can see the position in other EU countries.  While the Minister is always saying we must abide by the EU rules, which is fine, it looks as though other countries have a way of bending those rules and looking after their own.  We should be seen to do more on that.<\/p><p> There is emphasis given to the issue of the farm loans.  We are going down the road where the Minister will have to find somebody from the Department to facilitate some write-offs in needy cases to ensure the viability of the farm family in rural Ireland.  Deputy Penrose raised the possibility of meal vouchers earlier and he is half right.  I am open to correction but I remember one of the last loan schemes the Department issued to farmers in need.  I think I am correct in saying that the needy farmers were not able to access those loans at the time.  The Minister might have come back to the D&aacute;il to state all the money was drawn down but did the right farmers get it?  Did those who needed it get the money?  It is all fine to say the book was closed and all of the money went out but do those schemes work properly to the benefit of the small farmer and the farmer who is badly hit by the issues currently at stake?<\/p><p> I have been concerned for the past couple of months.  While I do not suggest the Minister is sitting on his hands, the major industrial sources were playing down this crisis.  I refer to one of the major farm journals from four or five weeks ago.  I bought it one week and I thought I had the wrong year's edition.  There were only one or two items in it referring to the drought crisis we were suffering in the south and south east of the country.  It hardly carried an article on it and only made one or two references.  I am open to correction on that but I scoured through the paper to see if I was reading the right one because there was a crisis out there.  I took part in farm discussion groups in my own area and I acknowledged that some farmers were getting away fine but it could be seen in the mentality of other farmers that they were under severe pressure trying to cope with the situation.  The issue had been played down too much.  The Department should be doing more on the ground.  The Minister should look at the issue of write-offs where there are cases that need it.<\/p><p> Does the Department see a slow uptake in applications this year for the targeted agricultural modernisation schemes, TAMS, for payments or works?  Has the Department noticed a change in the economic drive for farmyard investments?  That will give a good insight into the economic impact it is having on rural Ireland because that affects farmers and builders and legal services as well.  I do not wish to knock the Minister but I feel this crisis has been played down too much.<\/p><p> We might be here talking about a short-term solution but the Minister himself touched on the point that bringing in fodder will not be the solution and will not cover our food shortage.  Does he have other solutions in mind, such as culling livestock?  There is no point in saying we have a shortfall without having answers going forward.  There is no point in finding out on Christmas Day that we might have to go to the factory with extra cattle because there is no fodder.  I want to know what the overall plan is for the future.  Grass only grows so much every year and only so much can be saved.  The Minister should consider write-offs in individual cases and more importantly, a credit scheme should be provided through the co-operatives and the merchants because they are the people who know the farmers better than any bank manager working a computer above in Ballsbridge.  They know where the feed is needed and where the credit is under pressure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#K00500","speaker":"1278","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1536067800,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

Sometimes I pick up the media commentary on this and I have a different reaction in this regard to that of Deputy O'Keeffe.  That is not motivated by having a thin skin towards commentary on the efforts we have been making but rather the fact that all of this is played out in a transparent context with our competitors in the international marketplace.  We make a lot of play out of our sustainable credentials, and rightly so, and this is a challenge for us that others in the marketplace could exploit.  That is why we need to be measured in our commentary on it.  That is not to mask the challenge in any way, it is not to pretend that it is not anything other than what it is but we need to be conscious that we export the overwhelming majority of what we produce in all commodity areas and we have quite good credentials in terms of our sustainability.  I take the point that Deputy Penrose is making in terms of our targets and sustainability.  By any international comparison, in dairy we are very good.  While we have room to improve in beef we are quite good by international comparison also.  If, however, we put this up in lights, there are competitors in the marketplace who will use that to their advantage.  However, by and large the commentary has been measured and focused on the issue and resolutions to it.  It has not been ignored, certainly not in the farming media that I have seen.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Keeffe asked an interesting question about TAMS.  As we were paying out about &euro;1 million to &euro;1.5 million a week on TAMS grants the last time I checked, it is still a substantial interest in investment on farms.  We have a current tranche of TAMS open.  I have not seen the figures but it is due to close in another couple of days or a week but there is no indication that there is a slowdown of interest from farmers in investing.  That is tied into this reason for a capital investment product.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked me whether I have a plan for culling.  I do not.  Some of the advice would suggest that in certain circumstances, culling is an instrument that could be used but that is an issue for every individual farmer to make a decision on him or herself, whether it is in the dairy or beef side.  We need to have the most efficient herd that we possibly can and we need to play to our strengths in terms of sustainability and things like grassland management.  We have had initiatives in the past like the Grass10 initiative.  Grass measurement is hugely beneficial as an instrument but unfortunately very few farmers use it.  Milk recording is an instrument in our dairy industry which is efficient but it could be more efficient and the low level of milk recording is a disappointment in the dairy industry because the knowledge on solids and proteins is at the farmer's fingertips along with all the other details that are needed to make informed decisions.  We can do an awful lot more to improve our sustainability credentials.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy made the point that the wrong fellows might have received the credit the last time around.  I have heard that point made before but repayment capacity for any loan will be an important criterion and banks operate on a commercial basis.  They are ultimately for profit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#L00300","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1536067800,"counter":35,"content":"<p>Very big profits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#M00100","speaker":"1278"},{"type":"speech","time":1536067800,"counter":36,"content":"<p>We had a situation where the banks did not make profit and it was a more problematic issue for us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#M00200","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1536067800,"counter":37,"content":"<p>They stole &euro;64 billion from us.

It is a pity the Minister did not make himself available sooner but we are where we are.  I understand he is a busy man but I hope he understands the worry that farmers in Cork South-West and across the whole country are experiencing.  I know in his heart he does.  I thank the Chair and the committee members for allowing me to speak today.  I am not on this committee but I travelled all the way from west Cork to speak here and also to speak at the committee discussing post offices.  Both are crisis points for the people of west Cork.<\/p> <p>  At the start of the Minister's opening statement, he spoke about the extreme weather.  We had extreme rain and drought, and there is no denying that.  I know he is a good Minister but, good and all as he is, he cannot control the weather.  What he can control is his reaction and action to the weather.  He can also control the reaction and action of his Department.  I would like him to take that on board.  Any time I hear him speaking about the fodder shortage, he mentions the weather quite a lot.  We all know what has caused this but we need action from the Minister and his Department.  <\/p> <p>  I welcome some of the measures he has introduced, such as extending the date for the spreading of slurry.  With respect, this did not cost anything.  I ask him today to open the purse strings wider and bring in measures that will help the farmers in west Cork with whom I deal every day.  They are worried.<\/p> <p>  On the low-interest loans, which were already committed to, what is happening with them?  This time, unlike the last time this scheme was run, when they do come in will the people who deserve the money most get the money?  It did not happen the last time this scheme was introduced.  It is essential that those who need it most receive the money.  When this was last run, constituents of mine paid up to &euro;700 to accountants to get help to fill out the forms, but most of them were shot down.  On top of not getting a low-interest loan, they had a bill of &euro;700 to pay their accountants.  Some of their neighbours, whom we all know did not deserve it as much as the people who were turned down, did get the loan.  I would like the Minister's comment on that.  <\/p> <p>  Immediate action needs to be taken, but we also need to plan for the future.  We had extremes of weather for the past couple of years, and it seems it will happen again.  In west Cork this morning there was a slight frost, and this is only 4 September.  I presume we are in for a cold, and possibly wet, autumn and winter.  Immediate action needs to be taken now but also for the future over the next few years.  We need to plan.  I recommend the Minister take a leaf from the book of the German Government and the German Minister for agriculture, and take a more proactive approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#M01000","speaker":"1262"},{"type":"speech","time":1536067800,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I hope the Deputy will not start giving the weather forecast on a regular basis because that does not sound promising.

I would like to clarify a few things.  He said there were approximately 17 approved operators for bringing in feed from outside the country, including co-ops.  We are hearing stories, and the Minister might be able to enlighten me.  As he is aware, in most parts of the country people who had lorries were bringing the feed from A to B, and that was their business.  Obviously, the feed is not there.  We are hearing from what I would call the small operators, who are not co-ops but are privately employed people who have spent their whole lives at this work, that they are not able to get through this ream of paperwork.  I noted the Minister said they have a track record.  They are not able to get through this paperwork to bring in fodder or get approved.  Will he clarify that situation?  Can it be made less cumbersome?<\/p> <p>  The Minister may remember that three, four or five months ago I mentioned the low input permanent pasture.  As he knows, last winter farmers had to get rid of stock and some of them were left with a lot of grass.  This is where we need to be proactive rather than reactive.  There was an opportunity early in the year where there was a plethora of grass, where people had sold stock and did not have fodder.  With the low input permanent pasture the grass was growing well but they were not allowed to cut it.  Now they are.  One wonders why we could not have got that for them then.<\/p> <p>  There is another thing we need to keep an eye on and I ask the Minister to talk to the banks about this.  The banks are the first ones to get the single farm payment.  The Minister said farmers will get money, which is great.  They will get 85% a bit earlier.  To call a spade a spade, however, in December they will get the same money they were owed although it might be a little quicker.  The banks will get it first.  The contractors and the co-ops will be hanging because the banks will swoop first, as we are well aware.  I ask the Minister to talk to the banks to ensure they are not pulling everything out and leaving nothing for the other side.  In fairness to co-ops, they had help last winter but they cannot keep going.<\/p> <p>  There is no simple solution to this, and no one will solve it overnight.  The factories know that at the moment there are many culled cows coming out.  They are doing the usual things that factories do at this time of year.  They have pulled the price of cattle.  In many factories, they are refusing to kill any carcass which is over 440 kg.  It is skullduggery.  The price of lamb has been dropped.  For one good deal, perhaps to get more stuff growing somewhere else, the store lamb is in trouble at the moment.  The guy who may be sowing this crop now used to always buy them for the stubbles but they are not buying them now, so the store lamb is in trouble at the moment.  The factories for both lamb and cattle are using their usual tactics.  They know farmers are under pressure.  We are hearing stories.  It is not my county, in particular, but people in the dairy sector are culling many dairy cows, and what they are doing to them is criminal, in my books, with the prices being offered.  A move must be made there, led by the Department and the farmer organisations.  The factories have much to be accountable for in what they are doing at the moment, and especially with the price of cattle.<\/p><p>I know the weanlings are coming out at the moment.  A really fancy weanling out of a two-star or three-star cow is making good money, but the plainish ones are unsellable in many places.<\/p><p> Many people are concerned about the depreciation of currency in Turkey and the difficulty in trading there; that needs to be addressed.<\/p><p> We talked about credit.  The Minister said that banks are commercial entities and we know what they have done over the years.  The small family farm with a small payment got damn all money in the different loan systems.  It is also important to keep them going.  I offer a solution.  GLAS does not have the number of participants anticipated.  There is a budget there.  Can the Minister kick that into gear?  We now know that suckler cows have just gone downhill based on the number of calves registered.  Will the Minister bring in the &euro;200 payment for suckler cows?  If he does not, areas in the country will be decimated.<\/p><p> I was out this morning on a tractor and baler on hire, baling for farmers.  We are getting five to six bales second crop.  In parts of the country, on more marginal land, between the first bit and the piece they have taken up again, farmers are coming near to having enough fodder.  In other parts of the country it is nearly the opposite of last year - for example, in the south and south east farmers are in big trouble.  There is some dryish rocky land in our neck of the woods that has not returned.<\/p><p> Some type of Government support needs to be introduced.  We now know the consequences of less grain having been sown.  We have the decimation of the suckler herd which has been denied for a long time, but is happening.  I will outline a factual case.  The Minister and his officials have power in this regard.  I know of farmers who had slurry in the shed last spring.  They had to spread slurry with the tanker - they might have ploughed two or three loads.  They had mostly bad land with a bit of a hill and the tanker left a mark.  Anyone would know the weather we had last winter and the pressure experienced by farmers.  An inspector came out and gave a &euro;2,000 penalty.  Can this be reviewed?  We talk about the money coming - 85% by Christmas.  However, these penalties, some of them nonsensical, represent money not coming to a farmer.  With the best will in the world, going through the appeal process will take a few extra months.  Can the Minister do something about that?<\/p><p> I ask the Minister to get stuck into the factories straightaway.  I know that they will give every excuse in the world.  As the Minister pointed out, some farmers can cull a certain amount, including old ewes and cows, and they can fatten a certain amount of cattle.  However, with the price of cattle as it is, people who never held them are trying to hold them over because they are so bad in places, especially the plainish cattle.  The factories have to step up to the mark.  While they might be able to make hay this year on the back of the farmer because they know they are caught in a situation, down the road if the farmer does not have the cattle for them, they will also be gone.  We need to look at the bigger picture of what is going on.<\/p><p> The Minister talked about giving credit.  Many farmers' loans have been sold on to vulture funds.  For once, as a State, as a Government and as politicians, we need to do something to try to finance some of these people to allow them to hold on to their farms, rather than heading for \"landlord\" Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#M01200","speaker":"1341","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1536067800,"counter":48,"content":"<p>Before coming back to the Minister, I wish to make some brief points.  In the discussions so far today we have heard a lot about the future.  We have all seen, particularly in my part of the country, many young, enthusiastic, energetic and skilled people enter into the industry, particularly the dairy industry, in recent years since the abolition of milk quotas.  I fear that those young individuals, whom we need in the industry for the future, will get badly burned this year because of what has happened and the extra costs that will be incurred.  We need to ensure they are in a sustainable position for the future.  If we do not have them in the future, we will be in serious trouble.<\/p> <p>  As we discuss CAP in coming months, is it now time to consider an insurance-type scheme in the longer term to deal with these types of issues?  We have these discussions on a six-monthly basis.  Unfortunately there is volatility if there is too much rain, if there is no rain, if it snows, etc.  We need a discussion on an insurance-type scheme to deal with these matters once and for all.  We should have a pot of money that in the event of a fodder crisis or other crisis can be accessed to deal with these matters.<\/p> <p>  We have had much discussion about the farmers with greatest need for whatever scheme may come down the line.  I would argue that those who need it most are the most productive farmers because of difficulty in the productive area.  Will they be in difficulty because of the state aid rules?  They may have acquired the low-cost loans last year.  Will they have reached their limit because of those state aid rules?<\/p> <p>  We have many targets in respect of Food Wise 2025.  As the Minister mentioned, there has been increased production with dairy yields up again.  Should we now have a detailed review of those targets?  In a previous meeting the Minister spoke about the industry's targets.  Is it now time to look at this from the ground up?  The industry seems to have led and been driving these targets up to now.  Do we need to look at where we are going in the future the other way round - from the ground up?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#N00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1536067800,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I sincerely thank the members for their contributions and will deal with the points raised by Deputies Murphy O'Mahony, Fitzmaurice and the Chairman.

People can judge for themselves the wisdom of doing that.  I certainly was not aware of any obligation in that scheme for that level of input when making the application.  A person who is refused it always feels aggrieved and understandably that product was oversubscribed.  There are new products in the market now and I know representatives of the banks will address the committee shortly.

My understanding based on the advice available to me is that on the contrary the store lamb trade is quite strong at the moment.<\/p> <p>  He referred to the decimation of the suckler herd.  I do not know what his definition of decimation is.  I acknowledge there has been a reduction in the suckler herd.  The greatest reductions came in counties Cork, Waterford, Carlow and Kilkenny.  I think Carlow was the top county in number.  In some instances I suspect it was because of migration from dual enterprises to an entirely dairy enterprise.  In other instances people just moved from one enterprise to another.<\/p><p>The reduction of 6% or 7% in the most recent figures I saw does not constitute decimation.  I acknowledge that issues arise regarding the Common Agricultural Policy and how best to support the industry in future and I am open to engaging on those issues.  It is important, however, that we base the debate on facts.<\/p><p> The general issue of factories has arisen several times.  The Department has been warned numerous times by the Competition Authority that it has no function in that regard.  I will just make the point - the position is somewhat different on the dairy side because most of the dairy processors are owned by farmers - that there is a symbiotic relationship between the beef factories and beef farmers.  They need each other and people should be aware of that in the context of the current difficulties.  <\/p><p> On supports, the point has been made about the early payments but we have also provided an additional &euro;25 million for the disadvantaged areas scheme for payment this year.  That should be beneficial in the Deputy's constituency.  We have also skewed that payment deliberately in favour of those on more marginal land.  That should deliver.<\/p><p> The Deputy also asked why there was not earlier movement on low input permanent pasture.  The reason was that we did not want to jeopardise the payment, for which &euro;85 million is available.  We wanted first to secure the payment and then liberate the land for additional fodder production.  It would have been a shallow victory if the land had been released from the regulations but farmers had not been paid.  The payment for that option is worth approximately &euro;85 million.

I will give a general overview and then hand over to my colleague, Mr. Farrell, to talk specifically about the supports we are providing for customers in the farming sector.<\/p> <p>  Bank of Ireland is the largest lender to the Irish economy, having lent &euro;14.1 billion during 2017, and has been lending more than 50% of the new lending flow into the sector.  We also have the largest retail bank network in Ireland with more than 250 branches throughout the country, which demonstrates how strongly we are embedded in communities.  While retaining our branch network we have also made changes to how we serve our customers by enabling our staff to become more mobile in their communities and to meet our business and farmer customers at their premises and farms.  This mobility and agility is more convenient from a customer perspective and gives our staff the opportunity to better understand each customer's business and how best we can meet their banking needs.  We have a mobile lending team of more than 115 people, including dedicated agrispecialists available to support colleagues and customers with individual funding requests.  We also provide direct lending over the phone, lending to business customers, including farmers.  The direct lending service provides loans of up to &euro;120,000 to customers without the customer having to come into a branch.  Our unique combination of a great digital presence and a footprint in 250 communities across the country means we can be more responsive to, and flexible in meeting, our customers' needs.<\/p> <p>  The committee may have seen recent announcements that the bank created 100 new customer-facing roles earlier in the year as part of an overall strategy to increase the number of people in customer-facing roles.  We have also announced that 100 branches are being upgraded so that there will be an all-day counter service in those branches.  We have listened carefully to feedback from our customers to understand how we could improve the service we provide and have taken these steps as a result of that.<\/p> <p>  I will now hand over to my colleague, Mr. Farrell.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pierce Butler"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1536067800,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to address the committee today and outline how we in Bank of Ireland are supporting our agricustomers in this very challenging year.  When we were here in May we advised that agriculture was our largest stand-alone business sector and that we are committed to meeting our customer's needs across all enterprises and this remains very much the case.  We noted at that time that investment appetite among our customers had been affected by the challenging weather this spring and that we had yet to see significant increases in demand for working capital from our farming customers.<\/p> <p>  This trend has continued and while there have been some increases in overdraft utilisation levels during July and August, less than 20% of approved limits are currently in use.  We absolutely appreciate the extent to which our customers around the country, and particularly in the south and east, have been affected by the summer's drought and that fodder shortages and deficits remain a real challenge for livestock farmers and that yields have also suffered for our arable customers.  Reduced growth and yield mean extra feeding and increased costs.  We can help customers in several ways to fund this additional cost and manage their cashflow over the coming winter and spring.  We understand that much of this cost has been financed initially by means of co-operative and merchant credit and we believe that for some farmers it may not make sense, or be possible, to repay all the extra costs incurred in this year in their current working capital cycle and that they may need to spread these increased costs over several years.  To this end, I am glad to advise that Bank of Ireland has today launched a &euro;100 million agriflex fodder support fund which has been specifically developed to respond to the needs of farmers affected by the challenging weather conditions over the past year.  It provides farmers with extended repayment terms of up to three years compared with 12 months for a normal stocking facility, a discounted interest rate of 3.86% and will be available for applications up to 31 March 2019.  This new loan finance is available to farmers seeking finance for additional fodder, for feed and for fertiliser that they have already purchased but have yet to pay for, or which they plan to purchase in the coming months.  The extended repayment term of up to three years combined with a discounted interest rate will support farmers in meeting additional costs and ease difficulties around cashflow. <\/p> <p>  We are also identifying those farming customers whom we consider may be most impacted by the summer drought and in greatest need of financial support and we have introduced a dedicated outbound customer care calling programme to these customers to advise them of options available to support cashflow which include our new fodder support fund.  Separately, many of our agricustomers also have loans with other financial institutions some of whom are no longer lending in this market.  To deal with this we introduced an agriloan refinance package in June through which we are offering customers the option to move these loans to Bank of Ireland.  We can generally match their existing interest rate and cover the bank legal fee and valuation fees associated with the move.<\/p><p> By moving these loans, customers can then use security transfers to help fund further development of their farm business.  <\/p><p> Bank of Ireland participated in the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, cashflow loan support scheme in 2017 and we successfully lent &euro;65 million to our customers in partnership with the SBCI.  Farmers are not eligible to apply for the current SBCI Brexit scheme.  However, as we heard earlier, should another farmer-focused scheme come onto the agenda in 2018, we will look to support and participate as we have with previous SBCI and Government lending initiatives.  Our approach is that where we believe a customer has a viable farm business, we need to support him or her through short-term cashflow challenges such as those being experienced in the current year.  This support may take the form of some of the initiatives that I have mentioned already.  In certain cases it may entail the provision of an increased overdraft limit or indeed a stocking loan.  We can also offer customers interest-only repayment options to reduce their annual debt funding requirements.  <\/p><p> Bank of Ireland is taking a pro-active approach to supporting customers, with all of our front-line staff acutely aware of the challenges they are facing.  We are actively asking customers to let us know if they believe they are likely to need extra working capital or other support.  We will look to put the required facilities in place for them. <\/p><p> Despite the weather difficulties faced by farmers this year, we retain a generally positive outlook on this sector.  Commodity prices for most sectors have held their own or increased this year, and Irish agriculture retains competitive advantage in many ways, not least of which is a low average debt level across the overall sector. Through our nationwide teams, we are committed to supporting customers and will continue to do so in the coming weeks and months as we work with all sector stakeholders.  <\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and the committee members for the opportunity to address the committee.  We will gladly answer any questions that the committee members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#Q00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Farrell","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1536067800,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for inviting AIB to discuss with the Oireachtas the cashflow challenges that the ongoing weather-related difficulties have created for Irish farmers and their families.  My name is Tadhg Buckley.  I am head of agriculture with AIB and I am joined by Ms Margaret Brennan, head of small and medium enterprise, SME, sector strategy with AIB.<br\/><br\/>Agriculture is an integral part of AIB&rsquo;s business.  With about &euro;1.7 billion in lending, the bank holds over 40% of total outstanding lending balances to the sector in Ireland.  Supporting the sector, we have a nationwide agri-advisor team of 15 agricultural science graduates providing financial and technical expertise to our front-line staff as well as engaging directly with customers.  This team has substantial experience in dealing with farm income and cashflow difficulties, particularly during 2009 and 2013 when farmers faced similar challenges to those currently impacting the sector. <br\/><br\/>The last 18 months have been a most challenging period for Irish farmers.  Weather-related difficulties have been ever-present during this time with all extremes experienced, including severe wet periods, substantial snowfall and a sustained drought.  A combination of increased meal and fodder feeding, lower yields and higher input prices has resulted in farmers across all regions and sectors, including both livestock and tillage, being impacted.  This is a key differentiator from previous crises which were often more sector-specific or region-specific.  AIB is working proactively to support our farming customers in overcoming any financial challenges they currently face.  While the sector is currently experiencing cashflow pressure, AIB continues to maintain a positive long-term view of the sector and will assess repayment capacity based on long-term output and input prices rather than the current situation. <br\/><br\/>In recent months AIB has undertaken a number of initiatives to encourage farming customers who may need financial support to engage with us.  These initiatives include a communications programme with local press articles and online articles to urge farmers to identify their winter requirements and engage with the bank where additional cashflow support is required.  Since weather difficulties emerged in late 2017 we have regularly briefed all front-line staff on the challenges facing our farming customers and on AIB&rsquo;s range of cashflow options, which are available to help overcome these.  We intend to continue both internal and external communications in the coming months to help ensure our customers remain informed on how AIB can support them through this current difficult period. <br\/><br\/>Moreover, local drought response task forces have been formed in the regions most heavily impacted, with customer contact programmes initiated in these regions.  A fodder cashflow survey has been undertaken of farmers attending the AIB Irish Grassland Association dairy summer tour and the Tullamore Show to better inform AIB of the type of challenges facing our farming customers.  AIB&rsquo;s agri-advisory team has participated and presented at a number of fodder-related events across the country, including industry workshops and discussion group meetings.  This team is planning several further workshops in conjunction with the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, and Teagasc in the coming weeks.  In addition, a fodder shortage panel discussion was held at the Tullamore Show, with participants from across the industry offering advice on how to deal with current on-farm challenges.  We plan to roll out further initiatives shortly.The primary focus of these will be on helping our farming customers to estimate the likely financial impact the current weather-related difficulties will have on their business and outlining the various options available to our customers to overcome any financial challenges they are likely to face.<br\/><br\/>Customers can engage with our team of 280 business advisors throughout the country.  These are available through our branch network, on the phone or online at <i>www.aib.ie\/farming<\/i>.  In addition, our dedicated 15-person agri-advisory team has a nationwide presence and is supporting both our front-line staff as well as interacting with customers who are seeking cashflow support.  This team is a touch point for distress cases as they come to light.  We are also very conscious of the stress the current difficulties can place on the overall well-being of farmers and their families. We ask any farmer who is under severe cashflow pressure to contact the bank and we will prioritise that request urgently.  Extended contact hours are available for farmers via our customer phone line, 1890 47 88 33.  This is available from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. from Monday to Friday and from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays. <br\/><br\/>AIB has a range of financial options to support our farming customers.  These include 48-hour decisions on business loans, farmer credit lines, overdrafts up to &euro;60,000 for AIB customers and flexible working capital finance by way of an AIB farmer credit line, which is currently available at a variable interest rate of 3.5% to 5% to all directly and indirectly-impacted sectors, such as the pig sector.  I refer also to our PromptPay working capital facility, which allows farming customers to spread payment of Revenue liabilities, accountancy fees and pension payments over an 11-month period.  We will retrospectively finance capital expenditure or breeding herd expansion which is already funded from cashflow in 2017 over terms of up to seven years.  We offer interest-only periods in the form of capital repayment holidays where appropriate.<br\/><br\/>To date we have had a substantial level of proactive one-to-one engagement with customers on cashflow.  In many cases, farmers have indicated that they will require additional cashflow support over the coming months but are currently focusing on the day-to-day operational challenges that the drought has placed on their farm businesses.  Accordingly, we anticipate the level of cashflow support requests to substantially increase as we progress through autumn and winter.  We have no limit on the amount of working capital, in the form of the farmer credit line, PromptPay or longer-term loan finance, available to support farmers through this short-term challenge.  Our advice, as it has always been, is to engage with the bank early if additional finance is required.  We will work with the customer to find the most appropriate solution for individual circumstances. <br\/><br\/>AIB continues to engage with stakeholders across the farming sector to address the current difficulties.  We participated in the fodder action group in the north-west last winter and are currently part of the Teagasc interagency fodder group.  In addition we are partners of the Teagasc Grass10 programme, also supported by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  This programme focusses on improving efficiencies in grassland production, a key element in helping to avoid a repeat of the fodder shortage currently affecting the country and maximising the grass growth potential to year end. <br\/><br\/>In conclusion, AIB recognises the challenges currently facing the sector and the role we will play in helping our customers overcome them.  Experience has taught us that no single solution will suit all farms.  Accordingly we will work with our customers on a case-by-case basis, supporting their financial needs as appropriate to their requirements.  On behalf of AIB I want to again express my thanks to the committee for affording us the opportunity to address it.  We will be happy to address any questions members may have for us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tadhg Buckley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1536067800,"counter":72,"content":"<p>Good afternoon, I am Ulster Bank&rsquo;s head of agriculture and I am joined today by my colleague, Mr. Eddie Cullen, managing director of our commercial banking division.  I thank the Chairman and the members of the committee for the opportunity to discuss Ulster Bank&rsquo;s ongoing support for the agriculture sector, particularly following a prolonged period of adverse weather conditions and the significant pressures on farming communities.  As one of our key sectors, Ulster Bank takes a long-term view of agricultural lending and supporting farmers through volatile income cycles.  We continue to build on our extensive knowledge and expertise in this sector with a risk appetite that supports lending to farmers, and we really want to grow this business.<\/p><p> The increased volatility evident in the agricultural sector over the past few years, either due to weather, price or unexpected individual on-farm challenges, is a reality the sector must learn to manage.  In light of current difficulties, Ulster Bank launched a weather fund in July to support farmers seeking additional working capital funds to alleviate cashflow pressures on farms.  We anticipate that this designated fund will ease some of the burden placed on farmers during these really challenging times.<\/p><p> Our agri team regularly updates our front-line colleagues on issues impacting on the agricultural sector to help support them in their ongoing contact with our farming customers.  We proactively engage and interact with farmers and industry stakeholders, including a recent meeting with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed.  I will attend the inter-agency fodder committee meeting next week.<\/p><p> At Ulster Bank, we welcome the initiatives to support the sector through this period, namely, the fodder import scheme, flexibilities to the GLAS scheme, securing advance payments of EU aid under pillars 1 and 2, the fodder incentive scheme for tillage farmers and the extension of the period for spreading chemical and organic fertilisers to allow farmers avail of late seasonal grass growth.<\/p><p> I would like to highlight a number of key issues regarding the pressures farmers are currently facing.  The nature and extent of the current challenges are not uniform throughout the country but every sector of farming is affected.  The significant variation in weather across the country in the past 12 months means that a winter fodder plan will need to be developed specifically for every farm.  We work with farmers throughout the country every day and we have heard first-hand accounts of the cumulative effects of a long winter, a very short spring and an unprecedented dry spell.  All livestock sub-sectors are experiencing fodder shortages, while yields in the tillage sector are well below average.  The completion of a fodder budget by farmers is an essential exercise to help minimise and manage any potential deficit.  There is no single solution to filing the gap and it needs to be addressed from both the supply and demand side.<\/p><p> The shortfalls to which I refer are placing a financial and mental strain on many farmers and farm families.  Working with and talking to farm consultants, advisers and other farmers, either through discussion groups or as an individual, will assist.  We believe that due to the physical and mental strain on farmers over the past 12 months, they may not have yet reacted to the possible financial impact of the current situation.  Farmers are working hard to feed their stock and secure feed for the months ahead.<\/p><p> Ulster Bank has experienced a modest increase in demand for working capital facilities to date.  We believe that the factors that have contributed to this are: the fact that the sector entered 2018 with relatively strong cash balances; the support offered by some co-ops in respect of credit facilities for their members; current farm commodity prices; and the extent of the physical workload on farms.  However, we recognise that farmers need to plan for the possibility of larger than normal tax bills in November and some may also need to reassess their infrastructure requirements on expanding farms.<\/p><p> Farmers use a variety of mechanisms to manage working capital, including bank funding and merchant credit.  Depending on the nature of the enterprise and the working capital cycle, Ulster Bank has a number of options available, including business overdrafts, trading stock facility and seasonal input facility.  A farmer may avail of one or all of these in combination to support his or her working capital requirements.<\/p><p> In recent weeks, we have engaged with our farming customers to ascertain if they are under cashflow pressure.  Some farmers requested small temporary increases in their overdraft limits to pay for feed and fertiliser.  We have also received requests from farmers to extend their stocking loans, while others indicated that they might need additional finance as the year progresses.  No farmer advised to date that he or she could not get access to feed.  Farmers will have significantly increased feed costs due to the fodder issues compared to what they budgeted for and they all advised that they had learned valuable lessons this year.<\/p><p> Ulster Bank offers support and solutions to all its customers during periods of pressure once the underlying core business is sustainable into the future.  One thing I would like to emphasise is that farmers should talk to their banks if they are in any way concerned about their financial circumstances.<\/p><p> We are taking a proactive approach to supporting farmers, with our local managers attending industry farm walks and meetings that were organised to discuss fodder issues.  This allowed them to interact with farmers and gain a full understanding of the extent of the fodder issues in their areas and subsequently provide support for farmers.  In the past few weeks, Ulster Bank has partnered with Teagasc to support a dairy farm open day in Cork and supported local agricultural shows in Carlow, Kilkenny, Mullingar, Cavan and Donegal.<\/p><p> I reiterate that Ulster Bank is committed to the agrifood and farming sectors.  Our aim is to partner with farming businesses to enable them to grow and to continue to support the agricultural sector through the difficulties that arise.  We have developed flexible solutions to support our customers, including the weather fund, the dairy expansion loan, the dairy farmer toolkit and pasture loans, as well as participating in the SBCI agriculture cashflow support loan scheme.  Ulster Bank looks forward to further engagement and collaboration with all stakeholders in the industry to consider a range of options to address the fundamental difficulties facing the sector.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and members for affording Ulster Bank the opportunity to address the committee.  Mr. Cullen and I will be happy to address questions members may have for us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ailish Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1536067800,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to appear before the committee once again in order to discuss the work of the SBCI and its role in supporting farmers and agribusinesses throughout Ireland, many of whom are facing the challenge of dealing with fodder shortages and the consequences of the exceptional weather conditions we have witnessed this year.<\/p> <p>  I have previously briefed the committee on the two main channels the SBCI has used to support farmers and agribusinesses.  To recap briefly, the first of these, the agriculture cashflow support loan scheme delivered &euro;145 million in lowcost working capital loans with an interest rate of 2.95% to over 4,000 primary agriculture businesses throughout the country.  This scheme reached capacity within weeks of its launch, with a strong mix of farm categories benefiting.  Dairy farmers accounted for 45% of the total; beef farmers 40%; tillage 6%; and others - primarily pigs, sheep and horticulture - 9%.  There was also a broad based geographical mix with a particularly strong uptake on the southern and western seaboards and in Border counties.<\/p> <p>  Our second major channel is our network of eight on-lending institutions, which have provided close to &euro;860 million in low-cost, flexible loans, of which a quarter has been drawn down by farmers and agribusinesses.  Taking these two channels together, the SBCI has deployed or supported the deployment of &euro;1 billion, of which 36% has gone to the agricultural sector, since it first opened for business three years ago.<\/p> <p>  In addition, the SBCI recently launched the &euro;300 million Brexit loan scheme, which is there to support businesses impacted by Brexit, especially food businesses which are often customers of the farming sector.  This scheme is at an early stage but we expect that as further detail emerges on the precise nature and shape of the UK&rsquo;s future relationship with Ireland and the wider EU, many more agribusinesses will be able to make informed decisions about their strategy for managing Brexit-related challenges and how best to finance that strategy.  We expect the Brexit loan scheme will be an important tool for agribusinesses and food processors as they innovate to prepare for and respond to a post-Brexit world over the next two years.<\/p> <p>  Looking ahead to future supports that might be available for farmers, it may be helpful for the committee if I share some elements of the market research we commissioned recently to better understand the requirements of the farming and agribusiness sector.  We targeted this research towards farmers who benefited from the agriculture cashflow support loan scheme, with parallel work to get valuable feedback from farmers who did not access the scheme and identify any measures that would make it easier for these farmers to access SBCI-driven supports.  The key things we learned were that four in five farmers received the loan for the length of time and of the scale they required.  The loan scheme was mostly used for replacing high-cost merchant credit and other working capital needs.  A large majority of the loans were under &euro;30,000 indicating a wide spread across the spectrum of size of farmers.  Three in four farmers who have accessed the loan scheme rate it highly, with little disparity between farm type, size, or region.  Some 83% of scheme participants found it to be an effective support.  This satisfaction was spread across farm types and sizes, and had good regional spread.  Some 94% expressed interest in accessing a similar scheme in the future.  Our research also indicates clear demand for long-term investment funding from farmers.<\/p> <p>  I have another comment I would like to add in light of some of the questions put to the Minister earlier.  We also looked at the reason why the group that we asked who did not get the loans did not access them.  Of these, 62% said they were not aware of the loans; 34% said there was no need for the loans; 3% said they did not qualify or meet the criteria; 2% said that when they went to apply, it was no longer available; and a further 2% had other reasons.<\/p> <p>  That concludes my opening remarks.  I hope the committee found them helpful and I will be happy to take any questions members may wish to pose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Nick Ashmore"},{"type":"speech","time":1536067800,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I thank the representatives from AIB, Bank of Ireland and the SBCI for taking the time to come in, present to us today and discuss fodder supports.  The witnesses were in the Public Gallery for our earlier discussion with the Minister and they are well aware of the challenges facing the farming sector with regard to the weather and the shortage of fodder as we head into winter.  A key point we put to the Minister was on the need for affordable and flexible credit to assist farmers as they meet that challenge over the coming months.  A key aspect that came through the presentations of all three banks was the need to ensure applicants are viable, risk is low and affordability is manageable for those entering discussions with banks.  From the banks' point of view, this is understandable.  How will the banks deal with customers who look like risks when it comes to the depths of winter and towards spring?  Are there other measures which could be put in place to support them?  What is the experience of the witnesses in this regard?  Things are straightforward in cases where somebody is able to repay but how will the banks deal with customers who may be in a financially precarious situation?  What are the options facing them and how will the banks deal with them?<\/p> <p>  Bank of Ireland outlined that its fodder fund interest rate is likely to be at 3.8% or 4%.  What rates are in place in the other two banks for those coming to them?  I would like further detail on the differences between the regions of the country?  Are particular counties, which the banks' agricultural advisers have indicated, having problems?<\/p> <p>  The Minister indicated he felt the previous cashflow loan scheme administered by the banks on behalf of the SBCI had contributed to lowering interest rates and that it was one of its objectives.  What are the views of the witnesses on this?  Do they feel the scheme contributed to lower interest rates?  Did it increase competition?  If so, why did it take such a scheme to accelerate any reduction in interest rates that followed?<\/p> <p>  The Brexit loan was announced in the budget almost a year ago.  I would like to hear from the SBCI about the nature of the discussions that have taken place in this regard and in particular why we have not seen this loan put in place.  Why has this not happened?  What can the SBCI tell us about the types of lending that the loan will be able to cover?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#T00100","speaker":"1244"},{"type":"speech","time":1536067800,"counter":76,"content":"<p>Any notion that there will not be a huge demand for working capital over the next 12 months can be dismissed.  There will be significant demand.  I would argue very strongly that in the majority of cases the farmers who received low-cost loans after the 2016 budget did not get the length of time for repayment they sought.  A maximum of six years was allowed under the scheme but there was a concentrated effort to reduce the term of the loans.  Nothing will convince me otherwise because I have met numerous farmers who have been put under pressure to reduce the length of time to repay the loan they received under the scheme.<\/p> <p>  The MilkFlex loan scheme introduced several months ago can be obtained for an eight to ten year period but it includes the condition that the recipient must have been in milk production for more than one year.  In the past two to three weeks, I have met two or three new entrants who are experiencing cashflow problems.  They are debarred from the MilkFlex loan scheme because of the condition of being in milk production for more than one year.  Can this be re-examined?  I asked one of the farming organisations why this condition is in place and its view is that people should not get into trouble in the first year of a new venture.  We are in uncharted waters with regard to the cost of milk production this year.<\/p> <p>  Significant investment has been made in dairy expansion.  Have the banks revised the cost of production figures they use to calculate the repayment capacity of farmers?  We can talk about weather-related issues but it looks as though the costs of fertiliser and concentrate will increase substantially.  The cost of labour is also increasing.  Has the base used for cost of production and repayment capacity been re-examined?<\/p> <p>  Low income farmers from all sectors are coming to meet all of us in our clinics because they have been refused access to credit by various financial institutions.  Many of them are carrying significant merchant credit at high interest rates with co-operatives or private merchants.  We need a scheme whereby farmers can get access to credit.  The situation they are in at present cannot be allowed to continue.  They are coming under severe financial pressure and there is the mental stress of not being able to pay bills.  They have contractors coming in to do work and in some cases their overdrafts have been restricted.  They are finding not being able to pay their bills very difficult.  I am not stating the banks created this situation.  In the vast majority of cases merchant credit has built up over a period of years.  We are going to have to look at this.  Perhaps it comes under the remit of the Department rather than that of the banks.<\/p> <p>  Earlier today I mentioned pig farmers.  Do the banks have figures on the pressures faced by the various agricultural sectors?  The dairy and pig sectors are those coming under the microscope the most.  How does our debt level in these sectors, which are under the most financial pressure, compare per cow or per sow with our competitors?  We have always been told we are significantly behind our competitors.  Is the debt level of those who have invested heavily in either of these sectors in recent years now comparable with our competitors?  A significant number of dairy farmers have not invested but what is the debt level per cow of those who have invested compared with farmers in New Zealand, the Netherlands or Denmark?  The overall picture of the sector will not give us this information because a significant number of farmers have not invested heavily.  Has analysis on this been done?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#T00200","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speech","time":1536067800,"counter":77,"content":"<p>I will return to our witnesses.

There have also been early discussions with the banks.  We are limited in our ability to bring schemes to market by the market's inability to absorb more than one scheme at a time.  We delivered the agricultural cashflow support loan scheme, then the Brexit support loan scheme and now we are in the early stages of working up and delivering the next scheme which, as the Minister said, is focused on long-term capital investment and finance.

The preclearance facility means that in future, applicants for SBCI loans will come first to the SBCI for preclearance and eligibility confirmation which effectively gives them a certificate with which they can walk into a bank and say they have a guarantee for the loan.  It means the discussion they have with the bank about what kind of loan they can get is a different discussion.  The SBCI guarantee is as though one walks into a bank carrying assets on one's back, which can be used as security for the loan.  We are looking to see how we can deliver and improve these products.

When we look at cases, we do not look at 2018 in isolation, as there is significant volatility, but we look at how an entity has performed, firstly over the last three years, in relation to profitability.  We refer to repayment capacity.  In the dry stock sector, for instance, the repayment capacity is based on what is available for the overall entity.  In many cases, that would include off-farm income in dry stock farms which aids repayment capacity.  Where possible, the primary objective is to support the farming operation.  If it needs to acquire feed or fodder to continue to trade through winter, where at all possible, we will support that.<\/p> <p>  On numbers, the approval rate is running at more than 90%, so more than nine out of ten of our farmer credit line applications are approved.<\/p> <p>  On the interest rate for fodder related facilities, our farmer credit line is a variable rate and today the rate is 3.825%.  That is the primary product that we encourage our farmers to use as the first port of call for the purpose of feed and fodder.  We expect we may have to meet those customers again next spring.  We are looking at giving a liquidity injection into the business.  The first thing that they need is cash; they need liquidity.  To give farmers an interest-only loan today gives them no liquidity.  The primary objective is to get liquidity into the business, and in many cases we will have to sit down with that farmer again and possibly restructure some of the loans over a longer term, depending on how much of an impact this current issue will have.  <\/p> <p>  I want to allay any fears Deputy Cahill might have.  I think there will be a substantial level of casual requests which will come at us as we work through the winter.  We have communicated that internally quite strongly to our front-line staff and have already started to see these requests coming to us.<\/p> <p>  The pocket of Tipperary, Carlow, Laois and Offaly seems to be the worst affected region in our experience.  The south and south east has also been heavily affected, as has much of Cork.  I do not want to pick out counties, but as one goes towards the western seaboard, they were much more heavily affected during the spring.  Every part of the country has been impacted, but at different times of the year.  The pig sector is probably one of the worst affected sectors, even though it does not have a fodder requirement, but it has been indirectly impacted by the increase in feed prices.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Cahill referred to dairy new entrants.  We do not have any restrictions on lending to new entrants to dairy, or relating to experience in the sector.  However, I am aware that there maybe restrictions in the MilkFlex product.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#U00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tadhg Buckley"},{"type":"speech","time":1536067800,"counter":85,"content":"<p>Who is administering the MilkFlex product?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#U00900","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1536067800,"counter":86,"content":"<p>Finance Ireland.<\/p> <p>  On whether we have examined the cost of production, we take a long-term view of prices.  We take a milk price of 30 cent per litre, including VAT, at 3.6% fat and 3.6% protein.  We regard that as a relatively conservative price but we also apply stresses on that.  The stress tests we apply are to allow for increases in input prices or decreases on output prices.  We feel that at that level of analysis, we are covered, even taking the current increase in feed prices into account.  That is not to say that this year will not be heavily impacted, but it is one year within a cycle.<\/p> <p>  On the debt levels on dairy farms, one can look at averages but they often hide levels of debt on farms.  About one third of dairy farms may have only very little working capital facilities.  Our heaviest indebted dairy farms would still only be at what the average debt levels are in New Zealand and would still be below the levels in Denmark and Holland.  While there are some farmers with a lot of debt, those farmers are mainly quite well structured in terms of long-term facilities, often 15 or 20 year facilities, to allow them to reduce the repayment burden on their business to allow them to trade.  Farmers who have expanded are under a lot of pressure this year but we have seen that in many cases expansion has helped them improve their overall efficiency from where they were in 2014, for example, when they worked under quota restrictions.  <\/p> <p>  I will finish on this point.  Today there are 1.4 million dairy cows in Ireland; in 1983 there were 1.5 million dairy cows.  Sometimes that message can get lost.  There has been an increase in dairy cows but we are still only at the numbers where we were in 1988.  Those dairy cows are producing 62% more than they were in 1988, which is also a point that can be lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#U01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tadhg Buckley"},{"type":"speech","time":1536067800,"counter":87,"content":"<p>There are fewer dairy farmers, however.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#U01100","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1536067800,"counter":88,"content":"<p>Sorry, I am talking about cow numbers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#V00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tadhg Buckley"},{"type":"speech","time":1536067800,"counter":89,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#V00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1536067800,"counter":90,"content":"<p>Exactly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#V00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tadhg Buckley"},{"type":"speech","time":1536067800,"counter":91,"content":"<p>But if we were talking about the number of dairy farmers-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#V00400","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1536067800,"counter":92,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#V00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tadhg Buckley"},{"type":"speech","time":1536067800,"counter":93,"content":"<p>-----it would be more concentrated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#V00600","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1536067800,"counter":94,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#V00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tadhg Buckley"},{"type":"speech","time":1536067800,"counter":95,"content":"<p>That is the point I am making.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#V00800","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1536067800,"counter":96,"content":"<p>The average would be substantially higher.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#V00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tadhg Buckley"},{"type":"speech","time":1536067800,"counter":97,"content":"<p>Yes.

Some of my answers are similar to what we have heard from AIB.  Deputy McConalogue asked how we assess customers who are on the edge of viability.  To some extent, we need to take a step back and look at the overall sector.  Most farmers are very lowly geared.  They have fairly low levels of borrowing.  Many of them have no debt levels at all.  When we are looking at repayment capacity, we look not only at a year like this, which is obviously a difficult one from a payment capacity point of view, but also at a number of years.  We do not get carried away with a particularly good year or overly concerned with a challenging year like 2018.  We look at repayment capacity in that way.  In general, farmers and agribusinesses have a higher approval rating than non-agribusinesses.  Farmers have an approval rating of over 90% with Bank of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I can respond to the query about where we are seeing the greatest impact by saying it is similar to what we have heard from AIB.  I would like to add another angle to that.  It is somewhat unusual that we are seeing commercial farmers being impacted to a greater extent.  It is a change that we are seeing large-scale commercial farmers - typically dairy farmers but in some cases arable farmers who have been heavily affected by drought - being impacted in this way.  As such farmers have invested, they will need significant support.  They have been making strategic plans and, in many cases, recognising that they have problems coming down the tracks in addition to the problems they are facing right now.  They are making plans to deal with those future problems.<\/p> <p>  Like AIB, we do not impose restrictions on new entrants to the dairy sector by saying that those applying for lending need to have been in dairy for six months or six years.  We have no restrictions on new entrants because they comprise a key market for us.<\/p> <p>  I would like to speak about why we have particular interest rates and why we provide support in a particular way.  The proposition we have launched today is our way of saying this is a very important sector for us.  We have stressed that in the correspondence we have outlined.  It is a sector that has stood by us and performs well for us.  This is our way of being able to say we want to support the sector at a time when it is facing a particular challenge.  Our way of doing that is to apply an interest rate which is supportive of cashflow.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Cahill had a query about revising costs of production, which is something we do on an annual basis.  We do a budget for each year in the context of the money we lend not just for one year but for three or five years, or 15 or 20 years in the case of land purchases.  We make our projections on that basis.  It may be worth noting that while costs of production can increase, they have decreased in certain years.  As the dairy farms that have been mentioned by the Deputy have scaled up, there have been efficiencies of scale that have reduced overall fixed costs in many scenarios, particularly from a fixed-cost perspective.  A similar point can be made from a debt perspective.  Our experience is that pig, dairy and other types of farms that have expanded have higher debt levels, as a percentage of overall units of output, than those that have not expanded.  It might be measured as a cent per litre of increased overall output, for example.  Over the past couple of years, debt levels per unit of increased milk output have fallen in Ireland because of profitability, funding expansion from cashflow and the fact that we are lowly borrowed by comparison with the Netherlands, Denmark or New Zealand.  The gap is not nearly as significant with our pig farmers because they typically operate on a larger scale.  They are more commercial and there are fewer of them.  That sector has gone through significant consolidation.  The gap is not as big in the pig sector.  In the dairy sector, where we are seeing the most growth, the average debt level is still significantly lower than in any of the areas outlined by the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#V01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Farrell"},{"type":"speech","time":1536067800,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I invite Dr. Byrne to respond on behalf of Ulster Bank.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#V01200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1536067800,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I will address some of the points raised by Deputies McConalogue and Cahill without going back over the points touched on by Mr. Farrell and Mr. Buckley.  Ulster Bank takes a long-term view of agricultural lending because agriculture is one of our key sectors.  We support farmers through volatile income cycles.  We introduced our weather fund in July to provide flexible credit to our farmers.  I suppose we have a record of doing this in the past.  In 2009 and 2016, when the sector went through other income issues caused by commodity prices and weather issues, we introduced our dairy farmer toolkit and a previous weather fund.<\/p> <p>  We take a long-term view of repayment capacity when we are lending.  We do not look at repayment capacity at any particular moment in time.  We look at farmers over a ten-year period by reference to the price of commodities, the cost of production and the cost of producing the various commodities.<\/p> <p>  Ulster Bank is processing a larger number of small loan applications in 2018 than it did in 2017.  This indicates that there is an increasing demand for working capital solutions.  The rates on these Ulster Bank loans are starting at approximately 4% at the moment.<\/p> <p>  A question was asked about the areas of the country in which we are seeing the most challenges.  We are seeing a lot of challenges in the south and south east, in particular.  There continues to be a real situation regarding soil moisture deficits in those parts of the country and in the midlands.  Some of the most rapid expansion in dairy farming in recent years took place in some of these areas.  The demand for feed has been much higher in such areas.  Trying to meet that demand has been an issue.  We recognise that every area has been challenged over the past 12 months.  There was too much rain in the north west this time last year.  Every area has been challenged, but some areas are not as challenged as others.<\/p> <p>  The pig sector has also been mentioned.  Ulster Bank's geographical footprint means it has a large number of pig farmers on its books.  This year's prices in the pig sector are very poor by comparison with this time last year.  There has been a 43% drop in pig farmers' financial margin in the last 12 months.  They are currently experiencing one of the lowest margins in the last 15 years.  Over the years, we have worked with and supported pig farmers to develop and build resilient businesses.  We will continue to support them through this trough as well.<\/p> <p>  We have had a number of new entrants to dairy farming over the past 24 or 36 months.  We will continue to support such farmers.  I often find it is over the first 24 to 36 months that issues arise for people who are involved in startup businesses or are changing enterprises.  We seek to support people and get them through that period of time.  It is the most important time to provide support.  I think I have covered off the main issues relating to Ulster Bank.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#V01300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ailish Byrne"},{"type":"speech","time":1536067800,"counter":101,"content":"<p>I note that none of the three witnesses answered Deputy McConalogue's question about whether the banks have become more competitive as a result of last year's SBCI loan scheme.

They are getting money for nothing from people.  They are giving nothing to people in interest rates.  They got billions of euro belonging to the Irish people and that is what they are charging.  Farmers, small business and individuals depend on overdraft.  They cannot always be running in for a term loan.  I will tell the witnesses why.  They are withdrawing from rural Ireland.  There are very few buildings.  There are buildings one cannot meet anybody in.  Even Bank of Ireland had to reverse a decision in recent days.  Nobody could touch anybody.  I ring up looking for Bank of Ireland and I get on to an answering machine in Dublin.  Do not tell me I am telling lies, this is from personal experience in the last ten days.  Lo and behold, if someone has a personal overdraft - the Chairman should listen to this for the gall - and actually has a bit of business that I would have mixed into it, if he wanted to increase the overdraft from, say, &euro;10,000 to &euro;15,000, the 8.05% would shoot up to 13%.  Legalised robbery - that is what they are involved in.  They come in here and expect us to listen to this type of stuff.  I am sick listening to it.  I have spent the last 26 years in here listening to this type of stuff.  People are paying the price.<\/p><p>They have some neck.  It is only about six or seven years ago that we all suffered because of them.  If they had any bit of decency they might come in here with interest rates of 2% or 2.5%.  That is what they should be doing to help out the farmers and every other sector.  The farmers are only one sector.  They should take the small shopkeeper and all of those across rural Ireland.  The banks have withdrawn for the most part.  The best contact they have if they have someone dealing with them for 35 or 40 years is to face that person face to face.  The bank manager would know their people, know their family and everybody.  That is not in the game now.  How do they handle farmers coming in?  They have their deeds and 150 acres worth a substantial bit of money.  How do the farmers make contact with the banks now?  It is the same for farmers as it is for a small business.  They talk into this machine and make their application across the machine and somebody will contact them in seven or ten days whenever they get time.  <\/p><p>That is some interest rate.  Most farmers are on interest rates of that nature.  As Deputy Cahill will tell us, they have to have an overdraft to tide them over when there are unanticipated events.  That is what the banks are charging.  Would they not start to be decent and reduce the rate to 4% or 5%?  That would be a good start.  They come in here with a few structured schemes.  Fair play to Bank of Ireland; it has a good PR system.  It took out its hundreds of millions a day in the farming section of the <i>Independent <\/i>when it knew it was coming in to face us.  Well done.  Bank of Ireland is excellent; it knew what was coming.<\/p><p>I am sure a lot of my colleagues who worked in the bank whom I started off with many years ago are now retired.  Nearly everyone I started off with has retired; I must be the only rascal left to this thing.  Farming is a volatile business in respect of supply, production and price - price takers for the most part.  Therefore there will always be a crisis.  There was the milk crisis a few years ago.  Deputy Cahill and Dr. Byrne are right that pig farming is in a very difficult state.  I would like to know what the banks are doing to reduce the cost of credit for farming.  Very often the schemes are grand.  Bank of Ireland is now extending them to three years, which is very welcome.I will welcome anything that is positive.  We have a rate of 3.85% or whatever it is - at least it is competitive.<\/p><p>I read a few weeks ago in one of the business papers that the banks do not want money from SBCI now as they can borrow cheaper on the market.  Is that right?  I read that and thought to myself that Mr. Ashmore would be becoming redundant.  That was my first thought.  Maybe I am not right.  We were promised a scheme by the Minister nine or ten months ago in the last budget.  Surely that scheme could have been accelerated, particularly in the context of the ongoing dramatic events since last November, the snow in February and March and the drought in May, June and early July.  <\/p><p>I ask Bank of Ireland if there is a withdrawal from dealing with customers face to face.  How does the bank get to actually speak to a person and relate how a loan is structured?  How does it relate to somebody who has been with the bank for 35 or 40 years, or five or ten years or whatever?<\/p><p>I welcome Bank of Ireland's indication in its presentation that it is refinancing farmers' debts to other financial institutions, especially those that are exiting the market.  Does that extend to refinancing those who are in the grip of vulture funds and who might be in a position to get substantial write-offs once an agreed sum is payable?  Through no fault of their own, people may be down for &euro;300,000 or whatever it is.  The vulture funds have bought it for damn all, perhaps &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000, and may be selling it off at &euro;100,000.  If it could secured for &euro;300,000 five, seven or eight years ago and now can be bought for &euro;90,000 or &euro;100,000, it surely is good value.  Surely, it would be in the bank's interest to look at that in a critical but positive way and ensure that farmers and others can remain in their holdings and try to look after their families in that regard.<\/p><p> I thank the witnesses for telling me about the banks' interest rates because after almost 40 years of dealing with the bank, I did not know it.  After taking 24 hours to say to myself that I am some fool, what I worried about then is there must be many fools across the country.  That is absolutely scandalous.  One could have &euro;100,000 in the bank but would not get 1%.  Will the bank look at its overdraft interest, as well as the various schemes and packages brought forward to deal with the various problems that have arisen?  Surely it did not take a fodder crisis to trigger within the banks' departments the impetus to set out particular packages for the farming sector, particularly with its volatility and now the traumatic events.  Somebody who is present handles small and medium enterprises, SMEs.  What way do the banks treat SMEs and small rural shops in particular, which the witnesses probably have written off at this stage like everybody else, post offices or small garages?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#W01600","speaker":"1370","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1536067800,"counter":121,"content":"<p>That is a hard act to follow and I will not attempt to but I agree with much of what Deputy Penrose and my other colleagues said.  I have a couple of questions but probably will not get the answers.  Banks, and any business which is run in a similar fashion to a bank, have their finger on the pulse at all times, with flowcharts or predictions.  The witnesses can touch a few buttons on a computer in any one of their respective offices and be able to answer all my questions.  There is no doubt but that they have the information but the question is whether they will give it to me.  We are here specifically to discuss the fodder crisis or the drought this year.  What extent of restructuring of existing loans have the banks done?  The witnesses have told us what they will do, what is available and what they will give to people who find themselves coming into crisis now.  They probably have the figures in front of them.  How much restructuring has happened already where people who had loans prior to last winter have defaulted or are potential defaulters or will not be able to meet the conditions set out?  What amount of restructuring has to go on?  What are the witnesses predicting for the back end of the year?  Where there is cashflow in the dairy sector, loans might be paid numerous times over a year.  If one is a suckler herder or a beef man, one probably has whatever loans one has structured for payments twice or perhaps even once a year.  This is most likely to be in October or November when a single farm payment comes in or when one is selling one's beef or weanlings.  What predictions will the banks make about what difficulties might arise this October, when the single farm payment comes in but which will go out every bit as quickly in paying debts that have built up since the end of the fodder crisis and before the drought crisis?<\/p> <p>  At this stage, the witnesses probably will be able to predict or know the demand for stocking loans.  It has been mooted here today and is in the public domain that, as part of the current crisis, many fatteners will not fatten this winter and possibly will sell their feed to dairy men.  They might see a little more profit in that, rather than feeding cattle.  The witnesses know at this stage what the demand is compared with previous years for stocking loans from those individual fatteners who deal with the bank once a year to buy their cattle.  They fatten them, pay the bank back and move on to the following year.  The witnesses have all painted a picture of a positive long-term outlook but I would like to hear what they are thinking in the short term.  What is in it for banks to give money to many people who, while they would take it with open arms in the morning, would realistically tell one once they got out the door that they do not know how they will ever pay it back?  It cannot all be rosy and positive.  Will the witnesses give a few facts and figures?  They know better than we do.  That is all on their computers but will they share it with us?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#X00200","speaker":"1383"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1536067800,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I will try to address all the queries and Mr. Butler might take some about the branch structures.

Linked, in a way, to Senator Paul Daly's question about the outlook for the remainder of this year and next year, we think there will be some costs in the system this year that a farmer will not be able to repay in the current year, which is why we are encouraging farmers to look at putting that out over a period of up to three years to support their cashflow.  That does not mean that they are not viable but that in the current year, they have challenges in meeting all their commitments, and that is our way to try to help support their cashflow in that period.<\/p> <p>  On the questions about stocking loans, it is typically only at this time of year that we start to see significant numbers of winter finishers coming to us to buy those animals that they will go to feed or of farmers going to buy weanlings that they will keep for the back end of the year.  It is too early for us to tell as yet what impact that will have on our annual stocking loans but from now on, we certainly will start to see those applications coming to us.  To date, we have not seen any significant change in application levels.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the queries about default, it is linked to my earlier point.  It relates to helping and supporting customers so they do not go into default as a result of this year, and that we support them over a number of years if we need to deal with the additional cost.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Penrose made a point about overdraft rates.  The overall average amount of overdraft as a percentage of a farmer's overall debt level in the Bank of Ireland is very low.  While it is more expensive, it is also more flexible, and it attaches a premium with regard to pricing from that perspective.  The other point I will address, while Mr. Butler might address the overall branch structure and our staffing, is refinancing of debt from other institutions, whether vulture funds or anyone else.  While we will need all customers to be able to show they can afford the loans they are seeking, be they new loans, restructuring of existing loans or taking over loans from another institution, we certainly are in the business of doing that as long as we can prove repayment capacity and that the risk is acceptable at whatever amount of borrowing is proposed.  Hopefully that addresses the queries and Mr. Butler might address the overall structure and our staffing levels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#X00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Farrell"},{"type":"speech","time":1536067800,"counter":125,"content":"<p>Before we move on to Mr. Butler, Deputy Penrose asked a question regarding the increase in the percentage of overdraft.

As a result of that feedback and to try to serve them better, we have brought additional staff into customer-facing roles within our branches.

I will make two points on overdrafts.  The first is that approximately 12% of overall lending to the agri-sector last year was overdraft lending.  Our current utilisation rate is 34%, part of the reason for which is that the overdraft is designed as a flexible facility which should come in and out of credit.  While it is expensive - a point I would not contradict for a second - we do not see it as a form of medium-term finance for farmers.  It should be used for current expenditure on a seasonal basis.  At the risk of repeating myself, I refer to the facilities provided side by side with overdrafts, including the stocking facility, the farmer credit line, which is substantially cheaper.  We encourage farmers to have the two facilities running side by side in order to ensure that they are not paying interest at 7.85% for longer than a month or three in the year.  That is a lot of what we are doing to try to reduce the cost of credit to farmers, namely, encouraging them to use the farmer credit line.<\/p> <p>  We have participated in all SBCI schemes to date and will engage with the corporation again on its new investment loan scheme.  Based on previous engagements, we expect to be in a position to participate in the next one.  There is no refinancing from funds or other banks.  Like Bank of Ireland, we welcome the opportunity to refinance loans once we are happy with repayment capacity and the interest rate.<\/p> <p>  In the context of Senator Paul Daly's comments, we have seen no restructuring as yet, but the first thing farmers will look for is liquidity for working capital.  Restructuring does not necessarily provide immediate liquidity.  I expect it to be later in the year before we start to see that.  The Senator made a valid point, particularly as it relates to tillage and dry-stock farmers, many of whom have annual loan repayments falling in October or December.  In a large number of those cases, interest-only arrangements may be a suitable tool to reduce the outgoings for the year and to give farmers some space to breathe.<\/p> <p>  I was asked about the short-term outlook.  We have not seen any farmers who have not sought approval for their stocking loans again this year.  While farmers may look for approval, that does not necessarily mean they will draw the funds down.  I live on a dairy farm in rural Ireland.  I am a dairy farmer as well as a banker.  We try to listen to farmers.  I meet farmers every day of the week and try to listen to their issues.  I try to use that experience to help AIB respond in the best way to those issues.  We are fully aware of the issues because we meet guys every day of the week.  There is a great deal of stress out there, including from a psychological perspective, because there has been no downtime.  When the weather cleared in April and May, the first thing guys had to do was try to catch up.  We were straight into the silage season, which is a big thing, but the first cut was not made when we had a drought.  It has been a very difficult 18 months, which the bank knows.  That is why it is important from our perspective to ensure our front-line staff are fully aware of the pressure farmers are feeling.  I will ask Ms Brennan to discuss the wider SME sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#Y00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tadhg Buckley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1536067800,"counter":130,"content":"<p>Deputy Brennan asked about the wider SME aspect.  We also have a business credit line to support our SMEs at the same 3.825% rate.  It may be that we are just not as good at messaging in that context, but we have had both those facilities in place for ten or 11 years.  Perhaps we need to ensure we tell our customers more about them because they are there to support both SMEs or farmers when they really need it from a cashflow perspective.  We are seeing some stress in the SME sector, particularly in the Border counties with the exchange rate issues that have hit.  That includes the hospitality sector and the retail sector.  We are supporting our customers and expect to see more issues as Brexit unfolds over the next nine to ten months or so.  We have seen SMEs in manufacturing and other sectors hold off on investment because they are concerned about what will actually happen.  We are concerned for them and we are trying to support them to enter new markets.  We are working with multiple agencies on that and put 26 Brexit advisers on the pitch two years ago to provide support whose job it is have the knowledge to engage with our customers, whether they are in the farming sector or the SME sector, on what Brexit is going to mean for their businesses.<\/p> <p>  To sum up, we support working capital for SMEs and farmers at quite a low price and have done so historically.  We may need to message it better, but we are seeing other stresses in the SME sector outside of what is happening in agriculture.  There is a great deal going on in Ireland Inc. at present and there is a great deal that needs to play out this year.  The weather is one of the factors impacting the agri-sector, as is Brexit.  The latter is also impacting on SMEs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#Y00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Margaret Brennan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1536067800,"counter":131,"content":"<p>Deputy Penrose referred to a withdrawal from rural Ireland.  We have seen a huge change over the last few years in the way our customers choose to do their banking.  More and more customers use online and mobile applications for day-to-day banking as opposed to the more traditional branch-based transactions.  All of these behaviours are driven by the desire for quick and convenient access when and where customers want it.  Importantly, we expect this type of change to continue.  For farmers and business customers, a team of business development managers is available to meet farmers on their farms in rural areas.  We will continue to invest to make Ulster Bank an easier bank for our customers to do business with.<\/p> <p>  Senator Paul Daly asked about stocking loans and changes in that context.  As I said in my opening statement, we have received requests from farmers over the past couple of months to extend for three to six months stocking loans that were due to be repaid in the early months of the summer in circumstances in which animals did not thrive as expected due to adverse weather conditions in the period.  We have supported farmers with an extension to those stocking loans.  As to what we are seeing with beef finishers in particular, they are coming to us seeking approval, which they are getting.  However, there is a lot more discussion with us this year compared to other years.  They are looking at a viable market for their feed this year compared to other years.  We all know the margins for beef finishers are very tight and that there is a market out there for their feed, in particular from dairy farmers.  As such, they are asking themselves whether they will finish animals this year.<\/p> <p>  The single farm payment is a typical time when many farm bills fall due for payment, including bank term debt.  If farmers look to go on interest only for 12 months, we can look at that.  Merchant, contractor and other main bills usually come in around that period of time as everyone knows it is a good time for freeing flows of cash into the farm business.  We will look to put working capital solutions in place for farmers to get to that period as we recognise their costs are a lot higher this year than in other years.  I will hand over to Mr. Cullen who can look at the SME and overdraft matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#Y00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ailish Byrne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1536067800,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I am sure everyone wants to come back to the overdraft point one last time.

It is important to recognise overdrafts are a specific product and they are not meant to be hardcore.  They are meant to provide inter-month and inter-period flexible financing when people need it and, by the way, that is farmers and SMEs.  When we see overdraft limits go hardcore and become long term we work with our customers, be they farmers or SMEs, to take them off that product and put them onto a term-debt product that is more appropriate to their needs.  I know there has been much talk about 8%-type margins around overdrafts but that is not where customers, be they SMEs or agricustomers, borrow from the banking sector.

Given the potential impact of Brexit on their businesses, we felt in conjunction with the Departments that we work with that there was a real sense of urgency to get that into the market.  That was launched at the end of March, and it still took a few months for one of the banks to be actively in the market after that.  It has really only just settled in and is in there now.  That frees up the capacity for us to start talking to the institutions and start delivering the next scheme.  It is a serial process that means we cannot always bring a number of things or something to market quite as quickly as we would like.  It is also important we take the time to get as much resource out of Europe as part of these schemes.  We have been quite successful in that.  The European Commission contributed to the agrischeme in two different ways.  It contributed strongly to the Brexit support loan scheme, and we expect there will be a strong European contribution to the next scheme also.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the recent article about the use of lower-cost SBCI liquidity by the banks, when the SBCI was first set up it addressed the market failure where banks could not access low-cost long-term liquidity support to support their SME-lending.  The market has evolved and, due to the massive amount of quantitative easing that has taken place, it is a much more liquid market now for bank credit.  At the point where it became cheaper for the banks to borrow in the market than it was to borrow from the SBCI, which is using a degree of Government resource to make that available, certainly in terms of the Government's balance sheet, it made no sense to continue that activity.  We continue to use that sort of liquidity to support non-bank institutions, at least two of which support farmers through low-cost access to leasing, hire purchase and finance to purchase equipment.  We continue to use that source of support and we use it instead of supporting the banks' delivery of loans to support non-banks which can then compete with the banks.  It is on a different scale and it is a different type of institution but we continue to look for non-banks to be able to use that funding.<\/p> <p>  In response to that change in circumstances, the SBCI has sought to evolve as rapidly and as quickly as it can.  We have been moving into the risk-sharing area for a number of years and, as has been seen, we have already brought forward two major schemes.  We also took over the administration and operation of the original credit guarantee scheme, which was brought forward by the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, and it is also delivered through the banks.  It is there as a backstop for businesses that are turned down for credit, where they can then look to the credit guarantee scheme to bolster their credit application.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#Z00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Nick Ashmore"},{"type":"speech","time":1536067800,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Ashmore.<\/p> <p>  As there are no further questions, I thank Mr. Farrell and Mr. Butler from Bank of Ireland, Mr. Buckley and Ms Brennan from Allied Irish Bank, Dr. Byrne and Mr. Cullen from Ulster Bank and Mr. Ashmore from the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland for appearing before us today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018090400002#Z00400","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1536067800,"counter":137,"content":"<p>The joint committee adjourned at 6.35 p.m. until 3.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 25 September 2018.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment","time":1536066000,"counter":138},{"type":"unspoken","content":"<p>The Joint Committee met at 14:00<\/p><p>MEMBERS PRESENT:<\/p><p>Deputy Timmy Dooley, Senator Gerry Horkan.* Deputy Martin Kenny,* Deputy James Lawless, Deputy Michael Lowry, Deputy Eamon Ryan, Deputy Br\u00edd Smith,<\/p><p>* In the absence of Deputy Brian Stanley and Senator Terry Leyden.<\/p><p>In attendance: Deputies Jackie Cahill, Se\u00e1n Canney, Michael Collins, Michael Fitzmaurice, Michael Harty, Danny Healy-Rae, Mattie McGrath, Eugene Murphy, Margaret Murphy O'Mahony, Tom Neville, Carol Nolan, Kevin O'Keeffe and Thomas Pringle, and Senators P\u00e1draig Mac Lochlainn, Michelle Mulherin and Marie-Louise O'Donnell.<\/p><p>DEPUTY HILDEGARDE NAUGHTON IN THE CHAIR.<\/p>","time":1536066000,"counter":139,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1536066000,"counter":140,"content":"<p>The joint committee met in private session until 2.24 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Impact of Retirement Packages for Postmasters: Discussion","time":1536066000,"counter":141,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#C00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1536066000,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.

As a business person with over 40 years&rsquo; experience and a commerce degree, I had a basic understanding of banking and little to no understanding of credit creation, nor the crucial difference between funding the productive economy and funding speculative bubbles.  PBFI is a solution-based forum.  Its members work voluntarily and do not receive any remuneration or expenses.  We are wholly independent from vested interests.  We might also refer to our extensive letter to the committee, dated 27 June, which comprises appendix 2, and to an update on the current position, which is provided in appendix 1.<\/p> <p>  We hope, over the course of the exchange, to outline the wider issues our country faces in respect of both banking and driving our indigenous economy and how crucial a role our valued post office network can play in assisting the transformation of the Irish socio-economy.  What do we mean by transforming the economy?  In 2011 we wrote a letter of congratulations to the then incoming Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, in which we pointed out that Ireland&rsquo;s cost base was unsustainably high and that we had an over-reliance on foreign direct investment, FDI, underpinned by a corporate tax structure that was incurring the wrath of the US, the EU, the OECD and our near neighbours in the UK.  Since then, those influential players in international trade have taken steps that may ultimately wipe out Ireland&rsquo;s corporate tax advantages.  The Apple case will also prove to be a defining moment in the future of FDI in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Post offices are the other side of the coin.  The reality is that we have only been paying lip service to our indigenous economy.  Like it or not, the responsible and sustainable development of our indigenous economy is crucial to our future.  We must create a competitive platform that facilitates the long-term future of our socio-economy.  This view is somewhat at odds with the views put forward by retired Secretary General of the Department of Finance, John Moran, who suggested, in a speech made in May 2016, that Ireland can no longer afford rural Ireland.  One can see the reference in appendix 3.  Clearly, there are choices to be made but we must be careful not to confuse any rural-urban divide with the overriding importance of our indigenous economy.  What is patently clear is that the current structure and behaviour of our banking sector is wholly incompatible with driving our indigenous economy.  The pillar banks are not lending in any meaningful way to citizens, small and medium enterprises, SMEs, and farmers and where they are, the rates charged are exorbitant - two, three, four and up to five times what our counterparts in Germany and France are paying in interest.  Last year, AIB gouged &euro;1.6 billion in profit and Bank of Ireland is gouging profits of approximately &euro;1 billion per year.  It appears that neither institution will pay corporation tax for up to 20 years.<\/p> <p>  I will shorten my contribution in view of the time constraints.  Last autumn, PBFI carried out an exercise comparing the cost of a mortgage in Ireland with that in Germany in the context of a house costing &euro;315,000.  Over the lifetime of the mortgage - 30 years - an Irish person would pay &euro;121,000 more than his or her German counterpart, which is a penalty of &euro;4,000 per year, as a result of the difference between the interest rate in Germany and Ireland.<\/p><p>Germany&rsquo;s development bank KfW states in its 2015 report that the German economy boasts almost 4 million SME and microenterprises.  These account for 99.95% of all companies and 87% have a turnover of less than &euro;1 million.  Germany is the fourth largest economy in the world.  Why?  One of the reasons is that it is underpinned by a public and community bank network that prioritises people and local economies over profit maximisation.  Public and community banks account for some 70% of the German banking sector.  German pillar banks including Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank have only 12.5% of the German market in contrast to the Irish pillar banks which hold 95% of the Irish market.<br\/><br\/>The Irish Government agreed and committed to the introduction of competition to the Irish banking market as a <i>quid pro quo<\/i>during the banking bailout but instead we have seen a mass exodus of banks, including Irish Nationwide, Anglo, ACC, ICC, Bank of Scotland (Ireland) and EBS.  Article 45(2)[iv] of our Constitution holds that in what<i><\/i>pertains to the control of credit, &quot;the constant and predominant aim shall be the welfare of the people&rdquo;<i>. <\/i>Under our Constitution, the Oireachtas is bound to enshrine this directive principle but as it stands, this has not been happening.<br\/><br\/>In November 2016, D&aacute;il Eireann unanimously passed a motion that allowed for the remodelling of the post office network along the lines of either the German Sparkasse or New Zealand Kiwibank model.  Ireland&rsquo;s post office network, along with our credit unions, can become a core plank of rebuilding Ireland just like the Kiwibank has done in New Zealand.  The current narrative on post offices is all wrong.  All we hear from media is talk of saving our post offices and subsidising them but we can, at the stroke of a pen, turn the network into a thriving, profitable bank and multi-service provider.  The post office network is failing in terms of monetary returns but the reason for this is quite simple, namely, the business model is wrong.  Kiwibank makes $100 million in profits each year for the people of New Zealand.  It provides credit<b><\/b>at competitive rates and has proved the saviour of the people and SMEs of New Zealand.  The current An Post proposals are bizarre and ill-thought out.  We are presiding over the destruction of one of our finest national assets, with 159 post offices closing, 231 with no future and the remaining 690 depending on An Post winning the social welfare contract again after the current one expires on 31 December <sup><\/sup>2019.  Having regard to European procurement law, there is no certainty that An Post will be successful in winning this contract once again.<br\/><br\/>As a country, we need to start thinking outside the box.  In the words of Professor Steve Keen of Kingston University, &quot;the financial sector should be the servant of the rest of the economy, not the master but at the moment, it&rsquo;s the master of not just the economy but of the politicians as well [...] to break the nexus, we need a complete political shift.&quot; <i><\/i>We appeal to this committee today to immediately call a halt to the wanton destruction of our post office network and turn it around to serve the needs of a modern indigenous economy.  There is plenty of help and guidance available to the committee and the Minister.  Professor Richard Werner of Southampton University is one of the world&rsquo;s leading banking experts whom we believe could bring invaluable perspective to the committee and we would urge members to engage with him.  We are sure members will have lots of questions for us and we will endeavour to be as helpful as possible going forward.

There is certainly room for a debate on the way in which our banking model works in this State.  However, our primary concern is the post office network and while I accept that the PBFI is offering a potential solution to the maintenance of the network by the creation of this bank, I must put on the record my concerns about conflating the two issues.  I see the post office network as one that delivers a service.  The PBFI is advocating the creation of a banking model that will turn our current model on its head.  That is a debate for the Oireachtas committee on finance or elsewhere but to do all of that and to save the network in the short time that we have available to us stretches it somewhat.  The people I meet and represent in my community and in other communities are anxious to retain a local post office so they can get basic post office services and get their payments.  They are not queueing up for another bank.  That said, I am sure they would queue up for the kind of attractive offering to which Mr. Maye referred.<\/p> <p>  A number of questions arise.  How quickly could such a bank be put in place?  What would it cost?  How much would have to be invested by the State?  Where would the expertise to set up such a bank quickly come from?  Mr. Maye said that it could be done at the stroke of a pen.  I have had the privilege of listening to Mr. Duddy on a number of occasions when he argued that An Post had a banking licence previously and that it was only a matter of reinitiating it.  I am no banking expert but if one is to lend money, one needs to have money in the first instance in order to be able to get money from the markets.  One also needs to be in a position to give confidence to those who will deposit money with one.  All of that takes time.<\/p> <p>  I have listened with interest to Mr. O'Callaghan talking about the Kiwibank model in New Zealand and the Sparkasse model in Germany and that is all good.  However, Ireland is a different country with a different culture and we do things differently.  If one takes a farmer in west Clare who has just sold his herd of cattle, would PBFI have the capacity to assure him that his money in safe in such a bank?  Is it possible to get that kind of model in place quickly in order to save the post office network?  Certainly, the ideas are good and the issue definitely needs to be addressed over time but we have a crisis now and Mr. O'Callaghan knows that better than anyone.  There are 159 post offices closing in the next two to three months.

The crisis in the post office network is not something that has arisen in the last couple of months but has been developing for the last 20 years.  As things moved forward and as the economy grew, there was potential for the post office network to expand, to do other business and to meet the requirements of a modern society but it was prevented from doing so.  That is what has brought us to where we are today.  One of the things that An Post was prevented from doing was putting a proper banking system in place.  On the proposal from PBFI, the question that Deputy Dooley asked in regard to the timescale for setting it up is pertinent.  How much would it cost to set up?  What kind of money would be required to make this happen?  I assume that what PBFI is proposing is that if the bank is set up, the post office network would act as the front door.  It would be to the post office that people in communities would go to carry out their transactions.  If that is the case, is additional technology required in the post office network?  Would broadband services, which are sparse enough in many parts of rural Ireland, need to be upgraded, for example?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#D00500","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1536066000,"counter":149,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Kenny for being brief.

We spent a good deal of the last D&aacute;il term looking at and talking about the Sparkasse and Kiwibank models.  The issue came up many times at this committee and on the floor of the D&aacute;il, including through questions to the Minister for Finance.  We had some very energised debates about whether it could work and the Government committed to looking at it and examining it closely, which it did.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, published a report on the issue in July which concluded that there was no compelling case for the State to establish a new local public banking system.  It found that the cost to the Exchequer for the proposed new model was an estimated minimum of &euro;170 million and that the assumptions in the proposal based on costs, interest rates and loan attrition rates \"appear challenging\".  When I read this, I nearly fell down laughing at the idea that we could not support a public banking sector to the tune of &euro;170 million when we have just thrown &euro;64 billion at AIB and the rest of the banks.  I am sure that the reaction of representatives of PBFI was the same.  In that context, it is disingenuous for other Deputies to say that this proposal is too late and that Ireland is a different country that does things differently and has a different culture.  We do have a very different culture.  We have had the biggest bank bailout in history and have refused the Apple tax that is due to us of at least &euro;13 billion.<\/p> <p>  I fully support Mr. Maye's contention that it is not too late and that we should look at this proposal.  I would like to know what he thinks of the Government's report.  I would be very critical of the fact that the Minister for Finance released this report in July, during the D&aacute;il recess.<\/p><p>It tells everybody in the country that the final nail is going into the coffin of the post office because what we have seen is just the beginning of the closure of our post offices.  This proposal was a way to help us step away from that and to be fair to the Irish people, farmers and small businesses and give them a way to borrow at a decent, realistic and humane rate, as people can do in Germany, New Zealand and elsewhere.

The Government has had four years to do so and we should be proceeding.  There is a confluence between this issue and the closure of the post offices because this provides a model for another service.  It is a service to small business in particular.  It has the advantage that deposits raised in certain areas are retained in those areas so it is about regional development.  It brings some of the expertise the Sparkasse organisation has in professional small business lending into the post office or, indeed, into credit unions.  There are a variety of ways in which it could be introduced.  We strongly support it and we are deeply frustrated with the lack of vision in the Government and among the Government parties in that regard.

The Public Banking Forum of Ireland was formed in 2014 and we immediately brought the Sparkasse people in Germany over here.  We have produced an extensive report on creating Ireland's alternative banking force, which includes proposals for the Sparkasse to work with the credit unions and a stand alone proposal for the post offices to take the Kiwibank route.  There is nothing to stop the post offices opting for the Sparkasse model as well.  There are a number of options available.  I was struck by the response of the establishment and the Department of Finance.  We brought our report to the Department of Finance and the Department of Rural and Community Development joint consultation group and it was clear there is a mindset that we must not compete with the pillar banks.  Those banks are charging us two, three, four, five and more times what our counterparts in other countries are paying, but that is the mindset.  The Constitution is very clear.  It says that the constant and predominant aim in what pertains to the control of credit should be the welfare of the people.<\/p> <p>  I should point out to Deputy Dooley that there is a massive, untapped indigenous economy in the agriculture, marine and other sectors, but it is dying on its feet for want of funding.  What we are proposing is a no-brainer.  New Zealand is a similar country to ours and, in fact, has a smaller population.  It said that enough was enough and in 2002 set up the Kiwibank.  I do not have the figures for what it cost to set it up but it was relatively cheap.  Within 15 years it had 20% of the market.  Everybody keeps asking how much it will cost to set up this new bank.  It is not a great deal, somewhere between &euro;50 million and &euro;70 million, although we have to do more work on that.  However, we must consider this in the context of the &euro;69 billion, as mentioned by Deputy Smith, we paid to bail out banks that were operating on a criminal basis.  They are still doing so.  Unless and until we lose the mindset that the pillar banks come first and people do not figure at all, the social economy is not going anywhere.  There is a glaring opportunity now.  There is a crisis in the post offices and there is an opportunity to turn this into a thriving banking and indigenous economy.  We must do it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Maye"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1536066000,"counter":155,"content":"<p>First, the question we all need to ask ourselves is: why are we here?  We do not wish to see the ruination of small villages and towns throughout the countryside.  I also believe that we care about people.  To respond to Deputy Dooley, I have heard many people ask what we can do to maintain the network.  I take the Deputy's point and I also accept the point that small offices are closing, but I am sick to death of getting a sticking plaster to maintain a network.  We must examine this from the top down.  It is very simple, like a car.  One puts a certain amount of petrol in the car to get to one's destination and back.  Currently, the post office needs &euro;78 million, effectively, to maintain itself.  We have an opportunity here to consider how to address that.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Kenny is absolutely correct that the Government has attacked its national asset.  Grant Thornton clearly stated in 2014 that if we do not maintain Government contracts to the value of &euro;60 million there will be drastic consequences, effectively shutting it down.  That was ignored.  We now know there are major problems so how do we resolve them and move forward?  My colleague, Gerry Duddy, will discuss what it costs.  An Post has done this previously.  We should be under no illusion about that.  It created a bank in 2010 to 2012 for quite a modest sum with a partner.  What we are saying is very simple if we want the network to survive on a social economic basis.  We have to think of the people as well.  People in every village and town are upset because they are terrified of the post office closing.  We must find a solution.  Part of that is New Zealand.  The reason New Zealand has been highlighted, as against the Sparkessen mentioned by Deputy Eamon Ryan, is that the post offices are interlinked.  The branch network is already set up.  At the turn of a switch a business proposal can be rolled out through the network to every village in Ireland.  It can go to Ventry or to the GPO in Dublin.  That is the reason we favour the Kiwi model for the post office network.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Smith referred to the &euro;170 million.  It was an absolute insult to the public to hear that there was more concern that it was going to cost &euro;170 million when billions of euro were paid to the pillar banks.  This is being used as an opportunity to stop a challenge to the pillar banks, one that will be of benefit.  The difference in what we are proposing is that the profits go back to the small communities rather than to the shareholders.

If this &euro;160 million was spent to set up community banking, would it pay for itself and pay to run itself?  That is the critical question because money is being pumped into many parts of our economy.  I refer to the health service.  Is it adequate despite all the money that is being pumped into it?  It is not manifesting in a proper health service for our people, the people who we are representing and the people who were on trolleys again last week in Tralee.

There is a vacuum in rural Ireland in banking.  The pillar banks have left rural Ireland and those which are still there have diminished customer service in, or excluded it from, their banks so it is difficult to speak to somebody when one goes into a bank now.  One of the positive aspects of community banking is that customers deal with somebody who knows their community and knows the viability of the businesses that may be coming in to seek a loan.  An Post has a trusted brand, has a national network and already has the IT systems in place.  Through a public banking system, it should have the capacity to loan to businesses that cannot get a loan from the public banking system or from the pillar banks as they exist at the moment.<\/p> <p>  On the closure of post offices, is it too late for a community or public banking system to step in and preserve the network as it exists at the moment?  The reason I am here today is to try to preserve the network as it exists.  There needs to be a devolution of services to post offices from Government.

People forget that there is something like &euro;22 billion to &euro;23 billion on deposit in the post offices and another &euro;23 billion to &euro;24 billion in savings.  I know it is a savings bank but Irish people recognise a safe place in which to put money.  I have never been asked if I would like to invest my &euro;5,000 or whatever into something like this where it would remain alive and I would not lose it, and it would go into the community like the co-operatives of years ago in every town in Ireland which kept those towns alive.<\/p> <p>  On the question of investing &euro;120 million, I completely agree with Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith that it is like loose change to vulture funds.  It is a disgrace that we are even talking in the millions.  Whether it is &euro;60 million, &euro;70 million or &euro;120 million it would certainly be worth it.  I agree with Mr. O'Callaghan that the Government is shattering its own asset, like shattering a clock.  If a clock is shattered in its middle, everything will suffer on the outer parts.  I am not suggesting that we should keep post offices with two, three and four people in them alive and well, but smaller post offices will not be kept alive if the centre is being shattered.  We are also then gifting them to conglomerates by putting them into the back of Centras and SuperValus.  Soon they will be in the back of Tesco as well and we will go to Tesco for everything.  It will end up being the supermarket culture.<\/p> <p>  I do not understand why the Government is so terrified of the pillar banks considering the way they treated this country.  There was a man in the bank the other day in Ranelagh and he went through the doors fuming because he had three or four children and he spent a half an hour trying to park only to be told that cash was not handled in that branch.  We are running around trying to find out, like evictees, where we will get the cash and where we will actually bank.  Although I will not be standing for election, everybody sitting around this table who will be better think very clearly and validly about the new poor.  The new poor in Ireland are the guy and the girl in training and earning &euro;30,000, or those in households earning 60,000, where they are both working.  They are paying 52% tax and they have nowhere to go to get a deposit.  They are living hand to mouth and there is no possibility of them saving &euro;10,000 or &euro;20,000.  We are always talking about choice in relation to the human body but they have no choice.  They are closed down in this country.  They are the new poor, they are the plumbers, radiographers, young doctors, nurses and teachers and they are living hand to mouth.  People better start thinking about that.  It is appalling and they have no alternative.  This should be done to give people a community based, social alternative.  Imagine living in a country where 96% of banking is commercial.  It is only 12% in Germany.  As Deputy Smith said, we got a report where the whole thing was dismissed in three sentences.

Before I ask those questions, I mention that we had a postal service and our first Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was in 1924.  In this day and age if we cannot keep a service throughout the country to support all of our people who need it, it is a poor reflection on Irish society.<\/p> <p>  I want to put two things to Mr. Maye and Mr. Duddy and I do not care who answers.  As they know, there are 7,500 people employed in the postal service.  We had to come to the rescue a short time ago when we lifted the cap on the price of a stamp to ensure that significant numbers of people would not lose their jobs and that a five or six day postal service could continue.  I have no doubt about the witnesses' passion, I know where they are coming from and they have said a lot of good things.  I refer to the credit union.  Can the witnesses see themselves coming behind the credit union, which has a network throughout the country, in terms of non-commercial banking?  That is one area where the credit union has done a lot of work on this.  It is something that could be supported rather than looking at a new sector of banking.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses spoke about other areas of business that An Post could go into but the one thing that amazes me in all of this is that nobody has mentioned the younger generation.  What about a pilot scheme where post offices would be put into the campuses of universities and ITs to go after that business.  There is huge business there.  Could that be brought into future policies because that could be quite lucrative for the postal service?  That would then mean that the postal service could be supported in parts of the country where it is not profitable but where there are vulnerable people who will be left behind if what is proposed now goes ahead.<\/p><p>I know we will not be able to keep all of those 159 post offices open but we need to keep some of them open and have the service for vulnerable people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#F00600","speaker":"1342","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1536066000,"counter":166,"content":"<p>There have been many questions, some of which overlap.

The figure of &euro;170 million was taken by the Department took from one submission from the Sparkasse people.  Our submission did not look for State money.  It did provide the option of using State money.  To put things in perspective, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, with which we dealt fairly extensively in our last letter to the committee, has a budget of &euro;1.25 billion and has not gone anywhere near achieving its aims and objectives nor can it because it is simply a non-lender.  In Germany, the Sparkasse bank is over 200 years old, has withstood two world wars and several financial crises and has never had a bailout or received a penny of taxpayers' money.  The reason is very simple.  It does not engage in speculative lending.  It lends to the productive economy.  We must not confuse this.  What happened in Ireland was that our pillar banks abandoned the fractional reserve system and entered an orgy of credit creation which could only finish in one place, namely, a big bang so we are not talking about setting up a bank that can go bust.  Banks that are run properly and diligently do not go bust.  Would our Kiwibank-style post office bank repay &euro;170 million or &euro;70 million?  Yes, of course it would and in a very short period of time.<\/p> <p>  It is very important that we do not leave out the credit unions.  The Public Banking Forum of Ireland has worked very hard with the credit unions and the post office movement from the outset.  Members must understand that the pillar banks in Ireland have 95% of the market whereas in Germany, it is 12.5% so there is room for our Kiwibank to take up 20% of the market just as it has done in New Zealand and there is still room for our credit unions or community bank to take another 25% to 30% of the market.  This would still leave our pillar banks with a market share that would be far too high at over 50%.  The restrictions that successive Governments and the Central Bank have put on credit unions are anti-competitive.  They cannot and do not comply with Irish or European competition law.  While we are at it, why not take the shackles off the credit unions as well because we have an indigenous economy to worry about?  That is what we are looking for.  It is not the nitty-gritty of how much it will cost because we all agree that whatever it might cost is peanuts.  For the sake of driving this economy, bringing our young people back and opening up all these new industries where we have researched what we can do, we need to drive the Kiwibank, model the post offices on Kiwibank and bring the credit unions on board.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Maye"},{"type":"speech","time":1536066000,"counter":168,"content":"<p>Does Mr. O'Callaghan wish to come in?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#G00400","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1536066000,"counter":169,"content":"<p>We are not looking at 159 post offices; we are looking at 390 communities that have not been offered a contract.  This is upsetting in itself for the people involved but more to the point, their income will collapse within two and half to three years.  The reason is because we are heavily dependent on the social welfare contract.  In 2012, the Government was told that if it was reduced from &euro;60 million, there would be problems.  It actually reduced it to &euro;54 million and the current figure is &euro;51 million yet Government policy that will come in 2019 from the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection clearly states that it will be tendered for the cashless society so the question is what will replace that income when it does come in.  How do we stop it?  Every Deputy in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann signed up to this.  We all made an agreement and I negotiated it with my colleagues here.  What we asked was that a five-year holding plan be put in place.  This would enable us to get those Government contracts that we would funnel into the post office.  An example of that would be if someone was signing on.  Why can this not be done within his or her local post office?  If we look at motor tax, we can see that 80% of this is done online but 20% could be done in a local post office.  These elements need to be brought up to a head in order that we can find an economic solution.<\/p> <p>  We talked about passion.  Yes, we are passionate about the network and that is why we are all here but we must also be realistic.  New products are vital, which banking will also enable us to provide.  Every post office in Ireland could be like an Argos catalogue.  Why can a person not walk into their small post office and buy a colour television?  Why can that money not then be circulated within their village?  I think we would have no trouble getting new customers.  <\/p> <p>  We need to look at this in a long-term fashion, look at where mistakes were made and look for solutions.  Over ten years ago, Bank of Ireland supposedly came to the rescue of the post office in England.  It did a deal.  Everyone thought it was wonderful and that there would be loads of products.  The spin was that every service was there for rural and urban areas.  The reality is that last year alone, a profit of more than &pound;15 billion was made for Bank of Ireland while the postmasters are struggling to survive.  Something is very wrong.  What do the unions in England want to do?  They want to get out of the deal.  To get out of that deal right now will cost them over &pound;2 billion.  We have an opportunity to do right for the first time ever.  <\/p> <p>  Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell is correct.  There is approximately &euro;22 billion in savings and investments in post offices.  Where did that money come from?  How did they build that figure?  We all recall the financial crisis.  In 2008, there was a serious issue about whether we would have our own currency.  We all recall the stories about how the Army would be there to secure ATMs.  What did people do?  They turned to their local postmaster and in short space of time, over &euro;15 billion was put into the post office.  That figure is now over &euro;22 billion.  Why are we now attacking the very people all over the country who have helped to mind our money and who now face closure?  <\/p> <p>  We also made reference to the subsidy.  Again, I acknowledge there is a short-term gap.  However, a document from Grant Thornton clearly states that the UK Government has used subvention to help the network.  We have heard the figure of &euro;8 million.  Again, I have problems with numbers because McKinsey has conducted a detailed analysis of the company.  I can assure the committee that we will provide the figures that we need to maintain the network for the next five years and proposals to bring us back but we do not want to cost the Exchequer money.  We bailed out the banks in 24 hours yet we are prepared to see the network shut down.  We are talking about possibly &euro;170 million.  Again, our focus is seriously wrong.  The Grant Thornton report stated that the UK Government has used subvention to help the network.  In respect of its account for the loss of income associated with the reduction in social welfare, which sounds familiar in Ireland, the report stated that at best, these subsidies provide a safety buffer for the post office while it is trying to establish a more reliable long-term stream.  We all agreed in November 2016 and asked for a holding plan to allow the implementation of this bank but also the products.  Let us put real Ireland back on the map.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom O'Callaghan"},{"type":"speech","time":1536066000,"counter":170,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Duddy wish to come in?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#G00600","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1536066000,"counter":171,"content":"<p>Deputy Harty asked how quickly the bank could become profitable.

I thank postmasters the length and breadth of the country for the dedicated service they have given to rural and urban communities over many years.  As members are aware, some postmasters have taken the difficult decision in recent weeks to leave the business.  I will return to that issue.<\/p> <p>  Some people have, perhaps mischievously, given the impression that I do not understand or care about issues in rural Ireland.  As many members are aware, I represent the most rurally dispersed constituency in the country and have consistently raised the issue of our post office network in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann over many years.  I have first-hand experience of the concerns and issues involved.  I understand the concerns of older people and that this is a very anxious time for many of them.  I have watched the gradual demise of the post office network over many years.  More than 500 post offices closed during the economic boom in this country between 2002 and 2007 while people sat on their hands and allowed the post office network to fall into decline.  No new investment or services were put into it.  I did not want that to continue.  The postmasters of this country and the communities they serve deserve a clear future and a plan to be put in place for the development of and investment into the post office network and its services.  Such action was not taken by a series of Governments over many decades.  Although Government after Government promised to do something, nothing was done.  We have now set out a clear path and future for the post office network.<\/p> <p>  As a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, I have for many years put forward constructive solutions to bring new business into the post office network.  I am now lucky to be able to help to implement such solutions.  I point out to members, some of whom have been Members of the D&aacute;il or Seanad for a considerable number of years, that I was one of only five Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann or Seanad &Eacute;ireann to make a submission to the Kerr report, which has now been almost fully implemented by An Post.  We want to have a sustainable post office network that is available to all of our citizens, both urban and rural, in the medium and long term.<\/p> <p>  Much has been made in the press over the past week of the impact of the closures.  Although I accept that the closures will have an impact on the communities served by the post offices in question, the background to the issue has not been well represented.  It is important to put the An Post announcement of the changes to the post office network into context.<\/p><p>Ninety-seven weeks ago, I was presented with a future for An Post and the post office network that was uncertain and extremely bleak.  I was determined the company would not go under.  There was a very real possibility that that could happen because of the failure to act by successive Governments.  The potential for a complete shutdown of postal services with the loss of thousands of jobs was undeniable.  Immediate action was needed because of the need to ensure the survival of An Post.  We also needed to safeguard the post office network.  That was necessary to protect thousands of jobs across the country; the 9,000 people working in An Post.  Those imperative requirements needed decisions.  I can tell the committee that decisions have been forthcoming.  I did not shirk from my responsibility as Minister.  We have worked tirelessly to restructure the company in order to save it.  I am sure members will recall the urgent need to introduce legislation to facilitate an increase in the price of a stamp.  That was an essential first step to avoid a cash crunch for the company and to give An Post time to construct a plan for a sustainable future.  The challenges facing An Post were recognised across all political parties.  That legislation was widely supported in its passage through the Oireachtas.  I thank members of this committee for their support in providing An Post with a much-needed window to put a strategic plan in place.<\/p><p> I also worked hard on securing a Government investment of &euro;30 million in An Post to safeguard the five-days-a-week mail service and collection and to protect the post office counter services.  Two years later, critically important decisions have been made.  An Post has been stabilised, because of the action that has been taken, and is now one of the few mail services in the world that is expanding its service, from a five-days-a week letter service to a six-days-a-week parcel service.  The fabric of services An Post delivers has been strengthened.  The company is changing from a 19th century model to one that has relevance and can have resonance in the 21st century in rural and in urban areas.  In fact, the current postmasters' contract dates back to 1907 and we all can accept that things have changed dramatically since then.<\/p><p> Today, the future is not as bleak for An Post but underlying challenges remain.  Mail volumes continue to decline.  E-substitution and the move to online payments and online banking continue to have an impact on the post office network.  Standing still is not an option.  If, politically, we tread water or if we shirk decision-making, we will not have a stronger post office network; we will have a weaker one and, potentially, ultimately we will have no post office network at all.<\/p><p> I believe in An Post as a public company delivering a public service.  That is why I am determined to embrace change, because change is required to deliver for post offices and a postal service for the future.  Change is especially required in rural areas.  There is widespread acceptance that the post office network requires modernisation to build, maintain and protect a service that meets the needs of communities across the country today and into the future.  Investment of &euro;50 million in the network, equivalent to &euro;45,000 per post office, is based on getting communities to use the enhanced services that their local post office will provide through a modernised network.<\/p><p> As part of its strategic plan, An Post announced a renewed vision for the post office network, which centres on the availability of new services in a modernised, revitalised network.  Such services must include a better range of Government services, financial services and e-commerce services for shoppers and small businesses.  I was one of only a handful of Deputies to make a submission to the Kerr report because I was determined to see new innovative services coming into the post office network.  I argued strongly for the need to channel more Government services to the An Post network.  I am pleased to say that earlier today, I got a decision from the Government to look at an offline avenue for all Government online services.  We expect to come back to the Government with decisions on that quite soon.<\/p><p> Since taking office I have been driving the offline avenue with my officials, my Cabinet colleagues, the management team in An Post, the Office of Government Procurement and other agencies.  Government funding of &euro;80,000 has been allocated to roll out the digital assist programme.  By means of the digital assist programme, ten post offices are being equipped to become digital hubs to help citizens navigate online Government services and other online goods and services.  The intention is to expand the number from the initial pilot scheme.<\/p><p> There is already a rapid expansion of banking services in the post office network.  One can now get US, Canadian and Australian dollars and sterling cash and currency cards without having to order them in advance.  Post offices will make credit card services available in addition to the An Post smart current account.  Personal loans will be provided as well as loans to small businesses.  An Post has committed to investing &euro;50 million to grow and modernise the post office network.<\/p><p> Essential to delivering on a renewed vision for the post office network is the agreement reached with the Irish Postmasters Union, IPU.  This agreement followed months of intensive negotiations which were overseen by Turlough O'Donnell SC, at my invitation.  I take this opportunity to once again thank him for his work, time and commitment to this process.<\/p><p> In its negotiations with An Post, postmasters and postmistresses sought both the modernisation of the network and a voluntary redundancy package for those who wanted to leave the business.  It is important that the decision of those who wish to leave the business is respected.  They are not decisions that have been taken lightly or without good reason.  There are a number of reasons that postmasters are availing of the offer, including age and low population levels, as well as the fact that some postmasters were not even earning the minimum wage as a result of declining transaction levels and mail volumes.  I must repeat - the decision on whether to accept the package was one for individual postmasters.  All closures have been on a voluntary basis and Ned O'Hara of the IPU has publicly confirmed that.  No one was forced to take the package.  It is important to state that any retailer in the locations of the 159 post offices can apply to An Post to be considered to take over some or all of the services of the closing post office.<\/p><p> The reality is that by facilitating those who wish to exit the business, neighbouring offices will be further supported, thereby ensuring a sustainable network for the future.  Where a post office closes, 70% of the business transfers to a neighbouring office.  This agreement removes a level of uncertainty that has existed as a result of the piecemeal approach associated with closures of post offices for the past 30 years.  The IPU has publicly acknowledged that.  An Post has given a pledge to retain a post office network right across the country.  However, we must be cognisant of the declining transactions in recent years that reflect the reality of the world we live in today.  We must equip post offices with a range of services that will attract and retain footfall, but those measures are meaningless unless the public use the service the post office provides.  Key to the survival of a renewed network is the willingness of us all of us to use post offices.  Last week at a public meeting in Athleague I spoke about Imelda Burke.  She is the postmistress of Ahascragh post office.  Some 18 months ago she sent out 1,000 letters to her community asking them to please use her services.  On foot of her initiative she received three positive replies.  Last Friday she sent out another 800 letters, again pleading with her community to use her services.<\/p><p> I am aware of the suggestion from various quarters that some form of public service obligation, PSO, levy or State subsidy should be provided to maintain the post office network in its current form.  It is long-standing policy that postal services will not be directly subsidised by the Government.  Successive Governments have held such a view.  An Post is a commercial semi-State body with a mandate to deliver postal services and a viable post office network.  Aside from state aid rules and other competition-related issues, it is likely that a subsidy to retain those offices in which postmasters have opted to take the package - in most instances because the business is no longer viable - could have a negative impact on the remaining offices.  They would lose the opportunity to enhance their existing businesses and such a move could jeopardise the long-term sustainability of the entire network.<\/p><p> While much has been achieved in An Post over the past two years, there must be a clear focus on continued delivery for the future.  That is critical to ensuring the long-term success of the national postal operator and a sustainable post office network to serve future generations.<\/p><p>After years of drift, there is now a clear direction for An Post.  Innovation and change are being embraced and new services to meet new needs of the future are being developed.  Politically, our responsibility, and the responsibility I take as Minister, is to lead that change, to strengthen An Post as a public company delivering a public service and to support the decisions required to translate that aspiration into effective action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#H00600","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1536066000,"counter":182,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee.  I will raise a few points from my written submission.  To be clear about how we in An Post view the post office network, it is a vital public service and our priority is a sustainable social commitment.  We want to provide the best range of services to every community throughout the country.  This is why we established a separate business to have full control over the network and it is why we are committed to 960 post offices, which is the best rural network of any postal service we know.  New Zealand is frequently cited as best practice for rural areas.  It has an identical population with a much greater landmass and it has 881 post offices against our 960 after the consolidation.  We define our social commitment as being to every community of 500 people, which is why we are opening five new offices.  Our social commitment is not just words.<\/p> <p>  Post offices are individual businesses owned by local postmasters and postmistresses.  This is one of the oldest franchise models in the world.  For post offices to succeed they need customers and products.  A post office is meaningless without both.  It can have all the products in the world but if Arnotts opens in an area with no customers it will not work.  The consolidation and reconfiguration of the network, which we have just announced, was not a decision made randomly.  Rather, it was part of a professional plan developed over the past year with world-class professional advice, local knowledge from the nationwide An Post team, the best data through An Post and consultation.  Most importantly, the four-month-long mediation process, to which the Minister referred, between An Post and the IPU was about a comprehensive strategy to ensure we have a post office network long into the future, to meet our social commitment and our need for sustainability.  The outcome of this is an extraordinary breakthrough plan and a strategy for the future of the network backed by a collaborative commitment to deliver this vital service to communities.  Any attempt to unravel the plan would have the most serious consequences.<\/p> <p>  I want to highlight what a large and successful business and service the post office network is, contrary to much of the coverage.  Every week, 1.7 million citizens use a post office.  An Post has collected more than &euro;20 billion in State savings delivered to the State.  It has the largest foreign exchange business in the country.  The new An Post current-account is winning more new customers than any comparable account.  AddressPal, the new online service, has signed up more than 200,000 customers who pick up parcels from their local post office.  Even after reported closures, no other network in this country will come close in size to An Post's 960 post offices.  We can compare this to 564 Garda stations, 330 libraries and, commercially, 460 Spar shops and 480 Centra shops.  In addition, we have 1,600 PostPoint outlets, which provide an expanding range of An Post services without the costs for the retailer of having to have a full post office counter.  Soon, we will develop this service into an An Post partner model that will expand the services available and will be able to be applied for by any local shop.  We also have the post and pay service, which can be applied for by any shop and which makes e-commerce available everywhere.<\/p> <p>  The closures are not primarily about An Post's business but they are about the viability of individual post offices as individual businesses and services.  The Minister referred to An Post's transformation from a point where it was virtually insolvent 18 months ago.  PWC and McKinsey noted we would lose &euro;180 million within five years if we did not take action.  We have had to go out and find &euro;200 million profit.  Within approximately 15 months from that date, we have more than &euro;100 million.  This is about us getting to a position of sustainability and breaking even.  We have done this through the steps the Minister noted: mainly through the price increase, a heavy cost-restructuring programme, better international contracts and a rapidly growing parcels business.  We continue to take action to strengthen the company.  Recently, we announced we will downsize our headquarters so we can put more money into our front line.   Because of this rapidly improving performance we can address the issues in the post office from a position of strength, which is how we can invest more than &euro;50 million in the network.<\/p> <p>  The renewal programme for the post office service is a comprehensive and detailed plan to build a great service.  We established a distinct company in 2018, headed by Ms Debbie Byrne as the managing director.  This means that for the first time the post office network has end to end responsibility for everything from marketing to product to finance and its own balance sheets, so it can operate in a much more agile and faster way to deliver services.  It also includes our post insurance subsidiary, which provides a strong financial and regulatory infrastructure.  That business has been put together only in the past five months and it will give us the engine to deliver the services.  I have mentioned PostPoint and BillPay, which are also part of the network.  The network is being taken more seriously than at any time in its recent history.<\/p> <p>  The closures are an essential step to consolidate the network so it can provide these services.  Where there are three post offices in a community that has only enough people to sustain two then closing one post office makes the other two viable.  If we keep all three offices open, all three will be unviable.  This is what consolidation is about and it works.  What will not work is subsidising the closing post offices because keeping them open will kill the other offices nearby.  The offices we are closing account for 3.7% of all customers, therefore 96.3% of customers will be unaffected.  They will have better post office services as the network consolidates.  The 3.7% will also have better services but they may have to travel up to 7 km further on average.<\/p> <p>  Our commitment to rural coverage is the best we know of any postal service.  Every community of more than 500 people will an office, which is why we announced the five new offices.  One figure mentioned is the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection's commitment to 95% of people being within 15 km of a post office.  Ours is much higher.  We believe that 70% of the population have five post offices within 15 km and at least 95% of the population is within 7 km of a post office.<\/p> <p>  Consolidation is just one part of the strategy to create the best post office service in any developed country, with the most outlets, best opening hours, most useful locations and widest range of services.  We are extending in a number of areas.  Financial services are being extended as we speak.  The new An Post current account has been rolled out to every post office, as have foreign exchange services.  We expect to have credit cards and small loans available in 2019.  We are exploring opportunities in the mortgage and pensions markets and we have a particular focus on developing financial services tailored for SMEs, particularly smaller or solo SMEs.  For the first time, we will launch a specialist SME package.  We have approximately four times as many offices as the major banks and we fully intend to provide a full range of financial services in each community.  As I noted earlier, we have collected &euro;20.5 billion from 1.2 million customers in post office savings that we have delivered to the State.  We have had 5 million transactions amounting to &euro;1.5 billion over the past year in agency banking, and we have foreign exchange transactions of &euro;300 million a year.  That is a big service, which we are pushing hard.<\/p> <p>  The e-commerce strategy aims to provide Irish citizens with access to products equivalent to access in any major city in the world.  The product I mentioned earlier that we make available to people is a product that every post office service is trying to buy from us.  It is the best technology.  It means wherever people are in Ireland they have access to the same goods and products as in the US, UK and any major city in the world.  We are making this available and we will ensure it can be picked up from more locations through post offices and local shops.<\/p><p> Finally, An Post is committed to being the one-stop shop for Government services.  I am very grateful to the Minister for his support.  He has been very strong in pushing us to provide more services.  We have been strong in pushing him to ask his colleagues in the Cabinet to provide more services.  It is absolutely vital.  It drives me nuts to think that driving licences are not available in post offices.  I have spent a week defending the fact that people have to travel 7 km farther to post offices when, in many instances, it is necessary for a person to travel 100 km in order to get a driving licence.  All those services should be made available through post offices.  An Post does a very good job and the postmasters and postmistresses do a very good job.  We look forward to having a much better, modernised network for the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David McRedmond","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1536066000,"counter":184,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McRedmond.

Is An Post approaching businesses within communities?  Is it waiting for communities to approach it?  I am sure some of my colleagues have received correspondence about this matter.  In that context, I am aware, for example, that a number of businesses in Gurteen, County Sligo, are interested in taking over the post office network there, which deals with 1,100 transactions per week.  They are going to contact An Post.  What has been the level of engagement?  There is a narrative to the effect that some businesses are not being communicated with or are being told that there is no interest there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#L00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1536066000,"counter":185,"content":"<p>In terms of the breakdown relating to the 159 post offices, technically, these postmasters and postmistresses are ending their contracts.  What is involved, therefore, is an exit contract payment, not a retirement.  There are a number of different reasons involved.  An Post did not ask for reasons.  Rather, it identified the approximately 350 post offices in respect of which this package was offered.  Those post offices were identified on the basis of their being able to serve the needs of communities and where it would be possible for people to exit.  On that basis, people have exited for their own reasons.  An Post has very detailed information on each of those post offices as to the number of transactions involved and the number of social welfare clients who use their services.  The company has a very clear plan for dealing with these.<\/p> <p>  As to engagement with local businesses, in the first instance, An Post ran a consultation on the plan in late April and throughout May when the deal with the IPU was announced.  That consultation was made widely available.  There was a relatively low take-up, as is often the case with consultations, and more engagement was required.  In the context of the latter, An Post has put in place a protocol and an appeals body.  There are two appeals adjudicators who are independent, experienced and recognised experts.  Any local business can appeal and say it wishes to have a post office and will be assessed against that criterion.  There was one post office in Sligo whereby an appeal was made not by the business but by the community.  In that instance, it was very close to the cut-off population number of 500.  The adjudicator did not say that An Post was wrong but asked if it would reconsider because the size of the community was so close to the cut-off.  An Post did reconsider it and the post office was kept open.  An Post is certainly open to listening to the adjudicators.  That is the process by which businesses can engage.  We have to be careful because there are 159 post offices involved and many communities will be affected.  We have to be fair to each of them.  An Post does not want to prejudice the outcome of any one of those appeals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David McRedmond"},{"type":"speech","time":1536066000,"counter":186,"content":"<p>Am I correct in stating that An Post makes the final decision as to whether a business will be allowed to take on the postal service, particularly as this may impact on neighbouring post offices in that area?

There are two elements.  The first is to ensure that, as a business, the post office can be sustainable.  The starting assumption is that it would not be sustainable to have a full post office in the vast number of those places.  That is the reason people take the package.  The Minister was right in talking about the very low amounts being earned by those postmasters and then having costs associated with operating a full post office.  In simple terms, it would, by and large, be true that they are not sustainable.  The protocol tests the sustainability of post offices in those areas and, in most instances, it will agree that they are not sustainable.  However, there is the chance that a post office might be sustainable and that is one reason for appealing.  If the adjudicator has a strong view and says that a post office should be licensed in a particular area, then An Post will, of course, do so.<\/p> <p>  Another opportunity that would probably be more attractive to retailers involves having PostPoint extended into the An Post partner model whereby retailers could offer a broader range of services.  It would not be the full range of services but it would be most of them.  The exception would be the services relating to social welfare.  It could be possible for retailers to take those up without having to have dedicated staff and dedicated counters that give rise to the costs that make it unsustainable to have post offices in particular areas.<\/p> <p>  Businesses can also apply for Post and Pay, which would mean that they could do parcel drop-offs for particular areas.  This could be integrated into An Post's mails and parcels network.  We fully intend having the best availability of e-commerce throughout the country.  It is not the case that there are no services available.  It comes down to a net point regarding social welfare payments.  In that case, the other potential solution is that the money could be paid into An Post's smart current account.  That account comes with a debit card that can be used in local shops.  There are some other opportunities to cover that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. David McRedmond"},{"type":"speech","time":1536066000,"counter":188,"content":"<p>A local business person is well able to make a business decision as to whether it will be viable for him or her to incorporate the postal service into his or her existing business.

As Mr. McRedmond said, the consultation process was not taken up by many but, now that the matter is being reported by the media, there will be far more interest.

I thank Mr. McRedmond, who set out what this is about, namely, restructuring An Post.  It is a commercial, semi-State company and that is its mandate.  Mr. McRedmond has to look at viability in terms of profit and loss.  He has a responsibility to the shareholders and the board of directors to exercise his fiduciary duty, and he has done that.<\/p> <p>  The Minister's responsibility is different and the third or fourth paragraph of his opening statement tells its own tale.  He said that when he came to office \"the future for An Post and the post office network was uncertain and extremely bleak\" and that \"The potential for a complete shutdown of postal services with the loss of thousands of jobs was undeniable.  Immediate action was needed.\"  The reality is that the Minister was spooked by An Post and the officials in his Department.  It is one of the oldest tricks in the book: paint the worst possible picture, spook the Minister and frighten him into believing the world is about to fall in.  If the Minister falls for it, the officials have a result.  They have done that.  The Minister clearly did not challenge them or look at alternatives.  He went into crisis mode.  This was his big moment - he was going to save the post offices.  He lost sight of the communities - the small communities that he and I represent.  I will not go through all 159 of the post offices but will use my own county as an example.  Post offices will close in Lissycasey, Cree, Cooraclare, Doonbeg, Fanore and Kilfenora.  They are all viable villages with post offices that do not fit Mr. McRedmond's model for viability.<\/p><p>If we were to introduce a PSO levy, do we give the same amount to the post office that has taken the package where there are 12 transactions a week and should it be considered the same as the post office that has 700 transactions a week?  The Minister has a responsibility to develop a model of postal services in those villages that meet the needs of that community.  Somebody has to pay.  Mr. McRedmond says it will not be An Post; it does not fit his model.  I suggest to the Minister that the PSO model with subvention from the State is a way to do it.  The PBFI earlier identified other methods for doing it and maybe that can happen over time.<\/p><p> The Minister knows this will have a devastating impact on the lives of elderly and vulnerable people in the 159 villages identified.  While Mr. McRedmond might talk about the distance people have to go to tax their cars, 12 km or 14 km for somebody who is elderly or vulnerable and does not have access to a car and certainly does not have access to public transport is an intolerable burden.  I challenge him on the transfer of the services.  All the new services can be created and there can be sterling, the dollar, yen and bitcoin, if it is wanted, but they will not save the post offices in Lissycasey, Cree, Cooraclare, Doonbeg, Fanore, and Kilfenora.  Retention of the basic service is needed in those post offices, which includes social welfare payments.<\/p><p> There is a postal agency service available in some areas where there used to be a post office contract and it makes social welfare payments.  If the Minister had not got into panic mode when the sky was about to fall, he could have gone back to Mr. McRedmond and asked what would be the cost of retaining a basic service in these areas, be it in the 159 post offices to be closed, or more if they opted for it, including social welfare, under the post office agency model in a local shop or supermarket.  In the areas I mention in Clare - and the same is true for places dotted all over the country - there are people clamouring to take the service.  They are not looking for the same money.  They do not want the same burden of investment in the way of concrete roofs and caves where they have to store vast sums.  There is not much money required because the activity levels have reduced.  I urge the Minister to go back and consider that model as a way of saving the service.<\/p><p> There is a slight variation between the notes we received in advance of the meeting and what the Minister said.  He said that \"some or all\" of the business can transfer to another facility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#L00800","speaker":"1274","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1536066000,"counter":192,"content":"<p>This is important because it gets to the nub of the matter.

I was shocked by the figures presented to me at the end of October 2016 because I had been presented with a different set of figures shortly before then.  As a result, I asked New Economy and Recovery Authority, NewERA, which is part of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, and which was established to advise Ministers on the operation of semi-State companies, to go through the books.  I deferred making any decision until I had received a detailed report from NewERA and there was engagement with the authority on various figures.  I wanted to make sure I had an accurate reflection of what was going on in the company because the last thing I needed was to be put into a position where this was thrown at me to make a quick decision.  We did not do that.  We went through all those figures rigorously and had them independently assessed by NewERA.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is correct that no single service will maintain the post office network.  The NTMA service in respect of State savings and the social welfare contract are the two big financial drivers of the post office network but they alone will not maintain post offices.  We and the management team in An Post are considering bringing in new services.  Footfall and transaction numbers in the post office have increased through a range of new services and, as a result, there is a sustainable network into the future.<\/p> <p>  In response to the question about the An Post agency, that is effectively what is happening with PostPoint.  An Post is studying how it can develop the franchise to expand into other services that it has not offered up to now.  That may also be in respect of social welfare services or payments.  There is also the opportunity through the An Post smart account for people to use the card in a local Centra, SuperValu or Spar to make their purchases and get cash back.

Mr. McRedmond has given an example of one area where An Post has decided to advertise again for a postmaster.  That will be an independent review and every community that wants to can make a submission.  <\/p> <p>  There is also an opportunity for retailers in that community to make an offer to An Post to take on enhanced PostPoint service, as Mr. McRedmond said, or to have the post office in their retail business.  This is an individual decision for retailers and they may or may not want to do that for one reason or another.  I do not think, any more than postmasters being forced to take a redundancy package, that retailers should be forced to take on something that may not suit their business model.  There are several options open to them if they want to take on some or all of that business.  <\/p> <p>  The PSO has been kicked around for many years, long before I came into this Department.

I do not question their commitment to resolving the problems of An Post.  I represent the constituency of Tipperary and like every other county we have taken more than our share of closures with the closure of eight post offices in Ballingarry, Clogheen, Coolbawn, Gurtnahoe, Littleton, Newcastle, Templetuohy and Upperchurch.  The word \"voluntary\" has been much used and emphasised but effectively the real position is that the postmasters union has been put into a corner and the postmasters and postmistresses saw this as the only opportunity they had to exit the system.  There was a veiled threat that if they did not take the package then their contracts would not be renewed.  That is the way it is being perceived in rural Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Mr. McRedmond talked about a protocol, as well as procedures and an appeal process.  I do not understand.  Could he explain what the protocol and procedure was in respect of the closures - was it simply because a postmaster requested it?  The post office in Littleton, County Tipperary, for example, was closed.  Mr. McRedmond said the criterion is that we should have a post office for every area of population over 500.  Littleton is down for closure and yet according to the census it has a population of 1,200 people.  What process came to the conclusion that Littleton should be closed?  The same goes for many of the post offices that have been closed in County Tipperary.  Who adjudicates on the appeal process and determines whether a post office should be closed if an appeal is lodged?<\/p> <p>  Mr. McRedmond also used the word \"consolidation\".  What has happened in these efforts to consolidate is what most agencies in Ireland have done in recent times - rationalisation and centralisation.  This has meant that rural Ireland has suffered because of those decisions.  We need to remember again that post offices are an essential part of the fabric of rural Ireland.  They are a focal point and a community hub and have a beneficial binding influence on local communities.  When these decisions are made to take services from local communities, as usual, it is the older people, the poorer people and those who depend on the State for a living who, because they do not have a bus service or public service transport, have to pay for a taxi to go to the nearest post office to do their business.  That may be 15 km away.  In Tipperary, the closures in these villages and parishes have been greeted first with dismay and that has been followed by anger, resentment and public protest.  The general consensus in rural areas is people feel they have been abandoned by the Government.<\/p> <p>  I also want to be reasonable and fair in my comments.  The crisis in An Post has not just dropped out of the sky.  It has developed for at least 15 years.  We have been cautioned and warned about it but several political Administrations have proceeded to show political neglect and not invest in the system.  That is why we are where we are at the moment.  Over the past 15 years, we have also had exhaustive assessments, analyses, reports and recommendations but nothing was actually done.  The one conclusion and common thread in every report written was that the post office network, as it presently functions, was not sustainable in the long term because it was non-violable.  It needed to be remodelled.  I accept that Mr. McRedmond has shown great initiative and that he is doing his best to expand the range of An Post services.  It is welcome, as the Minister mentioned, that this has been discussed at Government level this morning and that online services will have the support of the Government.  The Government must, however, empower the post offices to broaden the range of activity to increase revenue.  Post offices must also be allowed to diversify into the financial services sector and into community banking in particular.  Before Mr. McRedmond came in we heard good, logical and common sense reasons why community banking should be part of An Post in future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#N00900","speaker":"1240"},{"type":"speech","time":1536066000,"counter":205,"content":"<p>Did Deputy Lowry have a specific question or does Mr. McRedmond-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#N01000","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1536066000,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I cannot answer a question about a specific post office-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#N01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. David McRedmond"},{"type":"speech","time":1536066000,"counter":207,"content":"<p>That is fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#N01200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1536066000,"counter":208,"content":"<p>-----because I do not want to prejudice the appeals process.  The adjudicators are Mr. Paddy McGuinness and Mr. Tom Hobson who are both highly recognised in this field of doing these sorts of adjudications.  The protocol is published and available on the An Post website.  I do not know if there is a second post office in Littleton if there are 1,200 people there but I should not go into the particular case.  We are keeping 100 post offices open where the population is under 500 because of the distance requirements and making sure they are available.  As the criteria are complex, there could be a number of different reasons but it is worth taking a look at the appeals process and seeing if there is a possibility with it.  I will point out that it is not fair to say that we have abandoned rural Ireland.  After the consolidation there will be 35 post offices in Tipperary and that is considerable coverage compared with that in many other countries.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Lowry also mentioned two other things.  On not implementing reports, I went through the Bobby Kerr report and, even though I disagree with some of the things in it, I discovered that we had implemented 17.5 of the 19 recommendations for An Post in that report - I said it was 18 earlier.  We have taken action.  I respect that Deputy Lowry has raised these issues before and we have gone back, looked at them and implemented.  In respect of community banking, I do not believe there is anything in community banking that An Post is either not doing or not planning to do in the short term.  I believe we are going to make the full range of services available.  We are not likely to go for a banking licence but with the changes in banking regulation that is no longer a requirement to provide the services.  It is indeed much better because services can be provided more quickly.  I believe we can leapfrog many of the services of the traditional banks and that we can have an even better range of services.  I completely share Deputy Lowry's ambition for financial services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#N01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David McRedmond"},{"type":"speech","time":1536066000,"counter":209,"content":"<p>I am going to bring in Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith.

I have a question for the Minister.  In the past few years I watched closely a game of pass the parcel, pardon the pun, in the relationship between what is going on here and what went on in the D&aacute;il between the Minister, Deputy Naughten, the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring and the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys.  No one wanted to take responsibility for what we were watching unfold in front of us, namely, the collapse of the post office sector.  I believe this is the beginning of something much bigger and not the end of it.<\/p><p>Will the Minister take responsibility for the outcome of the closure of the 159 post offices and any future closures?  There have almost been scraps between himself and the Ministers for Rural and Community Development and Business, Enterprise and Innovation on the floor of the D&aacute;il with each refusing to take responsibility for the issue and saying it was somebody else's responsibility.  It now seems that the Minister and Mr. McRedmond are saying the responsibility for the closure of these 159 post offices is that of the postmasters and postmistresses themselves and that they have made that choice.  I do not accept that for a minute.  In the style of the Mafia, they were made an offer that they could not refuse because they were not being offered an alternative or viable contract.  Will the Minister and Mr. McRedmond comment on how it came about that 159 people who had resisted the closure of their local post office, having looked after their communities informally but in a close and caring way, would suddenly decide that they would close?  There must be something behind it.<\/p><p> If in 2019, An Post loses the tender for social welfare, will the remaining post offices have the volume of business required to remain viable?  After two and a half years, regardless of the social welfare payments, how will the Minster and An Post decide whether the volume of business and the footfall is good enough?  This process will be incremental, with more and more closures because the footfall will not be good enough.  I use my local post office in Ballyfermot frequently.  The main footfall relates to the collection of children's allowance, pensions and other social welfare payments and the payments of bills as people collect them.  If An Post loses that tender, hundreds of post offices will close in the Ballyfermots of Dublin, Limerick, Cork and so on, where the main source of footfall is social welfare payments.  <\/p><p> I have a question relating to something which was discussed during the previous session when the Minister and Mr. McRedmond were not present.  Is either of them interested in a model such as Sparkasse or Kiwi, a public banking model that could make a return to the community?  How do they feel about the report which the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform issued in July in which he said that the Government would not pay out &euro;170 million to fund a public bank, when it had no problem paying out &euro;69 billion to bail out Anglo Irish Bank, AIB and so on.  I cannot stay for their replies but I will watch back and hope that they will reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#N01500","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1536066000,"counter":212,"content":"<p>The Minister is welcome.  I am glad to have this opportunity where hopefully we can clarify some issues.  In my local parish of Aughavas, the post office is closing because the postmistress is retiring, which she is entitled to do.  However, it should not be the case that if a person in rural Ireland retires that the service should be retired, which is what it means for many people.  Often when someone goes sick or on maternity leave, the service goes sick or on maternity leave.  That is our experience everywhere.  On my way to Dublin today, I heard the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy Halligan, speaking about school bus services.  The same issue applies here. Services are being withdrawn from people living in  rural Ireland.  Similarly, the home help service is being withdrawn all over the country by the HSE.  Most Ministers whom I deal with personally say they are doing their best but when they get together around the Cabinet table, it seems a corrupt political system is in place.  It is destroying the country and the problem is particularly acute in rural areas and areas where people most need services.  It is a corrupt political system which the Government inherited from Fianna F&aacute;il, a party that closed hundreds of post offices, and started this rot which has continued all the while. <\/p> <p>  People talk about whether services are viable or not.  Is the health service viable or sustainable?  Are people eligible or are they concessionary when it comes to them being allowed to live and be active citizens in their own communities?  These are the questions that are being put to us.  Is that the kind of Ireland we want?  Do we want an Ireland where people must make choices like that, or where, if they live in a particular part of the country and they do not have access to services?  That is not the kind of Ireland in which I want to live and nor do the vast majority of decent, ordinary people.  They want to live in an Ireland where the Government delivers services to them and stands up for them.  This Government is not standing up for people.<\/p> <p>  Last week, I attended a meeting of a couple of hundred people in Killeshandra, a decent sized town, where the post office will be closed because the postmistress is retiring.  She is entitled to do so but does that mean that the post office has to close?  I have been told that it does, and that that is just tough luck because it is not viable.  I am sorry but it is viable.  People's lives are viable and they matter.  Somebody needs to say that enough is enough and this must stop.  We are told that we do not have the money and that we cannot continue down this road.  We had the money to support the banks to the tune of billions of euro, and the Government continues to support them as they make massive profits but it will not even tax them.  What is wrong at Cabinet that Ministers can do this?  Why are they victimising ordinary decent people throughout this country?  What is wrong with them?  <\/p> <p>  I have discussed post office closures with the Minister.  There are instances in my own area such as Gurteen, which the Chairman mentioned, and many others which are closing because the postmaster or postmistress is retiring.  We have been told that there will be a review process which may re-examine them, particularly if there are other businesses that might make the post office viable.  The Minister is aware of the post office in my parish where there is also a pub and a shop, and we have spoken about this.  He has said if there is another business that makes the post office viable, it has a good chance of being awarded the contract but the contract may not be as good as previously.  That is what I had been led to believe but that does not seem to be the case.<\/p> <p>  There is a question about the way by which the minimum service levels will be examined.  An Post says, \"In rural Ireland we will endeavour to ensure that all settlements with over 500 people will have a Post Office\".  Where does it draw the line on 500 people?  Is it within 5 km of the post office, which is what I understood, or is it within 1 km?  That issue needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  Clearly, the problem is that it is the intention of Mr. McRedmond and An Post to close these post offices and they do not care.  The Minister needs to care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#O00300","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1536066000,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I will ask the Minister and Mr. McRedmond to respond in a moment.

There has been an expansion of postal services in the past two years since my appointment as Minister.  An Post vans can now be seen in rural communities on Saturdays, which never happened before other than at Christmas.  That is because An Post now provides a parcel service to every townland in rural Ireland six days a week.  There has been an expansion of foreign exchange service in post offices to include cash, which does not have to be pre-ordered but can be collected by customers walking in to post offices.  Over the next six to eight months, there will be a significant expansion in the financial services that An Post will offer in every post office.  That will be new business coming into the post offices.   There will be an expansion of services relating to personal and small business loans and a credit card facility which will not only provide services that may have traditionally been available in the community through banks which have withdrawn them or that may never have been available in that community.  These new services are going into rural Ireland and will support existing businesses, the development of new businesses in those communities and meet the needs of today, tomorrow and the days after.  People are looking back at what the post office provided 20, 30 or 40 years ago, but we are looking at what the post office will provide in five, ten or 15 years and we need to plan for it now.  I have taken the difficult decision.<\/p><p>I could have taken the easy decision, as my predecessors did, sat on my hands, ignored the issue, and allowed post office after post office to close and watched hundreds of post offices close, but I will not be disingenuous in this regard.  I spent long enough arguing that we should develop new innovative services in the post offices.  We are seeing that in the case of financial services currently and we will hopefully see it in the case of government services on foot of the decisions that we have made.  One in seven people in Ireland has never used the Internet.  With the digital assist programme, they will have an opportunity to benefit from the services on the Internet.  For example, using my hat as Minister for energy, consumers can save between &euro;200 and &euro;300 each by using either <i>bonkers.ie<\/i>or <i>Switcher.ie<\/i>to move their electricity account from one operator to another.  If they have not access to the Internet or cannot use the technology, they cannot avail of that currently.  Through the digital assist programme, they will be able to avail of that through their local post office.  This is an example of practical services that are going into the post offices today or that will go in next month and the months after that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#O00700","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1536066000,"counter":216,"content":"<p>Will they be in Killeshandra that fast?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#P00200","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1536066000,"counter":217,"content":"<p>Regarding Killeshandra-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#P00300","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1536066000,"counter":218,"content":"<p>They will not, because they are gone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#P00400","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1536066000,"counter":219,"content":"<p>Regarding Killeshandra and Littleton post offices, which have been mentioned, there is a review mechanism.

The independent appeals body will also review the decision by An Post on what services will be provided by or offered to the new retailer.<\/p> <p>  In response to Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's question regarding passing the parcel, I was disappointed that responsibility for the operation of the post office service in this country was split between two Departments.  It was not my preference.  I was happy to take that back and have responsibility for both the financial operation of An Post and the post offices.

The third measure which was sought is in the programme for Government, which was to consider the provision of new services by post offices.

I have three questions in three areas where we could look to expand the business and create that new development model.<\/p> <p>  First, Mr. McRedmond stated towards the end of his opening contribution that An Post was looking for additional government services to generate footfall.  He cited driver licence applications as one example.  Can he give other examples of government services?  How long has An Post been looking for those?  The Minister might want to contribute as well.  What is the likelihood of such services coming online or of them becoming part of the new business model that An Post wants to develop?  Will the Minister give as much detail as possible on those government services?  I heard Mr. McRedmond state he has the harp over the door and wants all the harp services there.  Specifically, I want to know what they are.<\/p> <p>  The 7 km range is still a hell of a distance, if one has got to walk or cycle.  I welcome the six day postal-van service.  Would Mr. McRedmond agree there is a possibility if An Post's parcel business is expanding, for the development of a business model where that van route is visible online and an application could be developed for those within the rural community so that it would not only be a postal parcel van but could also be a people van.  With the new app-sharing and other devices, one would have a new public transport system that serves the rural community.  Because one knows the route, one would know where the van is and when it is coming, and one could opt in to getting a lift from that van.  It could well be a lift to the nearest post office which would also help bring business to it.  Let us be radical and revolutionary in rethinking how An Post delivers its parcel services so that it is a public transport service as well.  Would the Minister commit to that service?<\/p> <p>  I would very much welcome the potential expansion of An Post into lending but it does not have lending skills and expertise.  Mr. McRedmond stated earlier that An Post has everything it needs to go into that business but I do not agree.  An Post needs the likes of the Sparkasse banking model and it has to be community-based.  We need another banking service, other than the pillar banks.  Has the Minister supported the Minister for Rural and Community Development in Cabinet in seeking such a model?  Both Mr. McRedmond and Deputy Naughten stated that they want An Post to go into small business lending.  Where will An Post generate small business lending expertise if it does not bring in the likes of the Sparkasse model under which it could be developed?  That model has worked for 200 years in Germany and it is a proven small business lending model.  If An Post does not use that model, where will it get the small lending expertise?  Members have stated here that we have to put in capital.  I agree but we do not want to just flitter it away with on lending which is not based on smart business lending because rural Ireland needs such lending.  The &euro;20 billion on deposit should remain in rural Ireland which is what would happen under the Sparkasse model.<\/p> <p>  On those three examples of how we could provide a new rural business development, public transport and  government services, I would be keen to know what specifically are An Post's intentions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#P01300","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1536066000,"counter":227,"content":"<p>Regarding government services, I will merely list a few: car tax, M50 toll payments, Leap payments, the public services card and any digital ID.

Sometimes, we have not won the tenders.  We have certainly made great efforts to get some of the services but it has not been as organised as I would like.  That is why we have set up An Post Retail, the post office, as a separate business.  It used to be that the operators of that business ran the operations and the marketing and product went across the whole of An Post.  The post office is the smaller part of An Post, with the bigger part being the mails and parcels business.  The post office did not get enough of a look in.

That is a very positive development.  It is willing to engage with anyone in this area.  It is a bit disingenuous that people continue to ignore a very successful community banking model that we have in this country that has been developed and expanded all over the world.  That is the credit union model.  I cannot understand why we continually ignore a model that is here and has successfully worked.  How can we engage with the credit union movement to better develop and enhance that service?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#Q01000","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1536066000,"counter":238,"content":"<p>The last member of the committee before I move on to those in attendance is Deputy Lawless.

I know we are under pressure for time.  I welcome the Minister and Mr. McRedmond and thank them for their time.  I am trying to understand, since this broke in the past couple of weeks, the background and where this is going.  Community begins at home.  I have tried to look around my constituency to get a flavour of the view on the ground.  I spoke to people such as Betty Dolan in the Staplestown Road post office in north Kildare, which is closing.  Betty has served with distinction for 30 years.  I understand that people like that have paid that service to the State and to the post office and are entitled to their retirement.  Long may she enjoy it.  There are people such as Sean Fogarty in Ballymore Eustace, which is a great example of an innovative, dynamic, new type of post office.  Sean Fogarty has invested in a web caf&eacute;, in an Internet doctor and in all kinds of additional services over and beyond the post office, within the same building.  That office is going from strength to strength.  There are different models and one size does not fit all.  I understand that there are different parameters.  I am trying to be objective in weighing this up and have listened to the arguments made by the Minister, by Mr. McRedmond and by other commentators and stakeholders.  I have listened to the argument about footfall and the argument that some of the post offices do not have critical mass, and that there is maybe a case for rationalisation and consolidation.  I am taking that at face value.<\/p> <p>  I am trying to understand that but, in doing so, I looked at the wider context.  I thought about people in some of the areas served by rural post offices and thought that maybe, if they need a State service and there needs to be a State presence in the village or community, then maybe there is a local Garda station that a person can go to instead if that person needs a port of call to the State.  Then I realised that 139 Garda stations were closed by the Government in the last term.  Five were closed in my constituency of Kildare and west Wicklow.  That line is not open to them.<\/p> <p>  The argument that they can go online would be very sensible and progressive if it worked.  It would be a great alternative avenue for accessing post office services but we know that, out of three bidders for the national broadband plan, we have lost two and a half out of three bidders.  That scheme is at least five years out of date, with no sign of broadband access coming to rural areas any time soon.<\/p> <p>  We might take solace that they are receiving some infrastructure and that Leader funding is being invested into communities.  That might be a good news story but I checked the figures and the Leader programme is being cut by 40%, &euro;150 million.  That is a social infrastructural deficit.<\/p> <p>  We might think back to the traditional hub of the community being the rural general practitioner, GP.  I know Deputy Harty, who is here, is very knowledgeable in this area.  We might think that at least the local doctor is still there as a bastion of the community or a hub but then we find out that those have been consolidated into primary care centres.  The rural practitioner allowance has been taken away and stripped back.<\/p> <p>  When all is said and done, people can get into a car and drive 15 km to the new post office that is now serving the area.  I checked the report and the most recent audit of regional and local roads tells us that 70% of those roads have a structural deficit and the Minister, Deputy Ross, is not putting any more money into that any time soon.<\/p><p> With all that said, it really is more a question for the Minister than for Mr. McRedmond.  It is not a pretty picture for rural Ireland and it does not give solace.  Even though the arguments about the post offices can be made on an individual basis in their own right, when one considers the wider context of all the deterioration and denudation of rural Ireland, with rural services being stripped away one by one, one can understand why there was concern in those communities and why people are alarmed about this.<\/p><p> This is a very recent development but I saw on Twitter in the last hour that the Taoiseach has published a wish list for the renewal of the confidence and supply agreement.  The Government will be renewed for another two years if that happens.  There are nine headings and not one deals with rural development.  I do not know if the Minister has a view on that.  How does the Government propose to tackle the wider demise and decay of rural Ireland?  This is very much a part of that, so I think it is very relevant.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#Q01200","speaker":"1323","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1536066000,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I ask the Minister to try to keep his answers as brief as possible.

I want to move away from that.  Deputy Lawless makes a fair point.  Sean Fogarty in Ballymore Eustace has been looking at innovative ways to bring footfall into his post office and expand it.  His is one of the ten pilot areas where we are expanding this digital assist initiative to look at how we can provide online services to people who are offline or who have never used the Internet for one reason or another.  That is just one of those post offices where that has happened.  That will be expanded across the country.  We have been developing parcel services which allow businesses in the most isolated rural community to have exactly the same e-commerce services Dublin city centre.  As I said earlier, to the best of my knowledge - I am open to contradiction  - this is the only postal service in the word that is actually expanding its services at the moment.  It is expanding its services to the most isolated rural communities and bringing banking services into the local post office network.  These services have been withdrawn by other operators.  Yes, a critical mass is needed.  No one here can justify a situation where a post office that has 12 transactions a week is kept open.  That is not sustainable.  We all know examples of post offices which the local community bypasses, going instead to the next post office.  The community has voted with its feet.  We are trying to put a sustainable network in place.  This will still be the biggest retail network in the country by far.  I am now confident that this niche retail network is sustainable in the medium and long terms.

I left west Cork early this morning to speak at this committee and at the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which is discussing the fodder crisis.  There are two crises going on in west Cork at the moment.  As the Minister knows, the post office is the nucleus of any community.  There are now four communities in west Cork out of which the heart has been taken; Allihies, Ballineen, Desertserges and Drinagh.  There is also village in the eastern part of the constituency whose post office building is in another constituency, but people in Cork South-West are obviously affected.  There are, therefore, five such communities, and there are 12 in total in Cork.<\/p> <p>  I had the unique honour of working in the post office many moons ago.  To say it was an education in life would be putting it mildly.  It has always stood to me, and I have very happy memories from that time.  I have seen the importance of the post office to a community first-hand, both to the economy of the community and to its social well-being.  I would not for one minute sit here and ask the Minister to keep open post offices that are not viable because of their social aspect.  However, because of rural isolation, etc., the post office network is of huge importance.  When I was working on the counter in the post office, I did a course on how to deal with a customer.  We were told that we might be the only person that an older person would meet in a week, so it was vital to be nice to them.  Even this contact could stop.  People will stay at home, getting their pensions paid into the bank.  They may never leave their houses.  I am not trying to be dramatic, but it can come down to that.  <\/p> <p>  This Government made a commitment to rural life and to the post office network, and in my opinion it has failed on both commitments.  In fact, there was an active campaign by the Government to get people to have their social welfare payments paid into the bank instead of the post office.

He is correct; we need to thank them.  Nobody has been listening to them, however, for many years now.  I have been trying to listen to them, and I have been speaking to them one by one.  Many of them in rural Ireland are living on the minimum wage.  Does anyone realise that?  Does the Minister realise that?  Does Mr. McRedmond realise that?  They cannot survive and they are choked.  They were forced into taking this redundancy because many of them have served their community brilliantly down through the years but they know there have not been any new services drafted into their post offices down through the years.  The Government has failed to do that.  An Post has failed to help them to survive.  More of them are fearful of their future.<\/p> <p>  I live in a rural community and I know how rural Ireland is dying on its feet.  I have seen the closure of Garda stations and banks.  In my peninsula two banks were closed.  What was the first thing that happened?  The local supermarket was closed within 12 months, with the loss of 17 jobs in that community.  If the post office is taken away, the heart is being ripped out of the rural community.  That is what the Government and An Post are doing now.  They do not realise what they are doing.  There are four, nearly five, post offices in west Cork that are facing closure.<\/p> <p>  I ask Mr. McRedmond because I am getting slightly confused.  We heard that it was 15 km but we are hearing 7 km today.  Mr. McRedmond said earlier that people would not be left without a post office within 7 km.  Allihies post office is 10.9 km from Eyeries post office.  Obviously, in the rural part of Allihies, it could be 16 km or 17 km.  Mr. McRedmond is going from post office to post office, which is a nice way to get An Post off the hook.  That is 10.9 km.  Drinagh post office is 9.5 km from Drimoleague, but Drinagh is being closed, as is the plan.  Allihies is to go also.<\/p> <p>  Mr. McRedmond also said An Post would look at shutting one post office where there are three in order to save the other two.  If that is the case, are we talking about Desertserges and Ballineen?  They are both closing and only one will survive, which is Enniskeane.  I look at west Cork and it is being chewed up completely differently to the way that Mr. McRedmond describes.  These post offices are the lifeline in rural communities.  We need their very survival.  I ask Mr. McRedmond to look at Allihies, Ballineen and Drinagh and give that community the opportunities.  I attended the public meetings and there is severe anger because the people feel they have been deserted by the Government and An Post.  People need An Post to fight for them.  I ask the Minister to do the same.  I know he is a good, fighting Minister for the people of rural Ireland, but this is not the position they want to be in.  They are losing their post offices.  I know it because I come from that area myself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#S00700","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1536066000,"counter":272,"content":"<p>I call Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#S00800","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1536066000,"counter":273,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McRedmond and the Minister.

That is my opinion of it.<\/p><p>The Minister mentioned community banks, that he is interested in the community and that he will bring in community banking.  Will he explain under what auspices he will have this community banking?  The banking products, all of which I agree with, will be under the auspices of our existing pillar banks that I would not allow in my back door.  Will he use these pillar banks and their products?  If he will, as a conduit or an echo or a road into the post office, in what way will he change their profit margins?  Will he start from scratch and say, &quot;Well boys, come and work here and not in Ranelagh or Baggot Street&quot;?  If he is working under the auspices of the post offices, he is working to a different model here and he will answer a 1% or 2% for the new poor in Ireland.

We cannot use words like &quot;the closure of 159 post offices&quot; in the same breath as the word &quot;historical&quot;.  I would like to find out about the 231 that are left with collapsing incomes.  Will the Minister say what he will do about that?  The post office is a brilliant organisation but one must remember that it takes in a lot of money.  Some &euro;25 billion is on deposit.  I have my little &euro;5,000 there for a rainy day.  What are the post offices giving back to the community?  I know they are running a service but what are they actually giving back?  It is like the book <i>Move Fast and Break Things<\/i>, which talks about Amazon and Google, which make billions, but do they build social housing?  I do not think so.

As she knows, the investment and lodgements that are made with An Post are managed by the NTMA, and they are invested in capital projects around the country.<\/p> <p>  On the 230 post offices that have been unviable until now and remain part of the network, they are critical to the development of the new services we spoke about earlier such as banking and digital assist-type services, and providing an offline avenue for people who have not had that up to now.  They will see significant investment, as will the rest of the post office network across the country, which is critically important.<\/p> <p>  On the banking aspect, I do not want to go into the detail of it because I know it is part of discussions that are ongoing, but my understanding is it is not the pillar banks.  While An Post is providing agency services for some of those banks, namely, Danske Bank, Ulster Bank and AIB, what An Post is talking about is a new service.  Mr. McRedmond might talk in more detail about that.<\/p> <p>  As to the questions from Deputies Murphy O'Mahony and Collins, there is no doubt that post offices were the nucleus of the community in the past, but I do not believe that is the case today.  We have not seen new, innovative services coming into the post offices.  The generational change where we see younger people coming in and using the post offices has not happened.  We want to bring them back to being the nucleus of the community, but that can only be done by putting investment into the post office network, modernising it and making it meet the needs of today and tomorrow.<\/p><p>It should not just be older people using the post office but families and younger people, not just at Christmas to buy stamps and in the summer to renew a passport but on a weekly basis.  People should be using the post office for banking, e-commerce and online services such as are needed in respect of identity verification, for example.  There are real and genuine opportunities for the post office network and the company is determined to roll out those services. <\/p><p> Deputy Murphy O'Mahony gives the impression that broadband is not being rolled out at the moment but it is.  Communities across the country are getting it.  Is it happening as quickly as I would like?  Absolutely not.  I am determined to make sure we continue the momentum on the build-out of broadband infrastructure until every home and business in the community has access.  I am acting and have acted as Minister.  The Deputy will see new and additional services that we have been working on over the last months being rolled out in post offices.  I accept that my predecessors have talked the talk but failed to actually bring services into the post office network.  That is changing and the fruits of it will be seen as part of the modernisation that is taking place.<\/p><p> In reply to Deputy Michael Collins I would say the service has expanded.  We now have An Post vans in every village in rural Ireland on a Saturday, which was unheard of in the past, because we are expanding the parcel service.  I accept the point he and Deputy Murphy O'Mahony make in respect of post offices in west Cork.  That is why we have a review process that allows for those particular circumstances to be taken into account and for the other retailers in those communities to take on some or all of the services.  <\/p><p> I will hand over to Mr. McRedmond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#S01100","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1536066000,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I will start with the issues raised by Deputies Collins and Murphy O'Mahony.

I absolutely hear and accept what the Deputies are saying about west Cork and, as the Minister has said, there is an appeals process.  I cannot get into discussing the individual offices.<\/p> <p>  Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell has always been a great supporter of post offices.  In response to her question, the adjudicators are Paddy McGuinness and Tom Hobson.  Paddy McGuinness is ex-Western Development Commission and Tom Hobson is an adviser and consultant who has worked in many groups, including &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  They are upstanding people to be adjudicators.  They are experts and have been carefully selected, not to serve An Post but to get to the right answer and implement the protocol.<\/p> <p>  On the 231 post offices that did not take the package, they are the ones that will benefit most from consolidation from the post offices that are closing.  Not all of them will do so because it is spread geographically.  They will get additional business and that is the whole purpose, to extend their viability.  They are kept on their existing contract because if they switched to the new contract they would have less money as the number of transactions is very low.  They are better off on the existing contract.  They will get all the new services that go through.  We were talking about foreign exchange, for example.  That is extended into those offices which did not have it before.  There are opportunities for co-location, which is another part of the strategy.  If a post office shares its premises with a local Spar, Centra or whatever, that can bring a benefit in terms of footfall.  We have quite a detailed plan for how to do that.<\/p> <p>  In respect of financial services, we do agency banking.  We are agnostic about that.  If someone has an account with AIB it is useful but the financial services are driven through our own regulatory infrastructure, particularly through Post Insurance.  By the way, just last week we launched a whole extended range of life insurance products throughout the network.  We are launching travel insurance within the next week.  We are extending the services all the time.  The financial services we are looking at are services that could come from other operators.

My question is about closures in County Limerick.  There have been a number of public meetings over the last months.  There was a meeting in Athea a few days ago about an impending closure there.  This is one example of active participants who are looking to take up the post office in the area but we are being told it will probably close because the population is under 500 and the 15 km rule is coming in as well.  How was the figure of 500 decided?  Was it the specific census figures or was it the town boundary?  If we went slightly outside the town boundary or out to the speed limits, we could start picking up 500.  The population is on the brink of that figure.<\/p> <p>  Athea has been given money by the Government towards a sewerage scheme and development in the last year and a half.  The town is going to progress and there will be future development there.  That is very welcome and is on the back of the rise in the economy.  There is also good broadband access available in the town and further investment has come in for flood relief and so on.  There are all these services going in from the Government but An Post is pulling out.  Would it not make more commercial sense for An Post to start looking at towns on a broader scale than just population and distance?  It should look at all the other amenities, services and investments that are built around a town.  In two, four or five years' time, as the town progresses, An Post could make a commercial gain there, and there are active participants looking at taking up the licence.  We have been told it is probably not going to be re-advertised.  I need clarification from Mr. McRedmond on that as well.  They are looking at taking up the licence under co-location, which would create footfall for the shops and keep the positive momentum going.  <\/p> <p>  I take on board what the Minister said.  If a place is doing 12 transactions a week, it is not commercially viable.  I get that.  This is a particular place where we have good investment, a good future and bright prospects.  The removal of the post office will hit this town.  It will hit all that momentum.  I am trying to create a case that it is commercially viable to have that work in tandem with what is going on.  I would like to hear Mr. McRedmond's views.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#T00900","speaker":"1328"},{"type":"speech","time":1536066000,"counter":285,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to ask some questions as I am not a member of the committee.<\/p><p>The Minister and the chief executive officer, Mr. McRedmond will be aware that in Donegal, 17 post offices are scheduled for closure from south Donegal right up to the Inishowen Peninsula, my own home place.  A number of public meetings are taking place and a number of communities are trying to save their postal services.  I trust that Mr. McRedmond will listen to the proposals brought by them and consider the case for keeping open those post offices in Donegal.<\/p><p> There is much hypocrisy in this room.  I was doing some research and a response to a parliamentary question in 2005 from the then Minister confirmed that in January 1999, there were 1,911 post offices across the State.  By 2011 that number had dropped to 1,156, meaning 755 post offices were closed under a Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  To repeat, 1,911 post offices were open across the State in January 1999 and by 2011, under a Fianna F&aacute;il Government, 755 of them closed.  There must be some honesty about whether the recent announcement came out of nowhere.  There has been a gradual collapse of the post office network across this State.  It is the first fact that should be read into the record today.  We must have some honesty, particularly from those who are making a political case.<\/p><p> Under the EU postal services directive, to which the State signed up quite a while ago, we have limited the capacity for the State to subsidise our post office network.  We have tied the hands of our Government.  It is why we have turned what should be a service at the heart of our rural communities in every village into something that must make a profit and have a business case.  We need honesty about these two facts.  It is the context or background of how we got where we are today.  It is not the fault of the Minister, Deputy Naughten, on his own or Mr. McRedmond.  They inherited this legacy and they have now been asked to speak to it.  I cannot fathom how certain political spokespersons, when we consider their own track record and what they presided over, have the audacity to call out the witnesses today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#T01000","speaker":"1400","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1536066000,"counter":287,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#U00200","speaker":"1427"},{"type":"speech","time":1536066000,"counter":288,"content":"<p>I will get into the solutions.

It is clear that whatever criteria are being used by the company is not correct.<\/p> <p>  In all those areas there are community facilities and vibrant community groups running innovative community projects.

There is to be restructuring to make the An Post network sustainable, and we have spoken about it for years.  An Post has been given a loan of &euro;30 million from the Government to get itself sorted.  A protocol is being applied whereby post offices will serve populations of at least 500 people, and nobody will be more than 15 km from a post office, on average.  Nevertheless, I am very concerned about the way business is being done.  I am not arguing that every post office ought to remain open but my concern is the way the company is doing its business.<\/p> <p>  Mr. McRedmond is speaking about rationalisation and restructuring but in my county of Mayo, 11 post offices are to close and I have heard no announcement about new services going in anywhere.  On the one hand the company is applying a protocol wholesale and we have heard the announcement while the Oireachtas is in recess that a plethora of post offices are to close.  I question the timing of the announcement and a special meeting of this committee had to be convened because this is causing such concern in so many rural communities.  There is the practical aspect of accountability on the part of An Post as a State company.<\/p> <p>  I welcome that Mr. McRedmond is here today but what is he showing us other than that An Post is shutting down post offices?  It is all I can see in County Mayo.  The witnesses can speak about something else coming down the line but I have not heard any announcements about anything else coming down the line other than in generalities.  There has been talk of other proposals for years.  As far as I can see, the company is applying a formula that it can argue has some fairness or method but the reality is the only post offices closing are ones where postmasters have accepted a package.  The company is not forcing anyone to close.  It is driven by the fact that somebody has had enough for various reasons.  I do not for a minute blame a postmaster for this and so many of them have delivered excellent services throughout the years.  This is a different matter and it is about what the company is doing to expand services.<\/p> <p>  The Minister indicated the number of unviable post offices that will get more services but what about the other post offices?  Not every area is making the same argument but I could use Ballindine post office as an example.  Three businesses have expressed an interest in taking on the post office service that closed on 10 August.  There has been no correspondence with these people, although one may have received an acknowledgement from An Post of receipt of the expression of interest.  None of the rest heard anything subsequently.  While I understand there will be a review at the end of September, the post office has already been closed.  My understanding is that all the post offices that are closing could have stayed open until January.  Why not have a review or consultation with the affected communities and people prepared to put their money where their mouth is and carry on these services before the post offices close?  It is a bit like the horse bolting and closing the gate.  People are right to be cynical about the way the company is doing its business.  There is talk that services will be improved but there is no evidence of that on the ground in rural Ireland.  I know there are a few places where post offices have been opened but they are not where I am from.  It is not in Mayo or any of the places represented here.<\/p> <p>  There are serious business people in Ballindine who subscribe to the idea of things paying for themselves so why did not receive a reply?  If there had been some consultation in the case of the Ballycroy post office, the company would know there is no other post office within 15 km and it has a population of over 600.  It now has to backtrack as a result.  What is happening with Ballycroy?  If there had been consultation, the company would know it got the protocol wrong.<\/p><p> Finally, we had community and public meetings in respect of Belcarra post office.  What is happening with that post office?  It is a growing suburb but people are being directed to a post office one would not go to because the road is not safe.  Another post office nearby, Ballyglass, is also closing down.  There seems to have been no cognisance taken of that.  People are having problems engaging and things are being done in the wrong way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#U00400","speaker":"1425","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1536066000,"counter":291,"content":"<p>The Senator's point is very well made.

I also thank the Chairman for giving me the opportunity to speak because, while I am not a member of the committee, I feel very deeply about this issue.  I understand that Mr. McRedmond and the Minister have a job to do to make An Post viable.  However, as public representatives, our job is to represent our communities, particularly those that are going to lose their post offices.  As previous speakers indicated, there is a cascade of effects on a local community that loses a post office.  If one goes to a village five or ten years after it lost its post office, one finds that it has become a shell of its former self.  The financial viability and sustainability of the community involved is gone.  That is our perspective as the people elected to represent such communities.<\/p> <p>  It is not just 159 communities which will lose their post offices.  In fact, 390 and perhaps more of the 670 post offices that will be offered new contracts will find they do not have a viable future.  There will be a ripple effect in the communities that will lose their post offices immediately, but also in many communities that have not yet lost them.  The State must intervene to support rural Ireland.  That is the point Deputy Eamon Ryan and others have been making.  There must be some form of support for rural Ireland, which must not be abandoned.  There is an abandonment.  Do the Minister and Mr. McRedmond they appreciate the depth of abandonment felt by these communities that are going to lose their post offices now or that will lose them in the near future?  There is real anger among people.  Deputy Dooley referred to public meetings.  We have had six in Clare and six out of 14 took the option.  The other eight in Clare will, undoubtedly, have to close in the near future because the An Post is not going to invest in post offices in communities of fewer than 500 people.  The effect on these communities will be akin to that of Brexit.  It will tear the heart out of their economic viability.  In fact, it will be far greater than the effect of a hard Brexit nationally.<\/p> <p>  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to the effect that new Government services be devolved to the post office network and that consideration be given to a public banking system.  In the two and a half years since the programme was introduced, none of those Government services has been transferred to post offices and it appears the concept of a public banking system has been abandoned by the Government and will not be introduced.  The banking system being introduced through post offices is a pillar bank model.  As such, we are going to support our pillar banks rather than introduce community banking, which would return profits to local communities.  I want the Minister to explain why the public banking system been abandoned.<\/p> <p>  I refer to possible solutions.  We have held six public meetings in Clare in the past two weeks and a number of solutions have been put forward by communities.  The first of these would involve a public service obligation to allow essential post office services to continue.  There should be an option of salaried positions, part-time positions and a special contract for those who wish to co-locate operations to another business in the area.  Postmasters and postmistresses should be appointed as peace commissioners in order that they might provide meaningful services to our post offices.  There is random selection regarding post office closures in view of the fact that 159 people have taken packages while 231 have not.  That is just a random selection based on the particular circumstances of the postmasters in those areas.  It is not fair to a community that it comes down to a random selection like that.<\/p> <p>  There is a silo mentality in this Government.  Departments operate in silos and fail to take into account the effects their decisions will have the sustainability of communities.  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment may make a decision which results in the Department of Rural and Community Development trying to pick up the pieces following the destruction of local communities.  The closure of post offices is an example.  Why has this not been rural-proofed to protect those rural communities which are going to lose these services?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#V00300","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1536066000,"counter":293,"content":"<p>The Minister and Mr. McRedmond can take those questions in any order, but I ask them to try to be as brief as possible, acknowledging that some will require detailed answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#V00400","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1536066000,"counter":294,"content":"<p>I will try to be as brief as possible.  To those members of the public who happen to be watching these proceedings, I note that Senator Mac Lochlainn is right in that there has been a gradual collapse in the post office network.  The reason that happened is that no Minister wanted to be put in the position in which I have been placed today.  I am trying to set out a viable future for the post office network.  Perhaps not publicly, but privately everyone in this room will accept that we cannot keep every single post office open.  When members go to their public meetings they have to take a different approach, but I have decided that we need to have a viable future for our post office network.  It is not acceptable to continue to allow post offices to close at a rate of one every second week for the next 12 months to two years.  Rather, we must set out a clear future for our post office network and put real new services into post offices.<\/p> <p>  I taken the point Senator Mac Lochlainn makes about looking at solutions.  In fairness, I have had a great deal of engagement with the Senator down through the years.  He is someone who is very constructive in that regard.  From my experience dealing with the management team in An Post, I know that any constructive proposal put to it will be explored and considered in a genuine way.  I come back to the point I made earlier and to Deputy Neville and Senator Mulherin who referred to specific cases regarding specific post offices.  The chief executive cannot speak to that at this meeting.  However, it is the reason that there is a review mechanism built into this.  It is so that those specific, individual cases which may not be known to the company can be looked at independently of the company.  That is why there is a mechanism for local retailers to contact An Post if they believe they can offer some or all of those services in their own local communities.  That can be independently reviewed by this team.  The mechanism is there because there are specific and unique circumstances in individual communities which it is not possible to foresee in relation to the statistics.  I encourage those communities to make submissions and let the independent team look at the position.<\/p> <p>  Senator Mac Lochlainn referred specifically to the postal services directive.  It is not an impediment to investment.  The Government is making an investment of &euro;30 million, of which &euro;15 million is for the postal mail service and &euro;15 million is for the post office network service.  The postal services directive deals with the universal service obligation in respect of the five-day a week delivery service.  In fact, it is a tool I was able to use to maintain the five-days-a-week postal service.  Thankfully, and in answer to some of the questions here, anyone who travels in rural Ireland today on a Saturday will see an An Post van.  No one can tell me that is not an expansion in services.  It is a new service which was not there heretofore in rural Ireland.  It is absolutely the case that we need to put more services into rural Ireland.  The company is committed to that and is going to invest in every single one of those post offices which remain in the network.  I note to Deputy Harty that they will see new capital investment to modernise facilities, technology and the services they provide in communities.<\/p> <p>  On community banking, a report was compiled and published.  It was identified at the time that the next steps include exploring a local public banking avenue.  The very next step involves a tender to secure external consultants to carry out an independent evaluation of local public banking and to run a stakeholder forum.  I understand that the Department of Finance is drafting the terms of reference for that tender and has engaged with Irish Rural Link and the SBCI to get their input.

We did a lot of analysis and concluded that 500 was the number which could best define towns in Ireland.  It was the census definition but, as I have already said, I will revert to the committee on that point.  What if a town grows?  At any time, it is open to any community to apply to have a post office and we are open to that.  We are also open to different solutions.  We are open to PostPoint, parcel depots and post offices and anybody can apply at any time.  We have a protocol in place to determine whether it is viable.  That is why we announced recently that we are opening post offices in Ballon, County Carlow, Kilworth, County Cork, Tullyallen, County Louth, Kentstown, County Meath, and Killane, County Sligo.  We are opening post offices as well as going through this consolidation.<\/p> <p>  Senator Mac Lochlainn asked about the EU postal services directive.  As the Minister has clarified, it applies to the mail service but not to the post office service as such.

What I will say on the issue of financial services overall, which also relates to the question on the pillar banks, is that our main financial services are driven by Avantcard and we use a FinTech company to deliver some of our other services.  Most importantly, we are just completing our financial strategy which will see us launch a request for proposal, RfP.  Under that RfP it will be open to anybody to apply to provide services.  As already stated, the nature of EU banking regulation is changing quite dramatically and this means that banking data is open and one does not need to have a licence.  An RfP will be issued and it will be on that basis that we will decide on the best services for citizens.<\/p> <p>  Senator Mulherin referred to the lack of announcements on new services and that is a reasonable criticism.  We must ask if we are publicising the new services sufficiently well.  We certainly have been announcing them.  We have been putting up notices in post offices telling customers that agency banking is available.  We have been advertising the roll-out of foreign exchange services this summer.  We have undertaken a lot of advertising in respect of foreign exchange cards.  We have been doing all of that but it might be the case that we are not doing it enough to make sure that all communities are aware.  We will certainly look at that again.  When we undertook advertising last week we made sure to include all regional as well as national newspapers but I absolutely accept the Senator's point in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I was asked why the closures announcement was made when the D&aacute;il was in recess.  Everything was driven by doing the deal with the Irish Postmasters Union but I did not expect that to take three to four months.  I expected it to take a month, in which case the announcement would have been made far sooner and would have been during the D&aacute;il term.  These businesses are not our businesses.  These post offices do not belong to An Post.  We cannot force any of them to stay open.  We tell them that a package is available and that they can take it and exit from their contract.  If someone is going to take over a post office, I would imagine that he or she will take over the entire premises and everything else involved.  As I said at the start, the main reason people are taking up these packages is that their post offices are unviable in those locations.  That is the reason we did it when we did.  The Senator has suggested that the way it was done was cynical but there was no intent in terms of doing it when the D&aacute;il was closed.  Our intent is to get on with the business.  There is a real drive on in An Post, because of the financial difficulties we were in 18 months ago and we are now back into a position of growth and profit and are delivering extended services and improving our parcel services.  There is a real drive to get on with the work and that is what we are doing.  If anything, haste was driving it and we certainly had no intention of doing it in a way that was not entirely open and visible.  We have issued press releases at every stage, including to Deputies.  We have done everything we could to try to keep people as informed as possible along the way.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Harty spoke about the possibility of more post offices closing and referred to the approximately 230 postmasters that did not take up the package.  This is a scheme that we agreed with the postmasters and it has taken a year to put it in place.  It took months to negotiate and we are not doing another one.  Our aim now, as I have said previously, is to make sure that the remaining post offices are viable, with new services, with the plans for co-location and with all of these other pieces.  That is very much at the heart of this.  In terms of the services, I very much appreciate any support we get in that regard.  It is up to members of this committee to support the delivery of Government services through the post office network.  There was a debate regarding the television licence, which I understand, but a recommendation came from this committee that the licence fee be collected by the Revenue Commissioners, even though An Post is doing a very good job with television licences.  That is an example of a service should be available in post offices.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy was asked if the selection was random.  It was not random.  The Deputy is correct that out of those selected as potential takers, there is a degree to which one office took it and another did not.  However, the fact that the package was offered to that particular cohort of post offices was carefully designed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#W00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David McRedmond"},{"type":"speech","time":1536066000,"counter":298,"content":"<p>I have a brief question for Mr. McRedmond relating to the appeals deadline.

In that context, I ask An Post to consider extending the appeals deadline.  I also ask that An Post considers extending the deadline for some of the impending closures.  In some of the villages or areas earmarked for closure, contingency services are being considered by businesses in order to retain footfall.  If a post office closes, the people cannot access money.  In that scenario, the local shop may want to install an ATM or organise mobile ATM services.

If a few more are gone the only places people will be able to go is Listowel, Tarbert and Tralee.  That is all that will be left in north Kerry.  Mr. McRedmond could run the biggest company in the world and make a profit from it.  I would go so far as to say that if he was selling sand in the Sahara desert he would make a profit there.  However, post offices are different.  They are a social service for people and the Minister should treat them as such.  The Minister outlined all the work he has done, but he has much more to do.  He must treat the post offices differently.  They are a social service for the people.  Mr. McRedmond said one would be closed so that two would survive.  However, if Lixnaw in north Kerry is closed and Ballyduff is left open, does he know the rivalry, difference and identity that the people in these parishes wish to retain?  They want to retain their identity.  That is what it is about, and they are not being allowed to do that.

I thank them for their presentation.<\/p> <p>  An Post tendered for a contract with the then Department of Social Protection.  When it tendered it gave the number of outlets it has around the country for the services.  That is how it got the contract.  An Post is now in breach of the contract up to 2019 because it is closing post offices that it said in the contract would be providing the services to the people.  Can Mr. McRedmond elaborate on that?  Can the Minister confirm that An Post is in breach of the contract with the closure of 150 post offices?<\/p> <p>  Second, 231 post offices have not taken up the offer for closing and An Post is offering a new contract to 690 other post offices.  Will it offer a new contract to the 231 or will An Post have 690 on one contract and the 231 on another?  If that is what it is contemplating, I do not believe it is legal.<\/p> <p>  The third question is about the criteria for adjudicating on whether to open or close post offices.  Mr. McRedmond referred earlier to one in every two that will survive in an area.  I will give an example in a hinterland of 15 km to 20 km.  An Post sent out word to Creggs, Glinsk, Ballymoe, Williamstown and Athleague in the one area.  An Post went around the periphery and offered that to every post office in the hope that they would close.  Mr. McRedmond's reference to one in every two is not factual.<\/p> <p>  Another criterion that was used was inside the 15 km zone.  I am surprised at this from somebody who comes from a business background.<\/p><p>We have one post office in Athleague and the Minister is very familiar with it, where approximately 200 cheques go out from one factory every day, where there are people of other nationalities using the money transfer service and where there are more businesses down the road that sell cards and put a large volume through.  I listened to what the Minister said about post offices being viable and not viable.  Obviously the Department has not looked with the criteria that it has laid down because what it has done is to look at what is between the two speed limits.  There could be a new community of young people, who would not be getting a pension, who would all be working inside those speed limits in some areas of the country.  Does the Minister admit that the system that has been used is flawed and needs to be re-examined?<\/p><p> These are the facts of what is happening.  There are 150 small villages that are now at risk.  The Minister said they went through a consultation process and he is right.  They went through a process that they drew up with the Irish Postmasters Union, IPU.  What is the most important part of An Post?  It is the people who pay the money and give the service by sending letters and drawing the pension because that is what generates the money.  What part of the process were they brought in to?  My understanding is that it was none of it.<\/p><p> Is Mr. McRedmond prepared at this stage to put a hold on closures until July of next year?  If he understands rural Ireland and I hope that he does, is Mr. McRedmond aware that the money that comes in with the pension, the children's allowance or social welfare to that small village's local shop, chemist or butcher shop may be what is keeping that village going today?  I am not saying that every service needs to be in every corner of Ireland, I will never say that, but when people have money they spend it locally.  I ask Mr. McRedmond to engage with Oireachtas Members and communities to keep that facility alone in those small villages because if that goes we are looking at shutting the door on those small villages.<\/p><p> I refer to An Post's appeals process.  An Post has set up the appeals process, I have talked to Mr. Gillespie, one of the workers and I have talked to Mr. Lafferty.  Before we go through the appeals process I have been told \"No\".  That is a fairly good system.  I have also talked to the independent adjudicator and all that has been detailed to me is the terms of reference set down by An Post such as 15 km, 500 people, bla bla bla and now we know that it is flawed from the examples I have given already.  Is Mr. McRedmond prepared to do those few things?<\/p><p> On public banking, the Minister has spoken about it and I welcome what he has said, but public banking is not much good if the door is closed in the post office.  I know, and I have proof of it, that the Public Banking Forum of Ireland has not been contacted.  The Minister talked about Irish Rural Link but it has not been contacted.

It was mentioned earlier about new services expanding in the vans.  I can tell the witnesses that many of them are bringing the bread and the paper and are bringing the only bit of life and survival to many people and that is the nature of them, they are doing it voluntarily and they are great people.<\/p> <p>  On the appeals system, who can appeal a decision?  Is it the community or the post office family?  If it is reviewed and a contract is awarded to another individual, be it a family member or somebody else, in the same premises or in another shop, what effect does this have on the retiring postmasters and their expected severance package?  That is something that is not being mentioned at all.<\/p> <p>  Many postmasters are very unhappy that they were not afforded any sort of legal advice by either the Irish Postmasters Union or indeed An Post on new contracts being offered.  There is a lot of subterfuge going on here as well as intimidation and rushing.  Why were the postmasters asked to vote on a new deal referring to their packages and the new contracts without having the finished paperwork?  An Post had enough time to do it so why is it engaging in these deceitful practices?  Something smells very bad here in this situation.<\/p> <p>  Further, I cannot understand how the IPU, and I salute it in its job of representing postmasters and postmistresses but it has no remit to do dirty deals with An Post with the acquiescence of the Minister to banish post offices from villages.  It is not its remit whatsoever.  Its representatives are elected by nobody or represent nobody in those communities.  They represent the postmasters and postmistresses.  That was a shoddy piece of work and they should not have been cajoled along to do that and given inducements of money as well to banish community services from the very customers who were supporting them.  They complained about the customers they did not have and, fair enough, many of us were not great but the people who were supporting them are the ones who will suffer most.  It is very unfair.  Management are more concerned with cushy offices and big jobs for themselves.  Why do we not sell the GPO?  We cannot get rid of the idle staff who are in there so sell the damn place and they will have to get them out.  They got them out in 1916 and it was a much more important issue.  It is scandalous what it going on there.  The Minister has told me before that there are staff in there who are unemployed and not gainfully employed.  I want him to answer that here today.  It is not fair to punish postmen and postwomen out in the country in all kinds of weather who are not gainfully employed in the post office due to trade unions or otherwise.  It must be outed.  Why are the rural people always expected to carry the can for the waste?<\/p> <p>  Mr. McRedmond also said that he was not supporting big banks but he is also refusing to support the community banking system put forward here by three wonderful people who are up and down this country night and day researching this and they have given him the models.  We have a motion here that should not have to be here today.  The Rural Independents put it down in negotiations with the Minister's office and in consultation with the Department of the Taoiseach.  Every Deputy accepted it.  It was to give a five-year window and give over the tools of the trade, not a hand out - we are not begging for anything in rural Ireland, we want to make our way and we are proud people.  Let the post office survive and not be tied behind the bank or in hock to the big banks which this Government is and the last Government was and many more as well.  I will hand this motion to the Minister again in case he has forgotten about it or has not read it.  That is what was passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  We are asked every night at public meetings to have the will of the people expressed through every Member in the D&aacute;il and have that motion put in place and not have lip service, talk and love letters from the Taoiseach to Miche&aacute;l Martin about confidence and supply.<\/p> <p>  We want to have a modicum of service in An Post and we want to allow those good people to provide those services, work for the people and give people some chance of survival.

I am disappointed with the whole outcome.  I do not buy into the excuse that many of the post offices that are being closed were unviable.  That is the witnesses' perception, I do not agree with their sentiments.  What we should be doing here today is giving those post offices support.  As rural Deputies we are expected to come in here and accept this.  We are not accepting it and it is very clear from the sentiment expressed here by the committee that we will not take this, nor will the people who we represent.  I am getting calls from communities in Laois, Offaly and north Tipperary.  People are very angry and frustrated and it is another blow to rural Ireland but we will not accept it any more.  We will not put up and shut up, it is as simple as that.  I wish the postmasters and postmistresses who are taking the voluntary contribution and retiring well.  It is their entitlement and we all respect that but what is the process for putting in replacement contracts?  In this great democratic institution, why is the motion that the Rural Independents put forward two years ago which many of us spoke on and we all supported not recognised?<\/p><p>This should never be happening today.  We should be here to talk about further supports for our communities.<\/p><p> Mr. McRedmond mentioned further expansion of the post office network, including opening new post offices.  Does this mean a re-examination and reassessment of post offices in towns with a growing population that were closed because the postmaster or postmistress retired and there was nobody to take up the position?  I met Mr. Laverty of An Post in Killeigh, County Offaly, about two years ago to discuss a retirement in an area of growing population.  There were concerns about the process of advertising the post.  At the time a businessman was willing to use the co-location option in his supermarket.  I ask Mr. McRedmond to revisit that and give those areas a chance because it is unfair.<\/p><p> At both the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine and in this committee, a number of members have mentioned the Sparkasse model of banking.  Is it possible to have representatives from Sparkasse appear before the committee, in addition to An Post representatives, to discuss this model?  That is what should happen.  We are a so-called democratic institution and it is only fair that everybody gets to contribute.<\/p><p> It has been brought to An Post's attention that the range of services Mr. McRedmond mentioned have not been advertised properly.

They have had a lot of it today.<\/p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Naughten, is a constituency colleague of mine.  I acknowledge he has clarified a number of issues for me and has been in contact with me.  I cannot disagree with virtually everything that has been said by fellow Oireachtas Members.  I accept that a lot of this has built up for years and that during our time there were issues with post offices.  Deputy Martin Kenny knows my part of County Roscommon very well.  I point out to him and to Senator Mac Lochlainn that 15 or 18 years ago, within a radius of 7 miles we had eight post offices.  Two of them were a mile and a half apart and three more were 2 miles apart.  In reality they could not all survive.  We are now at a different juncture and because of that we are concerned.<\/p> <p>  In acknowledgement of An Post in the past, when rural areas had no transport apart from walking or cycling, An Post gave a tremendous service virtually in every parish.  The first Minister for Post and Telegraphs was appointed in 1924 and we were able to put in place a service which, I accept, came from the old British system.  In 2018 we must be able to give a service that tries to look after all the people.<\/p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Naughten, has clarified a number of issues affecting Roscommon-Galway.  I know people in the affected areas who are prepared to take on the service.  They have approached me in a confidential manner.  I will not say any more about it.  We need clarity on the issue of needing a population of 500.  I think An Post goes out to the point where the driving speed limit changes, but the catchment area takes in many more people.  I seek clarification on that.<\/p> <p>  I have a problem with Mr. McRedmond's figures.  He said that only 1.98% of people in County Cork were affected and 3.9% overall.  In the counties of Donegal, Roscommon, Leitrim, Longford, Mayo, Sligo, Galway, Clare, Kerry, Offaly, Cavan and Monaghan, almost 54% of the people are affected.  Many of those closures are in one regional part.  Mr. McRedmond's figure of 3.8% of people being affected is not a true reflection of my part of the country, in the west and north west.  We need to take that into account.  While the overall figure is correct, if one breaks it down to how it is affecting my part of the country, the figure is 55% to 60%.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge the Minister has a very difficult portfolio.  As the Minister knows, the national roll-out of broadband affects 50% or more of the people of County Roscommon - he is doing his best on it.  In talking about Internet facilities, many areas will not be able to buy into that in counties like Roscommon and parts of Galway.<\/p> <p>  The credit unions were mentioned.  When representatives from the Public Banking Forum of Ireland appeared earlier, I made the point the Minister made.  I would be very wary.  We should develop the credit unions more as they do a lot of work in providing a service and surely, a banking model should be based on that.<\/p> <p>  I will reiterate something I mentioned previously.  An Post is looking for new ideas and we all have a responsibility in this regard.  Has An Post ever considered the possibility of trying to encourage students to use the post office service?  About two years I did a survey of 80 students in a local school attended by my daughter.  Of 80 students, only one used the post office service and actually walked into a post office, which indicates there is a problem there.  The Minister, Deputy Naughten, can be very good on issues like this.  Why not look at a pilot scheme of setting up post offices on our university and IT campuses?  Let us be radical here and sell it to the students.  There is a lot of business there and a lot of banking can be done there.  We should study that to see if it could be effective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#Z00200","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1536066000,"counter":341,"content":"<p>I agree.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#Z00300","speaker":"1427"},{"type":"speech","time":1536066000,"counter":342,"content":"<p>I have a final point and if Mr. McRedmond does not have an answer, he can come back to me.

I come from east County Galway.  Nobody is happy about the closure of post offices, albeit through a redundancy scheme.  In County Galway 18 post offices are closing; I do not know the exact number in my constituency.  Funnily enough, the people who have contacted me since the announcement of the closures - this is probably something for both Mr. McRedmond and the Minister, Deputy Naughten - are business people in the village who are asking whether they can get involved in running this post office by bringing it into their shops.  They need to know who to contact to do that.<\/p> <p>  I understand that An Post and the Department are open to placing the post office in a shop in a village or whatever.  While that might be considered, who has the final say on whether it would be done?  Is it An Post, the Department or someone else who might look it and decide this would work?  In the case of four post offices in my constituency that have closed, I have received phone calls from people, mainly shopkeepers, who have stated the post offices were adjacent to their premises and they were willing  I am to take on the post office and place it in their shops.  If we can do that, we will be increasing the post office network in these areas.  My concern is about scenarios in which such post offices are closed because like every other facility, when something closes it is damn hard to get it reopened.  Is there a timeframe from when someone puts in an application such that it would be considered fairly swiftly and a \"Yea\" or \"Nay\" would be given on it?<\/p> <p>  While I welcome that all these additional services are being considered for the post offices, one point is blatantly obvious to me.<\/p><p>If I did a survey in my village, I expect I would find that many people do not know what is available in the local post office.  The marketing of the post office network in local areas is weak.  If the post office is going to be great again, we need to educate the young people about whom Deputy Eugene Murphy spoke.  We need to encourage them to come in with their savings books to put in a couple of euro to save for their holidays.  This will make them aware that the post office is there to be used.  We need to get them used to going into the post office.  Every aspect of the retail industry in Ireland is changing because of the Internet and online shopping, etc.  The retail business has to change.  The post office network needs to change as well.  It is okay for Mr. McRedmond to say that An Post will do this, that and the other.  I hear about the changes that are made, but I know most of the public does not know what services are available in post offices.  As we go forward, we need to be able to get that information out if our efforts are to be worthwhile.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#Z00500","speaker":"1260","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1536066000,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for letting me in.

It is a sign of the role they have played that post office closures have taken place throughout the country on a continuous basis over the past 20 years.  It is important to mention that because attempts are being made to suggest everybody is to blame.<\/p> <p>  The Minister has given a good defence of his role with regard to post offices as an Independent member of the Government.  That might be a signal of what needs to happen in the future if we are to continue to defend post offices.<\/p> <p>  I ask Mr. McRedmond and the Minister to explain the relationship between the Department and An Post.  The distinctions between the roles of both bodies need to be clarified.<\/p> <p>  The Minister has said that his Department is rolling out some services through the post offices.  I ask him to explain how that came about.  Did they go out to tender?  If so, how did An Post win that tender?  This is important as well.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the closures that have been announced.  The number of closures in County Donegal - 17 - is the second highest in the country.  Why were the service improvements not rolled out to see how they would work before the closures were announced?  It would be better to approach the matter in that way rather than announcing the closures first.  Some of these post offices could be viable when the new services are available and are happening.  That is important.  The approach that is being taken has led to unnecessary conflict.  This could all be done in a different way.<\/p> <p>  Mr. McRedmond mentioned earlier that is not possible to keep a post office open that is conducting just 12 transactions per week.

I welcome the Minister and Mr. McRedmond.  I missed the start of the meeting.  I hope I will not repeat some of the issues that were raised earlier.  We all acknowledge that post offices have closed before this year, before last year and under previous regimes.  I was picking my brain to recall the post offices in my own area that closed 20 years ago.  Most of them were stand-alone post offices.  There was a stand-alone post office in my parish of Ballindangan.  I remember a big campaign 30 years ago when a stand-alone post office in Bartlemy was being closed.<\/p> <p>  There is a trend of bigger significance at the moment.  It is having a bigger impact on communities.  I have seen in my constituency that the closure of the local post office leads in many cases to the loss of the local shop as well.  That is where this will have a major impact.  I acknowledge that many post offices cannot stand alone.  When post offices close, it can lead to the loss of other services, like shops and newsagents, in local communities.  That is where a bigger backlash from the public will be felt.<\/p> <p>  Reference has been made to County Donegal and questions have been asked about who is causing the closure of all of these post offices.  The appeals process has been mentioned.  I ask Mr. McRedmond to provide for a 12-month period in which people can vote with their feet in local communities.  This would allow people to use their local post offices and thereby take up the slack in local areas, if there is a slack.  When I spoke to a postmistress, I got it in the ear from both sides.  She acknowledged that there are people who should be able to use her post office but are choosing to go to a post office in a bigger town instead.  They are passing her front door because they can avail of other services like banks in the bigger town.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge the dilemma the Minister is facing.  He cannot satisfy everybody, but he can look at other possibilities like mobile units.  I remember when the banks used to bring mobile branches to little villages.  Could that be considered?  The issue that would probably arise in such circumstances would be the availability of broadband services in such communities.  This issue was discussed earlier in the meeting.  Given what is happening, the roll-out of broadband to rural areas needs to be fast-tracked.  Broadband can be used for other services.<\/p> <p>  I suggest that consideration should be given to freezing these closures to allow the post offices that have been identified for closure to be reassessed.  I am aware that an appeals process has been announced.  It has been mentioned that all of this is based on footfall.  There could be a footfall of 10,000 people outside a post office, but they could all be going across to the next community to use another post office.  The calculation of usage is a big thing.  People need to vote with their feet.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the reversal of a decision that was taken regarding Kilworth in north Cork.  It lost its post office under the previous Government.  I do not think it has seen much of an increase in population since then.  Maybe it was through confidence and supply that we got the post office back up and running.  I ask Mr. McRedmond to send me details of this welcome news for Kilworth.  The people of the village fought tooth and nail to try to keep the post office open some years ago.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Chairman for giving me this time.  I know it has been a long day for most of us.  However, the appeals process should be reviewed.  Usage is how we can show whether a post office is able to work.<\/p> <p>  I would like to ask a final question.  There is a perception that a post office must be open from morning until evening.  Does each post office need to observe the full opening hours?  Can a deal be done to allow a post office to open for just a couple of hours each day, or a couple of days each week?  If services have to be reduced, they should be retained for a few days of the week at least.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#AA00400","speaker":"1278"},{"type":"speech","time":1536066000,"counter":348,"content":"<p>Many questions have been addressed to the Minister and Mr. McRedmond.

I am responsible for the postal sector, including the governance of An Post.  An Post is a commercial semi-State company with a mandate to act commercially.  It has statutory responsibility for the State's postal service and the post office network.  I am responsible for the governance aspect.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Pringle is correct when he says that my predecessors sat on their hands.  This portfolio has been held by Ministers from Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il, the Labour Party and the Green Party over the years.  I have accepted the mantle and decided to try to do something with the post office network.  That is the reason I am here.  Unlike my predecessors, I have not taken the option of sitting on my hands.  Instead, I am trying to put a viable future in place for the post office network.  I am the focus of attention here today because we are trying to put a viable future in place.  I believe that after we have gone through this process, people will look back and see that the right decision was made.  It will become clear that it was right to put a proper plan in place to develop the post offices, rather than letting post offices drip away one week after another for the next decade until the network is completely gone.<\/p><p>My understanding is that one post office had 12 transactions a week.  I understand the average in the post offices that were offered the redundancy package was 120 a week.  Mr. McRedmond can clarify that.  One cannot justify providing any level of support for a post office that has 12 transactions a week.  We cannot try to do that.<\/p><p> Deputy Kevin O'Keeffe said the closure of one his local post offices will mean the loss of the local shop as well.  That is something of which I have been conscious.  He is correct that sometimes it is not just the post office that will close, but shops will close as well.  However, as he clearly pointed out, something which some members fail to acknowledge, the local community has bypassed some of those post offices and gone to the bigger towns rather than use the local shop.  I heard a postmaster in the past week make the point that some people passed the local post office, went to some of the German retailers in the bigger towns, and collected their pensions in those towns but now they are complaining that the local post office is closing.  This is not a surprise to anyone.  Since the day I was appointed, I have dealt with questions on the future of the post office network and issues arose long before that.  Communities knew their post office was under threat yet they continued to pass by the front door and are now concerned about the post office closures.  I gave an example in an earlier contribution of Imelda Burke, the postmistress in Ahascragh, who wrote to every family in her catchment area and outlined to them the services that were available.  We need is new innovative services, which is what we will provide.  That is what the management team in An Post is doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#AA00600","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1536066000,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I will allow Deputy Mattie McGrath to make a brief point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018090400002#BB00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1536066000,"counter":352,"content":"<p>I hate to cut across the Minister but he did not get the post office portfolio when he was appointed.

The result of one of the key bits of research we did before we started the process was that people wanted post offices to be where they do their shopping.  That is a key part of the location strategy.  It says it is a social service and it should be treated as such.  We would have 500 post offices if we did not treat it as a social service.
