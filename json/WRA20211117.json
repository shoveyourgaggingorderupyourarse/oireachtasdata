The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention.    I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 5 November, almost 274,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed or have surveys underway and over 125,000 premises have build currently underway. NBI has also advised that the first premises are connected in Cavan, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Monaghan and over 30,000 premises are available to order and pre-order across 12 counties.\u00a0Surveying is complete in County Monaghan in the Deployment Areas of Emyvale, Clones and Carrickmacross and main works are underway in the Deployment Area of Monaghan. There are currently over 3,600 premises in Monaghan who can order a connection today and over 770 premises who can place a pre-order today. The areas covered include Monaghan, Clontibret, Ballybay, Scotstown, Tehallan,\u00a0and Tullycorbet.<\/p>  <p>  Further details are available on specific areas within County Monaghan through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the Intervention Area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries. NBI has recently published details of its full deployment schedule on its website which enables all premises within the intervention area to have an anticipated service activation date range. Given the scale and complexity of delivery of the new high speed broadband network under the NBP, I am advised that any dates provided by NBI on its website are based on the best available information at the time and may be subject to change. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the challenges to the delivery of the NBP due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has faced a range of other challenges due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre to the home in a rural environment. These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract. This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-baselines milestones for 2021. Work is underway to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond. This has resulted in some changes to timeframes for connection for end users. <\/p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 5 November, 388 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCP&rsquo;s are installed at Corduff Community Centre (5.3km from the premises referred to), Mullyash Community Centre, St. Patrick&rsquo;s Accommodation Centre, Monaghan GAA Centre of Excellence, Latton Resource Centre, Corcaghan Community Centre, Tannagh Outdoor Education Centre, Geraldines GAA Club, Tullycorbet Parish Hall, Carn Resource Centre, Saint Alphonsus Community Hall, Ceremartin Community Hall, Ballybay Wetlands, and Latton O'Rahilly Gaelic Football Club.

My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP.

It has been pointed out to me that the current drafting has the potential to create inconsistencies as to how it will be applied, with the potential for variation in rates being used.

Section 477C Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 outlines the definitions and conditions that apply to the HTB scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue as follows:<\/p>  <p>  A claimant under the scheme must make an application confirming he or she meets various conditions specified in the section, including that he or she is a first-time purchaser, that he or she has completed a tax return form and is tax compliant for each of the tax years for which a claim is being made.  Also, the new property must be occupied as the sole or main residence of a first-time purchaser.  First-time purchasers who intend to purchase a new property should also ensure their contractor is a Revenue approved qualifying contractor for the purposes of Help to Buy.<\/p>  <p>  S. 477C of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides that the property must be a new building which was not, at any time, used or suitable for use as a dwelling. In order to determine if the property satisfies the definition of a \"qualifying residence\", full details of the property would need to be provided. The Revenue Tax and Duty Manual Part 15-01-46 outlines further guidance on what would be considered a \"new\" house. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the HTB process, \"qualifying contractors\" are involved in the claim stage of the process where the applicant has purchased a house or apartment.

However, my officials reached out to Insurance Ireland for information regarding the issue of the validity of driving licences which have been extended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Insurance Ireland stated that it had received a query about the matter via its Insurance Information Service.  I understand that an administrative error may have happened in this particular case and that the issue is being resolved.  I believe this case underscores the usefulness of the Insurance Information Service, which is a free service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance cover. It can be accessed at feedback@insuranceireland.eu. <\/p>  <p>  Insurance Ireland further noted that a number of its members put measures in place last year (which were recommitted to in January this year) to avoid such a situation given the backlog in licensing services due to COVID-19 lockdown restrictions, where people could not renew their licences through no fault of their own.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, it is worth reiterating that where a consumer feels that they are being treated unfairly, they have the option of making a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO). The FSPO is a statutory official who acts as an independent arbiter of disputes that consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider. The FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-567-7000.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111700072#WRE02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":117,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111700072#WRE02600"},{"type":"question","counter":118,"qnumday":72,"qnumall":"[56407\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111700072#WRE02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if all assistive technology and mainstream technology devices have been made exempt from VAT for persons who are blind or vision impaired, as is recommended in a report (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1523","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":119,"content":"<p>The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the provisions of EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply.<\/p>  <p>  There is no provision in the VAT Directive to exempt the supply of assistive technology and mainstream technology devices.

Tax returns do not detail the individual properties disposed of, or the gains on these disposals. However, the numbers of claimants by sector and by asset type are detailed in the statistics published by Revenue.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Finance Act 2012 introduced section 604A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 which provides for relief from CGT on the disposal of certain land and buildings. The rationale for the introduction of the measure was to stimulate activity in the property market at that period in time, when there were few transactions taking place.<\/p>  <p>  This relief was amended in Finance Act 2017 for disposals made on or after 1 January 2018, to provide that gains on land and buildings acquired between 7 December 2011 and 31 December 2014 are not chargeable gains where the land or buildings are held for at least 4 years and up to 7 years from the date they were acquired. This change was aimed at reducing any impact the original provision could possibly have on limiting the supply of development land available for sale by incentivising delayed sales to maximise relief. <\/p>  <p>  In response to the Deputy's question in Dail Question No. 75 (Ref: 56471\/21), I don't think there is any indication that this capital gains tax relief is acting as a tax incentive and contributing towards the sale of rental properties.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s current focus is on the comprehensive 'Housing for All' plan. In relation to property-based reliefs more generally, taxation is only one of the policy levers available to the Government through which to boost overall housing supply. In line with my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines, consideration of whether a tax measure is the most appropriate policy tool for a given purpose is required. The presumption should be that non-tax measures should be considered before the use of a tax&ndash;based measure. <\/p>  <p>  Housing for All is intended to deliver more homes of all types for people with different housing needs, including those who wish to rent at an affordable price. The Government has committed to, amongst other things, an average of 2,000 new &lsquo;cost rental&rsquo; homes every year, with targets of rents being at least 25 per cent below market level, as well as a rent value freeze to 2024 by linking any increases in Rent Pressure Zones to inflation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111700072#WRE03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":125,"content":"<p>Question No. 74 answered with Question No. 73.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":126,"content":"<p>Question No. 75 answered with Question No. 73.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":128,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111700072#WRE03700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Office of Public Works","counter":127,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111700072#WRE03600"},{"type":"question","counter":128,"qnumday":76,"qnumall":"[56207\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111700072#WRE03700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will ascertain from the OPW its plans for a property (details supplied); the length of time the property has been vacant; if it could be considered for use by an organisation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1500","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":129,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Commissioners of Public Works that the property at Prospect Avenue, Westport, Co.

A new Irish Executive Officer competition will be undertaken by PAS in the coming months from which future assignments will be made from 2022.

On enactment of the Bill presently before the Oireachtas, the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media will establish an Advisory Committee on Irish languages services.  The functions of this Advisory Committee are set out in the Bill and include the publication of a national plan to increase the provision of services through the medium of Ireland that will likely require the consideration of approaches to the future recruitment of Irish speakers in the coming years.  My Department and the Public Appointments Service will be represented as members on this Committee.<\/p>  <p>  The Mobility scheme (list-based) for Clerical Officers and Executive Officers which went live for offers on 10th September 2018 was reviewed by officials in my department and key stakeholders (Local HR representatives and F&oacute;rsa) following twelve months of operation. The reported data at this time indicated that only 25% of moves took place following the initial offer.<\/p>  <p>  Following consultation it was agreed by with all stakeholders that in order to focus a more targeted approach at application stage that the number of zone choices would be reduced from three to two with the number of organisation choices per zone reduced from all organisations to five, for all new applicants.

The report was updated in May 2021 with projections of teacher demand and supply to 2038.  Ultimately, the intention is to establish a robust data based model for the effective projection of future teacher demand and supply across the school system. The report projects that, at post-primary level, the demand for teachers, on a no policy change basis, will follow a largely downward trend to 2032. It is important to note that the report&rsquo;s projections are based on high level demographics and to demonstrate trends in demand and supply.

Details of the consultation, and findings arising from the process are set out on www.gov.ie\/en\/consultation\/13be2-consultation-on-the-apprenticeship-action-plan-2021-2025\/. <\/p>  <p>  In moving to a single model the objective is to build on the strengths of both the existing craft and the consortia led models. The single model must be capable of delivering apprenticeships which can flex to accommodate the rapid rate of change driven by technological adaption, digital and environmental transformation which is inherent in today&rsquo;s economy while retaining the high standards required from Ireland&rsquo;s apprenticeship system.<\/p>  <p>  The existing craft apprenticeship structure relies on a heavily standardised approach to the 25 existing programmes, with academic oversight and curriculum development undertaken by a central body (SOLAS).  All craft apprenticeships are four years in duration, with the majority of programmes following a standard seven phase approach of on-the-job and off-the-job training. Advice from the partners on the structure and content of the apprenticeships is through a subcommittee of the SOLAS Board, with Phase 2 delivery undertaken across the Education and Training Boards (ETBs) and phase 4 and 6 undertaken in the Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) through the HEA. There is significant partnership and buy-in from the education and industry partners and a well established reputation internationally.  <\/p>  <p>  The existing system has seen two major shocks in the past 15 years, firstly the 2007 housing and economic crash and most recently the COVID-19 pandemic.  While those involved in apprenticeship delivery have moved to meet the challenges presented on both occasions, the need for rapid movement has also highlighted limitations of the more centralised craft apprenticeship system compared to individual consortia who had more flexibility to adapt delivery and assessment processes to the changed environment. <\/p>  <p>  The existing consortia-led or post-2016 apprenticeships operate under a structure whereby the academic content of the apprenticeship is agreed by a consortium of education and training providers, employers and relevant partners with the off-the-job training delivery managed by coordinating providers who are themselves part of the consortium. This approach has allowed for rapid re-alignment of off-the job training delivery to allow for apprenticeships to continue insofar as possible during the COVID-19 period, proving resilience and flexibility under testing conditions.  Apprentice Occupational Profiles, including QQI level and duration are approved at national level through the Apprenticeship Council. <\/p>  <p>  Over the period of the action plan, the dual system of programme governance will be replaced by a single distributed system of programme governance &ndash; the single apprenticeship system.  Responsibility for curriculum and apprenticeship content will be placed close to where activity is taking place which will leverage the core strengths of education and training providers, employers and partners who are immersed in the respective industry. It will also foster the integration of apprenticeship within the quality assurance arrangements of the educational institutions across further and higher education.  The new National Apprenticeship Office will bring together the oversight and funding roles of SOLAS and the HEA as they relate to apprenticeship into a single office, providing national level oversight of all apprenticeships. The office will provide support for the new apprenticeship consortia and will be informed by the National Apprenticeship Alliance which will comprise stakeholder representatives, including a subcommittee focussed on advising measures for broadening diversity in the apprentice population.  Therefore, while there is a move towards a distributed model of apprenticeship, there is a significantly changed and enhanced role for national level governance and oversight mechanisms.<\/p>  <p>  The process by which this transition will take place will be planned in close collaboration with apprenticeship stakeholders, including union partners, through representation on the National Apprenticeship Advisory Committee and the National Apprenticeship Alliance.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111700078#WRL00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1493"},{"type":"question","counter":353,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[56321\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111700078#WRL00700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will consider ending the exemption of apprenticeships from the minimum wage legislation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1466","askee":"1624"},{"type":"question","counter":354,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[56323\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111700078#WRL00800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the steps his Department is taking to begin monitoring the wages paid to apprentices in the consortia-led model given that apprentices are exempt from the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 and SOLAS only monitors the wages paid to craft apprentices; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1466","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":355,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 153 and 155 together.<\/p>  <p>Apprentices are employed under a Contract of Apprenticeship. In the case of the 37 apprenticeships established since 2016, the rate of pay is agreed between the apprentice and the employer. The minimum rate of pay for the 25 craft apprenticeships are agreed by the partners within the relevant sector, or are set out in Sectoral Employment Orders (Construction Sector and Mechanical Engineering Building Services Contracting Sector). Minimum agreed rates vary between occupations and sectors but in all cases craft apprenticeship rates are expressed as a proportion of the qualified rate, from 33% of the qualified rate in year one to 90% in year four. All apprentices are excluded from the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.<\/p>  <p>  Neither the Department or SOLAS monitor or collect data in relation to apprentice wages other than in relation to the payment of training allowances.  Training allowances paid to craft apprentices by Education and Training Boards (through the Education Shared Business Services) on periods of off the job training are based in the agreed industry rate. <\/p>  <p>  The core regulatory standards for apprenticeship provided for in the 1967 Act have been enhanced through statutory rules and administrative guidance. A significant number of measures are in place to support and protect the apprentice. The Apprenticeship Code of Practice, which specifies the rights and responsibilities of apprentices and employers and is signed by both parties, forms the basis of each apprenticeship contract.  In tandem with adherence to core regulatory standards, apprenticeships are underpinned by a strong framework of quality assurance to ensure programmes provide a high quality learning experience for apprentices.<\/p>  <p>  Under the new Action Plan apprentices will be supported to complete their programmes through clearer communication, support networks and increased ownership of their learning journey. The voice of apprentices in shaping the future of the system will be formalised within the single system of apprenticeship, enhancing the existing apprentice feedback mechanism which is inherent in the QQI quality processes. Apprentices will be included both looking to the future through representation on the apprenticeship stakeholder oversight and advisory structures and also through an annual survey of apprentices which will provide a robust system view for the prior year. This will provide multiple fora through which apprentices may voice concerns over any issues pertaining to the conditions of their employment, which may then be addressed directly.   Monitoring medium to long term outcomes for apprentices will also be formalised through the commencement of graduate tracking.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111700078#WRL00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1493"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":356,"content":"<p>Question No. 154 answered with Question No. 152.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":357,"content":"<p>Question No. 155 answered with Question No. 153.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":359,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[56324\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111700078#WRL01300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will provide complete lists of all consortia-led apprenticeships including the details of the education providers and accrediting agency, duration and total enrolment figures in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1466","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":360,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is being compiled by SOLAS.

However, they will still be recorded as a refusal of leave to land. <\/p><p>Arrangements for the removal of persons refused permission to enter the State are essentially operational matters for the GNIB who work closely with civilian immigration officers on these matters. Detention of a person refused entry to the State is only undertaken as a last resort. There is a statutory obligation to return a person refused entry permission as soon as is practicable. Non-custodial measures, such as a requirement to report to a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na station or a requirement to reside in a specified place, are widely used as alternatives to detention.<\/p><p>Section 5 of the Immigration Act, 2003 (as amended by the International protection Act, 2015), contains the main provisions dealing with the removal from the State of persons refused permission to enter. It specifies that a person to whom this section applies may be arrested by an immigration officer or a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and detained in a prescribed place of detention for the purpose of facilitating their removal from the State, which must be as soon as is practicable. It also provides that a person may be detained for a period not exceeding 12 hours at the airport or port from which the person is due to depart.<\/p><p>Work has been completed on a new Block F in Cloverhill remand prison which is intended to be used to accommodate people detained for immigration purposes and ensure they can be housed separately from people on remand. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic required significant measures within the Irish Prison Service (IPS) to manage and control infection risk, and it was necessary to re-purpose Block F as an isolation unit for those prisoners who have, or are suspected of having, the virus. It is intended that when the pandemic is over, Block F will revert to its original intended use, subject to the availability of staff and the impact on resources. While this will address the situation in the immediate term, work is also proceeding on the consideration of a longer-term sustainable and compliant solution as part of my Justice Plan 2021. However, the Deputy will appreciate that there are complex issues arising and a detailed assessment of the feasibility of the various options is required and work is ongoing in that regard.<\/p><p>The former Transaer building at Dublin airport has been refitted and now contains the new Dublin Airport Garda station and additional office facilities occupied by the GNIB. I understand that the GNIB took up residence in the office facility during July 2019 and the local Garda&iacute; moved into the new Garda Station during December 2019. The Garda station contains four one person cells and two additional detention rooms. While the building works have completed, the cells have not been fully commissioned at this time and outstanding matters are being addressed by the authorities. It is intended that the GNIB will detain persons refused leave to land, overnight at the Dublin Airport Garda station when the detention facilities are fully commissioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111700080#WRN02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":448,"content":"<p>Question No. 185 answered with Question No. 184.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":449,"content":"<p>Question No. 186 answered with Question No. 184.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":450,"content":"<p>Question No. 187 answered with Question No. 184.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":451,"content":"<p>Question No. 188 answered with Question No. 184.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":453,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111700080#WRN02600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services","counter":452,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111700080#WRN02500"},{"type":"question","counter":453,"qnumday":189,"qnumall":"[56461\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111700080#WRN02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he is satisfied that there is no ongoing risk to service users in all disability day and residential units following the revelations in County Donegal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1576","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":454,"content":"<p>In the context of correspondence with the HSE on a National Independent Review Panel report, the Brandon Report, the HSE has advised me that there is no ongoing risk to service users and that there is a commitment to the implementation of the specific recommendations arising from the report.

That Policy set out the roadmap for the future provision of oral healthcare to the eligible population. It has two key goals; first, to provide the supports to enable every individual to achieve their best oral health, and second, to reduce oral health inequalities across the population, by enabling vulnerable groups to access oral healthcare and improve their oral health. <\/p>  <p>  The Dental Treatment Services Scheme, which dates from the 1990s is available to medical card holders aged 16 and over. The dental care is provided by independent dental practitioners who have a contract with the HSE. Patients may choose to have their treatment undertaken by any dentist who participates in the scheme. The Scheme covers a dental examination, two fillings in each calendar year, prescriptions, denture repairs and extractions as necessary. Other more complex treatments such as the provision of dentures require the approval of the HSE before the dentist can proceed and in this case the dentist applies directly to the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  There is a need to align the DTSS with best international evidence and practice, and legislation, as outlined in Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte, the National Oral Health Policy. Regretfully, the COVID-19 pandemic caused the roll-out of the Policy to be delayed and the proposed review of the DTSS contract to be deferred.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, there has been continued engagement between my officials, the HSE and the dental community throughout the pandemic on infection control measures, guidelines for safe dental practice, and ensuring that dental professionals were included in the high-risk group for early vaccination.

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.<\/p><p>In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.<\/p><p>In June 2017, on foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.<\/p><p>The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.<\/p><p>The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.<\/p><p>Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.<\/p><p>My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.<\/p><p>Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020\/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration. This applies to everyone whether or not they have a medical card\/GP visit card, as it is outside of the HPV immunisation programme.<\/p><p>My Department has asked the National Immunisation Advisory Committee to consider the clinical effectiveness of providing the HPV vaccine to:<\/p><p>- girls and boys in secondary school who were eligible to receive HPV vaccine in 1st year but who did not receive it; and<\/p><p>- women up to the age of 25 years who have left secondary school and who did not receive the vaccine when eligible.<\/p><p>If NIAC conclude that there is sufficient evidence to support providing the HPV vaccine to one or both groups, HIQA will undertake a cost-effectiveness assessment on that basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111700083#WRQ01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":567,"qnumday":226,"qnumall":"[56283\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111700083#WRQ01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding booster vaccines for persons under 60 years of age that have serious underlying health conditions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1516","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":568,"content":"<p><font color=\"#201F1E\">The immunisation programme in Ireland is based on the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC).

All cases must clear validation checks before payment can issue. <\/p>  <p>  GLAS payments are continuing on a weekly basis as applications pass all validation checks and are approved for payment. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111700087#WRU01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Common Agricultural Policy","counter":733,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111700087#WRU01100"},{"type":"question","counter":734,"qnumday":281,"qnumall":"[56450\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111700087#WRU01200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 273 of 10 November 2021, if the 58.53% of farmers better off with 100% convergence is relative to their current pillar 1 payment if no convergence was applied or relative to 85% convergence; the way the eco scheme element of 25% and other pillar 1 reductions such as young farmer and national reserve elements have been reflected and accounted for in this comparison; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":735,"content":"<p>Parliamentary Question No. 273 of 10 November 2021, illustrates the number and percentage of farmers who would be better off in 2023 with 100% convergence achieved by 2026, compared to 85% convergence achieved by 2026.

Circular CVSP 1\/2014 specifies that<i>'the PPN will be the main link through which the local authority connects with the community, voluntary and environmental sectors without prejudice to other consultation processes.'<\/i> <table>    <tr>       <th>PPN<\/th>       <th>Resource Worker (WTE)<\/th>       <th>Administrator \/ Support Worker (WTE)<\/th>       <th>Development Worker (WTE)<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>0.5<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare<\/td>       <td>1.6<\/td>       <td>0.4<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork County<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin City<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>D&uacute;n Laoghaire\/ Rathdown<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>0.8<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Fingal<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway City<\/td>       <td>0.7<\/td>       <td>0.75<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway County<\/td>       <td>0.5<\/td>       <td>1.25<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>2<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick<\/td>       <td>0.75<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>2<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo<\/td>       <td>0.6<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>South Dublin<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>0.85<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford<\/td>       <td>1.5<\/td>       <td>0.5<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>TOTAL: 55.7<\/td>       <td>26.65<\/td>       <td>28.05<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111700087#WRU02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1563"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Strategies","counter":748,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111700087#WRU02600"},{"type":"question","counter":749,"qnumday":286,"qnumall":"[56336\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111700087#WRU02700","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the role her Department plays in the delivery of the National Drugs Strategy.","asker":"1453","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":750,"content":"<p>My officials have regular engagement with the Department of Health regarding the National Drugs Strategy.  My Department is represented on its Oversight Group and recently participated in the mid-term review of the strategy.<\/p>  <p>  The strategy is relevant to my Department's work in the community and voluntary sectors as it is vital in ensuring the collective input of the statutory, community and voluntary sectors, to provide a coordinated response to drug and alcohol use in Irish society.<\/p>  <p>  The strategy also involves mobilising communities and building their resilience to respond to the drug problem, particularly marginalised communities.  This links well with my Department&rsquo;s Social Inclusion &amp;amp; Community Activation Programme (SICAP) which supports those hardest to reach, and those who are most at risk of marginalisation. <\/p>  <p>  The Department has two main goals within the strategy, which relate to providing community supports in collaboration with schools and other youth programmes, and improving the life chances of those that are marginalised in society.   Both goals are implemented under SICAP which provides &euro;200m to Local Development Companies over six years to work with marginalised individuals and groups.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to assist with the important work of the National Drugs Strategy into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111700087#WRU02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1563"}]
