I assure the House that we are doing everything in our power to tackle this problem.  As the Deputy is aware, I established the national homeless action committee, which I chair and which is made up of representatives from my Department, all the State agencies and the NGOs, to ensure that we address prevention and exits from homelessness.  In addition to the measures already in place, to get to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific question, I am working with my Government colleagues and with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to provide for an increase in the housing assistance payment, HAP, discretionary rate to 35%.  This has been agreed by the Government and will be implemented shortly.  The couple&rsquo;s rate will also be extended to single persons for new tenancies.  This again is another significant change and it will secure more tenancies and prevent more entries into homelessness.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, in the Seanad this week, I will bring forward some changes to the notice-to-quit period to alleviate some of these pressures.  The Government also recently approved a pilot expansion that will open the repair and lease scheme to a wider range of owners.  These properties will be available for social housing.  My Department has also approved the reintroduction of the place finder fee incentive by the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive, DRHE.  This will be payable where suitable properties are made available exclusively to homeless families through the DRHE place finders team and not advertised on websites or elsewhere.  Targeted measures such as these, along with the provision of more homes, and the crucial point is that we must increase the supply of social homes, are key to meeting the challenge of eradicating homelessness.  To this end, as the Deputy will know, we are investing significantly in social and affordable housing, with record funding allocated for current and capital expenditure this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300003#A00500","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1655971200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Monday is the second anniversary of the formation of this Government and of the Minister being elevated to his portfolio.  In these two years, homelessness has increased by 16%.  Since the Covid-19 related ban on evictions was ended last April, we have seen a 24% increase in the official figures for homelessness.  We are perilously close to having 5,000 single adults in emergency accommodation, which would be the highest figure since records began.  We have also had an alarming increase, not under the auspices of the Minister&rsquo;s Department, but that of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, of former asylum applicants who got their leave to remain here but who are now trapped in direct provision, which is essentially being used as emergency accommodation.  Our hotel system is also enormously overstretched.<\/p>  <p>  The modest changes the Minister has made to the HAP are welcome, but they can only work if there are HAP properties available to rent, which there are not.  Likewise, the changes to the notice-to-quit period, while welcome, are not going to change the fundamental problem of an accelerating level of notices to quit and presentations in this regard.  What I would like to hear from the Minister is something that gives an indication of the urgency of the crisis we are facing over the summer, and the minor measures the Minister has announced so far do not do that.

The regulations prescribe maximum net income limits for each local authority in different bands according to the area concerned, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard household means policy.  The income bands, and the authority area assigned to each band, were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation throughout the country.  A blanket increase of &euro;5,000 was also introduced prior to the new system coming into operation.<\/p><p>Net income is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, universal social charge and additional superannuation contribution.  The policy provides for a range of income disregards.  Local authorities may disregard temporary, short-term or once-off income.  Determining whether an applicant household meets the income criteria is now based on its preceding 12 months' net average income prior to receipt of the application.  This ensures the most comprehensive picture of a household's current and previous income is available when the eligibility assessment is carried out.  It also better reflects the long-term nature of social housing supports and in doing so ensures fairness and equity in the system and that those with a continuing long-term need are prioritised.  Eligibility may be reviewed by a local authority, for example, at the point of allocating support.  Households are generally removed from the housing list if they exceed the income limits.  They may re-apply for social housing at any stage but, if deemed eligible on re-application, they are not re-instated to their previous position on the list.<\/p><p>Housing for All - A New Housing Plan for Ireland was published in September 2021 and, as part of a broad suite of social housing reforms, committed to reviewing income eligibility for social housing.  The review, which examined <i>inter alia<\/i>the efficiency of the current banding model and income limits applicable to local authorities, has been completed.  The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, is considering its findings and recommendations.  The review is being considered in the context of our affordable housing scheme and cost rental scheme, the amendment to Part V from 10% to 20% social housing and all of the affordability measures available in the State in the new Housing for All package.  Local authorities have discretion on short-term or one-off income that can be disregarded when assessing a housing application.  The key priority for the Government is to ensure the most vulnerable get the support they need.  The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, will shortly make recommendations from the review.<\/p><p>Those on the list who, further to a review by the local authority, fail to meet the criteria and subsequently reapply will be reinstated at the position they had previously on the list.  This is very important reassurance for people.  Looking back over the previous 12 months is the fairest system to ensure that all income is captured.

I absolutely appreciate it will take some significant assessment to determine to what level it is increased and how that is operated across local authorities.  I do not believe, however, that it should take six months to make those decisions given that the work will have been done by the Department.<\/p>  <p>  I appeal to the Minister and the Minister of State to come back with a formal recommendation as a matter of urgency.  It is simply not acceptable for a working family on a hard income who have waited eight, nine or ten years on the list, to have to then decide whether to give up a promotion or some increased permanent overtime to keep their position there, or take that extra money to deal with the cost of living crisis and lose their social housing position and, ultimately, be worse off because they have to pay rents.  This needs a decision this summer and I urge the Minister and the Minister of State to take that decision and announce it, for the good of all of those families affected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300008#F00100","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1655974200,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I will go one further and argue with the Minister that he has a duty to publish that review, having sat on it for six months.

There are various schemes in the Housing for All policy which are really an attempt to reinvent the wheel.  What we need is a massive investment in public housing that gives access to the housing list to those who need it and we need to stop, in the cruel way which the Government has been doing, knocking people off the housing list because their income increases.  Sometimes their income increases by a very marginal amount after having waited for ten or 12 years on the housing list.  This is not acceptable.  We have dozens of families and maybe more, throughout the Oireachtas, coming to us with this problem.  It is absolutely heartbreaking.  It is argued that Housing for All or cost rental will resolve it.  They do not and will not resolve it.  What also impacts on this is that people get no housing supports whatsoever once they are off list.  They do not get HAP or RAS or income supports to help them be rehoused.  That is why we have working families consistently ending up in homeless accommodation.  It is outrageous.

There are hearings today that the Oireachtas joint committee will hold with residents affected, along with experts who have fed into this highly significant work.  I certainly look forward to listening to those contributions.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that the Bill will allow us to progress on key decisions made by the Government last November, including a 100% grant, to an overall maximum grant amount payable to an applicant under the scheme in the sum of &euro;420,000, up from &euro;247,500.  There is the removal of the financial barrier to scheme entry, a feature of the current scheme, thereby reducing the cost for homeowners from up to &euro;7,000 to an estimated &euro;500 or &euro;700, which will be recoupable under the scheme once the applications are approved.  We have already been issuing refunds of those payments that have been made.  Counties Clare and Limerick will be included in the enhanced scheme upon commencement and further local authority areas can be added as the necessary evidence supports inclusion.<\/p>  <p>  To get to the point of the question, the decision made by the Government last November called for a number of reviews to be completed, which are very important.  The scheme will be with us for ten or 15 years.  This included a review of the IS 465:2018 standard and the consideration of the issue of other potentially deleterious material, such as pyrrhotite and the impact, if any, on foundations.  I am acutely aware of homeowners' concerns in this regard, which is why I have asked the NSAI to review IS 465 and carry out all necessary research as a matter of priority.  I briefed Deputy &Oacute; Broin informally on this earlier.  It is currently understood that foundations are not impacted and there is currently no evidence to support claims they are.  However, when the Bill is published, if there are issues with foundations, we will revisit the scheme and amend the legislation accordingly.  That is very important.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to confirm that once the necessary review has been concluded and any revised standard is published, the defective concrete blocks grant scheme will be reviewed at that point, having regard to any amended standard.  We need to conclude the research being done independently of me and we need scientific data to support this work.  If the standard at that point provides for the inclusion of foundations, the Bill provides that I will be able to make regulations to provide for a new remediation option.  That will be seen later today.  If foundations in some homes are found to be impacted, we will not be slow to act.  I have kept my word heretofore in greatly enhancing the scheme and putting much more resources behind it.  There is a 40-year guarantee as opposed to a 20-year guarantee and a second grant option.  The alternative to this approach would be to wait until the NSAI did the work and to pause the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will see very clearly in the legislation that we will be allowing for further regulations once the evidence comes back.  It is being done scientifically and independent of me.  If there is a problem with foundations then, we will amend the scheme by regulation and include a relevant provision in the scheme.  Not every house will be affected and there will be homes where other materials have not been found in the infill.  We can proceed with a number of them and we should do that.  We must get people's homes and lives back on track.

There is the upping of the caps as well.  At a minimum, more than likely we are looking at the State providing, rightly so, about &euro;2.7 billion to help people get their lives and homes back.<\/p>  <p>  The Society of Chartered Surveyors of Ireland, SCSI, will be presenting to the committee today and I do not want to prejudge what it will say about the work it has done.  I commend its work heretofore.  The committee will also hear from Paul Forde, chair of the expert group.  He did an incredible amount of work and is definitely the most eminent expert in this field in the country.  The standards and the material itself are being tested independently and scientifically so we can be very clear that it is not just opinion.  I am not dismissing people's fears at all.  That is being done.  I cannot speed it up.  This work is being done independently of us.

The idea of taxpayers' money going into building a structure on foundations that are at least questionable and are not even being tested is a serious issue.

I will give the Deputy the official response as to what the target is.  Applications for social housing support are assessed by the relevant local authority in accordance with eligibility and need criteria set down in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  The regulations require that local authorities, subject to conditions, deal with social housing applications within 12 weeks.  Local authorities prioritise housing needs assessments for those in greatest need and seek to process their applications within that prescribed timeframe.  Some applications are taking longer than 12 weeks.  I have had that experience myself.  That can be for various reasons including incomplete information provided or simply the level of work that is there.  Housing assistance payment application processing times vary across local authorities.  I discussed this last night with officials to see if we can make sure there is more consistency in the timeframes.  Applications are only accepted when the relevant sections are fully completed by the tenant and the landlord and returned to the local authority with the required supporting documentation.  My Department and local authorities absolutely recognise the importance of minimising HAP processing times.  I have been at pains to reiterate that to my colleagues in local government.  We recognise the importance of keeping processing times under review at a local level so they are minimised to the greatest extent possible.  Last year, we tracked the average processing time for HAP applications.  At the end of 2021 that average was 29 days.  To be honest with the Deputy, in some areas it is done better than in others.  I want to see more consistency.  All applications are not uniform in the sense that cases are different.  The Deputy has raised a very important matter.

In my view, it is possible to solve a significant amount of the issues that have been raised, predominantly by the Unionist community and business leaders in Northern Ireland, in terms of how we approach this issue in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300012#K00900","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1655976600,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and I totally agree with what he has said.

I have worked closely with Adrian O'Neill, our current ambassador to London, since he took up his post in September 2017.  This has been an especially busy period in British-Irish relations, which has seen the UK leave the EU and enter into a new post-Brexit relationship with the latter and Ireland.  In this period, the ambassador, Mr. O'Neill supported the 17 in-person visits I have made to Great Britain.  During these visits, the ambassador generally accompanies me for meetings with British Government representatives as well as with other political, Irish community, commercial or cultural contacts.  He often meets me separately, or together with other embassy staff in the course of programmes.  On a regular basis the ambassador also participates in calls and virtual meetings with high-level British contacts.  Such forms of engagement were particularly important in 2020 and 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  In the second half of 2020, the Ambassador facilitated and participated in a number of calls with British Ministers and a virtual visit by the metropolitan mayors of Greater Manchester and the Liverpool City regions.  I also hold weekly video calls with the Mr. O'Neill and other senior officials from across my Department to discuss the outworkings of Brexit.  I also meet occasionally with the ambassador at the Department of Foreign Affairs headquarters and at major British-Irish events in Ireland, including those that take place during official high-level inward visits from Britain.<\/p>  <p>  The role of our diplomatic network in Great Britain is especially important at this time as we work to advance Irish interests in a period of change and challenge, and seek to continue to strengthen British-Irish relations in the post-Brexit era.

Passport service figures show that less than 1% of all applicants use the in-person urgent appointment service available at the Passport Office in Dublin and Cork.  Given the high percentage of applicants using Passport Online, I am confident that the range of service options available meets the current needs of passport applicants. Furthermore, recent service improvements allow the passport service to provide this essential citizen service in an efficient and effective manner.<\/p><p>At the moment, the priority is the turnaround time and getting passports to people on time.  I am not ruling out extending our footprint to other parts of the island of Ireland, either Northern Ireland, the west or the north west.  I recognise that it is a long drive to from somewhere like Donegal or Sligo to either Dublin or Cork to get an urgent appointment.  To be honest, we are trying to move the whole system online in order that no matter where people apply from, they can get an efficient service.  That needs to be the focus for now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300014#M01200","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1655977800,"counter":173,"content":"<p>The Minister said he is not ruling out increasing the footprint across the country, but let us take the example of somebody living in Clifden who needs an emergency passport.<\/p>  <p>He or she travels through the county and arrives in Ballinasloe, halfway to Dublin but not having left the county.

Rather than going through a long recruitment process, which takes time, we have instead linked in with the HSE to get large numbers of contact tracers to come onto the passport call line system.  That is the most efficient way of doing it within the Civil Service and the public sector.  That only started this week.  The public will see a significant improvement in service this week.  Even if one goes to the Cork office, the passports are not printed there, so the urgent appointments system in Cork gives a four-day turnaround rather than a one-day turnaround.

That would broaden the service geographically in terms of where people can apply for passports and so on.  The fact is that passports are printed in Dublin.  When I was Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, people told me that if we moved the whole farm payments online, many farmers would be unable to deal with that because they do not have broadband connections and all the rest of it.  For many years now, all farmers have successfully been applying for their payments online.  It is the only way in which one can do so.  We need to get to a point where everybody applying for a passport does so online, but we have to make sure there are facilities available for those who do not have connections in their homes to be able to do that in the locality and so on.  The online system is so much more efficient.  It is much easier for me to intervene or for the Oireachtas call centre to do so in important cases if there is an online file on which one can intervene.  Paper-based applications are much more complex to deal with because they involve physical piles of paper through which one has to search for a certain application.  That is difficult when one is dealing with thousands of applications every day.  This is a system that is evolving and changing.  It has experienced extraordinary demand this year and, by and large, we have dealt with that, with some obvious exceptions where things have gone wrong.  It is improving by the week.

The passport service is continually working to deliver enhanced customer experience and service delivery <font color=\"#101000\">to <\/font>our citizens.  As we all know, it has been under a lot of pressure this year.  It is experiencing an unprecedented volume of demand for passports.  This is as a direct result of pent-up demand for travel after two years of pandemic-related restrictions.<\/p><p>This level of demand is not unique to Ireland.<\/p> <p>In countries such as the UK and the US, the turnaround time for all types of passports can be up to ten weeks and that is increasing, rather than decreasing.  Our passport service has managed to decrease the processing time for first-time online applications from 40 working days to 25 working days in just four months.  Additionally, almost half of adult online renewals, which are the vast majority of passport applications, are processed within two working days.  Our passport service is performing at its highest capacity ever and is producing an average of 6,000 passports every day.<\/p> <p> To achieve these types of results and to continue to improve the service, my Department has made a huge investment in the passport service.  In terms of staffing, more than 400 staff have been assigned to the passport service since June 2021, including 120 in recent weeks.  The addition of these staff has allowed the passport service to maintain its current turnaround times in the face of enormous levels of demand.  In addition to significantly more staff being assigned, the passport service has made three important improvements that will assist our customers in ensuring their passport applications are correct and can be processed without delay.<\/p> <p> Many of the new staff have been assigned to the customer service hub and this will greatly increase the number of calls and web chats being answered and will assist with customers getting access to the information they need.  This is important because many members of the public contact the offices of Deputies when they are utterly frustrated that they cannot get through to the passport office by phone.  We are acting to address this issue and to put a much bigger system in place, which will involve many more people answering calls, to provide a better service for the public in this regard.  I referred to this aspect earlier.<\/p> <p> Additionally, the passport service released two online video guides that provide tips to ensure that passport photos and witnessed consent forms for children are correctly submitted.  We have had to improve communications in this area because there were many examples of incorrect applications.  This is not about blaming the public.  It is about asking ourselves how we can communicate better to ensure that these mistakes are not made, because they delay everything.  Passport photos and witnessed consent forms are some of the main reasons that an application may be delayed, so it is important that customers have all the information they need to ensure that these are submitted correctly.  It is our job to ensure that communications improve in this regard.  These easy-to-follow video guides are available on my Department's website and social media channels and I encourage all applicants to watch them before they submit their applications.<\/p> <p> My Department is also currently running a national radio and print public information campaign reminding our citizens to check their passports and to apply online.  This campaign also offers tips to ensure that applications are correct and complete.  The campaign is running in ten national newspapers and on national and local radio in Ireland, as well as in Northern Ireland, by the way.<\/p> <p> The passport service is experiencing a significant level of demand.  I am glad to say, however, that the indications are that demand is already starting to decrease.  Initial forecasts for the end of this month show the number of applications received in June may decrease by up to one third from last month.  We expect to see demand level off and to return to more normal levels in the coming months and into next year.<\/p> <p> Regarding Deputy Griffin's question concerning a passport printer being located in Cork, this is not currently under consideration, given that passport demand is now starting to decrease.  There is a question concerning the financial cost of this, given the resourcing we must focus on other areas, such as customer service, efficiency, call centres, etc.  I am not going to rule this possibility out, however, and if it makes sense to do it, then we will.  My understanding, though, is that turnaround times are not being delayed predominantly because of printing times.  We have high-capacity printers in Dublin delivering great numbers of passports by the hour.  The delays in getting passports to people who need them on time result predominantly from processing times and the need to answer queries, correct applications that have documentation that must be added to or corrected, etc.<\/p> <p> In answer to questions from Deputies Griffin and Aindrias Moynihan regarding the checking of applications as soon as they are received, this is simply a question of the volume of applications currently being submitted.  When applications are received, they enter a queue and are checked in order of the date they are received.  We do not know and cannot predict which ones will be problematic, if the Deputies understand what I mean.  The applications come in and then each one is checked based on delivering a passport in time for the turnover times we have set.  Therefore, when we get to a passport application and there is a problem with it in respect of witness consent documentation or a photograph that needs to change or be corrected, or whatever, then that of course, causes a delay.  We have worked hard to ensure that the clock does not start again on turnaround times and that, instead, after a file has been corrected, we deliver a passport within 15 working days of that happening.  We are actually trying to shorten this time further.  People will know that I have intervened, and that the Oireachtas call line has also intervened, in urgent cases to try to ensure that people can get their passports in time for when they need them.  This is, essentially, the position.<\/p> <p> Passport Online is continuing to expand and is now available to 97% of our citizens around the world.  Most recently, Passport Online has been rolled out to first-time applicants in the United Arab Emirates, UAE, Afghanistan, Kuwait and Qatar.  The availability of Passport Online worldwide will continue to enhance customer experience and deliver even more efficiencies for the passport service.  If there is one thing that I want the public to hear, it is that if people are applying for a passport or to renew a passport, then please do so online.  That will enable us to try to get the passport back to people as quickly as we possibly can.  Equally, if a mistake is made, then we can make the corrections much faster if an application is made online.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300016#O01900","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655979600,"counter":204,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the huge efforts that have been made by the Minister and his Department to try to address the difficulties that people have been facing.

Unfortunately, some people did not get their passports in time.  Most do, but it is last-minute stuff and it is terribly stressful for people who are, in many cases, looking for a little bit of rest and relaxation after several stressful years.

Regarding the issue of whether there should be the ability to print passports in Cork, it would be a big advantage to the whole Munster area.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue concerns a situation where a family came to me.

Due to the fact that the garda was not present in the station, the application went out of date and the family had to reapply.  This is crazy stuff.

From an international perspective, I would like to separate that information.  It is important we get a full understanding of the position.  My concern relates to the number of mainland UK-based applications, in particular as a consequence of the knock-on effect of Brexit.

I know the issue has put a lot of pressure on the constituency offices of all parties.  A lot of applications from Northern Ireland come through the offices of Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies, if there is a problem.  Likewise, there is a perception among the public that if they contact the constituency office of a Government party member, perhaps they are likely to get to the Minister faster or whatever.  There is a lot of pressure on political offices in regard to passports.<\/p><p>The cases are very stressful.  When someone is crying on the phone and saying he or she will miss a holiday for which he or she has been waiting for two years and has taken out a loan from the credit union or whatever to fund a holiday, it is a big deal to try to solve the problem.  Rarely, but sometimes, it is not possible to solve the issue on time.  Most of the time, from the feedback I have received, the Oireachtas line provides a good service.  Urgent cases often come to my office, and nine times out of ten we get a response that is appropriate and reasonable.  <\/p><p>People have responded in a way that is helpful to me and have made suggestions in terms of how we can improve things.  There are frustrations at times but, by and large, people have recognised that we have extraordinary demand this year and are trying to deal with it by putting a lot more people into the system.  Staffing levels and infrastructure have expanded dramatically in the space of nine or ten months to try to deal with the demand.  I am glad to say that we have now reached the peak and the number of applications is starting to fall quite dramatically.  The second half of the year will be a lot easier, for obvious reasons, because a lot of people needed to get passports before the holiday season starts.<\/p><p>On Deputy Aindrias Moynihan's question on a Cork printer, one of the first questions I asked when I started visiting passport offices was why we did not have a printer in Cork as well as Dublin to try to have a geographical spread and so on.  The answer I received is that the pace of printing we can deliver through the current printers we have is not the problem.  The proof of that is that the current number of applications is between 20% and 30% higher than the previous highest year, and the printers have still delivered.  <\/p><p>The passports that are stuck in the system are stuck not because the printers cannot print fast enough, but because there are other problems or delays, something has gone missing, someone has not been able to answer the phone to respond to a query or whatever.  That is not to say we will never have a printer in Cork.  We have given consideration to a move to a new passport office in Cork.  The current office facilities are not big enough and are not at the standard they need to be in terms of the staff numbers.  We are in the very early process of looking at a relocation and providing a bigger, and perhaps more modern, building for the Passport Service in Cork, something I want to continue to pursue.  We will of course keep printing capacity and where those printers are located under review.  I am not in a position to say that we will move ahead with a printer in Cork at this stage.  <\/p><p>We are trying to focus on the pressure points, namely, turnaround times and facilitating a new software system that can make online applications more efficient and flexible than they are today, while obviously maintaining safety and security to make sure that we guard against fraud and a range of other things, in particular in respect of children.  Sometimes people scoff when I say there are security issues, but there are.  Every week or so, there are cases of people trying to get passports inappropriately, using fraudulent information and so on.  We have robust systems to deal with that but it sometimes delays the process.  Security is really important.<\/p><p>I will follow up on the question on why the system accepts a photograph that is not valid.  That is a fair question and I will get a proper answer to it and try to come back to the Deputy.  The system should be able to differentiate between what is and is not valid at the outset, which would save an awful lot of strife later on.  <\/p><p>On the question raised by Deputy Gould and others on the relationship between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Garda stations when a verification check is required, it is an essential part of ensuring there is no fraud and so on in the system.  We now have new memorandum of understanding between the Passport Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It was agreed over the past number of weeks to have a system that no longer relies on the right garda being in a station and able to pick up the phone to give an answer that is needed to the Passport Service.  What had been happening was that the Passport Service would try to call a Garda station on three separate occasions.  If, after three efforts to do so, it did not get through to the right person or the Garda station, the process had to start all over again.  That was not a good system.  The Garda and we have accepted that, and we have a new system in place, which means the issue will be addressed.  We will not hear about cases of a brother, but not a sister, getting a passport or <i>vice versa<\/i>because the Passport Service did not get through to the right garda in a Garda station at the time the call was made.

Every city, town and county would like to have the convenience of being able to go to pick up emergency passports at short notice locally.  My job, however, is to try to deliver 130,000, 150,000 or 160,000 passports a month and to do so in an efficient way whereby I can stand over the delivery times within which we say we will deliver and to get more than 90% of our passports delivered within those timelines.  For the other 10%, 5%, 2% or 3%, whatever the figure is, where there are issues, we need to turn around those passports and to fix the issues as quickly as we possibly can.<\/p>  <p>  We are doing the systems analysis to which Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referred.  He is right.  This is about systems.  If you are trying to deliver 6,000 passports a day to the public, you cannot have the system we used to have whereby you drop a passport in a box and a Deputy can take a dozen passports home to constituents.  I can understand the attraction of that in the past, but we now have much higher numbers of applications and an expectation on the part of the public that they can apply from their homes - online, on an iPad or a computer at home - and get their passports in two or three working days in the case of a normal, straightforward renewal.  For children, the turnaround time is within 25 working days now.  If you speak to people in other countries about children's passport applications being turned around in 25 working days, most of them think that this is an extraordinary delivery time, given the security checks that are required and so on.  It is not a perfect system but it is not a bad system either.  We will have a lot more flexibility with the new software platform we will have in place this time next year, I hope, or certainly close to that.  We will be testing this time next year, at least.  I am told that the security considerations as to how the Passport Service has to function today will give us a lot more flexibilities to be able to work potentially through a network of social welfare offices, Intreo offices or post offices to provide more passport services to different parts of the country.<\/p>  <p>  A higher percentage of the passport applications from the North are paper applications than in the South.  We need to change that, and I need Members' help in getting the message out to applicants in Northern Ireland that when getting their Irish passports, they should apply online because it is a much more straightforward process.  We are looking at whether we can put some kind of specific web chat function in place for applicants in Northern Ireland to be able to get information for urgent cases and so on.  I have been asked whether or not I could open the Oireachtas line to MLAs in Northern Ireland.

The legal framework for the EU-Israel partnership is provided by the EU-Israel Association Agreement, which has been in force since 2000.  Israel is part of the European Neighbourhood Policy and benefits from various regional programmes under the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument, including in the areas of environment and climate change.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly, the foundation of the EU-Egypt relationship is the association agreement signed in 2004.  An EU-Egypt Association Council was held on 19 June in Luxembourg, chaired by the Egyptian foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry, and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrell. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge that the strong bilateral relationships between the EU and both Israel and Egypt do not prevent either the EU or the member states from voicing their opinions on issues of concern, including regarding human rights and international law, which we do regularly, as the Deputy is aware, with both partners bilaterally and in multilateral fora.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to the territorial applicability of this trilateral agreement, it is established EU policy, reflecting UN Security Council Resolution 2334, that all agreements with Israel unequivocally and explicitly indicate their inapplicability to the territories occupied by Israel since 1967.  The inclusion of a territorial clause is also an important expression of the EU's support for international law and for a negotiated two-state solution.  The territorial clause is included in an annexe to this trilateral agreement.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to say that Ireland and the European Union remain firmly committed to a two-state solution in the Middle East.  The region is part of the EU's neighbourhood.  Helping our neighbours find a solution allowing them to co-exist peacefully is the right thing to do but it is also in our own interest.

The Ombudsman for Children has released a scathing report of the Government's failure on children with special needs who cannot secure appropriate school places come September.  Mr. Muldoon was very clear regarding the seriousness of the situation.  He said the situation is \"a clear failure on the part of the State, which has an obligation to respect, protect and fulfil the right to education of every child.\"  The Ombudsman went further.  He said the failure to provide children with special needs with an appropriate school place is discrimination.<\/p>  <p>  As things stand there are hundreds of children with special needs who do not have an appropriate school place.  Today, on 23 June, we have parents who do not know whether their child will have a place in a school come September.  It is scandalous that children with special needs and their parents are treated in such a way.  The failure of the Government to plan for the school places needed happens year in year out.  We can speak about the statistics all day but behind all of these numbers are human stories of stress, worry and heartbreak.  Take Aaron's story for example.  He is 12 years old and has a dual diagnosis of autism and intellectual disability.  This was identified in his early years.  He went on to early intervention, preschool and a special school.  Recently he graduated from his special school.  He has no place to progress to in September.  He is 12 years of age with nowhere to go.  Aaron's mother said that in her opinion the Department of Education and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, did not engage in forward planning to ensure Aaron and his classmates had a right to education that was guaranteed.  She said that even if he was accepted now there would be no opportunity for a transitionary programme for him to familiarise with the new school environment.  She said that Aaron is confused about his future.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, Aaron's story is not isolated.  There are children and families the length and breadth of the State who are in the same situation, particularly in blackspots such as Cork, Dublin and the midlands.  We know the courts have ruled that the failure to provide children with special needs an appropriate school place is a breach of their legal rights yet every year we are faced with this appalling situation.  The Department scrambles for school places and parents and their children are left in the lurch.  It is a result of a complete failure to plan on the part of the Government.  It is even more frustrating when we consider that the NCSE has the data and information to get this right but here we are once again.<\/p>  <p>  This is an emergency for every one of these children and their families.  Children with special needs and their families need action and they need it now.  The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, who accepts, in fairness, that this is discrimination by the State, has thrown out a few possible solutions but there is still real confusion as to what will happen.  The section 37A process, which takes 13 months, needs to be shortened to guarantee an appropriate school place for these children in September.  There are three weeks left in the D&aacute;il term.  Will the Government pass emergency legislation to make sure this happens?  Sinn F&eacute;in will support the Government in trying to meet this objective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300021#T00300","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1655982000,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue, which I know is causing a lot of angst and worry to families throughout the State, including in my constituency of Dublin West.  I have read the Ombudsman's report.  The Government accepts the criticisms being made.  We are committed to ensuring that every single child with special educational needs has access to education.  One child who does not have a school place is one child too many in our view.  We are prioritising children who have special educational needs.  We have a dedicated Minister of State for special education for the first time and &euro;1 in every &euro;4 spent on education is spent on children with special needs.  We have more special needs assistants, special education teachers and more special classrooms in mainstream schools than ever before.  We have new special schools in Dublin 15 and in Cork.  I absolutely appreciate this is cold comfort, indeed no comfort at all, to families and children who do not have a place for September.  Every day that goes by they get more and more worried about what will happen in September when they need a school place.<\/p>  <p>  I know the Minister of State is redoubling her efforts with the Department to make sure this is sorted out in the next few weeks so that parents have peace of mind that their child will have a place in school in September.  This is absolutely what we are working towards.  I am not aware of any plans at present for special legislation on this but I will take on board the Deputy's offer of full co-operation from Sinn F&eacute;in should it be required.  As I mentioned, this year we will spend in excess of &euro;2 billion, 25% of the Department's budget, on special needs.  This is a 60% increase over the past ten years.  Budget 2022 provided for the creation of 287 additional special classes for the school year.  These will provide 1,700 new places from September next.  This is a very significant increase in places.  The difficulty is that the projection has been exceeded and 1,800 additional places in 312 special classes will be needed in 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300021#T00400","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1655982000,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for his response.

The T&aacute;naiste is absolutely right that his words and statistics are cold comfort and no comfort to any family.  Today there are 106 children who do not know whether they will have a school place in September.  Aaron's mother nailed it on the head.  Even if they get a place children with autism must go through a transitionary programme.  It is crucial that the children know the surroundings and has familiarity with the school they will enter.  Sometimes they need to meet the teachers beforehand.  This year again we have a failure to plan.  How many years will we have to listen to Ministers accept the State is involved in discrimination against children with special needs?  How many years will we have to hear Ministers and T&aacute;naist&iacute; stand up to say it is wrong and they are hoping to get it right?  This has been going on for years.

The need for this sort legislation has become patently clear in recent weeks and months.  That need has been clear for a long time for the parents of children with autism who have been waiting for so long to see proper and effective provision made for their children.<\/p>  <p>  Last weekend, I had the pleasure of attending a training session involving Ranelagh Rockets, the brilliant initiative of the Ranelagh Gaels GAA club in my area which works with children with autism and provides one-on-one coaching.  However, I heard there, as we have all heard throughout the country, about the immense anguish and frustration that many parents are experiencing because they cannot secure appropriate school places for their children and as a result of the immense delays involved.  These issues were highlighted just this week in the report of the Ombudsman for Children, which indicates that the Department of Education is failing children with special educational needs.  The ombudsman estimates that as many as 15,500 children have to travel outside their local catchment areas every day because there is nowhere available for them in their communities.<\/p>  <p>  We all know the parents.  On RT&Eacute; just yesterday, we heard the story of Gareth, a young boy from Athlone who is finishing primary school next week but who cannot secure a secondary school place near him because he is autistic.  His mother, Michelle, spoke powerfully about the toll that this has taken on her child.  He has stopped attending class altogether because he feels that there is just no point.  He is not alone.  Some estimates indicate that nearly 270 children in Ireland are without school places for this coming September.  We know many more who are waiting for diagnostic assessments to allow them to qualify for school places in the first instance.  We are approaching the end of the primary school year.  We are approaching the end of June, and we are only beginning to hear now about processes being invoked by the Minister and the Government.<\/p>  <p>  The Ombudsman for Children's report was prompted by the actions of parents.  The great group, Involve Autism D6 &amp;amp; D6W &amp;amp; Surrounds, is based in my constituency.  Its chairperson, Miriam Kenny, has spoken out powerfully about how the group had to lodge a complaint with the ombudsman to get things moving.  That complaint was lodged because of the lack of autism classroom places in Dublin 6 and Dublin 6W despite the existence of the section 37A process.<\/p>  <p>  It is simply not good enough for parents and children to hear that processes are now being invoked this late in the school year and to still lack any clarity or certainty about whether they will be able to attend school anywhere near where they live this September or whether they will be able to attend school at all.  The Ombudsman for Children's report is clear that the current failures in the system amount to discrimination against children with special educational needs, especially those with autism.  We know that other jurisdictions do so much better than us.  They have proper planning in place and they know the numbers of places required.  We are failing children.  Is the T&aacute;naiste in a position to give any clarification as to school places for those awaiting them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300022#U00200","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1655982600,"counter":245,"content":"<p>As stated earlier, I have had the chance to read the ombudsman's report.  The Government accepts the criticisms that are being made.  The report acknowledges some of the changes that have been made in the past two years, especially with regard to future planning.  Use of such planning will mean that in future years we will not face the problems we have been facing for the past couple of years whereby parents do not know if there is a place available for their child until very late in the day.  That is not acceptable, and it is something we are working on.  We very much have an emergency situation in which approximately 100 children do not have school places - as yet - for this September.<\/p>  <p>  I am always reluctant to discuss individual cases in the D&aacute;il but I understand that in Gareth's case, an additional special class is now being provided in Athlone.  That will be an option for him.  I hope that will resolve that issue to the satisfaction of his parents.<\/p>  <p>  I look forward to seeing Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's legislation.  We will, of course, give it special consideration.  Perhaps it can be considered by the new special committee on autism that has been established under the chairmanship of Senator Carrigy.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the wider issue raised by Deputy Doherty earlier in terms of emergency legislation, section 37A is currently being reviewed within the context of the review of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 - the EPSEN Act - to establish whether the process can be streamlined to ensure that sufficient specialist places can be made available in a more efficient manner.  The review is being conducted by way of engaging with those who are part of the process, including the NCSE, Department officials and schools, in order to take into account the cases where section 37A has been used and the effectiveness for the child.  In addition, the advisory group for the overall EPSEN Act review will have an opportunity to submit its views.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is separately considering whether there is a need to introduce new emergency legislation to assist in securing additional special educational needs provision.  The Department has engaged with the Office of the Attorney General to discuss this matter.  This work will consider whether new legislation would assist in expediting the existing section 37A process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300022#U00300","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1655982600,"counter":246,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for the response in respect of the individual case I raised.

It is simply not good enough to hear that the Attorney General's advice is being sought and that amendments of the section 37A process are being considered.  This is too little, too late for those who are currently unclear as to whether their child will have a school place or even an appropriate school place for this September.<\/p>  <p>  Even where we see provision made, the lack of wraparound supports and the additional measures necessary is very evident.  I had the pleasure of visiting St. Francis Special School in Portlaoise earlier this week.  I heard about the need, even there, for the additional supports to be present.  I am also conscious that with regard to special needs assistants, SNAs, the exceptional review process is simply not working as it should.  I pay tribute to F&oacute;rsa's campaign to ensure decent recognition of the immensely important work that SNAs do in providing those additional supports.

It is much better if therapists are in and employed by schools and are present on-site, perhaps shared among schools, rather than being off-site with the HSE because that inevitably leads to children ending up on waiting lists.

On one hand, there was the Ireland of the highly paid and the rich.  In this case, I am referring to the top 1% of civil servants who are on &euro;150,000 or more a year.  The Government was out across the media to justify pay increases of &euro;15,000, &euro;20,000, &euro;30,000 or more for some of the highest earners in the country.  Secretaries General of Departments will get a raise of almost &euro;40,000.  This will bring their total pay up to &euro;250,000 per year.  The total annual cost of these increases will be &euro;60 million.  On the other hand, the Government had a very different message for low- and middle-income workers.  There will be no immediate pay increase in July.  The Government did not say it will have to do something about their pay because it is legally bound to do so.  No.  The message to the low- and middle-income workers is that they will have to wait and that there will be no action until the budget.  There is an insulting pay offer to public sector workers, which amounts to 3.5% in a year at a time when inflation stands at 8%.  In other words, workers are being asked to sign up for a significant pay cut.<\/p>  <p>  This morning the ESRI warned that Irish households face the biggest drop in living standards since the 2008 crisis, but the Government continues to say it can do precious little.  That is a political choice.  A different choice is entirely possible.  The Government says it is bound by the 2017 legislation.  That is legislation against which People before Profit voted.  However, the Government could bring in new legislation next Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday.  It can say there continues to be a financial emergency for ordinary people and the one in three people who are living in energy poverty and say that it will not, at the moment, pay the already well-paid even more.<\/p> <p>Workers in both the public sector and the private sector need a pay rise.  If they do not get a raise equal to or higher than the rate of inflation, they will experience a cut in their living standards.<\/p> <p> There is a reason that Mick Lynch, the leader of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers has become such a popular figure, including in this country.  Not only is he unflappable in the face of ridiculous right-wing media questioning, he also represents the fact that when workers are struggling, they look at the idea that when they get organised, they have power.  That is what we need to see here in order to see wage increases being won.  Instead of massive pay increases for the top 1%, the Government needs to take action now to protect low- and middle-income workers from the cost of living and housing crises.  We need price controls on essential goods to stop the spiralling costs.  We need wage increases at least equal to the rate of inflation for public and private sector workers.  We must raise the minimum wage immediately to raise the wage floor for all.

It is the reversal of pay cuts that happened more than ten years ago.  Ten or 12 years ago, there were pay cuts across the board in the public sector.  Those on the highest salaries had the deepest pay cuts for the longest period.  This is the last group that is having its pay restored.  It is not a pay increase; it is the reversal of a pay cut and pay restoration.  If it was any other group involved, that is how the Deputy would describe it.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy stated that these people are civil servants.  Again, that is not factually correct.  Some 90% of them are doctors.  Those doctors are public servants.  They are working in our public hospital system.  If I accompanied the Deputy to one of the maternity hospitals throughout the State today, the only person who would not have had his or her pay restored would be the one who performed a caesarean section at 4 a.m.  If I accompanied him to one of the busy accident and emergency departments in any of our public hospitals, the only person who would not have had his or her pay restored would be the consultant doing the rounds and trying to get patients off trolleys and into beds.  If I accompanied him to the children's hospital in Crumlin, just down the road from here, and we went to the orthopaedic operating theatre, the only person there who would not have had pay restored would be the person performing the scoliosis operation.  These are people who are hard to recruit and retain.  They are well sought after around the world.  They are the last people to have their pay restored.  That is what is happening.  The way the Deputy tried to represent the position is simply non-factual.<\/p>  <p>  On the wider issue of public sector pay, the Government believes that all public servants deserve a pay increase.  We have already agreed a pay increase of between 2% and 3% this year, plus or minus an increment, and we accept that is not enough in light of the cost of living.  That is why we are engaging with public sector unions on an agreement for a better pay increase than that, not just for this year but also for next year.  As the unions rightly point out, there are three elements to this.  It is not just about how much somebody is paid; it is about how much he or she gets to take home after tax and how far the money goes.  That is what the unions refer to as the social wage.  The space is there for an agreement if we take into account those three aspects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300023#V00200","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1655983200,"counter":251,"content":"<p>When is a pay increase not a pay increase?

Over the next 12 months, they will take home &euro;250,000 each.  In anybody's money, that is a pretty significant pay increase year on year.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the points relating to hospitals, the truth is if we want to attract and retain health professionals, we need to have pay equality in the health service.  We should not overwork staff in the overly pressurised environment of our currently underfunded health service.  We need to tackle the housing crisis and get people to come work in a national health service.  That is the answer and what the studies show.  People do not need to be on &euro;250,000 a year to do a job in our health service.  People will want to work in our health service if they feel they can contribute to a real public service.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is moving immediately to increase the pay of the highest earners and saying to ordinary people that they have to wait.

One thing I have to say is that I respect his sincerity.  He believes in an ideology, namely, socialism, and I respect that.  Nevertheless, he made two statements that are totally wrong.  He mentioned price controls.  We know the world over what happens when price controls are introduced.  We end up with supply problems and rationing.  It is what happened in the Soviet Union, eastern Europe and other places when it was tried.  I also heard the Deputy say we should have a maximum wage and nobody should earn more than &euro;150,000 a year.  That is fair enough; that is the Deputy's view but I disagree with it.  If that happened, there would be a brain drain of talent from the State.  It is what happens in socialist countries around the world when they attempt this.  We would see investment from multinationals and foreign direct investment either dying off and, perhaps, being removed altogether.  The cake would then get smaller and there would be less for everyone.

The company has since left the country voluntarily.  It posted a profit of &euro;1 billion in the first quarter of this year.  I can provide an example of a business whose owners I have spoken with about Iberdrola.  It is Black Donkey Brewery in Ballinlough.  The company finished its previous electricity contract .  To enter a new one would, with the increase in electricity costs, have been 145% more than it paid before.  In February, the brewery signed the contract with the electricity company in question.  In March, the brewery started to have its electricity provided by this company, having used what is called a green energy provider to see where it could get the best price.  Everything was going okay.<\/p>  <p>  Funnily enough, Black Donkey Brewery heard via the media - I emphasise that it was via the media - that Iberdrola had left Ireland.  The brewery received no word of this from the supplier.  The owners went to their green energy supplier, not knowing what was happening, to see if they could get another supplier.  Bord G&aacute;is Energy was the only supplier that would provide electricity.  Its cheapest rate was 16% higher than they were previously paying.  The owners decided to sign a contract with that supplier but, lo and behold, a month later, they received a letter from the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities, CRU, stating that Electric Ireland would be taking over Iberdrola's contracts and that customers would be obliged to pay 30% more than they had agreed in their original contracts.  Those affected cannot get out of these contracts until 1 September 2022.<\/p>  <p>  The data has been transferred without consent from the company in question.  Everything about it has been given to Electric Ireland, and the CRU has done nothing about this.  One part of the contract signed by the brewery states clearly that Iberdrola would have to give one month's notice, but this seems to have been bypassed completely.  With the 145% increase and the subsequent rise in electricity costs, the brewery is facing close to 200% of an increase in electricity prices in September.  Why is this happening and what is the CRU doing?<\/p> <p>How can this be tolerated?  In my book, a contract is a contract.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300023#V00500","speaker":"1508","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655983800,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I am informed that on 31 May, Iberdrola announced that it would be exiting the market in a controlled exit.  I understand that while the company is profitable globally, it was not profitable when it came to its Irish operations.  The supplier of last resort protocol was introduced.  That is managed by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU.  The primary objective is to ensure that customers' electricity and gas supply is not interrupted.  Under this, all customers of exiting suppliers are transferred to the standard tariff of that gas or electricity supplier.  Electric Ireland and Bord G&aacute;is Energy as suppliers of last resort for electricity and gas, respectively, were directed by the CRU to take over the electricity and gas supply of Iberdrola customers.  ESB Networks and Gas Networks Ireland transferred the customers to Electric Ireland and Bord G&aacute;is Energy with no interruption to power or gas supplies.<\/p>  <p>  Customers will remain with the supplier of last resort until 31 August 2022.  The customer will then be free to switch from 1 September 2022.  However, once the transfer process is complete, customers can renegotiate the standard tariffs with Electric Ireland and Bord G&aacute;is Energy, both of which offer competitive rates.  This is the same for business customers.  The CRU has indicated that customers who were in the process of switching from their old supplier may need to check with their new supplier that the switch has been completed correctly.  This is because when the customers are being moved from the existing supplier, any switches currently in process may be cancelled as part of the technical transfer to the supplier of last resort.  The duration of term is determined by a number of factors, including the large volume of customers transferring, the requirement to purchase additional energy in the short term on the wholesale market and to allow adequate time to facilitate the registering of customers and the issuing of bills.<\/p>  <p>  As Iberdrola made a commercial decision to exit the Irish market, it requested it be done through the supplier of last resort process as it was commercially unsustainable for it to continue to operate in Ireland.  The timing of the decision taken by Iberdrola to leave the Irish market unfortunately left a limited window for its customers to switch supplier.  While both Bord G&aacute;is Energy and Electric Ireland will write to domestic customers within this period to offer them the opportunity to take a contract on discounted or improved rates, the key message to all customers is to contact Electric Ireland or Bord G&aacute;is Energy once they have been transferred and have received communication from the new suppliers.  If the customers do not wish to avail of the renegotiated rate, they can of course switch.  The electricity and gas supplier handbook, which was recently updated by the CRU, states that the standard terms and conditions must include that a customer's personal information may be transferred to a supplier of last resort in the event of a direction from the CRU and any requirement which applies to customers in relation to safety or network-related activity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300024#W00200","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1655983800,"counter":256,"content":"<p>When Iberdrola left Ireland, it did so voluntarily.

If somebody engages in a deliberate strategy of trying to buy market share by below-cost selling, they should still honour the contract.

We have seen figures recently from Cork, Dublin and Tipperary showing that a paltry number of fines were issued, with only one or two being issued annually.  Dog fouling is a public health issue.  Dog faeces contains parasites that can lead to blindness in children and has been described as the single most potent contaminant of the bathing water in Dublin Bay, a protected biosphere.  <\/p><p>I raised this issue numerous times when I was a councillor on Dublin City Council and every time I did so, the council claimed that it was an issue for the national Parliament and one that required national legislation so here I am, in our national Parliament, with legislation that seeks to address a very serious public health issue.  My Bill is a simple one.  It increases the fines for not picking up after one's dog.  Currently the fine is &euro;150 and this Bill proposes to increase that to &euro;1,500.  This is a significant increase but risk is judged on the likelihood of getting caught balanced against the consequences.  We know that the likelihood of getting caught is almost zero.  Dublin City Council, for example, issued one fine last year and the situation is similar in the rest of the country.  By increasing the consequences, we change the way people think about the risk of not picking up after their dog.  It also sends a very strong message about what we consider to be important.  The fine was last increased in 2007 by the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, John Gormley.  He spoke then about how a modest increase would send a strong message and I am trying to send an even stronger message about this important public health issue.  <\/p><p>Of course, fines alone will not deal with this issue.  We need to be creative but before talking about that I want to point out that when John Gormley increased the fine in 2007, he did so by way of statutory instrument.  The Executive branch does not need to wait for this Bill, which will not move rapidly through these Houses, to pass.  The power is in the Minister's wrist to make that change today.  Equally, there is power in the Minister's wrist to issue policy directions under section 60 of the Waste Management Act.  We have done this twice before in relation to enforcement systems related to the waste framework directive and around illegal waste activities and illegal dumping.  The Minister has the power now to increase the fine and to issue policy directives and the latter is where the creativity comes in.  When I was on Dublin City Council I pushed for DNA testing of dog poo in order to fine people and Leitrim County Council is pushing ahead with this.  We need to address issues around dog bins and the provision of free dog bags.  All of these are local authority issues but the Minister, through section 60, has the power to issue policy directives.  This Bill will help but the Minister can do more relatively quickly.<\/p><p>I commend this Bill to the House, which seeks to address a very serious public health issue.  I also call on the Minister to use his executive powers to increase the fine by statutory instrument today, or as soon as possible, and to issue policy directives available to him under legislation.  Then, finally, children might be able to play in parks and not have to be sanitised and cleaned of dog waste that others have selfishly not picked up, when they get home.  This is a serious public health issue that is not being addressed by the local authorities because they say they do not have the power to do so.  It is up to us here to address it and that is the purpose of this Bill.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300028#AA00200","speaker":"1570"},{"type":"speech","time":1655986200,"counter":306,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300028#AA00300","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1655986200,"counter":307,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300028#AA00400","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655986200,"counter":308,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655986200,"counter":309,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300028#AA00600","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1655986200,"counter":310,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300028#AA00700","speaker":"1570"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655986200,"counter":311,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Autism Bill 2022: First Stage","time":1655986200,"counter":312,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300028#AA00900"},{"type":"speech","time":1655986200,"counter":313,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to provide for an autism strategy to be prepared and published, and to provide for related matters.  <\/blockquote>  <p>It gives me great pleasure to stand in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann alongside my party leader, Deputy Bacik, to introduce the Autism Bill 2022.  In April 2021, the Labour Party tabled a motion calling for a national autism strategy but over a year later, in June 2022, we are still hearing stories of a lack of school places, of a 36-month wait for assessments and basic interventions, of concerns about dental care, mental health services and employment opportunities for children and young people who have autism.  It is time for us, as a party, to move on from the motion that was passed in April last year and to produce legislation that underpins the responsibility of the Government to produce a national autism strategy.  Our Bill is based on similar legislation in Northern Ireland that was enacted in 2011 and on the English Autism Act 2009. <\/p><p>Our Bill obliges the Government to produce a cross-departmental autism strategy and requires all other relevant Ministers and public bodies to co-operate with its implementation.  The strategy must outline how the needs of people with autism, in terms of access to education, other public services, employment and social inclusion can be met by public service providers.  It must include an emphasis on how the needs of families and carers can be met by setting out a roadmap of actions for the development and improvement of family support services.  The Minister shall be responsible for monitoring the implementation of the strategy by all of the Ministers and public bodies.  Each relevant Minister and public body must publish a progress report on a three-yearly basis, which gives updates on implementation of the strategy.  <\/p><p>Our Bill states that the strategy must provide for public service providers to set up data collection systems to identify and record the number of persons within their client bases who have autism and to calculate current and future needs for services.  As was outlined earlier today, the fact that we will need school places for young people with autism is completely predictable.  We cannot allow the scandal to persist whereby 268 young people with autism do not know, in June 2022, whether they will have a school place in September, not to mention the 15,500 young people who have to leave their own catchment area in order to access a school place.  <\/p><p>Under the strategy, the Minister must establish a public autism awareness campaign.  This is not just for those who have autism and their families.  Every single member of this Republic must be part of the strategy and part of the solution.  Provision must be made for autism awareness training for persons in the public service who frequently deal with adults with autism.  The Minister must commission research into the prevalence of autism in the State, including among adults, and into the levels of need.  A pathway of care must be developed which clearly maps services for adults with autism, aimed at ensuring the consistent availability of those services across the State.  The strategy must also provide for the development of a range of services to address the needs of adults with autism, including in healthcare, education, employment and social inclusion throughout their lives.  I recall being involved in the development of a comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities but no Department wanted to deal with it.  The then Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection did not want it because it related to disabilities.  The Department of Health did not want it because it said it related to employment.  In the end, it landed into the Department of Justice.  <\/p><p>There must be a best practice model of service delivery, assessment, diagnosis and intervention for service users with autism drawing on international expertise and guidance to health service providers on how to meet the needs of adults with autism, their families and carers.  There must also be a detailed examination of the needs of families and carers and how these are to be met by developing and providing appropriate support services.  There must be a clear system of accountability, a word that comes up again and again, and scrutiny in relation to autism service provision, to be overseen by the Minister.  The Minister must keep the autism strategy under review and must publish a revised strategy at intervals of no more than seven years. <\/p> <p>We are seeking a legislative underpinning of these rights.  We need solution-driven policy and legislation.  The people of Ireland who have autism in their families deserve no less.  The same is true of every other citizen of the country.  We need to do what has been done in Northern Ireland and England and provide a legislative basis for an autism Act in 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300028#AA01000","speaker":"1551","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655986800,"counter":315,"content":"<p>Is the Bill being opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300029#BB00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1655986800,"counter":316,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300029#BB00300","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655986800,"counter":317,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655986800,"counter":318,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300029#BB00500","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1655986800,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300029#BB00600","speaker":"1551"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655986800,"counter":320,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655986800,"counter":321,"content":"<p>Cuireadh an D&aacute;il ar fionra&iacute; ar 1.20 p.m. agus cuireadh t&uacute;s leis ar&iacute;s ar 2 p.m.<br \/><br \/>Sitting suspended at 1.20 p.m. and resumed at 2 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"LGBTQI+ and Equality: Statements","time":1655987100,"counter":322,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300030#FF00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1655987100,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I welcome this opportunity to update the House on LGBTI+ issues, particularly during Pride week.  At the start of 2022, Ireland entered its second century as an independent State.  We have become a proud, progressive and modern nation that supports and cherishes all people equally.  We have made great strides in recent decades to promote equality and respond to the changing needs of a diverse population.<\/p>  <p>  We have a proud record as a champion of human rights internationally.  We have been at the forefront of change in advancing equality for LGBTI+ people.  In 2015, we became the first country in the world to legalise same-sex marriage by popular vote.  In the same year, we introduced progressive gender recognition legislation.  In 2018, we became the first country in the world to launch a national LGBTI+ youth strategy.  The annual Pride parade, which will be held in person again this Saturday, has grown to become one of the biggest festivals celebrated in Ireland.  Yet, despite these advances, challenges remain.  LGBTI+ people continue to face significant barriers to full participation in public life.  They do not always feel safe in public spaces.  They continue to experience unacceptable levels of harassment, violence and discrimination.  LGBTI+ people also face particular health issues.  The Government and society in general have more work to do.<\/p>  <p>  That is why the Government launched Ireland's first national LGBTI+ inclusion strategy in 2019.  This all-of-government strategy pursues objectives under four thematic pillars and provides a vision of an Ireland where LGBTI+ people are visible and included, treated equally, healthy and feel safe and supported.  With a view to making progress towards these high-level objectives, 108 actions, aimed at improving the lives of LGBTI+ people within the lifetime of the strategy, were agreed.  The overall aim of the strategy is to target discrimination, promote inclusion and improve quality of life and well-being for all LGBTI+ people.  The Government is committed to these overarching goals and is advancing a suite of initiatives within the strategic framework to improve the lives of LGBTI+ people in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The inclusion strategy dovetails with the LGBTI+ national youth strategy, which was launched in 2018 and recently concluded.  The youth strategy aims to ensure that all LGBTI+ young people are visible, valued and included.  The consultations with young people and their direct involvement in the development of the youth strategy as well as its implementation demonstrate the value Ireland places on having the voice of the child in the development of policy.  Reports and research continue to show that coming out as LGBTI+, and growing up as LGBTI+, are still challenging for young people.  The youth strategy and policies aim to address these difficulties through the creation of safe, supportive and inclusive environments for LGBTI+ young people and through improving their mental, physical and sexual health and well-being by developing the research and data so we are able to understand their needs and respond appropriately to them.<\/p>  <p>  The key achievements of my Department in the lifetime of the youth strategy include the establishment of the LGBTI+ youth forum to support the implementation of the strategy.  I had the privilege of working with 25 young LGBTI+ people from diverse backgrounds who all actively engaged with the implementation of the strategy throughout its lifetime.  With the support of the forum, my Department established the LGBTI+ youth leadership programme.  This enables young LGBTI+ people to develop their leadership skills.  The programme was delivered by For&oacute;ige and undertaken in consultation with BeLonG To.  It was a great success.  A similar programme bringing in new young LGBTI+ leaders will be offered later this year.<\/p>  <p>  In October 2020, I launched the national Live Out Loud: Celebrating LGBTI+ Youth campaign and event.  It culminated in a live-streamed national event from Wexford Opera House as part of Pride celebrations in June 2021.  This campaign and the overall event celebrated LGBTI+ young people, again showing that they are visible, valued and included across culture, society and sport.  A review of the implementation of the youth strategy is under way and will be published later this year.<\/p>  <p>  The House will be aware that one of my key priorities is the prohibition of the practice of so-called conversion therapy.  This objective is contained in the programme for Government.  My Department recently commissioned research aimed at capturing the views and experiences of people who have undergone this so-called therapy.  This multi-phased mixed-methodology research is being conducted by an expert team at Trinity  College and is expected to be completed in August.  The findings will assist in the development of legislation that will prohibit the practice of conversion therapy.  The legislation will also be informed by international comparative analysis.  Conversion therapy is something that does not happen hugely in this country but it does happen.  I have met young people who have experienced it.  When it happens, its impact can be devastating.  That is why we are taking the time to undertake this research to understand exactly where and how it is happening so that we can ensure the legislation being brought forward is effective and we can prohibit this practice.<\/p>  <p>  As a Government, we recognise that people arriving in Ireland who wish to claim international protection are diverse in background and often have different needs.  The White Paper on ending direct provision committed to establishing supported pathways for people who, because of their gender or identity, may have specific vulnerabilities.  For an LGBTI+ person, that journey can be more difficult.  My Department recognises that and we are developing a specific LGBTI+ operating model to help interact with and best support people from the LGBTI+ community who are seeking asylum in Ireland.  I am pleased to state that work will begin shortly, in conjunction with an NGO partner, on a consultation and research phase that will gather the experiences of those who have already passed through this process and make sure we can design our international protection process in a way that fully respects and protects LGBTI+ people in that process.<\/p>  <p>  As well as the research into conversion therapy, my Department is in the process of commissioning a study of older LGBTI+ people in Ireland.  The study will draw from data held by the Irish longitudinal study on ageing, TILDA.  The contract with a third level institution is now being finalised and it is expected the research will be completed by the end of 2022.  This study of the older LGBTI+ population in Ireland will identify the needs of older LGBTI+ people and the specific challenges they experience.<\/p> <p>The research will also inform the ongoing implementation of strategic actions to support older members of the LGBTI+ community in Ireland.  In the context of the change we have seen in this country, we are all aware of significant numbers of older LGBTI+ people who were not in a position, or did not feel they were in a position, to come out in their early years, who now, because of the changed circumstances, feel they can do so.  We must recognise their situation and policy and law must be in place to support them in their process.<\/p> <p> The Government is committed to ensuring that members of minority and vulnerable groups feel safe and supported in Ireland as they go about their daily lives.  My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, will soon publish the criminal justice (hate crime) Bill 2021, which will introduce new, specific aggravated offences with enhanced penalties for crimes motivated by prejudice against certain characteristics, including gender and sexual orientation.  The Minister and I met with a range of national LGBTI+ groups yesterday to brief them on the progress of that legislation and other legislation and policy being pursued across both our Departments.<\/p> <p> Recent tragic events, including the brutal killings in Sligo, the range of attacks on members of the LGBTI+ community on the streets of Dublin and in other parts of he country and the increasingly vitriolic online attacks on members of the community, particularly trans members, have shaken the community in Ireland.  We are all aware of that.  It was good to have an opportunity for the Minister for Justice  to outline the extensive measures An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is taking, both at the national level and at a very localised level, to ensure all members of the community feel safe and that we have the very best mechanisms in place for engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, LGBTI+ groups and individual members of the community.<\/p> <p> The Garda initiatives include LGBTI+ network dialogue days, a joint promotional video on online hate crime reporting, the involvement of LGBTI+ representatives in Garda diversity officer training and the ongoing human rights training Garda personnel are receiving.  In addition, all trainees at the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na College must now complete revised hate crime and diversity and cultural awareness training.  This additional training around hate crime is welcome, as is education in respect of hate-related non-crimes.  There are situations people experience every day that probably do not fall within the criminal sphere but that are nevertheless clearly motivated by hate.  The passing of the hate crime legislation, on which significant work has been undertaken at pre-legislative scrutiny stage, which we are working to respond to, will mark an important moment not only for the LGBTI+ community but also for many other minority communities in the country, including members of the Traveller community, black and mixed-race communities and persons who are disabled.  Many people in those communities have experienced hate and will now, finally, be able to see a clear mechanism whereby An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can prosecute what was done to them, recognising it not just as a general assault but as an assault based on hate, and punish it as such through the courts system.<\/p> <p> In reviewing our policies and legislation, it is important we do not inadvertently create discriminatory circumstances.  There has recently been some public debate regarding a small number of proposed changes to the Maternity Protection Acts that will be brought forward as part of the work life balance and miscellaneous provisions Bill 2022 to ensure no family and no child are disadvantaged because of the parents' gender.  It is Government policy to ensure all pregnant employees in the State are entitled to maternity leave.  These amendments are intended to ensure this is reflected in the Maternity Protection Acts.  I hope to introduce the Bill before the end of this term or early in the next term and there will be opportunities to debate all elements of it.  I know colleagues will be mindful that any debate should be sensitive to the fact these amendments affect real people and real families.  I have no doubt that Deputies and Senators will conduct themselves with those people in mind.<\/p> <p> Government collaboration with civil society and community organisations is a vital strand of our approach to service provision for LGBTI+ communities.  We are committed to providing support and funding to a wide and diverse range of LGBTI+ non-government groups in their delivery of targeted programmes and services throughout the country.  Last year, my Department allocated more than &euro;1.5 million to support LGBTI+ projects through grant funding.  This funding is critical in achieving the Government's overall strategic objectives and providing regional services and supports for the LGBTI+ community.<\/p> <p> It is important that allocated funds are deployed strategically and projects that are funded by the Government support the objectives of the LGBTI+ inclusion strategy.  One such project is the specialised legal advice clinic launched in May 2022 by the Free Legal Advice Centres.  I had the privilege of being part of the launch of this fantastic initiative.  The clinic will meet the specific needs of the gay and trans community.  It will provide advice on a wide range of legal issues where gender and sexuality are core factors, including discrimination matters, equality, family law, gender identity, immigration, hate crimes and access to healthcare.  The clinic's objectives align with the actions in the strategy that mandate the provision of tailored legal advice and advocacy to LGBTI+ people.<\/p> <p> This is one example of the dozens of strategic initiatives by LGBTI+ organisations that have received funding under the annual community services fund, which was first launched in 2020.  The fund is an essential limb of the inclusion strategy, unlocking the delivery of many of its aims and objectives.  The day before yesterday, I was delighted to announce details of the 2022 funding call.  A key change this year is that we are providing an element of core funding within the call.  This marks a change in the structure of the funding, which originally was all project-based.  We recognise that the LGBTI+ community sector, like much of the community sector in this country, is facing additional financial pressures.  Being able to plan ahead by way of the provision of core funding for basic things like rent and key staff is often as beneficial as project-based funding.  This change was asked for by groups in the sector and we are pleased to be able to deliver it this year.  It will allow community groups, including local groups, to continue to benefit from the range of available supports.<\/p> <p> I welcome the opportunity to engage in this discussion and to hear from Deputies on both the Opposition and Government sides.  I wish Members a very happy Pride Month.<\/p> <p> I am pleased to have this opportunity to express my solidarity with LGBTI+ communities throughout the country.  Although this discussion offers us the opportunity to reflect on, and celebrate with pride, the successes of the LGBTI+ community, we also must recognise the struggles many in the community continue to f\u1ea1ce.  This is particularly so for members of the trans community, who too often hear their very existence being debated in public discourse.  As a society, Ireland has made huge progress and strides over the past decade.  I always recall that when I was in school, there was absolutely no concept or chance of my coming out.  Now, when I visit schools in Dublin 15 or elsewhere around the country, I see the Pride flag flying.  It is such a change in one person's lifetime.  Many people of my generation feel and see that change.  It is always important to note the huge progress we have made.<\/p> <p> We also must be conscious that there can be regression.  We see regression in Europe right now.  I have made the point before, including in this Chamber, that a situation in which people see their human rights going backwards in their own lifetime must be truly terrifying.  It probably has only been experienced by small numbers of people over time, but in parts of Europe and elsewhere in the world at this time, the rights of the LGBTI+ community are going backwards.  That is why it is so important that we in Ireland celebrate our progress while also being conscious that we still have significantly more to do.<\/p> <p>All of us in this House must take it upon ourselves to make the extra effort to be informed and to listen to the perspectives and experiences of those who still struggle, and I specify members of the trans community in this regard.  If we are to create a society where everyone feels safe, included and supported to live life as their true selves, we must first educate ourselves and play our role in supporting others to understand the complexities of gender identity.  The Government is committed to working with LGBTI+ communities to ensure that LGBTI+ people can feel visible, equal and safe in a fairer and more inclusive Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300030#FF00200","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655988300,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I am delighted to get the opportunity to speak about equality and how it impacts on the LGBTI+ community.  As the Minister said, we wish everyone a happy Pride.  What is really good this year, and especially on a day like today, when it is so sunny, is that we finally have an event that is back to being held in person this weekend.  To everybody taking part, my colleagues will be out in support too.  It is fantastic that we are living in a society like this.  In this Chamber, we often talk about various crises and things happening in housing and health.  It is nice to sometimes have debates where we are discussing areas where there has been such progress.  We were world leaders in the context of the marriage equality referendum in 2015.  It is something we should all be very proud of.  I always remember it vividly because we had a by-election in Carlow-Kilkenny at the same time.  I always think of those two events when I remember back to those times.  May of this year marked seven years since they happened.  It is hard to believe it has been that length of time.<\/p>  <p>  There is a growing general awareness in this regard.  It is good and welcome.  I see it even with my children and their friends, and in the context of how school is now.  It is so different from anything I experienced.  I still refer to myself sometimes as a young person.  When you have a teenager, however, you do not actually feel so young anymore.  It is only when we see our kids getting older that we realise that we must also be getting older.  Even since I was in school, however, there is much more acceptance.  Some schools are out on their own.  I will not name or single out any school, but some are so progressive, so into the individual and they do not mind children expressing themselves.  This is extremely important and we should welcome, encourage and support this approach at every opportunity we can.  It is fantastic, and even during the drive into Dublin every day this week and for the last few weeks, it has been possible to see all the Pride flags and various businesses getting on board.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with some of the points the Minister made.  Despite our great strides in legislation and social awareness, areas of concern remain, particularly regarding healthcare, mental health services and the level of awareness of the complex and specific needs of this community in our medical profession at times.  Anecdotal evidence suggests this, but, equally, coming from a constituency that is a mix of rural and urban, I am aware that it can be much more difficult in rural communities.  People are living in towns or villages that are much smaller.  We have grown a lot, but, at times, in certain areas, there is still some stigma and it can be very difficult.  It can be particularly difficult to access crucial supports around sexual health services.  Some GPs, for example, may be more old-fashioned in their approach, and this can be very difficult, especially for people in rural communities.  It can also be especially difficult to get access to counsellors, mental health services and trans healthcare.  Therefore, it is important that we see an improvement in the lack of social services and social outlets.  We must grow in this regard.  Everywhere is affected, but it can be particularly difficult in rural areas at times.  We must examine this aspect.<\/p>  <p>  The work of amplifying and reforming legislation to provide a safe, inclusive and secure country for all continues in earnest.  I and several others have been involved as members of the Joint Committee on International Surrogacy, for example, and some of the areas we have been exploring include issues facing same-sex couples, male and female, in the context of international surrogacy arrangements and achieving parental regulation recognition.  Our committee has finished its public hearings and we hope to have our report published soon.  This is another step forward and an important one.<\/p>  <p>  Safety is a key concern for this community.  We saw this, unfortunately, in the most tragic way earlier this year.  While I have the opportunity, and the Minister mentioned this, I encourage the Minister for Justice to prioritise the proposed criminal justice (hate crimes) Bill and to publish it as soon as possible.  This is robust and comprehensive hate crime legislation, when enacted, will ensure that members of the entire LGBTI+ community and other marginalised communities can feel safe going about their daily lives.  There can sometimes be a sea change in the minds of people in society when something is enshrined in legislation.  Therefore, it is important that we have this legislation.<\/p>  <p>  While discrimination and difficulties in accessing services affect all ages, younger people struggle the most with accessing information and assistance.  LGBT Ireland, which operates a helpline, highlighted that 64% of all calls in 2020 were from young people under the age of 25, with the remaining 36% of calls coming from those under the age of 18.  The most common query was for help in coming out.  It is important that the Minister referred to his own situation and how it has progressed since he was in school.  It is good for young people to see this.  Despite great strides in awareness in the wider community, and their own self-awareness of their identity, however, many young people do still struggle to confide in family and peers.<\/p>  <p>  I also welcome the &euro;900,000 made available this week by the Minister for NGOs and community services for the LGTBQI+ community.  I understand this funding will maintain and enhance existing services which focus on improving quality of life and well-being for all members of this community.  This will be welcomed.<\/p>  <p>  We all want to see people from this community empowered and supported to feel 100% comfortable, as everybody should.  So many of us probably take this for granted at times as well.<\/p>  <p>  I will finish there.  I totally lost track of the time.  I thought that I was only going to take a few minutes but I have taken loads of the time.  I reiterate to everyone celebrating Pride, and over this weekend in particular, that we send our solidarity to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300032#HH00200","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1655988300,"counter":327,"content":"<p>I delighted to be able to speak on the LGBTQI+ community, about our strategy and to listen to the Minister.  To be fair, he spoke about many positive things.  I certainly recognise that.  To echo what Deputy Funchion said, we are in a much better place than we were when I went to school.  A great deal of work remains to be done, though, and we all recognise this as well.  I send my solidarity to the members of the trans community.  I stand with them against the recent attacks on their very existence.  This must be said today and I am glad that people are saying it.  The members of the trans community know they have our support.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to when I came into politics.  I and many people in Sinn F&eacute;in have a vision for the island involving republican principles of equality, diversity and inclusion because this goes to the core of who we are.  I have been lucky.  I have been attending Pride in Cork for years.  Sometimes my wife, Michelle, and our two daughters would come with me.  I remember pushing them in the buggy when they were babies.  Pride has a great atmosphere and I look forward to walking it this year with my family again, because it sends out a brilliant message to people that this is where we want to be, that we want to be inclusive and to work with people and respect them.  The atmosphere can be so positive; it just lifts your heart.<\/p>  <p>  I also pay my respects to all those who have campaigned over the years.  In Sinn F&eacute;in, we say that we stand on the shoulders of great men and women.

I want us to move forward.  We all remember how proud we were as a nation when we passed the marriage equality referendum.  It was a brilliant achievement for us as a people, but a lot more work needs to be done.  While we can recognise our victories, we also have to recognise that there is more to do.<\/p> <p> The Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, has called for legislation on hate crime and hate speech, something we all want the Minister for Justice to fast track and deliver.  People should never be allowed to promote hate crime and hate speech.  That is something that we as an Oireachtas need to deliver on.  We need to stand up and let that message go out loudly and clearly.  The only way we can do that is to pass legislation to ensure that happens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300032#HH00300","speaker":"1453","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655988900,"counter":329,"content":"<p>I am also glad to be here today to speak on the issue of equality for everyone in our society.  I wish the Minister and everyone else in our communities a happy and joyous Pride week.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister touched on many issues in his opening remarks, with which I concur.  As someone who grew up in a very rural part of Ireland, the advancement we have seen in the past ten years, and in particular the last seven years since the referendum on marriage equality, has been immense.  It has been immense in the mindset of older people, in particular, and people who grew up in an Ireland which was very closed and dominated by a particular orthodox kind of Christian view that dominated their thinking and outlook on life.<\/p>  <p>  We have come a huge distance.  In the main, the reason for that is that young people spoke to the older generation and told them that it is not like that, they have experienced life and it is different and they have to give them their space, equality and sense of worth in our society.  That has happened.  <\/p>  <p>  We have, of course, had regressive incidents, such as the incident in Sligo the Minister mentioned, where two men lost their lives earlier this year.  As a Deputy for the constituency, I got calls from various constituents about the deaths.  A man who called me was extremely aggressive towards the person who had been arrested in connection to the incident because the person was from outside of the country.  While he ranted and raved about that, I remembered that I had met the man a few years previously.  On that occasion, he had a similar rant and rave about people who are homosexual.  I recognised that it was, and was not, a contradiction.  It was true to where that man had been and the kind of Ireland he felt he wanted to go back to.<\/p>  <p>  One of the sentiments he expressed was that we are losing our values.  We have gained much better values than we ever had.  I certainly hope that people will recognise and come to understand that, and recognise the day in the sun for any sector of our society does not, and should not, put any other sector into the shadows.  Holding up one particular group of people in society and telling them they have an equal space does not mean we are taking anything away from anyone else.  It is not a zero-sum game.  Unfortunately, some people think it is.  In fact, it is a multiplier.  It enhances everyone's lives when we give everybody a better space.  We have to recognise and understand that.<\/p>  <p>  Last Thursday, I was leaving the canteen, having had a bite to eat, and there was an event going on in the corridor attended by Senator David Norris, who has been ill in the recent past.  His portrait was being unveiled, which is very unusual given that he is still a Member of the Houses.  The event was a recognition of his valued contribution to not just the Oireachtas, but to Irish society in general.  He was, more than anyone else, the flag bearer for these particular issues.  He has done so much for so many people, and was such a positive example for all of us.  We all wish him well in the future.  It will be a stark reminder to us as we pass through these corridors that equality hangs on the wall and we have to make sure we stand with and for it.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that we have legislation around all of these issues.  The hate crime legislation is advancing, and we need to make sure that it is passed.  At the same time, it is not just about legislation; it is about changing mindsets and people's understanding of what it is to be human.  What separates us, as humans, from every other living species, including animals and everything else in the world, is that we have the ability to communicate, speak to and understand each other, have emotions and work those things out, and we need to use them.  <\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, some people do not want to do that.  They want to almost set civilisation aside.  The Minister and other colleagues mentioned regression in other parts of the world where there is a very fascist agenda coming into play.  That is very negative.  That negative fascist agenda has to be held to account for the harm it has done to so many people around the globe.  We have to ensure that it does not take hold anywhere in our society.  I again wish the Minister and everyone else in our community, whatever they identify as, a very happy Pride week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300033#JJ00200","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1655988900,"counter":330,"content":"<p>The Minister is very welcome.  I listened to his speech in my office.  There are so many positive things coming from the Minister and Government in terms of the LGBTQI+ community.  I wish to start by wishing everybody who takes part in the parade on Saturday the very best.  I hope the weather stays fine.  Unfortunately, I heard the dress code will be raincoat and wellies.  We hope the weather forecasters are incorrect.  I welcome the opportunity to speak to this debate because this is an important issue, not just for the LGBTQI+ community.  It is important that all of society deals with the issues facing the community.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to focus on two issues in particular.  I commend our schools.  We have been in many schools in our communities.  It is incredible to see the significant amount of work that has been done by schools, teachers and, more importantly, strong LGBTQI+ students who have constantly pushed the agenda and envelope.  I would like to commend them because it is a strong and brave thing to do in a school community.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to talk about mental health services, in particular.  There are wonderful services like Foroige, Jigsaw and BeLonG To, but there are also universal services in our communities like Genesis and Suicide Awareness Dublin 15.  Unfortunately, many such services are under serious pressure in terms of being able to access them.  There are currently 84 young people in Dublin West waiting on a list for a first appointment with Jigsaw.  The average waiting time has increased from five to 11 weeks, which is deeply worrying.  That wait is for general services, but we know the LGBTQI+ community is part of the waiting lists.  <\/p>  <p>  The waiting list for CAMHS is more than one year.  As we know, every expert in child and adolescent mental health will tell us that early intervention and support is absolutely vital in order to avoid worsening mental health problems into the future.  It is critically important that we consider all of those services, including targeted and universal services, in regard to mental health.<\/p> <p> The other issue is community safety.  We have had not only the horrific murders in Sligo but also, worryingly, an increase in attacks on our streets on members of the LGBT+ community.  That should deeply worry and concern all of us, and we definitely need to challenge and to tackle it.  We need to create awareness and a space for everyone to be who they are.  We need to ensure that our towns, our cities and our streets are safe for people to express themselves without fear of being attacked and without being verbally abused, beaten or horrifically murdered.<\/p> <p> There have been huge strides in recent years.  We were on the marriage equality campaign trail on many a night in Dublin West.  The sheer energy and joy of that campaign meant that it was not only probably one of the most important but also one of the best campaigns I have ever been on.  Today I pulled out and looked at a couple of the badges we had for marriage equality.  They went like hot cakes.  You could not get one during that period.  That just shows how much society has come along.  As I said, however, there is still work that needs to be done.<\/p> <p> I will therefore make an ask of people who are listening in to this debate.  It is a very simple ask.  If you have never attended the Pride parade, why not start this week?  A very simple thing you can do to show your solidarity is to stand with people when they ask you to stand with them.  I look forward, on Saturday, to standing with people, whether in me poncho, me rain jacket or me wellies or whether using sun cream.  We will absolutely be there.  It is a really important weekend for people to be able to stand with others.  That is the ask I make of people today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300033#JJ00300","speaker":"1476","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655989500,"counter":332,"content":"<p>I was really uplifted by the Minister's remarks and his contribution to the debate.  As has been said, debates in this House can often be quite negative and a lot of points can be scored, but the Minister's contribution has challenged us all to point to positives.  We can point to a lot of negatives.  We have to do that and to point to challenges.<\/p>  <p>  Only two weeks ago, however, I brought my four-year-old daughter into the Dublin Pride shop and we decked her out.  We got her a flag and a t-shirt for the Pride march on Saturday.  I was reflecting on the fact that that just would have been absolutely impossible when I was her age.  Like Deputy Funchion, I do not consider myself to be that old, but when we engage with our children we realise how old we are.  When I was her age, only a few years later Declan Flynn would be murdered in Fairview Park.  That was 40 years ago, when a homosexual act, as it was then called, was a criminal offence.  We decriminalised homosexuality only in 1993.  We had a dedication on Sunday to Mervyn Taylor, who was a bastion of equality rights, including LGBT+ rights, in these Houses.<\/p>  <p>  I think of my daughter and think of young people, as has been described.  I often observe young people as they walk together in a very different Ireland from that of the kind of teenage walking I used to do.  The background of one or two of their party may be of a different country.  They celebrate that and are engaged in that much more than in the very dull, pasty-white Ireland in which I grew up.  One or two of their number may be from the LGBT+ community.  That is what they know to be right, normal and celebrated.  They are ready to defend those rights, and that is something I find so refreshing of that generation, which has handed this to us and are handing it to my child.  Whatever happens to my child, whoever she may be and whomever she may love will be defended by those young people, more so, perhaps, than by people of my generation, who grew up in the schoolroom of homophobic jokes and in a system and an Ireland that were quite oppressive.<\/p>  <p>  Then we see across Europe, as the Minister said, in Russia, Hungary and Poland, and in various individual states of the United States, what they are trying to do to books, statements and legislation.  We see troubling conversations happening in the UK and then we see them in this country.  We all have to take note of the fact that, as the Minister said, a person's existence is not up for debate and that punching down on a community that suffers higher levels of mental ill health and suicide just is not good enough.  This month we have an opportunity to call that out.  Being a member of the LGBT community is different from facing other inequalities.  If you are a member of the Travelling community, you share that burden with your family.  You can go home to the bosom of your family to discuss or share the inequality or discrimination you have suffered and you can plough through life together.  If you are a member of another minority group, perhaps a migrant group, you may be able to share that burden sometimes with your family.  If, however, you are a member of the LGBT community, that is sometimes a very private discomfort or a very private hell, and possibly the worst thing you can do in your own mind is to be honest about who you are to your own family.  Imagine the fear of rejection from your own family.  That is a fear I cannot even contemplate, that you would be who you are to your family and be rejected by your own family.  Sometimes we have to reflect on how big a fear that is today for young Irish people, but it is young Irish people who are dispelling and challenging that and fighting back against it.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister referred to the hate crime legislation which is coming down the tracks.  I greatly appreciate that because we have been campaigning for that for quite a long time.  When we see what happened in Sligo, there is a marked difference, as the Minister will know, between hate-based or hate-motivated crime and other crimes.  My colleague, Deputy Nash, asked me to impress on the Minister the need for a commitment from the Department of Justice as to when it will start public consultation on the dispensing of convictions of men who were prosecuted pre-1993.  That was the second element of the 2017 Labour Party legislation which led to the State apology marking the 25th anniversary of decriminalisation.<\/p>  <p>  I will say this much about the educational system, and I know people across these Houses will agree with me.  Education is one of our biggest challenges, as is the elephant in the room of the dominance of the influence of entities that are hostile to this agenda.  We cannot pretend that that does not exist or that our education system is not still dominated by the influence of patron bodies that are hostile to this agenda.  Within the school system there absolutely are schools that stand on their own two feet, that will promote Pride Month, that will speak about LGBT rights and that want to stamp out homophobic, biphobic and transphobic bullying.  We will have to come, however, to a pinch point in the advancement of our Republic and of our democracy in that it is not sustainable for us to have 90% of the primary schools of this country under the patronage of bodies that are hostile to the agenda with which we in this House all agree.  How can we have a scenario in which all the parties represented in this D&aacute;il, the representatives of which are directly elected by the people, are, I believe, in concert with this agenda, with the people of the country themselves amending the Constitution in 2015 in order to afford equal rights, including equal marriage rights and equal constitutional protection, to families, yet so many of our schools and so many of our minds can still be influenced by patron bodies that are hostile to this agenda?<\/p> <p>It is not just about Pride month but it is about every day of the life of a young LGBTQI+ person and if they are attending such a school, we are going to have to deal with that scenario.<\/p> <p> I was involved in the amendment of section 37 of the Employment Equality Act, that the employment rights of an employee in a State-funded institution had to be protected, even if they were perceived to be undermining the ethos of the school or the health institution in which that person was employed.  We could not delete that section of the Employment Equality Act because the patron bodies, constitutionally, still had the right to uphold their ethos.  The very existence or the way of living their lives of those who were LGBTQI+, who were unmarried parents, or were divorced, was being undermined because of the fact they were teachers.<\/p> <p> We had a situation only a number of years ago where the INTO LGBT+ teachers' group was asked to stand in a photograph in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in with President Michael D. Higgins.  Half of the teachers left the photograph because they did not want to be photographed and to be clearly identifiable as LGBTQI+ because they could not be fully convinced or sure that their employment prospects would not be inhibited by the fact they were in a photograph with the President of this country advocating for the rights of LGBTQI+ teachers.  That is a climate of fear.  While we amended the section of the Employment Equality Act, we have to go much further.<\/p> <p> Let me not finish, however, on a note of negativity but on one of love.  I was greatly taken by the contribution of Deputy Martin Kenny when he spoke of our collective humanity.  What really connects us as human beings is this search and need for love.  Some people find it and some do not.  If one finds it and is able to express it, it is the most wondrous thing.  Pride is all about love.  As I said earlier, I cannot wait to bring my little four-year-old to the Pride march on Saturday and for it to be the most normal thing in the world.  I cannot wait for me to explain to her what it is all about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300034#KK00200","speaker":"1551","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655990100,"counter":334,"content":"<p>I start this contribution by saying that I fully agree with the points raised by Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in on the need to tackle this issue within our schools and in respect of employment equality.  I have known teaching colleagues during my career who have not felt that that they could be open about their own identity.  This is certainly something that needs to be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  I join with everybody else in the House in wishing people a happy Pride week.  If Deputy Donnelly suggests that the weather may not play ball and that the dress code may be raincoats and wellies, well at least there may be rainbows.<\/p>  <p>  We have had a little bit of happy history made in Waterford where we have had the Pride of the D&eacute;ise Festival in Waterford for many years.  The Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, met with members of the committee last year.  We had our first ever Pride event in Dungarvan in west Waterford just last weekend.  That is a happy bit of history to have.<\/p>  <p>  On reflecting and in preparing today&rsquo;s speech, I thought back on another bit of happy history which was the general election of February 2020.  The Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, who has left the Chamber, and I were elected just a couple of hours apart.  We both responded in almost exactly the same way.  We did not do any of the whooping and hollering and there was no hoisting on shoulders or anything like that.  We did, however, what came naturally to us as a response.  We turned to the person who had most supported and had walked the long road with us, that is, we turned to our partners and we kissed them.  It was the most natural thing in the world to do at a time of great happiness.  In my case, it was completely unremarkable or unremarked upon.  In the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman&rsquo;s case, it was much remarked on because I turned and kissed a woman and the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, turned and kissed a man.<\/p>  <p>  As we hear statements on LGBTQI+ and equality today and during Pride month, we should remember that while Pride has become much more mainstream now, it is a protest.  It is a protest that reminds us that despite all of the progress made, there is still much more to do.  If I walk down the street and I reach out to take my wife&rsquo;s hand, I do not have to think about it as that is just a simple act of affection.  It is not a statement or a protest.  Until people within our LGBTQI+ community feel that same freedom, it means that we still have a road to travel.<\/p>  <p>  It also reminds us that progress cannot be taken for granted and it has to be protected.  While we have made significant progress in our lifetimes, in the last decade even, and we are rightly proud of those steps, of all those conversations and of that empathy that culminated in our historical result in the marriage equality referendum, both history and the international context show us that freedoms won can be freedoms lost unless they are protected and defended.  We have talked about the regression and the retrograde steps that we have seen both in Poland and Hungary on LGBTQI+ rights in recent times and we have already commented on the violence we have seen against people in that community, which seems to be on the rise everywhere.  This is happening in the US, the UK and in many countries across Europe and we are not immune to it ourselves as witnessed in the vicious murder of two men in Sligo just earlier this year.<\/p>  <p>  Something which worries and concerns me is that we are also beginning to see an importation of culture wars that are being waged elsewhere where debates around these issues are becoming weaponised and are being used to stoke fears and to sow division.<\/p>  <p>  The debate around trans rights has become increasingly heated in Ireland over the past number of weeks and, as many of the previous contributors said, it is a debate around somebody&rsquo;s basic right to exist.  We always have to be conscious of that.  It seems that the highly divisive and destructive battle lines drawn in the UK on this issue have been imported to Ireland despite the fact the laws on trans rights have been in place for seven years now and, to my mind, have had no ill effects on anybody.<\/p>  <p>  Trans people are like everybody else, including myself.  They just want to live their lives and to be left alone.  They do not need to hear their right to exist debated in divisive terms.  Let us not go down that very divisive and needlessly cruel path, as we have seen in the UK.  Let us remain focused on facts over panic and let us never forget that there are real people at the heart of these debates.  There are real people listening to the radio or watching the television and are having the way that they live their lives discussed and picked apart.  If these conversations need to be had and if there are genuine concerns that people need to express, then this should be done at all times with empathy and with understanding.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has been very active in this space and the Minister spoke about many of the initiatives being undertaken and I will mention just some of them.  The Government will be bringing forward a new hate crime Bill.  Ireland will also opt in to the proposed EU hate speech ban.  My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Martin, is bringing forward an Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022 which aims to tackle online abuses.  The Minister, Deputy McEntee, has also enacted laws which make the sharing of intimate images with intent to cause harm a criminal offence.  These protections, of course, protect us all but we must recognise the need to protect members of our LGBTQI+ community who experience many forms of discrimination, institutionalised prejudice, social exclusion, related harassments, bullying, violence and health issues, including mental health issues.<\/p>  <p>  A key pillar of the LGBTQI+ inclusion strategy referred to by the Minister is to ensure that the members of the LGBTQI+ community feel safe and supported within Irish society.  That is what we need, which that all members of our society feel safe and supported in the same way.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and his Department continue to do tremendous work.  A major review of the equality legislation is under way to specifically outlaw discrimination based on gender identity.  His Department is working on operating policy to guide the experience of LGBTQI+ refugees going through the process of the international protection application.  Earlier this year his Department commissioned an extensive study of older members of that community in Ireland to help identify the needs, strengths and challenges which they still experience.  This will help inform ongoing implementation of the current and future national LGBTQI+ inclusion strategy.<\/p>  <p>  This week's announcement of LGBTQI+ community services funding by the Minister is very welcome.  Some &euro;900,000 has been made available to groups operating at local and national levels to support the community and non-governmental organisations with the aim of promoting inclusion, protecting the rights and improving the well-being of LGBTQI+ people all over Ireland.<\/p> <p>There is a new additional element in the funding round that will enable LGBTI+ NGOs to plan to undertake longer-term initiatives to help maintain their support.  This is the core support feature to which the Minister referred in his opening statement.<\/p> <p> I very much welcome the work being undertaken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deepen awareness of this issue among its front-line officers.  Actions in the national LGBTI+ strategy also aim to increase the capacity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to respond to the needs of victims of hate crime and to improve understanding of the community within the force.  A new organisational approach to Garda diversity training is in the final stages of development and will be delivered throughout 2022.  It includes online hate crime training and online diversity and cultural awareness.  The training programme was developed in conjunction with community representatives, including LGBT Ireland and Transgender Equality Network Ireland.  It has provided a very welcome opportunity for diverse and minority groups to have meaningful engagement with Garda training to ensure the policing we have in our communities answers the needs of all people in our communities.  Garda diversity officers are now located in every Garda division throughout the country.  They are trained, developed and supported to actively work with diverse and minority communities.  Last year there was a full review of the Garda diversity officer network that resulted in revising the role to include responsibility for facilitating the reporting, recording, investigation and prosecuting of hate crime.  It also included support for victims of hate crime by identifying their particular needs and responsibility for acting as a liaison with the necessary external support services.<\/p> <p>This is a flavour of some of the work that is happening.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, outlined much more that is happening.  All of this is necessary and important work.  The Government is ambitious and committed to this agenda and LGBTI+ rights.  The fact there is a need for this work to be done shows there is a need for Pride.  The need for the Pride festival is not only as the moment of joy throughout our communities that it has certainly become.  It is most welcome that it has developed to become a joyous occasion but we must also remember that Pride is a protest.  It is still important that members of the community make their voices heard and keep the pressure on the Government and all Members of the House to deliver on what we want in our Republic, with all members of the Republic experiencing the same freedoms.<\/p> <p> I have never had to consider these issues.  I am cis male.  It is part of my identity but it is not something I have to fight for.  It is not something I ever need to overly consider.  I am straight.  This is also part of my identity.  I do not have to think about it.  It is not something that crosses my mind as I reach out to take my wife's hand as we walk down the street.  Until every member of our society feels that same freedom to do as I do and feels that same comfort in their own identity and skin, regardless of race, ethnicity, orientation or identity, Pride is necessary.  It is an agenda we have to push forward.  We should absolutely be donning the raincoats and the wellies if that is what the weekend weather will require as a dress code.  All of us should be coming out and supporting those who are marching and who have marched for many years to make those necessary changes in our society that will make it a better place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300035#LL00200","speaker":"1617","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655990700,"counter":336,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak ahead of what will be a great Pride march on Saturday.  It is always a great event.  It is very positive.  It makes people feel good and feel happy.  There is a real sense of solidarity on the march.  Pride month has many great events.  Last week I was at one, the Pride dog show, in the Cabbage Garden off Kevin Street.  It was a fantastic event and everybody enjoyed it.  It was very positive.  All of this positivity contrasts with the homophobic attacks carried out recently.  It makes those attacks even more shocking and more upsetting.  It is very important that those who carry out these crimes face the full force of the law.  There can be no place for this type of behaviour whereby somebody can feel threatened or unsafe because of their sexuality.  We have to, as we are doing today, give voice to the LGBTQI+ community.<\/p>  <p>  Last week I was here when the portrait of Senator Norris was hung.  I have to say it was a lovely event.  It is important to acknowledge the contribution Senator Norris has made for more than 30 years.  He was first elected to the Seanad in 1987.  He flew the flag.  He was openly gay at a time that was much different to now.  He deserves huge credit.  He walked the walk and flew the flag.  He did so much for his community and for wider society.  He made it a human rights issue and a social justice issue.  He fought the fight and is still fighting it.  It was lovely to see him.  He was in great form.  There are many people like him, such as Kieran Rose who headed up GLEN for many years, who have been huge advocates for the LGBTQI community.  It is important to acknowledge and remember the contribution and actions they carried out.  Ireland was a bleak place for anybody who was gay at the time.  It is still challenging and difficult but it was a significantly darker place.  It is important to acknowledge, remember and name those who carried the flag.  Many people have been named here.<\/p>  <p>  Leinster Rugby's Nick McCarthy came out recently.  This is very positive for a number of reasons.  He has been well supported in the rugby community and the wider community.  It is a credit to Leinster Rugby that he has got this support.  It is very important.  It is significant that an elite male sportsperson has come out.  Elite male sports are a cold house in many ways for any diversity, particularly for the LGBTI community.  We see the Premier League in England and we do not have to look too far from home in the League of Ireland.  Very few male elite athletes come out and state they are gay.  Nick McCarthy coming out is very welcome.  There is no openly gay football player in the Premier League.  The last footballer who came out was Justin Fashanu back in the 1990s.  I do not know whether the Minister remembers him.  I remember him as I am around that long.  When he came out, the abuse he got was horrendous.  At the time I remember thinking it would be a watershed moment but it was not.  Even today we do not have any Premier League player, and very few elite sportspeople, who have come out as gay.  This is an issue that we need to be aware of.  The national governing bodies, NGBs, must be aware of it and do more to support players coming out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300036#MM00200","speaker":"1555"},{"type":"speech","time":1655990700,"counter":337,"content":"<p>I welcome that these statements are taking place.  It is more than 25 years since I attended my first Pride march.  It was 26 years ago, which is hard for me to believe in many ways.  Much has changed in Irish society since then and much has changed for LGBTQI+ people.  That said, while some things have changed massively for us, some things have remained quite the same.<\/p>  <p>The Pride march has gone from thousands of people to tens of thousands of people participating.  It has become one of the largest events that takes place in Dublin, with massive mainstream buy-in and support.  Of course, we have had great progress and some legal changes over the years.  More and more people are coming out.  We have had marriage equality, which has been significant.  However, some things remain fundamentally quite the same.  More of our community is now comfortable being visible and being out holding hands in public and yet, many of us at times do not feel safe being visibly ourselves in public.<\/p> <p> As an elected representative of Dublin Bay North, my constituency has strong connections with the history of LGBTQI+ liberation in this country.  The first Deputy in this Chamber to talk about gay rights was the late Dr. Noel Browne who represented parts of my constituency.  He was well ahead of his time.  Sadly, when he did talk about gay rights, he was laughed out of it in this Chamber.  Thankfully, we have had massive progress since then.<\/p> <p> Another strong connection with my constituency was the brutal murder of Declan Flynn in Fairview Park in 1982.  That gave rise to the first LGBTQI protests and marches in Dublin and in Ireland, which then gave rise to Pride.  It is all the more sad, when we think about that brutal murder that this year, people have been murdered in connection with their sexual orientation and that violent homophobic and transphobic attacks are on the rise yet again.<\/p> <p> Considerable progress has been made.  Marriage equality was a particular milestone but, it is also true to say that since marriage equality many of us in the LGBTQI+ community feel that progress has been slow and not at the pace at which we would have hoped for or expected.  We are in Pride month now and with the Pride march coming up on Saturday, yes, there is much to celebrate, but it is the first time I remember in years when many of us in the community feel that this is not a celebratory moment.  Many people are very concerned about violent homophobic attacks being on the rise.  There is also a very strong sense that our community is under a concerted effort to try to divide us, which will not succeed.  We have seen the efforts to try to attack the trans community in particular.<\/p> <p> Before I talk about that, I will welcome the work that has been done by the Garda and community leaders, especially people such as Ois&iacute;n O'Reilly in Outhouse, to work together to address violence on the streets and have a co-ordinated response to tackle homophobic attacks.  It is a very sad indictment that over the past number of months, many LGBTQI+ people are questioning how comfortable they feel being visible in public places.  Being violently attacked is horrific for anyone and it is all the more horrific to be attacked because of who one is or because one is different, whatever that difference is.  That makes people feel more vulnerable.<\/p> <p> In terms of the attempts that there has been to divide the LGBTQI+ community and the attacks on trans people, the LGBTQI community stands strongly united against anyone who would seek to divide it.  We know, from our history and lived experience, exactly what is happening and what these tactics are.  We have seen them before.  We have seen them throughout our lives.  We know from the darker years from which we have emerged that those who are trying and seeking to attack and pick off parts of our community will not stop there, if they get the chance.  If they get half the chance, they will go further than that.  We will not tolerate any attacks against people simply for having the courage to be themselves and to live their lives as themselves.<\/p> <p> In the strongest possible terms, I express solidarity, on behalf of our community, with all of the trans members of our community.  We know that an attack against any trans person is an attack against all of us.  Those attacks are, sadly, all too familiar because we have seen them over the decades.  The same sorts of arguments that are now being used to attack trans people have been used against all of us over the years.  The attempts to sow disunity or to pick off groups of people simply will not work or succeed.  The march towards equality is unstoppable, even though it comes with its challenges.<\/p> <p> In terms of the debate that has been happening around and about trans people, it is very important in terms of public discussion that the voices of trans people are heard loudly and clearly.  It is also very important that when the media frame the debate, we should be discussing issues that affect trans people.  We should not be discussing issues that sections of the media have with trans people.  Let us talk about issues that affect trans people and let us reject any attempts to dehumanise any group of people.  That is an attack against all of us in society.  It puts a considerable stress on anyone in society if one has to continually feel the need to defend one's existence, just for being who one is.  We should all be very conscious of that.<\/p> <p> When we talk about trans people and how they need our political support, we should be very conscious of what research has shown us.  There is not enough research in Ireland.  However, research in the UK, published by Stonewall in 2017, found that 45% of trans young people had attempted suicide at least once.  It also showed that 84% of young trans people had self-harmed and that 64% of trans pupils said they had been bullied for being LGBTQI+ at school.  We also know from research done by Akt, formerly the Albert Kennedy Trust, that 24% of homeless young people in the UK identify as LGBTQI+ and that trans people are over-represented in that number.  We also know from research from Stonewall that 19% of trans people have experienced domestic abuse from a partner in the past year.<\/p> <p> When we talk about trans people and the issues that are affecting them - those are the issues.  How we support trans people and help them resolve and work against those issues is what we should be talking about in our public discourse.  We know from research in Ireland that almost 50% of trans people in Ireland are unemployed, which is a startling figure.  It shows the level of work we all need to do to address the discrimination and inequality that the trans community, in particular, faces.<\/p> <p> As a country, we are at our best when we are inclusive, when we work towards equality and when we celebrate our diversity.  That goes for everybody in Ireland.  Everything that we do to support the LGBTQI+ community and Pride is supportive of us as a community.  It also sends a signal to anyone who is any way different that one is supported and that diversity should be supported.  We know, unfortunately, from the very dark history that we have as a country when that was not done and people were mistreated, incarcerated and locked up just for being different, how far we have come as a country.  That was very much the country out of which Dr. Noel Browne was coming, but we know how very far we still have to go as a country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300036#MM00300","speaker":"1550","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655991300,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I commend the previous speaker, who is on my housing committee and with whom I work closely, on a very open and frank contribution here today. I am delighted to be speaking on this important topic today.  I will start by wishing a happy Pride month to everybody and especially to all those who are preparing to celebrate this weekend.  I always love attending the Pride parade in Dublin and seeing our capital city flooded with colours, vibrancy, diversity and, most importantly, with a considerable and palpable sense of inclusivity.<\/p> <p> We have come a really long way in Ireland in recent years and our small island has become increasingly more tolerant and welcoming of all sexuality and gender identities.  We are better at celebrating and accepting each other.  Just recently I was delighted to see a rainbow zebra crossing popping up in Clondalkin village and I hope it is a project South Dublin County Council replicates.  A rainbow crossing may seem like a really small gesture - and it is - but it also sends a big message of inclusion and rejection of intolerance.<\/p> <p> This debate indicates how far we have come from a political perspective, which is so welcome.  We are often reminded that Pride began as a protest and it is really important to remember that.  There is no doubt that this year's Pride celebrations will also be a protest because although we have come a long way, there are many members of the LGBTQI community who are angry and sad.  Unfortunately, there are many reasons to be angry and sad.  For many, this year's Pride will highlight the recent increases in rates of horrific homophobic attacks in our communities.<\/p> <p> Like all of us, I was horrified by the brutal murders of Mr. Aidan Moffitt and Mr. Michael Snee just a few short months ago.  I am saddened to see reports of homophobic attacks continuing to be reported online and in our media.  These attacks must further strengthen our conviction to pass the criminal justice (hate crime) Bill without any delay.  I know this is something the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, is very dedicated to delivering, and I hope we will see this Bill move swiftly through the Houses.  This will ensure sexual orientation and gender can be viewed as protected characteristics when prosecuting perpetrators of crimes filled by prejudice and hatred.<\/p> <p> We need to send a strong message there is no room for hatred or homophobia in Ireland and we need strong laws to back up that message.  Listening to advocacy groups, I have heard calls for greater collaboration with the LGBTQI community with this legislation so their views and experiences can be better captured, and I hope that will happen.  LGBTQI people are one of the most targeted communities when it comes to hate crime and hate speech and it is vital we have robust legislation that can protect this community from abuse both in the physical world and, crucially, online too.<\/p> <p> It is important to stress that tolerance and acceptance starts in all our communities.  It starts in our homes, schools and workplaces, and even in our WhatsApp chats.  The vast majority of us would never intentionally act or speak in a way that is homophobic but it is so important we also recognise the damage that can be done by having a blas&eacute; attitude towards discrimination, offensive language, so-called jokes or hate speech.  When we see or hear it, we must call it out.  It is that simple.  Do not let unacceptable behaviour go unchecked.<\/p> <p> My party colleague, Deputy Carroll MacNeill, recently highlighted the shocking availability of homophobic, sexist and misogynist relationship and sexuality in education, RSE, teaching materials.  The specific matter has been addressed but it speaks to a wider problem in our approach to RSE.  It is so important that in our primary and secondary schools we are educating children in a manner that is inclusive of the LGBTQI community and that appropriately introduces ideas like sexuality and gender at an early age.<\/p> <p> Given the recent increase in the rate of homophobic attacks, I also support the establishment of a specific Garda task force to tackle homophobic hate crimes.  I welcome the national LGBTI inclusion strategy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is working on to increase reporting of hate crimes by members of the LGBTQI community.  I welcome commitments to increasing the Garda presence on our streets, particularly here in Dublin city centre.  This presence is crucial to ensuring everybody feels safe to be themselves and be free from attack or persecution on the streets of our capital city and the wider country.  At the end of the day, that should not be an unreasonable thing to expect.<\/p> <p> I have been a part of the Oireachtas special committee considering international surrogacy for the past number of months.  During its deliberations, we have heard many heartfelt testimonies from families through surrogacy, some of whom were also members of the LGBT community.  These are parents who have gone down the surrogacy route to become a family but who are left in legal limbo because in Ireland we do not have adequate surrogacy legislation.  Having legislation that recognises international surrogacy is vital for these and future families who go down the international surrogacy route.  It will have particular importance and poignance for the LGBTQI community and for equality.  In the next few weeks, our committee will make our official report to the Minister and I sincerely that our recommendations will not only be taken seriously but be taken on board and adapted into Ireland's surrogacy legislation through Ireland's Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill.<\/p> <p> The programme for Government contains a commitment to legislate to end the practice of conversion therapy, an objective I strongly support.  There should be no place in Irish society for any such pseudoscientific practice, which attempts to persuade a member of the LGBT community of a need to be cured or fixed.  It is ludicrous.  We must ban conversion therapy and implement stringent sanctions for those who continue to inflict this so-called therapy on others.  I understand the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, led by the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, is in the process of capturing the views of those who have undergone conversion therapy in order to better inform the legislation.  It is really important work and I look forward to that being completed.<\/p> <p> I highlight the work that many amazing advocacy and charity groups do to support the LGBTQ community in Ireland.  I was really pleased yesterday to hear that the Government has made &euro;900,000 available to support community services and promote visibility and inclusion of LGBTQI people.  It will help promote inclusion, protect rights and to improve quality of life and well-being for people in Ireland.  I hope that funding will be availed of by local and national groups.<\/p> <p> Ireland in 2022 is certainly a more accepting and welcoming place for people of all genders and sexual orientation.  I am proud of how far we have come as a society but we are also far from perfect and we have further to go.  That is for sure.  I look forward to seeing us continue as a Government and as a nation to improving the lives of LGBTQ people here in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300037#NN00200","speaker":"1566","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655991900,"counter":341,"content":"<p>I start by expressing solidarity with our trans siblings.  They were there for us during the campaign to repeal the eighth amendment and it would be absolutely wrong for us not to all come together today and express that solidarity.  I would have thought at this point in proceedings I would be relatively unshockable but I have been quite shocked at the outpouring of hate against a small group.  The trans community has demonstrated extreme fortitude, patience and dignity in the face of an onslaught against it.  From the D&aacute;il, I express my solidarity today and every day; we must do it every day and we cannot just be allies when we stand here.  It must happen in our thoughts, our actions and everything we do.  We must call it out when we hear it, which is really hard, because we have heard transphobic and homophobic statements being passed off as jokes.  Every single time it happens, we must remember the people who were there with us, intrinsic and integral to the campaign to repeal the eighth amendment.  When they need our solidarity, we must stand up.<\/p>  <p>  I am very proud to have been raised in a household where tolerance and inclusivity was absolutely central to our upbringing, who we were and what we did as a family.  We were an anti-apartheid family, a pro-women's rights family and an anti-homophobia family.  Both of my parents' children are now grown with children of our own but they would not have tolerated the notion of us being intolerant.  We have now moved on and it is not simply about not being intolerant and we must be proactively inclusive.  The debate is really good and it is no longer about whether a person is being intolerant or tolerant but whether somebody is being inclusive.<\/p>  <p>  I am the Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson on workers' rights and I will speak a little about the rights of people at work.<\/p> <p>In 2007, when I was chair of the SIPTU LGBTQI+ advisory group, we bought a small enough banner and brought it to Pride for the first time.  I am so proud, if Deputies will forgive the pun, of how far the trade union movement has come since then, how far my own former union, SIPTU, and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have come.  Trade unions now have a big presence at Pride, and that is very good.  Our workplaces should most definitely be inclusive.  As I said then, if someone is not out at work then something has to change in their workplace.  Work has to be a place where people can feel free to just be themselves.  That should not be a big ask.<\/p> <p> This is an important debate for us to have as public representatives.  We need to provide leadership and deliver on equality for LGBTQI+ people.  In the midst of attempts by bad faith actors to drag the debate backwards, and we know who they are and what they are at in trying to erode any progress that has been made, we have to stand together and say \"Not on our watch\".  We have a role to provide that leadership, to use our platforms to amplify positivity and challenge hate.  That is not an easy thing for people to do.  We all know what a pile-on looks and feels like but we have to be positive but also vocal.  We have to be allies, but we have to be active.  That is very often the case.  If it was left just up to politicians on our own, we probably would not have the progress we have made.<\/p> <p> I want to mark the progress.  I also want to focus on the fact that there is a lot more that we can do.  Members of the LGBTQI+ community face discrimination at every turn, in school, in college, in work, in accessing services, in the street, on the bus, no matter where it is.  We need to be there with them.  This discrimination, victimisation and bullying creates stress and fear for members of the LGBTQI+ community.  This is very apparent when we look at members of the Travelling community.  There are LGBTQI+ people within the Travelling community who must find the stress even more acute.  We know the levels of mental ill health within the Travelling community.  There is a group within a group.  We need to be laser-like in our focus in looking at where leadership is required, what we can do to be positive, how we can help people and how we can use the platforms we have as political leaders to amplify positivity and challenge victimisation, discrimination and what is, I suppose, hate.  I will end by saying we need hate crime legislation on the Statute Book that is fit for purpose, not legislation that is 33 year old.  We need modern legislation that will protect people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300038#OO00200","speaker":"1467","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655992500,"counter":343,"content":"<p>There is a very particular context and backdrop to the discussion we are having here on LGBTQI+ rights and Pride.

That is the context and reality of this discussion.  Day after day, representatives of a fringe hate group of transphobes - let us be honest, that is what they are - were allowed to dominate our airwaves.  Their aim was to peddle transphobia, including lies about the trans community, lies about the history of trans rights in this country and lies about the National Women's Council of Ireland.  In this, they were aided and abetted by a particular broadcaster who has a notably terrible record on the rights of marginalised people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300039#PP00200","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1655992500,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I do not want to interfere in this debate, but it is not appropriate to make reference to somebody who is readily identifiable or make any sort of charges against that person when they are not here to defend themselves.

What I would encourage people to do is read a really excellent article which was put up online yesterday or the day before an incredible activist called Izzy Kamikaze.  It is on the Beacon website.  Izzy investigated what happened and wrote this revealing piece about the background to the particular witch hunt on that programme against trans people.  She shows quite clearly how pretty much everything that the transphobes were allowed to say on the show was simply untrue.<\/p><p>Lie number one was that they were excluded from the National Women's Council of Ireland annual general meeting for wanting to ask questions about the council's position on the supposed removal of the word &quot;women&quot; from maternity legislation.  What actually happened was that they, the transphobes, put out a press release the day before announcing that they were going to disrupt the AGM in order to stop a trans woman from being democratically elected to the National Women's Council of Ireland board by its membership.  That is what is in the press statement they put out themselves.  They are not members of the National Women's Council of Ireland because they obviously have no track record on women's rights and exist purely to foment hate against trans people.<\/p><p>The second lie they peddled was that the National Women's Council of Ireland supports erasing women from the new maternity legislation.  In fact the National Women's Council of Ireland position is to use inclusive language to broaden those included, including, of course, women, but also trans men and non-binary people.<\/p><p>Lie number three was the idea that is kind of out there now that the Gender Recognition Act was somehow sneaked in without a proper debate when, in fact, it was extensively debated both inside and outside the D&aacute;il.  More than 240 articles were published about it at the time.  The problem for the transphobes, of course, is that we have the Gender Recognition Act and, clearly, the sun and the sky did not fall.  It was not something that was quietly lobbied for by elites in the corridors of power.  It was actually fought for from below by people struggling, particularly personified by the heroic Lydia Foy.<\/p><p>Thankfully, these transphobic ideas do not have much public support at all in this country.  However, it is not just the national broadcaster doing its best to change that but much of the rest of the mainstream media as well.  Jenny Maguire, a trans woman who is the gender equality officer for Trinity College Students Union, responded on Twitter:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWe have seen Irish media getting ever more open about their transphobia, we have to call it out wherever we see it.  There is no &ldquo;balance&rdquo; in platforming those that wished I didn&rsquo;t exist as a trans person.  So upsetting and troubling to see. <\/blockquote>  <p>I agree.  Many people have already cancelled their subscriptions or terminated working relationships with <i>The Irish Times<\/i>due to its repeatedly publishing transphobic content.  I will not name them, but we have a coterie of newspaper columnists who are really bent on aping their British transphobic counterparts, who love nothing more than to whine about their freedom of speech being threatened when any regular person takes exception to the views they have put forward or when any regular person without the benefit of a national newspaper column disagrees with how they have chosen to use their freedom of speech.  In reality, it is transphobic clickbait, a global phenomenon.  Wealthy media organisations are toying with trans people's lives for the sake of advertising revenue.<\/p><p>The case of the former CEO of Transgender Equality Network Ireland, TENI, Eirenne Carroll, who was subjected to what the Garda told her was a credible death threat and subsequently left the country, shows just how serious this is for trans people.  It is not some abstract, academic, interesting debate.  It is about people's lives.  Two gay men were brutally murdered in Sligo in April.  A non-binary person was recently attacked on the streets of Dublin.  We have to speak about the reality of the oppression and discrimination that trans people face.  They have mortality rates worldwide that are twice those of cis people because of suicide, violent attacks and murder.<\/p> <p>More than 50% of trans and non-binary young people in the US have said that they have considered suicide.  We know from the &ldquo;Speaking from the Margins&rdquo; report from TENI that 76% of respondents here had self-harmed prior to transition and that 81% had considered doing so.  The later is the consequence of a society that debates and then denies their existence and reality.<\/p> <p> The situation with RT&Eacute; also illustrates the problems for activists with relying on corporations for sponsorship.  Dublin Pride has become very reliant on corporate sponsorship, including, until recently, with RT&Eacute;, as well as a host of multinational corporations that would have had nothing to do with it when homosexuality was illegal and homophobia was rampant and normalised.  Included in that regard are companies with terrible track records on workers' rights and human rights, such as Amazon and Nestl&eacute;, numerous banks and financial companies and even an oil company.  The hypocrisy of these companies is very striking.<\/p> <p> I would like to urge everybody to support the recently launched campaign for trans rights, namely, Trans Equality Together.  I intended to be at the launch, but Covid struck me down.  I call on the Government to immediately take action in respect of all of the demands Trans Equality Together has made.  They include for gender identity and expression to be explicitly included as protected grounds in the Equality Act, for the gender recognition process to be opened up to include under-18s, for increased funding for the National Gender Service, which currently has an outrageous waiting time of five years, and for the immediate reintroduction of health services for trans children and adolescents.<\/p> <p> There is also an urgent need to have full separation of church and State in order to ensure that trans healthcare can be provided wherever it is needed and not be subjected to the archaic prejudices of the Catholic Church, which still controls so much of our health service.  We need to have, and we have been pushing and campaigning for, progressive, objective LGBTQI+ inclusive relationships and sexuality education universally provided in schools, regardless of the religious ethos of those schools.  In reality, we think we should have full separation and therefore should not have religious schools.  That is necessary to cut across the homophobic and transphobic bullying that still exists.  Unfortunately, transphobic bullying is particularly prevalent in schools.  You need education to deal with these things.  It is not the only way to deal with them, but it is a vital way of dealing with them.  At the moment, the whole issue of religious ethos is an obstacle to that.  We need to protect the mental health and lives of our LGBTQI+ young people and kick the church out of our education system.<\/p> <p> I just want to encourage everybody to attend pride events across the country.  I look forward to attending Dublin Pride on Saturday.  I encourage people to get out, campaign, fight, remember that Pride is a protest and express solidarity with the LGBTQI+ community.  This includes, and I particularly reference, Trans and Intersex Pride, which is taking place in Dublin on 16 July, because it is particularly important this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300039#PP00400","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655993100,"counter":347,"content":"<p>I am delighted that the Government is committed achieving its vision of a safe, fair and inclusive Ireland, where people are supported to flourish and live inclusive, healthy and fulfilling lives, whatever their sexual orientation, gender identity or expression.  There are many issues that prevent LGBTQI+ people from achieving their full potential in Irish society, which of a structural nature and require a whole-of-government approach to devising appropriate solutions.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the National LGBTI+ Inclusion Strategy 2019-2022, which contains a number of actions by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deepen awareness among its front-line officers to better the LGBTQI+ needs, which involves victims of hate crimes and the needs of the community in general.  That is so important.  It is expected that the Department of Justice will publish the hate crime Bill in the coming months.  The Bill will create new aggravated forms of certain existing criminal offences, where those offences are motivated by prejudice against a protected characteristic.  The protected characteristics identified in the general scheme are race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origin, sexual orientation, gender and disability.  It is important to create a republic that is founded on the equality and dignity of every citizen.  <\/p>  <p>  Fighting discrimination in all forms is one of Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s core principles and we have committed to working for a fair and equal society.  The year 2018 marked the 25th anniversary of the decriminalisation of homosexuality in Ireland.  The decriminalisation was pioneered by the then Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for Justice, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn.  Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s civil partnership legislation was followed by the marriage referendum.  The Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act was a major frontier in the recognition of loving, same-sex relationships and it was the first time in Irish law that gay relationships were given official recognition.  It included pension rights, succession rights, maintenance obligations and protection in the event of domestic violence.  These were crucial.<\/p>  <p>  Our recent welcome progress continued in March 2021 with the Family Leave and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2021, which amends the Adoptive Leave Act 1995 and enables adoptive couples to choose which parent may avail of adoptive leave.  The Justice Plan 2022 commits to publishing the hate crime Bill in the summer.  A review of the Equality Act is under way, and proposals are expected by the end of year.  Again, this is very important.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned additional funding for events and projects.  Funding for some projects has been cut this year.  I would ask that there would be an emphasis on funding for projects or when funding is needed, there would be some mechanism to get it.<\/p>  <p>  Much progress has been made in recent years, but there are many issues everyday affecting the LGBTQI+ community.  I speak with my very good friend, Deputy Phelan, often.  He is a very good friend of mine.  Just today I spoke with him and he highlighted many issues in my constituency that are still occurring and should not be happening.  In Carlow, we have the Carlow Pride Festival, which is on 10 July.  My diary is again totally booked for that.  I am looking forward to it.  I see the Minister of State is writing that down too.  I absolutely welcome him to that too.  The Carlow Pride Festival does great work every year.  They do great advocacy and just work so hard.  However, they are receiving much hate on social media, especially on Twitter.  Even just this morning I spoke with them, as I said, and they had been getting inappropriate messages through this channel.  This is unacceptable.  Recently, a drag queen was doxxed at a Pride event in the south east, where their address was revealed and their workplace was targeted.  They received harassing and inappropriate emails.  Again, people should not be harassed for being who they are.  That is really unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  There have been recent events of homophobia.  Near Carlow town, a Pride flag was found to have been burned in a local village.  Again, that is unacceptable.  There has also been homophobic abuse occurring at night when people are out socialising.  They are telling me that what is happening now in the past few months is worse than it has been.  Deputy Phelan told me that he feels that this is happening more regularly.  It is just not acceptable.<\/p>  <p>  There was a vigil recently in Carlow.  There have been serious issues where members of the public filmed the event and posted it to far-right extreme forums and social media.  We always say in here that words and action matter.  We have to be so mindful.  That cannot be allowed to happen.  We have to make sure that there is something, whether it is an educational campaign or we set up a committee specifically to look at how we can do this.  We need to work on this.  It is unacceptable.  We cannot and will not allow this to happen to anyone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300040#QQ00200","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speech","time":1655993100,"counter":348,"content":"<p>Equality, inclusion and diversity are three things that should be central to any and every republican who wishes to build and live in a real republic.<\/p> <p>Together, we took a leap of love in the marriage referendum in May 2015.

However, it would be foolish to think that homophobia has vanished and we would be careless, especially in this House, as legislators, to think we can take our eye off the ball.  That same othering, that sniggering, that suspicion and questioning is raising its ugly head right now when it comes to our trans community.<\/p> <p> Have we not learned enough from the way we scapegoated people, the way we, as a society, barged into the lives of men, women and children, locking them up in laundries or lunatic asylums, as they were called at the time, mother and baby institutions and industrial schools?  We just could not leave people alone.  We had to be at them all the time.  I saw on social the media the other day someone say that their father could not remember the word for transitioning, so he used the word \"transforming\".  It is a pretty good word to describe Ireland's own journey, where we looked at the loathing we had for others, and the scapegoating and the finger-pointing, and decided quietly that it is not us anymore and will not be us, because all of us are us.<\/p> <p> Today, as a Kildare Sinn F&eacute;in Deputy, I am especially proud to speak of the trail blazed by a Kildare woman to whom so much is owed, Dr. Lydia Foy.  Dr. Foy changed her gender and had to do it publicly, entering a very long and very public battle for recognition.  Without wishing to intrude on her life, I would imagine it was a very difficult and lonely journey, as it is for so many people who have followed in her footsteps.  As a person who prefers to live and let live, I used to think that whatever gender people identified as was really nobody's business except their own.  It is, however, everybody's business to get out of their way and it is everybody's business to allow them to be and to become the people that they are, without any talk of diminishing or denying anyone else.<\/p> <p> I am loath to give them attention but a small cohort now goes finger-pointing again.  Those in our trans community want nothing from us other than to live their lives as the people they are, the same as any of us.  There has been talk which, I believe, was manufactured and imported.  It was not Irish debate at all but an imported debate on the national broadcaster on trans citizens, people whose lives and whose pain and acute sensitivities were reduced to a talking point on a talk show.  I am all for debate but the national broadcaster should not get involved in gossip or scaremongering, and it should stick to the facts.  The fact is the word \"woman\" is not being removed from anything.  What is being proposed is to insert inclusive language alongside the word \"woman\".  There is no diminution or denial of anything.  There is simply an inclusion of inclusion itself.  Women are going nowhere; just like the T in LGBTQI+ is going nowhere either.  The vast and silent majority know that rights are rights.  Human rights are never up for debate.  Equality, inclusion and diversity do not just happen by themselves.  We make them happen and when we do, we protect them and we move on our fight to the next phase.<\/p> <p> I listened to the Minister's statement.  I welcome that he acknowledged that we need better sexual health services.  We also need timelines for appropriate sex education from the Minister for Education.  We need more training for public services providers so no citizen in our country feels marginalised when accessing services.  People with trans friends, children, siblings and colleagues do not see or treat them as a category, classification or an item in a debate.  We love, respect, protect and defend them for the people that they are, and that is citizens just like all of us.<\/p> <p> Br&oacute;d sona do gach duine.

Two or three things need to be borne in mind.  The LGBT community deserves to be recognised and protected.  Them being different is not a reason for hatred or to generate hatred, but to be able to go about their lives the same as everybody else.  It is in respect of this that I want to say a couple of words.<\/p>  <p>  If the Ceann Comhairle has ever studied, as I have, the faces of people in a crowd who may be fearful, for whatever reason, that fear is mirrored in their visage.  It should not be that way.  There is no need to feel aggrieved, to feel afraid or to feel they are under threat.  That should not apply to anybody in this country or anywhere else.  Several Members have spoken about this today.  It is important that we speak out against violence against anybody for reasons of their race, their sexual orientation, their colour or anything about them.  They are entitled to go about their lives without being impeded by anybody.  That is not the case all the time, however.  There have been cases in this country, which have been referred to and which I think are appalling.  It is appalling to take some someone's life because somebody hates them sufficiently to do so.  They have no right to take somebody else's life.  Pretending to do it on their own behalf or on behalf of some kind of thinking is totally and absolutely wrong.<\/p>  <p>  We have many instances I could quote.  The biggest single example over the past 20 years was the war in Rwanda in which 500,000 people were decapitated at the behest of a person who motivated society on the basis of religious hatred and racism and took the opportunity to extract the maximum in terms of pain from the individual.  It proved that it was possible to kill 500,000 people in the most grotesque circumstances.  It was all done at the behest of a guy who hated people and who seized a radio station and used it to pour out his own particular twisted feelings to such an extent that there was an upheaval and violence.  We know what the result was.<\/p>  <p>  We have had incidents in this country where people with a different sexual orientation from the perpetrators were targeted and, in some cases, killed.  What an appalling thing to do.  One should never, inside or outside politics, have to deal with a situation whereby somebody hates their fellow man or woman to the extent that they feel they have the right to take their lives.  That is something that is sacrosanct to the people and to the country.  They do not have the right to do that in anybody's name.<\/p>  <p>  I am sure, like me, everybody is appalled at what has happened in the United States in recent times, where a person full of racial hatred went into a school and decided to murder the children who were there at the time.  Nobody did anything to stop it for a very crucial period.  That is a bad sign of the way society is going.  What would the founding fathers of the United States or Abraham Lincoln have said about that?<\/p>  <p>  From time to time, we have had little slippages.  They have happened in the UK where people were murdered in cold blood because certain other people hated their sexual orientation, what they said or the views they held, which they were entitled to hold.  I and many other people have spoken about this previously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300041#RR00200","speaker":"1584"}]
