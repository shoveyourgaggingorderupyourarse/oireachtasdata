This evaluation will provide an opportunity to learn lessons from our experiences in dealing with a pandemic over the past two years. This will help ensure that we are in a better, stronger position if another pandemic or another similar type of emergency arrives. <\/p>  <p>  I recognise how difficult it has been for the families of nursing home residents who died during this pandemic, which has presented one of the greatest and most wide-ranging public health challenges internationally in recent history. Throughout the pandemic, the overall national response to COVID-19 has had a specific and sustained focus on older persons, particularly those resident in nursing homes. <\/p>  <p>  This included the establishment of a structured nursing home support system, in line with National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) recommendations, to provide enhanced supports to public and private nursing homes. A comprehensive package of direct and indirect supports was established in early 2020 and many of these remain active across the country to support nursing homes on a proactive basis.     <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the independent COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel was established early in the pandemic in May 2020  to examine the complex issues surrounding the management of COVID-19 in nursing homes and to provide real-time learnings and recommendations to inform the ongoing response. <\/p>  <p>  One of the most important things we can take from the sadness, illness, and death experienced over the last two years is our learning and understanding of the challenges facing the nursing home sector. Through engagement with key stakeholders in the nursing home sector, including residents, their families and advocacy groups, we are committed to implementing the recommendations of the Nursing Homes Expert Panel and a programme of reform is ongoing across health agencies and stakeholders to ensure an improved quality of service and experience for residents into the future.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200068#WRC02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service","counter":92,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200068#WRC02500"},{"type":"question","counter":93,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[37461\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200068#WRC02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will report on the provision of a new ambulance base in Carlow; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1511","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":94,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Health Service Executive (HSE) that the National Ambulance Service (NAS) is planning a replacement for the current facility in Carlow and that a greenfield site has been identified and is under consideration.  <\/p><p>I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly with any further detail that it may have in the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200068#WRC02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":95,"content":"<p>Question No. 121 answered with Question No. 106.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Charges","counter":96,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200068#WRC02900"},{"type":"question","counter":97,"qnumday":122,"qnumall":"[37489\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200068#WRC03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide an update on plans to introduce a cap on the maximum daily charge for car parking for patients and visitors at public hospitals as outlined in the Programme for Government; the timeline that he is working towards for implementation of this commitment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":98,"content":"<p>I am aware that hospitals that charge parking fees are very cognisant of the financial implications of parking costs for patients and their families, particularly for those with long-term illnesses. <\/p><p>Consequently, some hospitals have introduced a maximum daily fixed parking charge and reduced rate parking for long-term patients and visitors for whom the payment of the full rate would cause hardship<i>.<\/i><\/p><p>The <i>Programme for Government<\/i>makes a commitment to introduce a cap on the maximum daily charge for patients and visitors at all public hospitals, where possible and to introduce flexible passes in all public hospitals for patients and their families.

These are normal movements in organisations across the world.<\/p>  <p>  As with any organisation when a staff member moves on, either for career progression or to spend more time with family, the objectives of the organisation remain and it is important for the organisation to go to the market to fill the vacant position with the best talent available for the post.

It is important that the local community of Dublin 18 &ndash; and indeed communities across the country &ndash; have access to public health nurses when they need them. <\/p>  <p>  This is why the Government is investing &euro;195 million this year to deliver the Enhanced Community Care Programme and establish 96 Community Health Networks nationally. These networks will be central to the development of improved primary care services and will enable an expansion of primary care capacity.  There will be eight such networks across the suburbs of Dublin South and South East. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the ECC programme, 3,500 additional staff will be recruited nationally, with a particular focus on nursing and health and social care professionals. Latest figures show that over 2,000 of these staff are recruited or at an advanced stage of recruitment.     <\/p>  <p>  The ECC programme and associated recruitment will boost public health nursing services within Dublin South and Dublin South East, with an additional 15 nursing posts allocated to the area. <\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, it is the case that the HSE has identified challenges to attracting and retaining nurses that are particular to the Dublin area and affecting recruitment in Dublin 18. These challenges include the availability of property to rent and to buy, cost of living expenses, childcare expenses, and commuting issues.  These factors also apply to difficulties in accessing agency staff.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE are working to mitigate these challenges as far as possible at both local and national level. This includes the implementation of an accelerated recruitment campaigns as well as planned engagement with third level institutions in order to recruit newly qualified graduates.  <\/p>  <p>  The HSE also plan to boost international recruitment efforts.  These initiatives have the potential to address the recruitment challenges being experienced in Dublin 18. At the same time, it is important to recognise that the recruitment challenge is not straightforward and that we are competing in a competitive international marketplace for skilled nursing staff.    <\/p>  <p>  It is also the case that the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted on the capacity of the Public Health Nursing to deliver core child health services.  Since March 2020, many Public Health Nurses have been redeployed to support COVID-19 related clinical activities, including vaccination. <\/p>  <p>  As COVID-19 testing and vaccination services are scaled back, available public health nurses are being reassigned from vaccination centres to their core duties with child development check services prioritised.  I am optimistic that this will result in improved service delivery across the country, including Dublin 18.  For example, the HSE have advised that three nurses have recently been reassigned from the Shoreline Vaccination Centre to Dublin South East. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health recognises the need to improve access to the wide range of services provided by public health nurses. I can assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to support the HSE to address the challenges that exist in Dublin 18.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200071#WRF03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff","counter":236,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200071#WRF03400"},{"type":"question","counter":237,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[37623\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200071#WRF03500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the shortage of nurses and nursing managers (details supplied) in University Hospital Galway and Merlin Park Hospital and the related impact on patient care; his plans for the expedited recruitment of nurses to these hospitals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":238,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200071#WRF03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services","counter":239,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200071#WRF03700"},{"type":"question","counter":240,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[37555\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200071#WRF03800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the main improvements in the provision of health services and entitlements for people with a disability over the past two years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1553","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":241,"content":"<p>As these are service matters, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200071#WRF03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff","counter":242,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200071#WRF04000"},{"type":"question","counter":243,"qnumday":169,"qnumall":"[37501\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200071#WRF04100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the steps that are being taken to recruit neurology nurse specialists for Cork University Hospital given that the unit is short of specialised staff; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1545","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":244,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200071#WRF04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Abortion Services","counter":245,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200071#WRF04300"},{"type":"question","counter":246,"qnumday":170,"qnumall":"[37481\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200071#WRF04400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to address the issues that have arisen with the reimbursement of service providers for the provision of abortion services in respect of persons without PPSNs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1574","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":247,"content":"<p>It is my priority to ensure that the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 is fully implemented, and is performing as it should be, to enable all women in Ireland to access termination of pregnancy services quickly and easily, without bias or judgment.<\/p>  <p>  Termination of pregnancy services are free of charge to anyone who is ordinarily resident in the State.

It is proposed that a Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on Drug Use will directly follow these two assemblies, with the intention of running it concurrently with the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on the Future of Education, if learnings from the concurrent running of assemblies suggest that this operational model is the best way forward.<\/p>  <p>  In line with this decision, the Department of Health has commenced preparations for the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on Drug Use, and, to this end, detailed discussions regarding the assembly took place at the most recent meeting of the National Oversight Committee for the National Drugs Strategy. These preparations are being undertaken to ensure that there will be no delay in establishing this citizens&rsquo; assembly when the two assemblies which are currently operating complete their work before the end of this year or in quarter 1, 2023 at the latest. This will allow a period of over one year for the Government to consider its recommendations. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is pursuing a health-led approach to drug use through the health diversion programme, which offers compassion, not punishment to people who are in possession of drugs for personal use. The programme will connect participants with health services and provide a pathway to recovery. It will also allow participants to avoid a criminal conviction, which can have far-reaching consequences, particularly for younger people.<\/p>  <p>  As we prepare for the Citizens Assembly on Drug Use, work continues to implement the health diversion programme and the strategic priorities for the remaining four years of the national drugs strategy. One of these priorities is to promote alternatives to coercive sanctions for drug-related offences. This priority aligns with the EU Drugs Strategy and Action Plan, 2021 &ndash; 2025, which actively encourages Member States to scale up alternatives to coercive sanctions and to monitor and evaluate their effectiveness for drug using offenders and for people arrested, charged with or convicted for drug-related offences or people found in possession of drugs for personal use.<\/p>  <p>  I am very positive about the potential contribution of the citizens assembly to the government's health-led response to drug use. Drug use affects all members of society, whether directly or indirectly, and imposes very significant social and financial costs. Involving citizens in decision-making on drugs policy is therefore appropriate. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200072#WRG01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1608"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service","counter":270,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200072#WRG02000"},{"type":"question","counter":271,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[37473\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200072#WRG02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of home care support hours being provided in each LHO area in CHO3 and 5 in 2022; the way that this compares for each of the LHO areas in 2019; the number of persons currently awaiting home care in each LHO area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1611","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":272,"content":"<p>As this is an operational matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200072#WRG02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":273,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200072#WRG02300"},{"type":"question","counter":274,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[37495\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200072#WRG02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the initiatives being taken to meet the challenge of long Covid; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1602","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":275,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to reply to the Deputy directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200072#WRG02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":276,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200072#WRG02600"},{"type":"question","counter":277,"qnumday":180,"qnumall":"[37357\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200072#WRG02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when he will publish a multi-annual waiting list strategy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":278,"content":"<p>The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan was launched on 25 February this year following extensive engagement between my Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). <\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan contains 45 actions to reduce and reform waiting lists across four main areas of work: delivering capacity, reforming scheduled care, enabling scheduled care reform, and addressing community care access and waiting lists. One of these actions is to develop and agree a multi-annual waiting list reduction plan to support the achievement of the Government maximum wait time targets.<\/p>  <p>  Our immediate priority under the Action Plan during the first half of 2022 has been to focus on identifying and funding additional activity to reduce the number of people waiting, with a particular focus on long waiters.

This includes the &euro;150 million I secured in Budget 2021 to progress the development of a reformed model of service delivery to underpin the statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-support services and to provide 5 million additional hours of home support.     <\/p>  <p>  In 2021 some 20.4 million hours was provided to over 55,000 people. This is about 2.9 million more hours compared to 2020, an increase of 17%.  In 2022, our aim is to provide 23.67 million hours of home support.  <\/p>  <p>  At the end of May preliminary data shows that 55,392 people were receiving home support and over 8.7 million hours has been delivered year to date.  The preliminary data also shows significant inroads have been achieved in reducing waiting lists for funding approval for new or additional service from over 7,800 in January 2020 to 348 in May 2022.  This reduction has been achieved through a combination of validation of the waiting list and availability of additional funding to address those waiting.  However, there can be a lag between funding approval and the actual delivery of home support hours.  Certain geographical areas that are experiencing increased pressures due to staff availability are particularly affected.<\/p>  <p>  At the end of May provisional information shows that there were 4,720 people assessed and approved for Home Support but were awaiting a carer to be assigned. In January 2020, there was about 1,300 people in this category. Despite the increase, it is important to note that the total number of people waiting for home support across both categories has reduced from over 9,000 at the start of 2020 to 5,068 at the end of May 2022. <\/p>  <p>  The number of home support hours in communities is increasing, in line with enhanced investment.

It is understood that the MoU seeks to address traditional ships that often operate on national safety certificates, and which cannot comply with international rules such as the SOLAS Convention or rules within the European Union or individual member states. It is understood that the MoU is mainly designed for traditional ships participating in maritime events in other countries and also contains recommendations for the performance of day trips in the waters of the member countries. The memorandum is not legally binding, and it does not provide a legal basis for the operation of such ships which are regulated by international, EU and national legislation. <\/p>  <p>  The safety of traditional ships is a matter of importance, and many traditional ships are sailing ships. In Ireland there have been several very serious marine casualties involving such ships and it is very fortunate that there has been no loss of lives in these casualties. Full details of these casualties and the issues raised with such ships may be found in the marine casualty reports on the &ldquo;STV Asgard II&rdquo; and &ldquo;STV Astrid&rdquo; published by the Marine Casualty Investigation Board. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is a party to the main international conventions regulating maritime safety most notably the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, SOLAS Convention as well as the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, MAPROL Convention, the International Convention on Load Lines and the International Convention on the Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers. Any ship calling to an Irish port must comply with these conventions and under EU Directive 2009\/16, as amended, on port state control Ireland is obliged to inspect foreign flagged ships calling to Irish ports and must enforce the requirements of these international conventions. The referenced memorandum of understanding does not alter or amend these legally binding obligations. <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, under Irish national legislation any ship carrying more than twelve passengers is a passenger ship and must comply with the Merchant Shipping Acts and hold a passenger ship safety certificate and any vessel carrying twelve or less passenger must hold a passenger boat licence. These are legally binding legislative requirements, and the referenced memorandum does not alter or amend these requirements. <\/p>  <p>  Given the above and the importance of maritime safety, the Department has no plans to become a party to the referenced Memorandum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200077#WRN01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts","counter":530,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200077#WRN02000"},{"type":"question","counter":531,"qnumday":261,"qnumall":"[37293\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200077#WRN02100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if his Department and bodies under the aegis of his Department have engaged the services of two organisations (details supplied) at any point from 1 January 2020 to date; the costs associated with or incurred by the provision of services from these organisations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":532,"content":"<p>Deputy, the department has engaged the services of Carr Communications Ltd.

These include the new Transport Operations and Commercial Driving Apprenticeship, which is being offered by Atlantic Technological University Sligo and which is the country&rsquo;s first academic qualification linked to the profession of HGV driving.<\/p><p>The Logistics and Supply Chain Skills Group has recently published a comprehensive overview of all of the training and educational offerings currently available, which can be found on the group&rsquo;s webpage. <\/p><p>Furthermore, there is ongoing engagement between my Department and the Department of Social Protection (DSP), which has dedicated employer relations teams offering a range of supports and services to employers to fill vacancies including recruitment campaigns, specialised jobs fairs and through the online portal <i>JobsIreland.ie<\/i>.<\/p><p>Regarding recruitment of drivers from abroad, DSP organises events in the EU\/EEA labour market for sectors where there are particularly acute labour shortages and recently ran such a transport-focused recruitment event.<\/p><p>HGV drivers from outside the EU\/EEA must have a valid employment permit and a visa, if coming from a visa required state as defined by the Department of Justice. Following engagement with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the quota for employment permits for HGV drivers from outside the EU\/EEA was removed in October 2021.<\/p><p>These drivers must also exchange their HGV drivers licence for an Irish licence. Ireland has licence exchange agreements with several countries and the Road Safety Authority, which oversees these agreements, is engaging with a number of other countries with a view to progressing further licence exchange agreements.<\/p><p>Labour and skills issues will be further considered in the 10-year strategy for the road haulage sector which, as outlined in the Programme for Government, will focus on generating efficiencies, improving standards, and helping the sector move to a low-carbon future.<\/p><p>Work on the Haulage Strategy is ongoing with a plan for further consultation with stakeholders following publication of a draft strategy in the Autumn. This Strategy is expected to be finalised and published by year-end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200077#WRN04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rail Network","counter":560,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200077#WRN05000"},{"type":"question","counter":561,"qnumday":271,"qnumall":"[37536\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200077#WRN05100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if the installation of ICT infrastructure has commenced at the national train control centre in Heuston Station.","asker":"1489","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":562,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport,  I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.

In addition, a number of smaller ports will be required for ORE Operation and Maintenance activities. A number of ports and private entities are already progressing plans to provide the facilities and infrastructure required to support the construction and maintenance of offshore wind farms and to assist the ORE sector to develop in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  While Irish Ports receive no exchequer funding, as part of endeavours to maximise EU funding, following extensive engagement with other Member States and the Commission, the Department successfully obtained changes to the Ten-T CEF criteria to allow EU funding of port infrastructure for ORE in the 2021-2023 funding stream. On its own, CEF funding does not have any State aid implications and successful applicants can obtain significant grant funding of up to 50% of eligible costs for studies and up 30% of infrastructure works costs.  <\/p>  <p>  A call opened in 2021 for applications and closed last January for funding for transport infrastructure projects. Bearing in mind the confidential nature of the process, individual applications cannot be commented on. However, four ports\/private entities that are eligible under TEN-T applied for funding for studies which will effectively allow them to prepare for lodgement of planning applications in 2022 and 2023 onwards for ORE port developments. <\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, none of these applications were successful in the first call. These are competitive processes, and typically oversubscribed and we are engaging with the Commission to understand the decisions. The companies involved continue progressing their plans and are also engaging with the Commission before preparing applications for the next call due to open in September this year. The Department will continue to assist, as appropriate, eligible applicants with the application process. <\/p>  <p>  The Department also continues to encourage engagement between the ports and developers so they are best placed to exploit the opportunities that will arise from the development of the ORE industry. From DoT engagements, it is known that ports and private entities are engaging in their own commercial discussions with ORE project developers to underpin the business case for the port infrastructure developments.  Progression of projects and timelines remains subject to results of ORESS auctions, substantive engagement from  ORE developers directly with ports, establishment and resourcing of MARA, MAC consents for ports and planning consents for the necessary port infrastructure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200078#WRO03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Licences","counter":611,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200078#WRO04000"},{"type":"question","counter":612,"qnumday":289,"qnumall":"[37788\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200078#WRO04100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the status of a driver licence for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1461","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":613,"content":"<p>All enquires relating to driver licensing are handled by the National Driver Licence Service, the provision of which I have delegated to the Road Safety Authority under the relevant legislation.

Driver licensing laws are intended to ensure drivers on our roads meet high safety standards.

For non-EU jurisdictions, Ireland may make bilateral agreements on licence exchange. This is not a straightforward matter and reaching them is not a matter of political will. The core principle is to ensure the continued safety of Irish road users. Agreements can be made only when the authorities in each jurisdiction have studied and compared the licensing regimes, so that each side is satisfied that standards are compatible. For Ireland, this task is undertaken by the Road Safety Authority (RSA).<\/p>  <p>  Since 2014, the RSA has been working on driving licence exchange agreements with Canada. Agreements have been completed with Ontario, Manitoba, Newfoundland &amp;amp; Labrador, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Alberta and New Brunswick to date. <\/p>  <p>  The RSA has previously explored exchange agreements with the USA. However, US driver licensing operates at state, rather than federal, level, meaning that there are 50 licensing systems with widely varying standards. Agreement with any one state would mean taking into account the exchange relations between that state and the other 49. The RSA determined that agreement would not be feasible.  <\/p>  <p>  When people come to Ireland with a non-exchangeable licence, they may obtain an Irish licence through the standard statutory process. A person with a full but non-exchangeable licence can avail of shorter Essential Driver Training of 6 lessons, instead of the usual 12, and they do not have to wait 6 months before taking a driving test.

The draft strategy sets out the government&rsquo;s ambition regarding the delivery of a public EV charging network to support up to 194,000 electric cars and vans by the middle of the decade. Responses and submissions received as part of the consultation are currently being considered in the development of the final Strategy for publication. <\/p>  <p>  There is a need for a seamless public charging network that will provide for situations or instances where home charging is not possible such as on-street and residential charging, destination charging, and workplace charging. <\/p>  <p>  Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland is to be launched next Thursday. This Office will play an important role in our transition to zero emission vehicles. It will co-ordinate measures to support the uptake of EVs and the rollout of charge point infrastructure including the development of a number of new infrastructure schemes. A significant increase in funding for local authorities to deliver EV charging points will be rolled out in the latter half of this year.<\/p>  <p>  The existing Public Charge Point Scheme continues to be available during 2022 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of the scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles, who do not have access to a private parking space, but instead rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes to charge their EVs. Mayo County Council has not as yet applied for funding under this scheme in 2022. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has reviewed the Scheme and the draft Strategy sets out a number of additional actions to support delivery by local authorities, such as funding capital costs for civil and electrics works, as well as charge point installation, through a new Residential Charging Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is also developing a new scheme which will support the installation of destination charge points in locations such as visitor centres and parks. This new initiative will help provide another critical link in the overall network for public charging.<\/p>  <p>  &euro;10 million was committed from the Climate Action Fund to support ESB investment in the charging network and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB, with the infrastructure to be in place by the end of 2022. This intervention alone will result in:<\/p>  <p>  - 90 additional high power chargers, each capable of charging two vehicles - Seventeen high-power chargers distributed across 14 multi-vehicle hubs have been delivered as part of the programme to date.<\/p>  <p>  - 52 additional fast chargers, which may replace existing standard chargers - This work is completed at 36 locations.<\/p>  <p>  - 264 replacement standard chargers with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points - This work is substantially complete.  258 of the chargers have now been successfully replaced.<\/p>  <p>  Further details on the progression of this project can be found at esb.ie\/ecars\/our-network\/network-upgrades. <\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to engage directly with stakeholders to ensure that a sufficient number of chargers, as well as a sufficient spread of charger types, will be in place to meet demand as we move towards our 2030 target of almost1 million EVs on the road.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200079#WRP02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Projects","counter":654,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200079#WRP02600"},{"type":"question","counter":655,"qnumday":303,"qnumall":"[38061\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200079#WRP02700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the status of the works between Glasheen Road roundabout, Bandon, and the Claire O'Leary walk, Cork (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1545","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":656,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport I have responsibility for overall policy and exchequer funding in relation to the National Roads Programme.

The properties are owned and controlled by their registered owners, or appointed receivers in the event of enforcement. The Receiver is an agent of the debtor, not NAMA.<\/p>  <p>  The referenced property is a private residential development consisting of a number of apartment blocks and houses. Each apartment owner owns their own individual unit and the various residential units are owner occupied or rented. NAMA owns certain loans which are secured by 15 individual residential units in the development. These units are under the control of a NAMA appointed receiver, John McStay of McStay Luby. <\/p>  <p>  NAMA understands from the appointed receiver, Mr. McStay, that it is not the case that the apartments cannot be insured until fire works are completed. The receiver has advised NAMA of his understanding of the current position regarding block insurance. The current insurer (QBE) is exiting this aspect of the Irish market, thereby necessitating a change of insurer. Subject to a fully completed proposal, which must include the claims history and a plan to remedy any known defects to the common areas, it is understood that cover can be made available. The insurance broker for the receiver has offered to assist the OMC (Owners Management Company) with the matter.<\/p>  <p>  NAMA has been advised by the receiver that he has been engaging extensively with the OMC, and its appointed legal and insurance advisors, in relation to the insurance and any queries raised. In addition, the receiver, in his capacity as agent of the developer and without any legal obligation or requirement to do so (as recently determined by the Court of Appeal in separate proceedings, entitled  Grehan &amp;amp; Ors v Maynooth Business Campus Owners&rsquo; Management CLG [High Court record number 2018\/5042P]) has carried out very substantial remediation works to the development which were funded by NAMA.  It is therefore simply incorrect to suggest that NAMA or the appointed receiver has, in some way, dealt improperly or unfairly with the private owners or residents of this development. In fact, the contrary is true.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, I am advised that there is extant litigation between the receiver and the OMC in relation to the referenced development. Given the on-going litigation (which is hopefully reaching a final conclusion) you will appreciate that NAMA is not in a position to substantively engage in certain issues, which it is understood are the subject of disputed claims in the ongoing pending litigation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200079#WRP03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Yield","counter":660,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200079#WRP03200"},{"type":"question","counter":661,"qnumday":305,"qnumall":"[37944\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200079#WRP03300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the funds that have been raised through the carbon tax; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1451","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":662,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that Carbon Tax receipts by commodity for the years 2010 to 2020 are published on the Revenue website at the following link: <\/p><p>www.revenue.ie\/en\/corporate\/information-about-revenue\/statistics\/excise\/receipts-volume-and-price\/excise-receipts-commodity.aspx. <\/p><p>I am further advised that the amounts raised through the Carbon Tax in 2021 and provisionally to the end of June 2022 are &euro;652 million and &euro;409 million respectively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200079#WRP03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Medical Certificates","counter":663,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200079#WRP03500"},{"type":"question","counter":664,"qnumday":306,"qnumall":"[37028\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200079#WRP03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when the new disabled drivers medical board of appeal will be in place; the number of appeals waiting to be reviewed since the resignation of all members of the previous disabled drivers medical board of appeal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1609","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":665,"qnumday":309,"qnumall":"[37119\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200079#WRP03700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 47 of 16 June 2022, the status of the recruitment of persons to the disabled drivers medical board of appeal; when the new board will be appointed and be operational; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":666,"qnumday":319,"qnumall":"[37260\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200079#WRP03800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when an appeal (details supplied) will be heard by the disabled drivers medical board of appeal; the reason for the delay in having this appeal heard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1612","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":667,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 306, 309 and 319 together.<\/p><p>The Disabled Drivers &amp;amp; Disabled Passengers Scheme provides relief from Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT on the purchase and use of an adapted car, as well as an exemption from motor tax and an annual fuel grant.<\/p><p>  The Scheme is open to severely and permanently disabled persons as a driver or as a passenger and also to certain charitable organisations.

The scheme is intended to act as a stimulus to the creation of an indigenous film industry in the State, creating quality employment opportunities and supporting the expression of the Irish culture.<\/p>  <p>  Finance Act 2018 introduced a short-term, tapered regional uplift for productions being made in areas designated under the State aid regional guidelines. The purpose of the regional uplift is to support the development of new, local pools of talent in areas outside the current main production hubs, to support the geographic spread of the audio-visual sector.<\/p>  <p>  The uplift originally provided an increased level of credit for four years, with 5% available in years 1 and 2 (2019 and 2020), 3% available in year 3 (2021), 2% available in year 4 (2022). However in recognition of the detrimental impact the COVID-19 crisis had on the audio-visual sector, Finance Act 2020 amended the regional uplift to provide for an additional 5% year in 2021, in effect to replace the incentive year lost as a result of the COVID-related public health measures. The tapered withdrawal of the uplift then restarted this year with a reduction to 3%, it will reduce 2% in 2023, and Nil thereafter.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently no plans to increase or extend the regional uplift, or to introduce alternative regional specific changes to the film tax credit. However I would note that the main film tax credit will remain available to qualifying productions in all areas of the country following the winding-down of the uplift.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, there are a number of other supports already available to ensure the continued growth of the film industry across Ireland. I am informed by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (DTCAGSM) that Screen Ireland, the national development agency for the Irish film, television and animation industry, has recently announced an investment of over &euro;2 million towards the establishment of five new National Talent Academies in Wicklow, Limerick, Galway and Dublin for film and tv drama, animation and production crew. These new Talent Academies will build on the success of the Section 481 skills model to develop and drive opportunities for diverse and regional talent on a national level.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, in 2021 Screen Ireland launched funding for crew development hubs. These Regional Development Talent Academies will focus on regional talent development and inclusion, ensuring opportunities and support for new and diverse talent. This will ensure an overall national approach to creative talent, crew and workforce development in line with the significant growth ambition for the industry and commitment to social cohesion.<\/p>  <p>  Also in 2021, Screen Ireland announced the Creative Futures fund as part of a commitment to grow strong and resilient companies throughout the country. The fund is designed to help support companies to strengthen and hone their expert creative capabilities and ambitions and build cultural resilience to enable high quality cultural projects. I am informed by DTCAGSM that 35% of successful companies were based regionally (outside of Dublin and Wicklow).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200079#WRP04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":671,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200079#WRP04300"},{"type":"question","counter":672,"qnumday":308,"qnumall":"[37109\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200079#WRP04400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of the introduction of a vacant homes tax.","asker":"1574","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":673,"content":"<p>Addressing vacancy and dereliction, and maximising the use of the existing housing stock, is a priority objective of the Government. <i>Housing for All <\/i>includes a specific action for the Department of Finance to collect data on vacancy with a view to introducing a vacant property tax.<\/p><p>Provisions included in the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021 enabled Revenue to collect certain information on vacant properties in the Local Property Tax return forms submitted by residential property owners in respect of the new LPT valuation period 2022-2025.

However, it is not possible for the Minister for Finance, nor the Central Bank in carrying out its regulatory functions to advise or comment on the management of loans (and\/or the treatment of any security which may be associated with a loan) by regulated entities as such issues are a business matter for the individual regulated entity.  <\/p>  <p>  However, at a general level, the Central Bank advises that loan arrears cases have individual circumstances, many of which are complex, that require real sustainable solutions and there is not a 'one size fits all' solution the issue of distressed debt.  Nevertheless, holding a high stock of non-performing loans (NPLs) can affect the credit supply channel, by restricting the amount of capital that could be otherwise lent or used for more economically and socially useful activities, and can cause serious dysfunction for the banking system and hence its ability to serve the economy and its customers. <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, the Central Bank expects credit institutions with a high proportion of NPLs to set, at a minimum, clearly defined realistic yet ambitious quantitative targets to reduce the level of NPLs. Where assets which acted as security for a loan are realised (such as properties in possession) are material, a strategy in respect of such assets should be defined or, at least, reduction targets should be included in the NPL strategy in respect of such assets. <\/p>  <p>  Where this is a part of a credit institution&rsquo;s NPL strategy, it should also monitor the volume, ageing, coverage and flows of such assets at a sufficient level of granularity to take into account material types of assets.

However, this timeframe should be clearly limited as the aim is a timely sale of the assets concerned.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA), it advises that its loans are primarily segregated and managed by borrower\/debtor connection as this was the most efficient way to manage the cross-secured loan portfolios originally acquired by NAMA and that the property assets securing NAMA's loans remain in the ownership and control of their registered owners (NAMA debtors) or appointed receivers, in the event of enforcement.

The relevant income thresholds may be increased further if the individual has a qualifying child. The thresholds are increased by &euro;575 in respect of both the first and second child, and &euro;830 in respect of each subsequent child. <\/p>  <p>  Marginal relief may be available where the individual&rsquo;s or couple&rsquo;s income exceeds the relevant exemption limit but is less than twice that amount. Where marginal relief applies, the individual or couple is taxed at 40% on all income above the exemption limit to a ceiling of twice the exemption limit.  Once the income exceeds twice the exemption limit marginal relief is no longer available and the individual pays tax under the normal tax system.  It should be noted, however, that where the individual&rsquo;s income is greater than the exemption limit but below twice that limit, the taxpayer is always given the benefit of the more favourable treatment as between the use of marginal relief or the normal tax system of credits and bands.   <\/p>  <p>  Persons aged 65 or over may also avail of the age tax credit, which currently amounts to &euro;245 per year for single persons or &euro;490 per year for married couples or civil partners.

LPT has yielded over &euro;4 billion for Local Authorities since its introduction.   <\/p>  <p>  All property owners benefit from the essential local services LPT helps to fund. The proper functioning of these services is important for every community and household.  Accordingly, it is equitable that the cost of providing the services should be shared by as broad a spectrum of owners as possible.  If the tax were abolished, the funding gap would ultimately need to be met by the Exchequer in the form of increased general taxation.  For these reasons, I do not plan to abolish the Local Property Tax. <\/p>  <p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021 fulfils the Programme for Government commitment to bring forward legislation in relation to LPT on the basis of fairness and that most homeowners would face no increase in their LPT liability. The Act provides for a cut in the main rate of the tax and widening of the valuation bands to make the changes affordable.  As these changes were implemented for the 2022 LPT year, this meant that the majority of homeowners saw either a decrease or no change in their LPT liability. Where increases arose, the majority were by a single band. <\/p>  <p>  The LPT legislation provides for the possibility of deferring the charge to LPT in certain circumstances to assist individuals who may have difficulty paying the tax. A qualifying person may opt to defer, or partially defer, payment of the tax. Where a person qualifies for a full deferral then 100 per cent of the liability can be deferred. Where a person qualifies for partial deferral, then 50 per cent of the liability can be deferred. The balance of 50 per cent of the tax must be paid. The deferred tax remains as a charge on the property and must be paid before a sale or transfer can be completed. Interest is charged on the deferred amount.  The interest charge is 4% per annum for LPT deferred for years 2013 to 2021; and the rate was reduced to 3% per annum for LPT deferred for the year 2022 and subsequent years.  The income thresholds were increased in 2022 and are now &euro;18,000 for a single person and &euro;30,000 for a couple to qualify for a full deferral. The income limits to qualify for a partial deferral are &euro;30,000 for a single person and &euro;42,000 for a couple.  It is also possible to apply for a deferral on the grounds of hardship if a person suffers an unexpected and unavoidable significant loss or expense as a result of which a person cannot pay their LPT liability without suffering financial hardship.  Further information regarding the deferral of LPT is available on the Revenue website at: www.revenue.ie\/en\/property\/documents\/lpt\/guidelines-for-deferral-of-lpt.pdf.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that it has engaged extensively with residential property owners who are experiencing financial difficulties, to agree flexible LPT payment arrangements that best suit their circumstances and avoid unnecessary hardship, and Revenue has assured me that this will continue to be the case.  <\/p>  <p>  Any property owners experiencing financial difficulties can avail of a wide range of flexible payment options both in respect of 2022 liabilities and for any previous years where liabilities remain outstanding. The full range of payment options, which includes phased arrangements, are available to property owners on the Revenue website at:  www.revenue.ie\/en\/property\/local-property-tax\/paying-your-lpt\/index.aspx.<\/p>  <p>  The LPT payment compliance rate for 2022 currently stands at 95%.

The ETD prescribes minimum tax rates for fuel with which all Member States must comply. ETD provisions on mineral oils are transposed into national law in Finance Act 1999 (as amended) and this Act provides for the application of excise duty, in the form of Mineral Oil Tax (MOT), to specified mineral oils that are used as motor or heating fuels. MOT is comprised of a non-carbon component and a carbon component. The carbon component is commonly referred to as carbon tax and the non-carbon component is often referred to as &ldquo;excise&rdquo;, &ldquo;fuel excise&rdquo; or &ldquo;fuel duty&rdquo;. It is important to note that both components of MOT are excise. Total MOT rates are what are considered in terms of compliance with ETD minimum rates.<\/p><p>In accordance with the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act, 2010, VAT is chargeable on petrol and auto-diesel at the standard rate, currently 23%, on the total amount which the supplier is entitled to receive including taxes, duties, levies and charges but excluding the VAT itself. A levy is also charged on petrol and diesel to cover the costs related to maintaining security of oil supplies. While both MOT and VAT are administered by Revenue the levy is administered by, and paid directly to, the National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA).<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that in March this year, in response to the current fuel crisis, I introduced significant reductions in the MOT rates for petrol and auto-diesel.

With filing not due until 18 months after the initial period of account, for most companies this would mean that the first Pillar Two returns would not be due until mid-2026.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is mindful of the need to maintain an environment of certainty for businesses.

Households in the bottom three deciles are better off as a result of the carbon increase and the compensatory welfare measures. <\/p><p>The remaining revenues (&euro;36m) were allocated to fund the continuation of the 2020 and 2021 Carbon Tax Investment Programme.

The ceilings detailed in the National Development Plan 2021-30 (NDP) are cognisant of the overall capability of the construction sector to deliver on the NDP and of the appropriate share of National Income being devoted to infrastructure. The levels of capital spending, at close to 5% of GNI*, are already among the highest in the EU and are close to the limit of the overall capability to deliver in the coming decade.<\/p>  <p>  The use of the Framework is voluntary, but participation by the parties is strongly encouraged. It represents a pragmatic and proportionate response to the current challenges caused by inflation that are not within either party&rsquo;s control.<\/p>  <p>  The Framework facilitates both parties to engage with one another for the purpose of addressing the impacts of this most recent onset of exceptional inflation and supply chain disruption and operates on an ex-gratia basis. It sets down the approaches and the parameters within which parties to a public works contract calculate additional costs attributable to material and energy price fluctuations, on an ongoing basis, using the specified price indices published monthly by the Central Statistics Office.<\/p>  <p>  The measures available under the Framework strike an important balance between the additional costs incurred by the State to support Contractors engaged on public projects and the State&rsquo;s ability to deliver the NDP including housing delivery, whilst providing value for money for the taxpayer.<\/p>  <p>  The Framework applies to payments made from 1 January 2022 in recognition that inflationary pressures were further building from this point in anticipation of the invasion of Ukraine.  The extent of additional payments that will arise on projects going forward will depend on the materials that are to be incorporated, the stage of the project&rsquo;s development and further movement in prices which is extremely difficult to forecast at this moment.<\/p>  <p>  At this point, parties have begun their initial engagement and any agreement (and costs associated with inflation) will take a period of time to be worked through.  Once the initial engagement is complete and the retrospective payments are made, the specified formulae will be applied to each interim payment in the manner set out in the template agreement to determine the cost adjustment (if any) that is due for inflation.<\/p>  <p>  The cost associated with the implementation of the Framework will not be collated centrally.  It is managed at a project level by contracting authorities and reported to approving authorities so the impact on their overall capital ceiling can be assessed and the programme adjusted accordingly.<\/p>  <p>  The 2022 capital allocation is &euro;11,403 million. This is an increase of &euro;0.9 billion or 8% on the 2021 allocation and an increase of almost &euro;2.3 billion or 25% on the actual spend (exclusive of carryover) in 2021. In aggregate, including capital carryover, there is &euro;12.2 billion available for capital spending this year. In the NDP, it was clarified that there will need to be an agile approach to funding allocations and in-plan reprioritisation of funding, particularly where underspends and policy changes are apparent.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the use of capital carryover to fund any additional costs associated with the Inflation Cooperation Framework, Section 91 of the Finance Act, 2004 makes statutory provision for capital carryover by way of deferred surrender.  Carryover amounts are published in the Appropriation Act at Vote level and at subhead level in the Deferred Surrender Ministerial Order, which must be made before 31 March in the second financial year.  When the resolution approving the Order is passed by the D&aacute;il, the carryover amounts become the first charge against the subheads designated in the Order and are typically spent early in the year.   <\/p>  <p>  Virement of deferred surrender amounts, as designated by subhead in the Ministerial Order, is not permissible under any circumstances. Therefore, any deferred surrender amounts that are not spent under the designated subhead by the end of the second year must be surrendered to the Central Fund.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200081#WRR02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Budget 2023","counter":773,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200081#WRR02900"},{"type":"question","counter":774,"qnumday":344,"qnumall":"[37158\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200081#WRR03000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will confirm that the annual priority reserve of &euro;51 million in 2023 will not be used as a resource for overspends in Budget 2023 given that it is stated in page 44 of the National Development Plan that the reserve is not intended as a resource to meet any potential overspends or cost inflation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1579","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":775,"content":"<p>I can confirm to the Deputy that it is not intended that the annual priority reserve of &euro;51 million for 2023 as set out in National Development Plan (NDP) 2021-2030 will be used as a resource for any potential overspends in Budget 2023.

The allocation includes &euro;50 million for business continuity supports and a &euro;35 million increase to the Tourism Marketing Fund to support the delivery of a marketing strategy to help restore inbound tourism to Ireland. Due to the devastating impact of COVID-19, the full effects of Brexit on our tourism sector may not become apparent for some time.<\/p><p>As part of its marketing strategy, Tourism Ireland has established a recovery framework which will be underpinned by an extensive programme of promotional activity throughout 2022. The organisation has a flexible, three-phase plan to RESTART, REBUILD and ultimately REDESIGN demand. Over &euro;80 million is being invested in the programme in 2022, allowing Tourism Ireland to ramp up its campaigns in key international markets.

All of their mediators, adjudicators and tribunal members have independent decision-making powers, in the same way as judges have within the Court system. As the RTB has replaced the courts in resolving residential tenancy disputes, it has a responsibility towards all parties involved in a dispute to ensure that a fair hearing is conducted and that each party will have the opportunity to set out their case. Any decision made is based on the facts and evidence of a given case.<\/p>  <p>  In setting a rent, a landlord cannot exceed the market rent. In general, a rent in respect of a dwelling cannot be reviewed more frequently than annually in a Rent Pressure Zone (RPZ), or biannually outside of a RPZ. In reviewing a rent, a landlord must complete the Notice of Rent Review (available on the RTB&rsquo;s website) which must be served on the tenant at least 90 days before the new rent becomes payable and requires details of the rent last set for the dwelling and, if the dwelling is in an RPZ, comply with procedures providing for the rent increase restriction and use the Rent Pressure Zone calculator on www.rtb.ie to ensure compliance with the rent setting laws.<\/p>  <p>  A landlord must include details of 3 comparable rents in the Notice of Rent Review.<\/p>  <p>  Where a tenant is unsure as to the validity of a Notice of Rent Review served, he or she may refer the matter to the RTB for dispute resolution, with redress available to the tenant including a possible direction to pay a refund of any unlawful rent amount paid and an amount of damages of up to &euro;20,000.<\/p>  <p>  Since 1 July 2019, the RTB is empowered under Part 7A &ndash; Complaints, Investigations and Sanctions &ndash; of the Residential Tenancies Acts to investigate improper conduct by landlords including unlawful rent setting in RPZs and to impose sanctions, where appropriate. The RTB has the power to impose sanctions if improper conduct by a landlord is found to have occurred, ranging from a formal written caution and\/or a fine of up to &euro;15,000 and\/or costs up to &euro;15,000.<\/p>  <p>  I have no plans to alter the Residential Tenancies Act in this regard at this time but I do keep the operation of the Acts under constant review and I will make timely amendments, as may be required.

In this regard, a central element of Housing for All is to build institutional capacity and Housing for All commits to strengthen the capacity of local authorities to initiate, design, plan, develop and manage housing projects and recognises that this requires the resourcing of the housing services of local authorities.

It is expected that the LPT yield will change following revaluation last November and the distribution model will be reviewed when new yield per local authority is fully quantified; final figures are not yet available. <\/p>  <p>  Given the need for timely information to be provided to local authorities for their budgetary process and the need for final LPT figures to inform that, I do not expect that baselines will be reviewed in advance of the 2023 local authority budget process. Each local authority situation is complex and it is important that sufficient time is taken to analyse and assess potential options in that respect. Preliminary census data will also form an important input to that deliberation. My Department will, however, be considering, in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the potential for a move towards 100% retention for 2023. LPT allocations for 2023 have, therefore, yet to be decided.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200085#WRV01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":995,"content":"<p>Question No. 423 answered with Question No. 375.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes","counter":996,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200085#WRV01400"},{"type":"question","counter":997,"qnumday":424,"qnumall":"[37603\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200085#WRV01500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if the current &euro;30,000 upper limit on the amount payable under the essential works grant scheme for the elderly will be reviewed upwardly; and if so, when this will occur given the current inflationary costs affecting construction.","asker":"1597","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":998,"content":"<p>My Department provides funding to local authorities for the Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability Scheme.

The actual cost of retrofitting works on each home will depend on its pre-works BER but can be as low as &euro;16,350 in some cases. Targets set and funding allocated to local authorities under the new programme calls for local authorities to undertake retrofitting on a variety of house types, from those requiring minimal investment to those requiring major investment, in order to achieve the B2\/Cost Optimal BER.

All provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, will be examined in the context of this review. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200087#WRX01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1099,"content":"<p>Question No. 463 answered with Question No. 462.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fire Service","counter":1100,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200087#WRX01600"},{"type":"question","counter":1101,"qnumday":464,"qnumall":"[38096\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200087#WRX01700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if there was a change in policy in the fire service which meant for a time that firefighters had to retire at 58 years of age; if this policy has subsequently changed; if compensation or other consideration has been given to those firefighters who were forced to retire at 58 years who would otherwise have had the opportunity to continue in service for another two years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1507","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":1102,"content":"<p>Previously, the normal retirement age of retained firefighters was 55 years, with provision for an annual extension up to the age of 58 years, subject to a formal application process, including a compulsory assessment under the Occupational Health Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  In early 2020, the Workplace Relations Commission recommended that the existing provisions for the retirement age of retained firefighters should be amended to change the existing provision for an annual extension from 58 years to 60 years.<\/p>  <p>  In deference to this recommendation, in December 2020 and on an interim basis pending consideration of legislative amendments, retained firefighters may now continue working until reaching the age of 60 years, subject to annual compulsory assessment under the Occupational Health Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of compensation does not arise where policy changes in response to a recommendation of the Workplace Relations Commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200087#WRX01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":1104,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200087#WRX02000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Birth Registration","counter":1103,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200087#WRX01900"},{"type":"question","counter":1104,"qnumday":465,"qnumall":"[37644\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200087#WRX02000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if the foreign births registry application of a person (details supplied) will be expedited; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1105,"content":"<p>Due to the complex nature of the Foreign Birth Registration (FBR) process, the large increase in applications received following the Brexit vote in the UK, and the pause in the Service due to necessary Covid-19 restrictions, applicants should allow over 2 years from the receipt of supporting documentation for processing of FBR applications at this time.<\/p>  <p>  Due to Covid-19 restrictions, and the subsequent reassignment of FBR staff to assist in the provision of essential passport services, the FBR Service was paused for nearly 15 months across the 2020-2021 period.<\/p>  <p>  The processing of FBR applications resumed in November 2021.

The Passport Service aims to process these applications within 15 working days of receiving the supporting documents.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service has been scaling up resources to deal with anticipated demand for passports since June of last year. A major recruitment drive has been underway for several months which has seen the Passport Service taking on over 560 new staff since June 2021. <\/p>  <p>  This recruitment drive has directly contributed to the significant reduction in turnaround times for online first time applications. Turnaround time for these complex applications has been reduced by 40% since March, down from 40 working days to 25 working days currently. The Passport Service is focused on reducing this turnaround time even further in the coming weeks. These additional staff are also helping to reduce the overall processing time for incomplete applications that require additional supporting documents. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Passport Service has taken the following steps to deal with the unprecedented demand seen so far this year and to improve processing times:<\/p>  <p>  - The Passport Service has worked with senior management at An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (AGS) to develop a system for verifying Garda witnesses on passport applications in cases where the Garda signature cannot be verified by the Passport Service directly with the Garda station. This new system assists in reducing the number of passport applications that are delayed due to a failure to verify witness details.<\/p>  <p>  - The Passport Service released new video guides in May to assist citizens in submitting the correct photos and consent forms for children&rsquo;s applications. These short videos provide tips to ensure that photos and children&rsquo;s consent forms will meet the Passport Service requirements.

As part of this review, the <i>Draft Primary Curriculum Framework<\/i>was published for public consultation in February 2020. Work is ongoing in finalising the framework in respect of the findings from the consultation. The draft framework proposes the introduction of five broad curriculum areas, one being Social, Personal and Values Education and another being Social and Environmental Education (incorporating history and geography). The introduction of these curriculum areas into the redeveloped primary curriculum provides opportunities for learning experiences on the nature, role and value of Trade Unions in Ireland. Work on the development of curriculum specifications for the five curriculum areas will begin later this year.<\/p><p>The model of curriculum design at post-primary level is based on learning outcomes, setting out what students should know or be able to do. This model allows for much flexibility and autonomy for teachers in designing learning experiences. The role and importance of trade unions can be explored most obviously in business courses, but there are opportunities elsewhere too to consider their historical and contemporary significance, especially in History, CSPE and Politics and Society.<\/p><p>The Junior Cycle History specification provides numerous opportunities to explore the significance of trade unions in Irish history and how they have contributed to political and social developments in Ireland. <\/p><p>Among the many opportunities that exist at Junior Cycle to teach about the history of trade unions, of particular significance is learning outcome 2.10. This requires students to &lsquo;Examine how one sporting, cultural or social movement<b><\/b>impacted on Irish life.&rsquo;  When this learning outcome was devised by the JC history development group in 2017, the word &lsquo;social&rsquo; was deliberately added to allow for groups such as trade unions to be the focus of particular study, and to allow for students to understand the significance and contribution of the role of trade unions in Irish history.<\/p><p>Both the Irish History and Europe and the Wider World History strands allow for students to &lsquo;Debate the idea that the 1960s was an important decade in Ireland\/Europe and the wider world, referring to relevant personalities, issues and events.&rsquo; This allows scope to consider how trade unions contributed to significant developments in politics and society, nationally and internationally, during this decade.<\/p><p>It should also be noted that the two Classroom Based Assessments for History, <i>The Past in My Place<\/i>and <i>A Life in Time<\/i>, each allow for students to look at an aspect of the trade union movement, or an important related personality.<\/p><p>In CSPE, there is great scope for considering the role of trade unions when interpreting learning outcomes. The CSPE course is taken by all students in junior cycle and infused throughout the course are numerous opportunities to explore the role that trade unions play in decision making processes in Irish social and political structures, and in tackling social justice issues. There is also an active citizenship dimension that allows for students to conduct a project, allowing for deeper learning about civic society and democratic processes.<\/p><p>Throughout the LC Politics and Society course, there are opportunities to consider the role of trade unions and other bodies in decision making processes. For instance, in learning outcome 2.1, students are obliged to describe the process of decision-making at national level in relation to a policy that impacts upon young people, making reference to the roles of: <b>civil society bodies or groups; <\/b>statutory bodies; the civil service; the social partnership process; the relevant minister and the government political parties; the Houses of the Oireachtas and the European Union supranational agreements such as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.<\/p><p>Recent revisions to the specification explicitly include reference to the role of trade unions in promoting sustainable development. Learning outcomes 8.1 states that students should be able to consider the role of each of the following in achieving sustainable development:  individual and local community efforts; corporate\/business sector; civic society groups, including trade unions, governments and international agreements.<\/p><p>Further to the above curricular provisions, the <i>Framework for Junior Cycle (2015)<\/i>gives schools greater flexibility to design programmes that are suited to the needs of their junior cycle students and to the particular context of the school. In addition to offering subjects, schools can offer students the opportunity to study short courses. <\/p><p>These short courses can be developed by teachers, or other agencies such as Mandate, to suit the specific needs and interests of their students in junior cycle. Information on how to develop a short course can be found on here: <i>ncca.ie\/en\/junior-cycle\/subjects-and-short-courses\/develop-your-own-short-course\/<\/i>.  This may be an avenue of interest to Mandate Trade Union to explore.<\/p><p>The remit of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), outlined in the Education Act, is to advise the Minister for Education on matters relating to the curriculum for early childhood education, primary and post-primary schools, and the assessment procedures employed in schools and examinations on subjects which are part of the curriculum. As part of this, the Council has a responsibility to review the curriculum and to advise the Minister accordingly. In accordance with the Education Act, the Council is a representative structure and is appointed by the Minister for Education for a four-year term. It has 26 members who represent teachers, students, school managers, parents, business interests, trade unions, the Irish language sector and other educational interests. The current Council, appointed in March of this year, has 8 trade union members.<\/p><p>Curriculum development work is carried out on behalf of Council by Boards and development groups. Members of development groups are nominated as representatives of their nominating bodies which comprise the key stakeholders and partners in education. <\/p><p>NCCA boards and development groups serve both the function of bringing expertise and valuable experience to the deliberations while at the same time providing effective representation around the table. Trade unions form an important and significant part of this representation on development groups and boards at both primary and post-primary level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200090#WRAA04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport","counter":1285,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200090#WRAA04400"},{"type":"question","counter":1286,"qnumday":537,"qnumall":"[37118\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200090#WRAA04500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the case of school bus drivers whereby once they reach 70 years of age, they are no longer allowed to be employed under the Bus &Eacute;ireann school bus contract despite having passed a yearly medical assessment permitting them to drive other coaches; if she will review this matter; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1626","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1287,"content":"<p>School Transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department of Education.

Where the introduction of new technology is planned, consultation with members of the school community including parents is advised.  The cost and other implications must be fully considered by the Boards of Management before a decision is made. Schools, in conjunction with parents and the wider school community, retain local autonomy for decisions on the use of digital technologies in the context of their digital learning planning, and how to embed their use to enhance teaching and learning. In making this decision each school should consider all the available information.<\/p>  <p>  The Professional Development Service for Teachers Technology in Education (PDST-TIE) offers advice to schools and have developed an advice sheet, on the adoption of tablets in schools, on it's website which covers areas such as what tablets can offer a school, educational and purchasing considerations, and software.<\/p>  <p>   I am keenly aware of the challenges faced by educators and parents, in relation to costs of digital devices including eBooks, and my Department continues to work to help support schools and families meet these costs. In 2017 a circular letter issued to schools with measures to be adopted to reduce the cost of school uniforms and other costs. This circular also instructed schools to consult with parents and their school community on the issue of ensuring costs are reasonable for parents, and how to avoid costs acting as a barrier. This circular specified that wherever possible, generic rather than branded items should be specified (e.g. uniform, clothing, IT tablets, sports equipment etc.). The issue of costs to parents will also be included in the Guidelines that will issue with the Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill 2018.<\/p>  <p>  My Department currently provides a book grant of over &euro;17.2 million to all recognised primary and post primary schools within the Free Education Scheme in order to provide assistance for books, including book rental schemes  (which can include ebooks), and all schools are encouraged to operate book rental schemes to help alleviate costs to parents.  It is a matter for the board of management of each individual school to decide on its own policy in relation to the use of this funding in the school, but they are expected to adopt a cost-conscious approach to the selection of books for use in their classes.<\/p>  <p>  Additional funding of &euro;1million was provided under Budget 2020 to provide free books in DEIS primary schools on a pilot basis. This funding was allocated to 102 DEIS primary schools for a new pilot programme for the 2020\/21 school year. The aim of this pilot is to provide free school books for students in the schools involved, and to support these schools in eliminating the cost of school books for parents.<\/p>  <p>  Under Circular 46\/2013, DEIS primary schools receive a book grant of &euro;21 per pupil.  This pilot provided an additional &euro;64 per pupil to increase the overall book grant rate to &euro;85 per pupil enrolled in the school. This is in line with the costings as set out in the 2019 Barnardos report on the Real Cost of School which states that &euro;85 is the average cost of school books at primary school. <\/p>  <p>  Funding continued for the 2021\/22 and 2022\/23 school year and the effectiveness and impact of the pilot will be evaluated before any decision is made as regards its possible extension or continuation. <\/p>  <p>  School book rental schemes have an important role to play in reducing the cost of school books for parents.  In order to support the establishment of book rental schemes, my Department provided &euro;15.7 million seed capital in 2014, 2015 and 2016 to primary schools.  Some 96% of primary schools and 68% of post-primary schools currently operate a book rental scheme.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Digital Strategy for Schools to 2027 was published in April 2022 and builds on the achievements of the previous Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020.  It aims to further support the school system so that all students across our schools have the opportunity to gain the knowledge and skills they need to navigate an ever-evolving digital world successfully. The strategy was developed following an extensive consultation process with all relevant stakeholders including students, parents\/guardians, teachers and industry and sets out the various supports and resources available to schools in this important area.<\/p>  <p>  The strategy is underpinned by an overall investment of &euro;200m, &euro;50m of which has already issued directly to schools. In addition, &euro;50m in grant funding was issued to schools in November 2021 as part of Ireland&rsquo;s National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) to address the needs of their learners at risk of educational disadvantage through the digital divide.  Again this builds on the overall investment of &euro;210m under the previous strategy. <\/p>  <p>  Most publishers issue eBooks free of charge with the purchase of their text books, but this is at the publisher&rsquo;s discretion.  Curriculum specifications and prescribed syllabus material are determined by the NCCA and it is the responsibility of each individual school to select the resources, if any, that it will use to support its implementation of the curriculum. The NCCA and the Department does not endorse or recommend particular materials. This includes text books, and it is a matter for each school to consider all relevant issues, including discussing license requirements for eBooks with the publishers.<\/p>  <p>  Scoilnet, the Department funded website, provides open access to the Irish education system to rich appropriate content including Encyclopaedia Britannica, Irish newspaper archives, and other curated sites.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200092#WRCC01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pupil-Teacher Ratio","counter":1369,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200092#WRCC02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1370,"qnumday":565,"qnumall":"[37843\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200092#WRCC02100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the average, median, maximum and minimum primary school class sizes for each council area in the State from 2017 to date in 2022, in tabular form.","asker":"1460","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1371,"content":"<p>Please find attached requested information for Primary Schools for the years 2017-2020 inclusive. <\/p><p>Please note we expect to publish the final enrolment figures for 2021-2022 shortly and we will update the table once the final enrolments data, including class size tables, are published. <\/p><p>The figures are based on mainstream classes in mainstream schools and were collated from the relevant Class Size tables published on the DE website and can be found at the link below;<\/p><p>gov.ie - Class Size Information at Individual Primary School Level (www.gov.ie)  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200092#WRCC02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport","counter":1372,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200092#WRCC02300"},{"type":"question","counter":1373,"qnumday":566,"qnumall":"[37880\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200092#WRCC02400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the current status of the application for the backdating of the remote area grant for persons (details supplied); when a decision will be made; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1619","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1374,"content":"<p>School Transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department of Education.

It is designed to act as a bridge between the two by facilitating the smooth transition from the more dependent learning of the Junior Cycle to the more independent self-directed learning required for the Senior Cycle. All Second-Level schools have the option of offering the Transition Year programme to their students and most do offer it. <\/p>  <p>  The established Leaving Certificate programme is a two-year programme that covers a wide range of subjects. Subjects are normally studied at either Ordinary or Higher Level. Two subjects, Irish and Mathematics, can be studied at Foundation Level. Foundation Level is geared to the needs of students who might have difficulty with those subjects at Ordinary or Higher Level.<\/p>  <p>  The Leaving Certificate Applied is a distinct, self-contained two-year Leaving Certificate programme aimed at preparing students for adult and working life. The programme sets out to recognise the talents of all students and to provide opportunities for developing personal responsibility, self-esteem and self-knowledge. The programme focuses on the talents of each student and helps students apply what they learn to the real world. The two-year programme consists of four half-year blocks called sessions. Achievements are credited in each session.<\/p>  <p>  The Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme (LCVP) is a Leaving Certificate with a strong vocational aspect.  The programme consists of Leaving Certificate subjects, together with three compulsory link modules on enterprise education, preparation for work and work experience. Students must take at least 5 Leaving Certificate subjects, one of which must be Irish and a continental language or vocational language module.<\/p>  <p>  On 29 March I announced an ambitious programme of work for a reimagined Senior Cycle of education where the student is at the centre of their Senior Cycle experience. The three tenets of Senior Cycle redevelopment are to:<\/p>  <p>  -  Empower students to meet the challenges of the 21st century<\/p>  <p>  -  Enrich the student experience and build on what&rsquo;s strong in our current system<\/p>  <p>  -  Embed well-being and reduce student stress levels<\/p>  <p>  The approach to Senior Cycle redevelopment is informed by and builds upon the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment&rsquo;s (NCCA&rsquo;s) Advisory Report on the review of Senior Cycle. The redeveloped Senior Cycle will involve the creation and development of more flexible learning pathways within school.<\/p>  <p>  In a redeveloped Senior Cycle, real opportunities to progress, consolidate and transfer learning should be available for students of Level 1 and Level 2 Learning Programmes, for those who can currently access these programmes at Junior Cycle. In my announcement I stated that a new qualification will be introduced at level one and two on the National Qualification framework to provide an appropriate level of assessment to some students with special educational needs, building on the equivalent programme at Junior Cycle level.<\/p>  <p>  I intend to make these opportunities available as soon as possible. I have requested the NCCA to begin work immediately with schools to work towards developing a Level 1\/Level 2 Learning Programme for those currently in first year. To commence this process, the NCCA has initiated a review of the L1\/L2 Learning Programmes at Junior Cycle and is seeking to learn more from schools about their curriculum provision for students in Senior Cycle who followed L1\/L2 Learning Programmes at Junior Cycle. To support this work, the NCCA recently invited schools to express their interest in participating in the school-based component of the review. Following a selection process, nine schools will participate in the review with school visits taking place when schools reopen in September.<\/p>  <p>  Work has also commenced on the development of a background paper and brief for developing the follow-on programmes. The outcomes from the review will feed into the background paper and help to inform the brief both of which will be discussed by the NCCA Council in Q4 this year. Following Council approval, the paper will be published for public consultation. In preparation for work on the follow-on programmes, NCCA is currently establishing a development group.<\/p>  <p>  The redeveloped Senior Cycle will involve the creation and development of more flexible learning pathways within school. For students commencing fifth year in the coming school year (September 2022), students in schools providing the LCVP will be able to access the Link Modules without the requirement to meet vocational subject grouping criteria set out in Circular Letter 0040\/2013. These groupings will no longer apply for students opting in to the LCVP programme commencing fifth year in the coming school year.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, students will no longer have to meet the modern European language requirements to access the LCVP programme. However, all other requirements for participation in the LCVP as set out in circular 0040\/2013 continue to apply, including the Irish language requirement.<\/p>  <p>  Further guidance for schools and students on the plans for Senior Cycle redevelopment is available at www.gov.ie\/SeniorCycle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200092#WRCC04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":1392,"qnumday":573,"qnumall":"[37966\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200092#WRCC04300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the two-year forecast for special class places that will be required in counties Carlow and Kilkenny; the number of spaces by school that currently exist in the counties; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1449","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1393,"content":"<p>Enabling children with special educational needs to receive an education is a priority for this Government.<\/p><p>In 2022, we will spend over 25% of our total educational budget on providing additional supports for children with SEN.

Work has been underway with stakeholders for a number of years in this area to meet the demand for places. <\/p>  <p>  The NCSE has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents and seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements. <\/p>  <p>  NCSE Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) are liaising with schools and patrons in Dublin 12 to establish new special classes for the 2022\/23 school year and beyond. <\/p>  <p>  If the NCSE has not been able to secure the necessary placements in an area, it can activate a statutory provision contained in Section 37A of the Education Act 1998. Under this provision, and after a period of engagement, the Minister can direct a school to open a special class. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware I recently initiated the Section 37a process for a third time. The NCSE have written to me to advise that they have formed an opinion that there is insufficient special class capacity in primary schools and special school capacity in Dublin The NCSE report to the Minister on the matter, which will consider existing provision, any relevant proposed building works and which schools may be able to provide additional provision is currently being finalised. I am not in a position to elaborate further until this report is finalised.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, my Department is currently progressing emergency legislation through the Houses. The Education (Provision in Respect of Children with Special Educational Needs) Bill 2022 provides for a truncated Section 37A process. It is envisaged that this new process can lead to a Ministerial direction to be served on school within 6 to 8 weeks of receiving a report from the NCSE setting out their opinion that there is insufficient schools places in a certain area. <\/p>  <p>  I look forward to seeing this urgent legislation progressing over the coming weeks, being enacted and being available as another measure to ensure that we can continue to work to forward plan and provide an adequate number of special class and special school places for children. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is committed, in conjunction with the NCSE, to continue to work with parents, schools, patrons and all stakeholders to ensure that there are sufficient appropriate places for students with additional needs and to support all students to achieve their potential.<\/p>  <p>  I want to reassure the Deputy also that my Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200092#WRCC04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1397,"content":"<p>Question No. 575 answered with Question No. 562.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Refurbishment","counter":1398,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200092#WRCC04900"},{"type":"question","counter":1399,"qnumday":576,"qnumall":"[38043\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200092#WRCC05000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if her Department is dealing with a funding application for works at a school (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1493","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1400,"content":"<p>I can confirm to the Deputy, that my Department is in receipt of an application under the Additional School Accommodation (ASA) Scheme, from the school in question. <\/p><p>The application is being assessed by my officials and the school authorities will be contacted directly with a decision when the assessment process has been completed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200092#WRCC05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":1401,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200092#WRCC05200"},{"type":"question","counter":1402,"qnumday":577,"qnumall":"[38051\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200092#WRCC05300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will provide a detailed update on any audits carried out by the National Council for Special Education of all schools in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire area since 2020; the outcome of these audits; the impact that these audits will have on the 2022\/2023 and 2023\/2024 school years; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1480","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1403,"content":"<p>Enabling children with special educational needs to receive an education is a priority for this Government.<\/p><p>This year, my Department will spend in excess of &euro;2 Billion, or over 25% of the Department&rsquo;s budget on providing a wide range of schemes and supports for children with special educational needs.<\/p><p>This includes additional teaching and care supports.<\/p><p>As a result, the number of special education teachers, special needs assistants and special class and school places are at unprecedented levels. <\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide.<\/p><p>I want to reassure you that my Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education.<\/p><p>As Minister for Special Education and Inclusion, I recently announced that the Section 37A process to compel schools to increase SEN provision has been initiated for a third time and that this process is now underway.<\/p><p>The NCSE have written to me to advise that they have formed an opinion that there is insufficient special class capacity in primary schools and special school capacity in Dublin.

The Invalidity Pension is an example, of one such income support.<\/p>  <p>  A person who has an insufficient PRSI contribution record to qualify for a social insurance benefit\/pension may apply for the appropriate means-tested social assistance scheme.

In effect, self-employed contributors, in return for a contribution of 11 percentage points lower than the combined employer and employee contribution of 15.05% made in respect of employed contributors, have access to benefits which comprise over 90% of the value of all benefits available to employed contributors.<\/p>  <p>  Where all qualification criteria are satisfied, Class S PRSI gives access to Adoptive Benefit, Guardian's Payment (Contributory),  Invalidity Pension, Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed), Maternity Benefit, Parent's Benefit, Partial Capacity Benefit (where in receipt of Invalidity Pension), Paternity Benefit, State Pension (Contributory), Treatment Benefit, and Widows, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension.<\/p>  <p>  The benefits to which class S PRSI does not provide access are Carer's Benefit, Health and Safety Benefit, Illness Benefit, and Occupational Injuries Benefits.  <\/p>  <p>  Self-employed people may qualify for long-term payments Disability Allowance or Invalidity Pension if they satisfy all eligibility criteria.<\/p>  <p>  Disability Allowance is a social assistance payment for people with a disability who are aged 16-66 and are resident in the state. Applicants are subject to medical and means assessments.<\/p>  <p>  Invalidity Pension is a social insurance payment for people who cannot work because of a long-term illness or disability. Eligibility is based on PRSI contribution record, this payment is not means-tested. Applicants are, however, subject to a medical assessment. <\/p>  <p>  Although self-employed people are not usually eligible for Illness Benefit, an exception was made in relation to Covid-19 enhanced Illness Benefit, primarily as a public health measure. The purpose of this payment is to encourage people to not go to work due to financial constraint when they should be in isolation.<\/p>  <p>  Apart from these income supports, my Department provides means tested supports under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who are ill but who do not qualify for illness and disability payments. An Additional Needs Payment is also available to people who have expenses that they cannot pay from their weekly income.<\/p>  <p>  My Department keeps its income supports under review in order to make sure they meet their objectives. Any changes to the current system would need to be considered in an overall policy and budgetary context. <\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200093#WRDD02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":1446,"qnumday":591,"qnumall":"[37121\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200093#WRDD02850","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the estimated cost to the Exchequer to establish a cross-education and employment system in keeping with universal design principles with which autistic people and disabled people can register at any stage of their education or career if they have a proof of their disability or if they are considering or in the process of pursuing a diagnosis in order that they can easily carry over supports between different life stages; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1617","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1447,"content":"<p>The development of services and policies to prevent social exclusion and improve employment opportunities for people with disabilities operates through a cross government framework which includes relevant departments, agencies and, importantly, disability sector representatives, under a number of key national strategies and action plans.

My Department also contracts AHEAD (Association for Higher Education Access and Disability) to deliver the Willing Able Mentoring (WAM) and &lsquo;Get Ahead&rsquo; Programmes on its behalf. These programmes provide paid work experience and other supports for graduates with disabilities seeking to enter or re-enter employment.<\/p>  <p>  As part of our commitments under the Pathways to Work Strategy and the Comprehensive Employment Strategy, my Department is shortly to commence an early engagement approach that will see the Intreo service proactively engaging with persons with a disability, to offer support and assistance to help them enter or return to employment.  The process will initially focus on persons aged 18 to 22 and in receipt of Disability Allowance, before being expanded to other age groups and schemes.  <\/p>  <p>  I recognise the additional challenges that some jobseekers with disabilities may experience in securing and maintaining employment, and my Department also contracts for the provision of specialist employment services (EmployAbility) to help address this.  A jobseeker with a disability who is working with their Intreo case officer (or LEAS provider) may be referred to these service providers if it is agreed that they would benefit from the type of services and support provided.  Jobseekers work with a Job Coach who provides both pre-employment and in-employment support and assistance. <\/p>  <p>  There are no directly associated costs in hiring Job Coaches in my Department as these posts are filled from existing, internal staffing resources.

payment at the weekly standard state pension rate of &euro;253.30; and the estimated full-year cost of increasing this payment rate by &euro;1. ","asker":"1604","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1457,"content":"<p>When the State Pension (Transition) existed, it was a scheme which allowed those who were retired to receive a transitionary payment between the ages of 65 and 66 years.  The maximum personal rate was equivalent to the then maximum rate for the State Pension (Contributory).  Eligibility was based on PRSI contributions and credits and payments were calculated based on the Yearly Averaging approach.  PRSI Class S contributions (self-employed) were not reckonable for the State Pension (Transition).<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the conditions and eligibility requirements for State Pension (Transition) were different to and more arduous than those for the State Pension (Contributory).  For example, a person had to have a minimum average of 24 contributions per annum to be eligible for State Pension (Transition) whereas an average of 10 contributions per annum is required for State Pension (Contributory) eligibility.  In addition, recipients of State Pension (Transition) were not eligible for Free Travel, the Household Benefits Package (electricity, gas, TV licence) or Living Alone Allowance.  Furthermore, the State Pension (Transition) scheme had a retirement condition whereas the State Pension (Contributory) did not.<\/p>  <p>  Since the State Pension (Transition) scheme ceased with effect from 1 January 2014, very significant amendments have been made to the State Pension (Contributory) scheme, including the introduction of the interim Total Contributions Approach and the availability of Homecaring Periods.  As a consequence of these changes, applicants for the State Pension (Contributory) are assessed under the Yearly Averaging system and the interim Total Contributions Approach and awarded on the basis of the most beneficial calculation. <\/p>  <p>  While it would be possible to estimate the potential cost of reintroducing the State Pension (Transition) on the exact same legislative basis as it previously existed (which included specific rate-band structures and a yearly average method of payment calculation), it would not be possible to reintroduce it on that basis because of the changes set out above.  Therefore, introducing such a scheme would require significant design changes to the previous State Pension (Transition) to modernise it in line with the Total Contributions Approach method of payment calculation and the availability of Homecaring Periods.  As no such design work has been done, it is not possible to estimate the cost as requested. <\/p>  <p>  In February 2021, I introduced the \"Benefit Payment for 65 year olds\" in line with the Programme for Government commitment, to provide a benefit payment for people who are aged 65 and who are required to retire, or who choose to retire, without a requirement to sign on, engage in activation measures or to be available for and genuinely seeking work.  This new payment was designed specifically to bridge the gap for people who retire from employment or self-employment at 65 years of age but who do not qualify for the State Pension until age 66.<\/p>  <p>  The Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report was published on 7th October 2021 and it contained almost 250 pages of analysis, consideration and recommendations. The report, Technical Sub-Committee's working papers, agendas, minutes, external presentations and submissions in response to an extensive public consultation process are available on the website, pensionscommission.gov.ie.  The Commission&rsquo;s work established that the current State Pension system is not sustainable into the future and that changes are needed.  It has set out a wide range of recommendations, including in respect of the State Pension Age and early access, and aligning retirement ages in employment contracts with the State Pension age. <\/p>  <p>  In the interests both of older people and future generations of older people, the Government is considering the comprehensive and far reaching recommendations in the Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report very carefully and holistically.  My officials are examining each of the recommendations and consulting across Government through the Cabinet Committee system.  The views of the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands and the Commission on Taxation and Welfare are being considered as part of these deliberations.  I intend bringing a recommended response and implementation plan to Government for its consideration when that work is completed.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear from the Commission&rsquo;s work that State Pension reform is necessary and it is complex.  It would be a strategic risk not to plan and provide for projected demographic changes, not least in terms of income adequacy for older people.  The State Pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  It is extremely effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.  This Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case for current pensioners, those nearing State Pension age and today&rsquo;s young workers including those who are only starting their careers.<\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200093#WRDD03475","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits","counter":1458,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200093#WRDD03481"},{"type":"question","counter":1459,"qnumday":596,"qnumall":"[37154\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200093#WRDD03487","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 294 of 19 May 2022, the estimated cost of including the working family payment as a qualifying payment for the fuel allowance for the period 30 September to 31 December 2022, 12 October to 31 December 2022 and from 21 January 2023 and for the fuel allowance season 2023 by period, in tabular form.","asker":"1604","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":1460,"qnumday":640,"qnumall":"[37790\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200093#WRDD03490","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the estimated full year cost of including the working family payment as a qualifying payment for fuel allowance for the period from 30 September 2022, 12 October 2022 and 21 January 2023, in tabular form.

For this reason, this Government did not await a further budget cycle to address these challenges but acted early.  Overall, the tax and spending measures we have introduced to ease the burden and provide support to those most in need have amounted to &euro;2.4 billion.  <\/p><p>The Government continues to monitor the situation carefully in preparation for the Budget later this year.  I will be meeting a range of NGOs at the Department's pre-budget forum next month and will listen carefully to the views expressed.<\/p><p>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, my Department can make additional needs payments to help meet expenses that a person cannot pay from their weekly income.  This is an overarching term used to refer to exceptional and urgent needs payments, and certain supplements to assist with ongoing or recurring costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.<\/p><p>The payment is available to anyone who needs it and qualifies, whether the person is currently receiving a social welfare payment or working on a low income.  <\/p><p>The household income amounts published in relation to additional needs payments are not an eligibility threshold, but are intended as an information guide to assist persons who may find themselves in financial difficulty and require assistance with essential expenses. <\/p><p>Guidelines issued to staff administering the scheme assist them in the decision making process and ensure consistency of service.  However, they do not affect the discretion available to officers in issuing an additional needs payment to assist an individual or household in any particular hardship situation which may arise.<\/p><p>An exceptional needs Payment (ENP) is a single payment to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  An urgent needs payment (UNP) may be made to persons who may not normally qualify for supplementary welfare allowance but who have an urgent need which they cannot meet from their own resources or where an alternative is not available at that time. <\/p><p>Payments are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, taking into account the requirements of the legislation, and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.<\/p><p>The scheme is demand led.  The Government has provided funding of &euro;45.75 million for the provision of exceptional and urgent needs that are provided for as Additional Needs Payment in 2022.  A further provision of &euro;5.3 million has been provided for SWA Supplements in 2022 (excluding rent supplement).<\/p><p>The Department is developing more extensive statistics in relation to the number of applications made to the ENP\/UNP schemes.  The focus of the development has been on current data from January 2022 with details on the number of applications available from this date onward.  Details of applications pre-January 2022 are not available at this time, however it is possible to provide details on the number of payments that were made.<\/p><p>Table 1 shows the number of ENPs\/UNPs awarded for 2021 and to date in 2022 (end of June).<\/p><p>Table 2 shows the number of recipients of Other Supplements on 31 December 2021 and on 30 June 2022.<\/p><p>Table 3 shows the number of ENP\/UNP and Other Supplement applications received\/disallowed to date in 2022 (to end of June).<\/p><p>This represents a snapshot of claim activity taken at 7th July 2022 and is subject to change. It does not include claims that were cancelled or withdrawn.<\/p><p>Any person who considers they may have an entitlement to an additional needs payment is encouraged to contact their local community welfare service.

The objective of the programme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them.  The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement.  <\/p>  <p>  A budget of &euro;68.1 million has been provided for the scheme in 2022.  <\/p>  <p>  In recent years entry to the school meals programme has been confined to DEIS schools in addition to schools identified as having levels of concentrated disadvantage that would benefit from access to the programme.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2022 provided for the hot school meals to be extended from January 2022 to the remaining 81 DEIS schools that had expressed an interest in the programme but which were not yet participating.  As a result, the number of children in receipt of the hot school meal in June 2022 was 54,266.  The full year cost for hot school meals for 54,266 children is &euro;28m.<\/p>  <p>  In March 2022, the Minister for Education announced an extension of the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in School to an additional 273 primary and 37 post-primary schools from September 2022.<\/p>  <p>  I have recently announced that the provision of the hot school meal option will be extended to all new DEIS primary schools and the cold lunch option to all new DEIS secondary schools at a full year cost of &euro;26m and benefitting some 60,000 children.  However, as 31 of these schools are already in receipt of some funding, the additional cost of providing these options is &euro;23.5m in a full year, with the first-year cost from September to December of &euro;9.5m.<\/p>  <p>  There are 444 DEIS schools not receiving the hot school meal.  The full year cost to provide a hot school meal to these 63,260 remaining DEIS children is &euro;33m.  However, as 402 of these schools are already receiving the cold lunch, the additional cost of providing a hot school meal is &euro;20m, with the first-year cost from September to December of &euro;8m.<\/p>  <p>  I am committed to continuing to grow the hot school meals element of the school meals programme for DEIS schools and building further on the significant extension announced.  In this regard, I have commissioned an evaluation of the school meals programme to be undertaken in 2022 to inform future policy decisions on the scheme. <\/p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the position for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200095#WRFF04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1600,"content":"<p>Question No. 645 answered with Question No. 644.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1601,"content":"<p>Question No. 646 answered with Question No. 644.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1602,"content":"<p>Question No. 647 answered with Question No. 644.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1603,"content":"<p>Question No. 648 answered with Question No. 644.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits","counter":1604,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200095#WRFF05600"},{"type":"question","counter":1605,"qnumday":649,"qnumall":"[37937\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200095#WRFF05700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"when an application for the supplementary welfare allowance will be processed for a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1606,"content":"<p>A basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) is a weekly allowance paid to people who do not have enough income to meet their needs and those of their families.

I will also be requesting that my officials meet with the corresponding organisation to discuss the matters further.<\/p>  <p>  The review which the correspondent references noted the considerable success of the NCS in reaching those most in need. As the correspondent notes the review also reflects certain concerns particularly that it may present challenges for some families and for some providers serving disadvantaged communities.<\/p>  <p>  It is however quite incorrect to say that \"in November 2019 the targeted funding for disadvantage was closed to children\". The NCS is designed to be highly inclusive and to meet the needs of those families who need it the most. The NCS is based on the principle of progressive universalism and has regard to the best interests of children.<\/p>  <p>  The subsidies on the older schemes were grounded in medical card and social protection entitlements.  It is a central policy component of the NCS to poverty proof and assist people in exiting the poverty traps, some of which were associated with the older ELC\/SAC schemes. Both the older schemes and the NCS contained universal and targeted elements. As a point of fact the proportion of families on the targeted schemes vs universal on NCS is more favourable than on the older schemes.<\/p>  <p>  By making this fundamental shift away from the legacy schemes where subsidies are grounded in medical card and social protection entitlements, and by tangibly reducing the cost of quality childcare for thousands of families, the NCS aims to improve children&rsquo;s outcomes, improve labour market participation and reduce child poverty. It is a central policy component of the NCS to poverty proof. It also designed to assist people in exiting the poverty trap, elements of which were inherent in the legacy schemes.<\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to consult extensively with stakeholders on the development of NCS, through the Partnership for the Public Good report and the 12 month review of the NCS. The reviews noted the considerable success of the NCS in reaching those most in need. However, the report also highlights the same issues raised in the correspondence, particularly that it may present challenges for some families and for some providers serving disadvantaged communities. Findings which I have already begun to act on in Budget 2022, specifically:<\/p>  <p>  -  An extension to the NCS universal subsidy to all children under 15 from September 2022, benefitting up to 40,000 children.<\/p>  <p>  -  An end to the practice of deducting hours spent in pre-school or school from the entitlement to NCS subsidised hours from spring 2022, benefitting an estimated 5,000 children from low income families.<\/p>  <p>  Core Funding will contribute to services&rsquo; sustainability and will significantly increase income for the overwhelming majority of services and provide greater funding stability. A number of safeguards have been put in place to ensure no unintended outcomes of Core Funding including a funding guarantee and a Sustainability Fund which is open to services.<\/p>  <p>  Core Funding will give providers a stable income source based on the nature of the service they deliver. A provider&rsquo;s income will now consist of Core Funding, NCS and ECCE subsidies, and parental fees. Structuring Core Funding primarily based on capacity means that services will have an allocation each year that will not fluctuate in line with children&rsquo;s attendance. <\/p>  <p>  Once Core Funding is embedded and changes to existing programmes take effect (ECCE and NCS), my Department will progress the development of the Tackling Disadvantage funding and support. Informed by recommendations in Partnership for the Public Good, services will be provided with a proportionate mix of universal and targeted supports to support children and families accessing their services who are experiencing disadvantage. <\/p>  <p>  This Government agreed on 31 May to the publication of the National Action Plan and for its submission to the EU Commission. The publication of the Plan is an important first step in the implementation of the EU Child Guarantee which clearly intersects with the Tackling Disadvantage response. Identifying the most appropriate and effective structures to pursue the reforms necessary to improve outcomes for our most disadvantaged children and young people will be a particular focus of our work in the coming months, in order to progress matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200096#WRHH01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ukraine War","counter":1636,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200096#WRHH01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1637,"qnumday":660,"qnumall":"[37101\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200096#WRHH01500","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the name and details of each premises being used to accommodate Ukrainian refugees; the number of refugees in each premises; the rate of payment for refugees per night given to the premises in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1461","askee":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":1638,"qnumday":661,"qnumall":"[37103\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200096#WRHH01600","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the full amount of monies paid out per county to accommodate Ukrainian refugees to date in 2022; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1461","askee":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":1639,"qnumday":662,"qnumall":"[37104\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200096#WRHH01700","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the details of the process used by his Department to select suitable accommodation for Ukrainian refugees; the standards which must be met; if all current accommodation that is being used meets these standards; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1461","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1640,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 660 to 662, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>My Department is currently collating the information requested and a reply will issue directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200096#WRHH01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1641,"content":"<p>Question No. 661 answered with Question No. 660.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1642,"content":"<p>Question No. 662 answered with Question No. 660.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Childhood Care and Education","counter":1643,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200096#WRHH02100"},{"type":"question","counter":1644,"qnumday":663,"qnumall":"[37130\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200096#WRHH02200","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"if he will advise on matters raised in correspondence (details supplied) in relation to the early childhood care and education scheme rules which are disadvantageous; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1598","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1645,"content":"<p>When first introduced, the ECCE programme was delivered over 38 weeks in a given ECCE programme year and children were required to be between the ages of 3 years and 2 months and 4 years and 7 months in September in the year they enrolled.<\/p>  <p>  ECCE now provides for 72 weeks over two years.

Its goal is to empower pre-school providers to deliver an inclusive pre-school experience, ensuring that every eligible child can meaningfully participate in the ECCE Programme and reap the benefits of high quality early learning and care. Eligibility for AIM supports is linked to participation in the universal ECCE pre-school programme.<\/p>  <p>  AIM supports are grouped into universal or targeted. Universal supports are designed to create a more inclusive culture in early learning and care settings, through training courses and qualifications for staff. Where universal supports are not enough to meet the needs of an individual child, targeted supports are available to ensure the child can meaningfully participate in pre-school.<\/p>  <p>  AIM Early Years Specialists are available to work with parents and pre-school providers to develop an inclusive learning environment for children. Applying for AIM educational advice and mentoring is very simple.  Parents are advised to speak with their pre-school provider who will make an application for targeted supports in collaboration with the parent. The pre-school will submit this application to Better Start through the Early Years Hive portal on the parent&rsquo;s behalf.<\/p>  <p>  AIM level 6 provides a range of services in collaboration with the HSE under therapeutic supports. Targeted services are individualised and could include; behaviour support plans, classes, equipment, professional advice or pre-school visits. Supports may be provided through a Children&rsquo;s Disability Network Team (CDNT), HSE Disability Service, HSE funded Voluntary Organisation or HSE Primary Care Services.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE offer speech and language therapy services, in the public health service, free of charge for children with a disability. Speech and language therapists (SLTs) will show parents ways to support their child&rsquo;s communication or feeding skills. They assess the child&rsquo;s needs, set short and long-term goals and link with other relevant services. For information on services in your area you can contact your Local Health Office. See list of Local Health Offices at the link below.<\/p>  <p>  www.hse.ie\/eng\/services\/list\/1\/lho\/.<\/p>  <p>  If a parent in partnership with the provider, submit an application for AIM support and in that application have stated that the child is already receiving supports from speech and language, the Early Years Specialist would link in with the relevant health professional. They would do this to identify what strategies\/supports can be implemented in the pre-school setting by the educators.<\/p>  <p>  AIM Level 7 support provides additional funding to pre-schools who have a child requiring extra support. Providers can use this funding either to reduce the adult-to-child ration in the pre-school room or to fund an extra staff member as a shared resource with other children in the ECCE setting. This is all centred on supporting the pre-school leader to ensure the child&rsquo;s optimal participation.<\/p>  <p>  One of the commitments in First 5 was to undertake an end of Three-Year Evaluation of AIM. The evaluation is now complete and the final report is due to be published in Quarter 3 of this year. Subject to evaluation findings and other relevant developments, we will be considering enhancements to, and\/or extension of, AIM to, for example, all ELC services, all school-age childcare services and to children with additional needs other than a disability. This will include consideration of issues raised with regard to children with ASD and potential measures to enhance provision.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Education also provides specialist pre-school services including autism-specific pre-school services for children who are ECCE eligible, which include:<\/p>  <p>  -  Early Intervention Classes attached to primary schools for autistic children aged three and over.<\/p>  <p>  -  A Home Tuition Scheme which provides funding towards 10 hours per week tuition for children under 3 years of age and 20 hours per week for children over 3 years of age who cannot secure a placement in an early intervention class.

I will also be requesting that my officials meet with the corresponding organisation to discuss the matters further.<\/p>  <p>  The review which the correspondent references noted the considerable success of the NCS in reaching those most in need. As the correspondent notes the review also reflects certain concerns particularly that it may present challenges for some families and for some providers serving disadvantaged communities.<\/p>  <p>  It is however quite incorrect to say that \"in November 2019 the targeted funding for disadvantage was closed to children\". The NCS is designed to be highly inclusive and to meet the needs of those families who need it the most. The NCS is based on the principle of progressive universalism and has regard to the best interests of children.<\/p>  <p>  The subsidies on the older schemes were grounded in medical card and social protection entitlements.  It is a central policy component of the NCS to poverty proof and assist people in exiting the poverty traps, some of which were associated with the older ELC\/SAC schemes. Both the older schemes and the NCS contained universal and targeted elements. As a point of fact the proportion of families on the targeted schemes vs universal on NCS is more favourable than on the older schemes.<\/p>  <p>  By making this fundamental shift away from the legacy schemes where subsidies are grounded in medical card and social protection entitlements, and by tangibly reducing the cost of quality childcare for thousands of families, the NCS aims to improve children&rsquo;s outcomes, improve labour market participation and reduce child poverty. It is a central policy component of the NCS to poverty proof. It also designed to assist people in exiting the poverty trap, elements of which were inherent in the legacy schemes.<\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to consult extensively with stakeholders on the development of NCS, through the Partnership for the Public Good report and the 12 month review of the NCS. The reviews noted the considerable success of the NCS in reaching those most in need. However, the report also highlights the same issues raised in the correspondence, particularly that it may present challenges for some families and for some providers serving disadvantaged communities. Findings which I have already begun to act on in Budget 2022, specifically:<\/p>  <p>  -  An extension to the NCS universal subsidy to all children under 15 from September 2022, benefitting up to 40,000 children.<\/p>  <p>  -  An end to the practice of deducting hours spent in pre-school or school from the entitlement to NCS subsidised hours from spring 2022, benefitting an estimated 5,000 children from low income families.<\/p>  <p>  Core Funding will contribute to services&rsquo; sustainability and will significantly increase income for the overwhelming majority of services and provide greater funding stability. A number of safeguards have been put in place to ensure no unintended outcomes of Core Funding including a funding guarantee and a Sustainability Fund which is open to services.<\/p>  <p>  Core Funding will give providers a stable income source based on the nature of the service they deliver. A provider&rsquo;s income will now consist of Core Funding, NCS and ECCE subsidies, and parental fees. Structuring Core Funding primarily based on capacity means that services will have an allocation each year that will not fluctuate in line with children&rsquo;s attendance. <\/p>  <p>  Once Core Funding is embedded and changes to existing programmes take effect (ECCE and NCS), my Department will progress the development of the Tackling Disadvantage funding and support. Informed by recommendations in Partnership for the Public Good, services will be provided with a proportionate mix of universal and targeted supports to support children and families accessing their services who are experiencing disadvantage. <\/p>  <p>  This Government agreed on 31 May to the publication of the National Action Plan and for its submission to the EU Commission. The publication of the Plan is an important first step in the implementation of the EU Child Guarantee which clearly intersects with the Tackling Disadvantage response.

In recent decades our universities, institutes of technology, and colleges have been transformed, from predominantly national institutions catering primarily for school-leavers, to internationally oriented institutions engaged with an increasingly diverse student body, of all ages, backgrounds and gender identities. It is therefore key, for the further development and internationalisation of the sector, that we stamp out all forms of racism within our HEIs and take a proactive approach to encouraging further diversity and inclusion in the higher education sector.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, the HEA conducted a National Race Equality Survey of all HEIs last year which was published in October 2021. The aim of the survey was to capture the lived experience of HEI staff in relation to race equality. For the purpose of the survey, race equality was defined as &lsquo;equal representation, equal experiences and equal outcomes of staff from minority ethnic groups.&rsquo;<\/p>  <p>  The survey was conducted in late 2020\/early 2021 and all staff working in HEIs in the Republic of Ireland &ndash; regardless of ethnic background or nationality &ndash; were invited to participate. A total of 3,323 staff, approximately 10% of the total number of HEI staff nationally, in Irish HEIs responded to the survey.<\/p>  <p>  The recommendations made in the report were across eight thematic areas: supporting diversity in staff; supporting diversity in student recruitment; making race\/equality policies transparent; reporting mechanisms; awareness and training; fostering diversity in HEIs; leadership; and data collection. The survey findings provide an evidence base which will facilitate a more proactive policy response to issues of racism in our HEIs. <\/p>  <p>  Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) have comprehensive policies to tackle harassment on campuses and reporting mechanisms for the same. These policies and procedures also cover incidents of racist discrimination and harassment. <\/p>  <p>  Last year, the Irish Universities Association introduced an online training programme called &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s Talk About Race in the Higher Education Sector&rsquo;. This course, which is available to both staff and students, is a key initiative in building the intercultural understanding and competence required to achieve systemic change within our HEIs. This training programme complements the existing race awareness and education activities of the universities, as well as other specific initiatives, such as curriculum reviews, Universities of Sanctuary initiatives, and intercultural events alongside new mechanisms for building cultures of dignity and respect which build a sense of inclusion for all members of university communities.<\/p>  <p>  Funding has also been provided to develop the anonymous Speak Out reporting tool through which students can anonymously report incidents of harassment, including racist harassment. The online platform directs users towards support services and formal reporting processes.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is also engaging with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and the Anti-Racism Committee; to develop tertiary education actions for the new National Action Plan Against Racism which my colleague Minister O&rsquo;Gorman will be publishing shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200098#WRKK01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Grant Payments","counter":1756,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200098#WRKK01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1757,"qnumday":701,"qnumall":"[37251\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200098#WRKK01800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he has given any consideration to relaxing the residency requirements of being in the State, European Union, United Kingdom or Switzerland for three of the past five years for Irish citizens applying for a SUSI grant, given the international travel restrictions caused by Covid-19; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1515","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1758,"content":"<p>Under the terms of the student grant scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.<\/p><p>With regard to the residency criterion, in order to be eligible for a grant, a &quot;student&quot;, as defined in Section 14 of the Student Support Act 2011, must demonstrate that he\/she has been resident in the State for at least three years out of the five year period ending on the day before the start of his\/her approved course of study.

The further development and mainstreaming of apprenticeship in Ireland through the creation of a single unified apprenticeship system has a key role to play in meeting Ireland's skill needs in a manner that presents a valued proposition for apprentices and employers alike. Despite the challenges of Covid, significant progress has been made to date;<\/p><p>-  The new employer grant of &euro;2,000 will encourage more employers to engage with a wider range of apprenticeships and help to encourage the development of new programmes. It also means that, for the first time, all employers will receive a level of support towards the cost of apprentice training.<\/p><p>-  The existing bursary for employers of female craft apprentices has been extended to all apprenticeships with over 80% representation of a single gender,<\/p><p>-  Two new governance structures have been put in place: the National Apprenticeship Office (NAO) will deliver practical supports and information for employers and apprentices seeking to engage with apprenticeship. The National Apprenticeship Alliance (NAA) brings together a wealth of knowledge and first-hand, practical experience from the worlds of education providers, learners, industry partners and trade unions, to help steer the evolution of the system.<\/p><p>-  Over 100 civil and public service organisations have recently been surveyed for their views on apprenticeship and their skills needs. These insights will form the basis of the Public Service Apprenticeship Recruitment Plan, which is currently under development.<\/p><p>-  With visits to apprenticeship.ie directly from CAO\/options page up to over 32,000 since November 2021, the inclusion of information on apprenticeship as part of the CAO website is expected to make a significant contribution to highlighting the range of learning and qualification options for school leavers, providing learning options both for students who learn by doing as well as vocational and academic routes to a qualification.<\/p><p>-  Information sessions and briefings were completed with guidance counsellors and others as part of the CAO initiative October-November 2021. A next phase of promotion is planned with guidance counsellors in 2022 and has been added to the Generation Apprenticeship campaigns.<\/p><p>-  Eight new apprenticeship programmes were launched over 2020 and 2021, despite the pandemic; Arboriculture, Equipment Systems Engineer, Healthcare Assistant, Principal Engineer &ndash; Professional Doctorate, Recruitment Executive, Sales, Scaffolding , Supply Chain Associate. In 2022 more were added - Bar Manager, Wind Turbine Maintenance, and Transport Operations &amp;amp; Commercial Driving. Programme development has been approved for progression in areas such as farming, horticulture, finance, manufacturing, construction, cybersecurity and ICT, and a number of others at the initial proposal stage.<\/p><p>The increased diversity of new apprenticeships, many of which have off-the-job training delivered through online or blended learning provides a significant opportunity for widening of access to apprenticeship for rural businesses and learners. In addition, Education and Training Boards, Institutes of Technology and Technological Universities are spread throughout the country and play a very important role in ensuring apprenticeship provision has a strong regional dimension.<\/p><p>Teagasc received approval from the Apprenticeship Council (now the National Apprenticeship Alliance) to develop 5 apprenticeships; Farm Technician (Level 6), Farm Manager (Level 7), Sportsturf Management (Level 6), Horticulture (Level 6) and Stud Farm Assistant Management (Level 7). <\/p><p>Current legislation in relation to apprenticeship (The Industrial Training Act, 1967 as amended) prohibits statutory apprenticeships in an area of agriculture, horticulture or fishing, which is an activity of primary production, which impacts the Farm Technician, Farm Manager and Horticulture programmes. An amendment to the Act is due to be progressed alongside the Higher Education Authority Bill 2022. <\/p><p>Development work on the 5 apprenticeship programmes is ongoing and programme documentation will be submitted to QQI shortly to commence the validation process. Pending approval by QQI and the removal of the legislative restriction on areas of primary production it is aimed to have these apprenticeships launched by year end. Further details of the programmes, including locations where the training will be provided, will be available once the validation and legislative processes are finalised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200098#WRKK06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Justice and Equality","counter":1802,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200099#WRLL00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residency Permits","counter":1801,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200099#WRLL00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1802,"qnumday":716,"qnumall":"[36972\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200099#WRLL00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if support will be provided for a person (details supplied) to obtain their Irish residence permit given the circumstances; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1480","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1803,"content":"<p>The application from the person referred to by the Deputy was returned requesting further information.

It is an ambitious five-year programme of reform to achieve a society which does not accept DSGBV or the attitudes which underpin it.<\/p>  <p>  Reflecting the Government&rsquo;s commitment to make this the most ambitious Strategy to date, and in particular to make a real impact on the provision of refuge units and other associated support services, will require additional expenditure. <\/p>  <p>  The overall cost of implementing the entire Strategy is estimated to be in the region of &euro;363m.<\/p>  <p>  I plan to deliver 141 new units of refuge accommodation on a phased basis at a capital cost estimated at &euro;70.5m and running costs of &euro;33m over the lifetime of the strategy.<\/p>  <p>  Other additional running and development costs (e.g. project management and capacity building supports, current costs for provision of step down facilities and safe homes) are estimated to cost some &euro;10m over the five-year life time of the Strategy.<\/p>  <p>  These figures are in addition to Tusla&rsquo;s 2022 current funding allocation of &euro;30m per annum for refuges, rape crisis centres and associated helpline services.  This equates to &euro;150m over the lifetime of the Strategy.  <\/p>  <p>  The Strategy will provide enhanced support for victims within trial and other criminal justice processes, victim awareness and trauma-informed training for front-line and other staff and legal professionals, legal aid for victims, national awareness campaigns and other communications campaigns, and an expansion of existing perpetrator programmes to create a national programme of interventions for men who have been violent.

No. 230 of 2018), the labour market access permission issued by my Department has had a very positive impact for international protection applicants and employers alike. Over 8,000 permissions have been granted to date. <\/p>  <p>  This permission gives eligible applicants the opportunity to work and helps them to integrate into Irish society while providing for themselves and their families outside of the State&rsquo;s directly provided services and supports. It also helps people to plan and prepare for their future in Ireland if they receive a positive decision on their application for international protection.<\/p>  <p>  The Regulations provide access to both employment and self-employment for any applicant who has not received a first instance decision within six months of making their international protection application, provided that this situation cannot be attributed, or attributed in part, to the applicant. <\/p>  <p>  Labour market access permission is valid for 12 months from the date of issue and may be renewed until a final decision is made on the person's international protection application. The LMA8 Information booklet provides a summary of the Labour Market Access process for employers. The Labour Market Access Unit of my Department recommends that employers familiarise themselves with the terms and conditions of the permission before employing permission holders. The booklet can be accessed on my Department's immigration website at the following link: www.irishimmigration.ie\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/form-LMA8.pdf.<\/p>  <p>  An applicant&rsquo;s legal permission to temporarily reside in the State is provided for under the International Protection Act 2015. People  who make an application under the Act are given a temporary residence card (TRC or blue card) which is proof of their permission to reside in the State. The TRC can be renewed and only becomes invalid when a person's permission to enter and reside in the State (Ireland) as a protection applicant, ceases to be valid. <\/p>  <p>  There are no plans by my Department to make any changes regarding the legal basis for an applicant&rsquo;s permission to reside in the State under the International Protection Act 2015. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that where the Ministerial Decisions Unit of my Department grants an international protection status or a grant of permission to remain to an applicant they are then entitled to immediately register an immigration permission on a Stamp 4 basis which allows a person to seek employment without the requirement to hold an employment permit and is renewable. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, I can confirm for the Deputy that my Department is currently conducting a qualitative study of the experiences of international protection applicants in accessing the labour market, which is due to be completed by Q3 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200099#WRLL03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Protection","counter":1833,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200099#WRLL03400"},{"type":"question","counter":1834,"qnumday":727,"qnumall":"[37253\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200099#WRLL03500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of decisions issued by the International Protection Office in the past 12 months under headings (details supplied) in tabular form.","asker":"1570","askee":"1502"},{"type":"question","counter":1835,"qnumday":728,"qnumall":"[37254\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200099#WRLL03600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of affirmed decisions by the International Protection Appeals Tribunal; and the number of recommendations that have been set aside in the past 12 months.","asker":"1570","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1836,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 727 and 728 together.<\/p><p>For those who are in the international protection process, our objective is to have decisions made on their applications, including the permission to remain consideration, as soon as possible.

The Service&rsquo;s implementing bodies are the Citizens Information Board (which includes the Money Advice and Budgeting Service), the Insolvency Service of Ireland, the Legal Aid Board and the Courts Service.<\/p><p>The goal of Abhaile is to meet the Government&rsquo;s commitment to keeping people in their own homes.

Legal aid includes the services of a solicitor from the Legal Aid Board&rsquo;s Abhaile Solicitors Panel and payment to the personal insolvency practitioner in respect of expenses that occur in making the section 115A application. Prior to 1 March 2019, the services of Junior Counsel were funded in all s115A applications.

The division currently receives almost 1200 applications per month.<\/p>  <p>  For a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the combined impact of the 2019 High Court judgment in the Jones case and the necessary health restrictions arising from the pandemic, has unfortunately resulted in the processing time for standard applications increasing. The processing time for applications in 2021 was 24 months. It currently stands at 19 months for decisions issued in 2022, an almost 21% decrease.<\/p>  <p>  Last year, my Department made 11,512 citizenship decisions, which is the highest level since 2015. For the first six months of 2022, 8149 citizenship decisions have been made with 7,193 certificates of naturalisation issued. This includes 1,005 minor applications who have also been issued with a decision on their application, in comparison to 868 in total for minors during 2021. <\/p>  <p>  The citizenship application process is reviewed on an ongoing basis to continually improve customer service quality. Feedback from applicants is taken on board and, as a result, a much more simplified, customer-focused and streamlined mechanism for applicants to provide their proofs of residence has recently been introduced. A scorecard was introduced to help applicants to complete their applications with greater certainty than before. A review of this is currently being undertaken and an updated version is due to be published in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  To further speed up the processing of applications, a number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times.<\/p>  <p>  Since the beginning of this year, new applicants for citizenship no longer have to submit their original passport with their application. Instead, they can provide a full colour copy of their entire passport, including the front and back covers. This change in practice is welcomed by our customers and is also freeing up valuable staff time that up to now has been engaged in returning passports to applicants.<\/p>  <p>  My Department hosted the first in-person citizenship ceremony since the pandemic on 20 June 2022 with 950 people receiving their certificate of naturalisation.

This is a process which requires getting to know the child and their needs (if not already known), preparing the family to create the IFSP and the development of the document along with the development of the supports to address the identified goals which include universal, targeted, and individual supports. Each IFSP is estimated to take up to 12 clinical hours across 2-3 staff to develop over a period of 6 weeks. This does not include the supports delivered after the IFSP to meet the goals and priorities identified. <\/p><p>  There are currently 810 children who are registered with Network 12.

There are a multitude of reasons why a medicine may not be available including: shortages of raw materials; manufacturing difficulties; or product recalls due to potential quality issues.<\/p>  <p>  Medicine shortages can therefore originate at any point in the supply chain and can involve and impact on many different stakeholders. Accordingly, medicine shortages require a multi-faceted, multi-stakeholder response to ensure patient safety, continuity of care and protection of public health. Ireland has a multi-stakeholder medicine shortage framework in place, coordinated by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), to prevent, wherever possible, and manage medicine shortages when they occur.<\/p>  <p>  Department officials engaged the HPRA who contacted the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAG) of Concerta, along with the wholesalers, after receiving queries from a patient's carer regarding supply challenges as well as some direct representation from TDs. The MAH stated that although there are global constraints on Concerta products, there was no stock-out for the products in Ireland. However, some logistical and operational issues resulted in a delay in some wholesalers receiving their allocation for July. This has since been rectified and HPRA understands that the situation has been resolved. Additionally, the MAH has put in place measures to ensure that a situation like this does not reoccur, including an emergency mechanism where a pharmacist or wholesaler can request additional stock to meet patient needs.<\/p>  <p>  In many instances a shortage of a particular medicine is effectively addressed to ensure continuity of care for a patient including through the substitution for a generic version (in the case of a branded medicine short supply) or a generic version from a different manufacturer (in the case of a generic medicine in short supply). Under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 medicines which are deemed to be interchangeable can be directly substituted for one another by a pharmacist.<\/p>  <p>  Where an interchangeable product is not available in Ireland, a pharmacist, in consultation with the prescriber, can source a medicine containing the same active ingredient in order to ensure that continuity of patient care is maintained, wherever possible. Such medicines may be sourced in another European Member State, or by a specialist wholesaler in a third country, and are known as exempt medicinal products (EMPs). EMPs have not been granted a marketing authorisation in Ireland by the HPRA but are sourced in response to a bona fide unsolicited order in order to fulfil the special needs of a patient. These medicines will however have undergone an evaluation of their safety, quality, and efficacy for the granting of their marketing authorisation in another EU Member State or third country by the respective competent authority for medicines.<\/p>  <p>  In other instances, where a medicine shortage occurs due to a more global issue affecting multiple countries, a patient may be directed to return to their clinician to consider prescribing an alternative medicine for the treatment of their condition.<\/p>  <p>  Patients or their carers who have any concerns in relation to temporary alternative products provided because of medicine shortages are advised to speak with their pharmacist or other healthcare professional involved in their care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200103#WRPP00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff","counter":2038,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200103#WRPP01000"},{"type":"question","counter":2039,"qnumday":795,"qnumall":"[37072\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200103#WRPP01100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the date by when a senior podiatrist will take-up position in University Hospital Kerry;

The National Dementia Strategy, published in 2014, sets out a framework for the development of dementia supports and services in Ireland.

In addition, funding was secured in 2021 for the provision of Day Care at Home Services to provide a day care at home experience for people when they cannot attend their local day centre. This service was developed in response to COVID-19 and will continue in 2022 as day centres begin to reopen on a phased basis in-line with public health measures. <\/p>  <p>  The focus of new service developments in relation to dementia is to enhance assessment ensuring access to a timely diagnosis and in the development of post-diagnostic support and appropriate care.

This will help ensure that we are in a better, stronger position if another pandemic or another similar type emergency arrives. Consideration is being given as to what the best model for this evaluation will be.<\/p>  <p>  Since the start of the pandemic there has been significant and ongoing consideration of the impact of COVID-19 and the evolution of the response to it, as evidence and knowledge emerged and as national and international understanding of the virus evolved. Throughout, this has included a specific and sustained focus on older persons, and in particular, those resident in nursing homes. Various examinations and development of reports with a focus on COVID-19, its impact on nursing homes and the pandemic learnings that can inform future policy, regulation and the model of care for older persons have been undertaken.<\/p>  <p>  In particular, the independent COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel was established in May 2020, on foot of a NPHET recommendation, to examine the complex issues surrounding the management of COVID-19 among this particularly vulnerable cohort in nursing homes and to provide real-time learnings and recommendations to inform the ongoing approach to the management and mitigation of risk to older persons resident in nursing homes as the pandemic evolved. This report outlines the key protective measures that we must ensure are in place across our nursing homes, based on learning from our own and the international experience of COVID-19.<\/p>  <p>  Work to progress the recommendations of the Expert Panel report, particularly those recommendations requiring a priority focus in the response to COVID-19, is ongoing across all of the health agencies and stakeholders. Four Expert Panel Progress Reports have been published to date, the latest published on 21 June 2022, and all Progress Reports are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200106#WRSS05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2258,"qnumday":871,"qnumall":"[37403\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200106#WRSS05400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he is committed to an inquiry into the State's handling of Covid-19; the form that such an inquiry will take; the timeframe for such an inquiry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2259,"content":"<p>The Deputy is advised that since March 2020, Government has focussed its response to COVID-19 around controlling the spread of the virus and breaking the chains of transmission and protecting those who are most vulnerable from infection.<\/p>  <p>  Government has previously acknowledged the importance of reviewing the response to the pandemic.

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Omicron variants.<\/p><p>The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.<\/p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system. <\/p><p>The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, which was launched on the 25th of February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists.<\/p><p>The plan builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly.<\/p><p>This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.<\/p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list programme, which is currently under development in the Department of Health.

However, there can be a lag between funding approval and the actual delivery of home support hours.  Certain geographical areas that are experiencing increased pressures due to staff availability are particularly affected.<\/p><p>At the end of May provisional information shows that there were 4,720 people assessed and approved for Home Support but were awaiting a carer to be assigned.

This important research report explores the experiences and preferences of older adults on ageing in place in rural Ireland and makes a number of recommendations to Government.<\/p>  <p>  Across Government, we will continue to prioritise the needs and preferences of older people, including those living in rural Ireland. The Programme for Government 2020 commits to the vision of creating an Age Friendly Ireland and highlights the imperative to plan judiciously to meet the needs of our ageing population. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health&rsquo;s strategic goal is to support older people to remain living independently in their own homes and communities for as long as possible, in line with the Sl&aacute;intecare vision for receiving the right care in the right place and at the right time.  To this end, &euro;195 million was allocated in Budget 2022 to enable the continued delivery of the Enhanced Community Care Programme. <\/p>  <p>  The objective of the Enhanced Community Care Programme is to reorient healthcare provision towards general practice, primary care, and community-based services, creating end-to-end care pathways that will prevent referrals and admissions to acute hospitals and will enable a &ldquo;home first&rdquo; approach.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health and the HSE also support a number of complimentary Support-Coordination models which help our older population to age in place and reduce the rate of older people transferring to long-term residential care. The Healthy Age Friendly Homes Programme is an innovative partnership between Age Friendly Ireland and Sl&aacute;intecare. The programme commenced at the beginning of 2021 and saw the introduction of a new person-centric, robust, support co-ordination service that will enable older people to continue living in their homes with a sense of independence and autonomy.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE, in conjunction with ALONE, is also continuing the roll out of a Support Co-ordination Service that will support older people to live independently at home for as long as possible, by facilitating access to services including befriending, social prescribing, assistive technologies, and by coordinating linkages to local community groups. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health is committed to delivering the vision of the 2019 policy statement on 'Housing Options for Our Ageing Population', jointly published with the Department of Housing, Local Government &amp;amp; Heritage. The central aim of the policy statement is to increase the housing options available to older people and to facilitate the integration of supports in a more coherent way, particularly between the housing and health sectors, with a view to facilitating people to live at home with dignity and independence for longer.  <\/p>  <p>  The final report of the group, published in June, details the significant progress that has been made to date and the plans for taking the strategic goals of the policy statement onwards. The remaining actions will be taken forward within the framework of Housing for All which aims to increase housing options for older people to facilitate ageing in place, in their own homes and communities, with dignity and independence, and deliver an appropriate range of housing and related support services, in an integrated and sustainable manner. The Department of Health will continue to work with the Department of Housing, Local Government &amp;amp; Heritage, as well as all relevant stakeholders, to increase the housing options available to our older population. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to establishing a new statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-support services. It is intended that this new scheme will provide equitable and transparent access to high-quality, regulated home care services based on a person&rsquo;s assessed care-needs. The Government allocated &euro;150 million of additional funding in 2021 to provide for 5 million more hours of home support.

The<b><\/b>fifth priority is to reinforce the health-led, rather than criminal justice-led, approach to people who use of drugs and who commit drug-related crimes. The main focus will be on the rollout of the government health diversion programme for people in possession of drugs for personal use, which will offer compassion not punishment. Other initiatives, such as the drug treatment courts, will also be supported. A particular emphasis will be on the exchange of best practice on alternatives to coercive sanctions with EU member states.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200111#WRXX03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1608"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2532,"content":"<p>Question No. 968 answered with Question No. 181.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff","counter":2533,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200111#WRXX03500"},{"type":"question","counter":2534,"qnumday":969,"qnumall":"[37796\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200111#WRXX03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the action that will be taken by his Department and the HSE in respect of the employment of 20 additional clinical nurse specialists to assist those waiting for a neurology outpatient appointment as advocated by Neurological Alliance of Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1523","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2535,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200111#WRXX03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":2536,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200111#WRXX03800"},{"type":"question","counter":2537,"qnumday":970,"qnumall":"[37797\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200111#WRXX03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if additional funding will be provided to support eye care services in Cork, particularly to ensure that there is greater capacity for services in Cork to assist those with serious conditions such as glaucoma to have more regular care; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1523","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2538,"content":"<p>The HSE Primary Care Eye Services Review Group (PCESRG) Report was launched in June 2017.

There are approximately 8,000 known rare diseases; 80% of rare diseases are of genetic origin and are often chronic and life-threatening.  Up to 1 person in 12 in Ireland may have a rare disease at some stage in their life.  Approximately 300,000 persons in Ireland are living with a rare disease.<\/p><p>Many of the recommendations of the <i>National Rare Disease Plan for Ireland (2014 &ndash; 2018)<\/i>have already been implemented including the establishment of a National Rare Disease Office (NRDO) and HSE National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases which has now been  operationalised and incorporated into the NRDO which is the main contact point and driver for National HSE rare disease projects and initiatives.<\/p><p>The National Rare Disease Plan elaborates on Ireland&rsquo;s participation in European Reference Networks (ERN).  ERNs are virtual networks involving healthcare providers across Europe where the networking of knowledge and expertise through reference centres and teams of experts takes place.  These links are emphasized in the Plan to address the care of patients with rare diseases at both National and European levels.  Significant progress has been made with regard to participation in ERNs with Ireland&rsquo;s 15 applications for entry to ERNs recently being approved from 5 academic hospitals. Entry to these networks commenced on 1 January 2022 and represents a significant achievement for the Irish Health Service which will drive innovation, training and clinical research for highly specialised care. It is also a very positive development for individuals and families affected with rare diseases.<\/p><p>In order to ensure that the input and the voice of the patient is represented in the ongoing work in relation to Rare Diseases, in 2021 I met with the HSE, NRDO and the Rare Diseases Task force which comprises the main rare disease advocacy groups; Rare Disease Ireland (RDI), the Medical Research Charities Group (MRCP), and  the Irish Platform for Patient Organisations, Science and Industry (IPPPOSI). At this meeting priority areas for the future were discussed with a view to building further on the significant progress made to date in implementing the Rare Disease Plan. A number, of priority areas for the coming period were agreed including; patient awareness, European Reference Networks, research and registries, access to services, access to medicines, diagnosis, education, legislation and policy.<\/p><p>The Clinical Genetics service at Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland (CHI) at Crumlin was founded in 1995 and provides a diagnostic, counselling and clinical genetic testing service for children and adults affected by or at risk of a genetic condition. <\/p><p>The service is the main provider of general genetic counselling to the population of the Republic of Ireland. It cares for and manages families with genetic conditions, rather than simply focusing on individual patients. <\/p><p>Currently there are four Consultant Geneticists in CHI at Crumlin. I am pleased to advise that two vacant posts have been approved by the Consultant Applications Advisory Committee and have been advertised with a closing date of 22nd of July 2022.

The HSE is the statutory decision-maker for the reimbursement of such products, and the Act ensures that these decisions are made on an objective and scientific basis.<\/p>  <p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) (Amendment) Bill 2021 seeks to remove any threshold incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) informed by the Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALY) metric from the assessment of orphan medicinal products while retaining the responsibility for the HSE to consider cost-effectiveness under modified criteria.<\/p>  <p>  The QALY is the economic evaluation system which is used to set a threshold of cost-effectiveness when assessing medicines. Using the QALY, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) can systematically assess new medicines for cost effectiveness. Disregarding a validated systematic evidence-based scientific methodology to inform decision-making would greatly limit the HSE&rsquo;s capacity to determine whether the submitted price for orphan drugs represents value for money. In the absence of cost-effectiveness information on orphan drugs, the HSE would enter commercial negotiations in an uninformed, and therefore disadvantageous position.<\/p>  <p>  The 2013 Health Act does not provide for a different ruleset when assessing orphan medicines. However, the criteria that apply to the evaluation process allow the HSE to have particular regard for the unique circumstances surrounding orphan drugs. The statutory framework in the 2013 Act requires the HSE to take account of a range of objective factors and not just cost-effectiveness under the QALY system.  In making reimbursement decisions, there is a list of criteria contained in the Act which the HSE is required to consider, including the magnitude of the clinical effect, cost effectiveness, budget impact, available resources, and unmet medical need.<\/p>  <p>  Consequently, the QALY economic evaluation system does not restrict the HSE from applying discretion particularly in seeking to address unmet medical need. In making reimbursement decisions, the HSE often reimburses orphan medicines in excess of a cost per QALY of &euro;45,000 in cases where the potential to address unmet need is supported by robust clinical evidence.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2021 allocated &euro;50 million for the approval of new drugs and nineteen of the fifty-two new medicines approved by the HSE in 2021 were orphan medicines, representing over one third of approvals. Budget 2022 allocated a further &euro;30 million for the approval of new drugs. The HSE has approved 36 new medicines\/new uses of existing medicines to date in 2022 including three medicines  for the treatment of rare diseases.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the concerns outlined above, the Bill is honourable in its intent and must serve as an opportunity to explore the policy options available to us. We all want an assessment process for orphan medicines which provides our most vulnerable patients with access to the innovative treatments which they deserve. The Bill represents an opportunity to comprehensively look at the current system and consider how issues such as transparency and communication can be improved, and I have asked my officials to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200112#WRYY01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2575,"content":"<p>Question No. 982 answered with Question No. 780.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":2577,"qnumday":983,"qnumall":"[37819\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200112#WRYY01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if Ireland is currently in breach of the European Union Transparency Directive 89\/105\/EEC; if his Department intends to reduce the ongoing delays for patients to gain access to European Medicines Agency-approved medicine in Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1523","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2578,"content":"<p>Under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, the HSE has statutory responsibility for the administration of the community drug schemes; therefore, the matter has been referred to the HSE for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200112#WRYY01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2579,"content":"<p>Question No. 984 answered with Question No. 981.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":2581,"qnumday":985,"qnumall":"[37821\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200112#WRYY02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the work that is being carried out to enhance transparency and improve communication with patient groups and industry during the drug reimbursement process; if he will provide a mechanism for patient groups and industry to establish communication with the HSE corporate pharmaceutical unit throughout the reimbursement process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1523","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2582,"content":"<p>The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicines under the community drugs schemes, in accordance with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.<\/p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).<\/p>  <p>  The NCPE has advised that it is unable to publicise all documents and information which it receives as part of the submissions from pharmaceutical companies, as much of this information is commercially sensitive and received in confidence.

My Department's Contraception Implementation Group, convened in July, 2021, has been working with partners, including the HSE, towards ensuring that the scheme will commence in late August or early September 2022. Funding of approximately &euro;9m has been allocated for this in Budget 2022.<\/p>  <p>  - The cost of prescription contraception;<\/p>  <p>  - The cost of necessary consultations with medical professionals to discuss suitable contraception for individual patients and to enable prescription of same;<\/p>  <p>  - The cost of fitting and\/or removal of various types of long-acting reversible contraception (LARCs) plus any necessary checks, by medical professionals certified to fit\/remove same;<\/p>  <p>  - The cost of training and certifying additional medical professionals to fit and remove LARCs;<\/p>  <p>  - The cost of providing the wide range of contraceptive options currently available to GMS (medical) card holders, which will also be available through this scheme, including contraceptive injections, implants, IUS and IUDs (coils), the contraceptive patch and ring, and various forms of oral contraceptive pill, including emergency contraception.<\/p>  <p>The legal framework for the scheme will be provided by the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, 2022, which was passed by the D&aacute;il on 6th July, 2022 and will be debated by Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 12th July, 2022. Should the Bill pass all stages and be signed into law, it is envisaged that the scheme will be launched in late August or early September, 2022.<\/p>  <p>  Formal consultations with medical representative bodies with regard to service provision under the scheme have commenced and are ongoing. The design of citizen engagement information and publicity campaigns to support and promote the roll out of the scheme will be finalised in the coming weeks by officials in the Department&rsquo;s Press and Communications Team, the HSE&rsquo;s Communications team and relevant subject matter experts.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of considering the expansion of the scheme to wider age cohorts, it is recommended by the Public Expenditure Code that policy changes with significant Exchequer cost implications should be phased in and\/or be subject to piloting and formal evaluation, before full roll out. This is particularly pertinent in the case of schemes, such as this one, which are demand-led. It is envisaged that, for quality control and other logistical reasons, including the monitoring of health service capacity in terms of LARC fitting and removal, a minimum of 12 to 18 months would be needed for monitoring of service delivery to 17-25 year-olds, prior to any further major expansion of the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to extending the age cohort specifically to girls under the age of 17, It is important to note that the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill 2022 in the form passed by the D&aacute;il, does not preclude the scheme being extended to girls under the age of 17. It provides that such an extension cannot be done under regulations to be made by the Minister for Health, meaning such an extension of the scheme would require a legislative amendment to be brought before the Oireachtas. I gave a commitment in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann (Committee Stage debate, 06\/07\/2022), that consideration of the needs of this girls under 17 would be considered by my Department as soon as this Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, 2022 has been commenced.<\/p>  <p>  If the Bill passes all stages in the form it was passed by D&aacute;il Eireann, my Department will commence the relevant consultations across Government, including engagement with the Oireachtas Health Committee. Subject to the outcome of these consultations, in particular resolving any potential obstacles, legal or otherwise, it is my intention, subject also to the required Government approval, to bring any necessary legislative amendments before the Houses of the Oireachtas, for full debate and scrutiny, at the earliest possible opportunity.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, it is important also to clarify that the sole purpose of the contraception provisions contained in Part 3 of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill 2022 (in the form as passed by the D&aacute;il), is to transfer the costs of contraception from the patient to the State, starting with women aged 17-25.<\/p>  <p>  Every day, GPs see women and girls of all ages, up and down the country, in their practices, to prescribe contraception, both for the purposes of birth control, and to ameliorate pain, heavy bleeding, mood disorders and other symptoms of the menstrual cycle for which medical help is often needed.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill, if enacted, will have no impact on normal practice in this regard, for women over 25 and girls under 17. The normal operation of services provided by GPs, their clinical judgement and the medications and devices they may decide to prescribe are not a matter for this Bill, which is concerned only with removing the financial barriers to accessing contraception, starting with women aged 17-25.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200112#WRYY04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1608"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental

The completion of Phase One of the roll-out, envisaged before the end of this year, will result in fully operational Regional Fertility Hubs in each of the six Hospital Groups across the country.<\/p>  <p>  Phase Two of the roll-out of the model of care will see the introduction of tertiary infertility services, including IVF, in the public health system. Substantial planning, development and policy work is required to establish the scope, design and requirements for this component of the model of care. At this juncture, the design and scope of this aspect of the model of care have not been finalised as detailed consideration of a range of issues including service and treatment design, eligibility and access criteria, and associated resource implications is required.

The HSE assesses each medical card application on a qualifying financial threshold. This is the amount of money that an individual can earn a week and still qualify for a card. It is specific to the individual&rsquo;s own financial circumstances.<\/p><p>Persons aged 69 and under are assessed under the general means tested medical card thresholds which are based on an applicant&rsquo;s household income after tax and the deduction of PRSI and the Universal Social Charge. Certain expenses are also taken into account, i.e. mortgage payments, which help to increase the amount a person can earn and still qualify for a medical card.<\/p><p>Persons aged 70 or older are assessed under the over 70s medical card income thresholds which are based on gross income. It should be noted that in November 2020, the weekly gross medical card income thresholds for those aged 70 and over were increased to &euro;550 per week for a single person and &euro;1,050 for a couple. This increase ensures that a greater proportion of those aged 70 and over now qualify for a medical card.<\/p><p>With regard to the estimated cost of the deputy's proposals, the data required to model these are not readily available and it is therefore not possible to provide an estimate of the associated cost, number of cards, or other requested figures.<\/p><p>However, I wish to assure the Deputy that, to ensure the medical card system is responsive and sensitive to people's needs, my Department keeps medical card issues, including the current medical card income thresholds under review and any changes are considered in the context of Government policy, the annual budgetary estimates process and other issues which may be relevant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200117#WRDDD01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2889,"content":"<p>Question No. 1094 answered with Question No. 1093.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2890,"content":"<p>Question No. 1095 answered with Question No. 1093.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2891,"content":"<p>Question No. 1096 answered with Question No. 1093.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2892,"content":"<p>Question No. 1097 answered with Question No. 1093.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":2893,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200117#WRDDD02300"},{"type":"question","counter":2894,"qnumday":1098,"qnumall":"[38092\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200117#WRDDD02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the case of a person (details supplied) will be examined; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1583","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2895,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200117#WRDDD02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2896,"content":"<p>Question No. 1099 answered with Question No. 981.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":2897,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200117#WRDDD02700"},{"type":"question","counter":2898,"qnumday":1100,"qnumall":"[38103\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200117#WRDDD02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the extent to which progress has taken place in recent months in respect of reducing the waiting lists for various procedures in respect of scoliosis and spina bifida with particular reference to availing of every opportunity to reduce these waiting lists and to show results on a weekly basis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2899,"content":"<p>Reducing waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures remains a commitment of this Government.

Such programmes and schemes include the following:<\/p><p><b><i>Town and Village Renewal<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>- The Town and Village Renewal Scheme (TVRS) was introduced in 2016 and supports small to medium capital projects which enhance the environment of town or village centres. Since its introduction, almost &euro;113 million has been allocated to more than 1,400 projects across Ireland.<\/p><p>- This year&rsquo;s scheme includes, under Priority category A2 , funding for projects to develop parks, plazas, public outdoor dining spaces, green spaces (including allotments) and recreational spaces\/amenities in town centres to make them vibrant hubs for community enjoyment, and to increase footfall for local businesses. <\/p><p><b><i>LEADER <\/i><\/b><\/p><p>- Funding may be available through the LEADER Programme for the type of project referred to by the Deputy.  LEADER is a multi-annual programme which is delivered through 29 Local Action Groups (LAGs) around the country. <\/p><p>- Support under the LEADER programme is provided under a broad range of themes, one of which is Social Inclusion. <\/p><p>- In order for a project to be eligible for LEADER funding, it must be compatible with the actions outlined in the approved Local Development Strategy for the relevant LEADER area, and it must comply with the Operating Rules and EU Regulations in place for the programme. <\/p><p>- Prospective applicants should, in the first instance, contact their relevant Local Action Group, through its Implementing Partner, to discuss the eligibility of the project and the funding that may be available. The list of all Local Action Groups, their Implementing Partners and their contact details, is available on the Gov.ie website at: <i>www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/c45498-local-action-groups<\/i>.<\/p><p><b><i>Libraries<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>- My Department has policy responsibility for Public Libraries, and provides funding to supplement investment by local authorities in their public library services.  The current public libraries strategy, &lsquo;Our Public Libraries 2022 - Inspiring, Connecting and Empowering Communities&rsquo; includes a specific focus on communities and individuals at risk of being socially excluded, marginalised or disadvantaged.<\/p><p>- In 2019 my Department approved funding of almost &euro;700,000 to support the provision of sensory facilities and equipment in Public Libraries which included equipment such as a Sensory Pod in Carrigaline and sensory play equipment in all the Cork City library branches.<\/p><p>- Since 2019 my Department has provided funding through the Dormant Accounts Fund which supports marginalised, socially excluded and disadvantaged communities. This has included funding for library staff training to support certain library branches in becoming Autism Friendly spaces e.g. Scarriff, Co Clare and a number of library branches in Fingal County Council. In 2021 and 2022, Dormant Accounts funding has also been provided to support the provision of modern equipment in public libraries which improves accessibility for people with a disability and those with autism and sensory needs.  Funding under this programme includes sensory walls, sensory toys, sensory gardens and sensory pods.<\/p><p>The Autism Innovation Strategy, which is in development, will take a whole-of-government approach to advance the rights of people with autism in Irish society and will play an important role in shaping future policies and strategies across government to address challenges and barriers faced by the community of neurodiverse people in Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200120#WRGGG02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes","counter":3056,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200120#WRGGG02700"},{"type":"question","counter":3057,"qnumday":1153,"qnumall":"[37731\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200120#WRGGG02800","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the total number of applications approved for Cork County Council through the town and village renewal scheme by year, project title, location, total amount approved since its introduction in 2016, in tabular form; the money that was subsequently returned from Cork County Council to her Department; the reason for same; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1455","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":3058,"content":"<p>The Town and Village Renewal Scheme (TVRS) was introduced in 2016 and is one of a number of measures designed to rejuvenate rural towns and villages throughout Ireland.
