The DRS operates on a sliding scale basis, whereby a partial rebate of MOT is available when the retail price of diesel exceeds &euro;1.00 per litre excluding VAT. The repayment rate increases gradually as the retail price increases, up to a maximum repayment rate of 7.5 cents per litre\/&euro;75.00 per 1,000 litres. At current retail prices the repayment rate is at this maximum.<\/p><p>It is important to note that the effective MOT rate on auto-diesel must be considered in ensuring compliance with the ETD. The effective rate includes the maximum MOT rate repayable under the Diesel Rebate Scheme (DRS), currently &euro;75.00 per 1,000 litres. The current MOT rate on auto-diesel is &euro;405.38 per 1,000 litres, which is &euro;75.38 above the ETD minimum. However, when the DRS is taken into account, the effective MOT rate is &euro;0.38 per 1,000 litres, or 0.038 cents per litre, above the ETD minimum, meaning that any material reduction in the effective MOT rate would be incompatible with EU law. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500066#WRB03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Rebates","counter":39,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500066#WRB03800"},{"type":"question","counter":40,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[31033\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500066#WRB03900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider the introduction of additional specific income tax rebates for families placing their children in the care of registered providers given that  childcare costs   are placing significant burdens particularly on young and middle-income families; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1616","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":41,"content":"<p>I\u00a0acknowledge the cost pressures on parents with young children.

This is a commercial matter for individual companies to assess on a case-by-case basis and in accordance with their own calculation of various factors, including risk. This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from any such intervention. <\/p>  <p>  I am aware of recent increases in the cost of travel insurance. Furthermore, Government acknowledges the strong concerns felt by many groups regarding the cost and availability of such cover. While recognising that there is no single domestic\u00a0legislative or policy fix to these and other insurance related issues, this Government has nonetheless moved to help address them through the implementation of the Action Plan for Insurance Reform. This sets out 66 actions to bring down costs for consumers and business; introduce more competition into the market; prevent fraud and reduce the burden that insurance costs can have on business, community and voluntary organisations. As the Deputy may be aware, the Government published the Second Action Plan Implementation Report in March, which showed that 80% of the actions were being delivered. Our focus has now shifted towards delivering the remaining aspects of the Action Plan, most notably rebalancing the duty of care. Proposals for this important reform were approved by Cabinet last month. <\/p>  <p>  One\u00a0part of the Insurance reform agenda is the establishment of the Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market, which I, as Minister of State for\u00a0Financial Services, \u00a0chair.

The demographic profile of arrivals, a key determinant of costings, is also subject to considerable change. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Initial estimates suggest costs in the region of a half billion per 10,000 refugees. These\u00a0estimates were based on a number of assumptions including the use of emergency hotel accommodation for which there are significant capacity constraints. The cost per refugee is highly sensitive to the accommodation solution provided&mdash;accommodation solutions are currently being developed and may change over the medium term&mdash;this complicates providing an annual cost per refugee. <\/p>  <p>  The provision of &euro;3 billion in 2023 would allow for a cost of c.&euro;30,000 per refugee assuming c.100,000 refugees. This is in line with\u00a0the international experience. Based on OECD analysis during the 2015 refugee crisis, significant amounts were spent by European countries: <\/p>  <p>  - Germany who received as many as 900,000 asylum seekers spent 0.5% of GDP; <\/p>  <p>  - Sweden which received 163,000 asylum seekers (1.6% of total population) spent 1.35% of GDP.<\/p>  <p>  Applying these percentages to 2023 forecasts of GNI* in Ireland\u00a0would give a range of &euro;1.3 billion to &euro;3.5 billion. Given that c. 100,000 refugees would represent 2% of the Irish population, it is more likely that the costs would be towards the upper end of the range.<\/p>  <p>  This was supported by a bottom up assessment of likely expenditure in key areas, based on assumptions regarding accommodation solutions, demographics and social protection costs.  It is too early to estimate the time horizon for, and level at, which supports will be required. The\u00a0&euro;3 billion\u00a0contingency included for 2023\u00a0will be revised as more information becomes available.

Due to the impact of Covid-19, Foreign Birth Registration\u00a0Service was paused for nearly 15 months across the 2020-2021 period. Due to the complex nature of the FBR process, the large increase in applications received following the Brexit vote in the UK, and the pause in the Service due to necessary Covid-19 restrictions, applicants should allow over two years from the receipt of supporting documentation for processing of FBR applications at this time.\u00a0<\/p><p>As can be seen in the figures provided below, the number of staff assigned to processing FBR applications in 2020 was impacted by the suspension of the service and subsequent reassignment of staff to consular duties in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2021, a number of FBR staff were reassigned to passport duties as demand for passport applications increased. In 2022, staff continued to be reassigned to passport duties in response to the unprecedented increase in demand seen by the Passport Service in recent months.\u00a0<\/p><p>My Department is fully committed to the continued allocation of additional resources over the coming period to assist with the processing of the\u00a0Foreign Birth Registration\u00a0applications currently on hand and the high volume of new applications anticipated this year.<\/p><p>A major recruitment drive has been underway over the past several months, which has seen over 400 new staff members join the Passport Service since June 2021. The Passport Service is currently running its own recruitment competition for Temporary Clerical Officers. Over 70 officers have been assigned to the Passport Service from this competition in recent weeks. It is anticipated that some of these resources will be allocated to the provision of FBR Services as the current high level of passport demand reduces.<\/p><p>The information requested by Deputy Lowry is outlined below in tabular form.<\/p><p>In October 2021, the\u00a0Passport Service\u00a0established a temporary phone\u00a0line\u00a0to respond to\u00a0Oireachtas\u00a0Members' queries on urgent passport cases.<\/p><p>There are currently 10 staff assigned to the Oireachtas Urgent Query Service team, along with one team lead and one officer carrying out administrative tasks.\u00a0<\/p><p>Since 23 May, up to 20 queries per week from each\u00a0Oireachtas\u00a0Member can be facilitated by this team.<\/p><p>Staff\u00a0on the\u00a0Oireachtas\u00a0Line\u00a0continue to work productively under increasing pressure. They are dealing with record numbers of calls and queries every week and have handled over 17,500 queries from Members since the beginning of this year.<\/p><p>In each case raised by an\u00a0Oireachtas\u00a0Member, the\u00a0Passport Service\u00a0reviews the application in question. However, applications can only be expedited in cases of genuine emergency such as a need for urgent medical treatment overseas or the death of a family member abroad. Such applications are expedited through the Travel Emergency service.<\/p><p>Non-urgent cases should continue to be dealt with through the existing phone lines and web chat facilities. Passport applications that are being processed in line with their turnaround times cannot be expedited. Where the estimated issue-by date has been exceeded this will result in a query being raised internally in the\u00a0Passport Service. The\u00a0Passport Service\u00a0will work to issue a passport or respond to a request for further information to the customer within two working days.<\/p><p>While Deputies often hear of the most complex and pressing cases, the overwhelming majority of passport applicants have their passport processed without any recourse to their local TD.\u00a0<\/p><p><b>Passport Service staff assigned to processing Foreign Birth Registration applications<\/b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year<\/th>       <th>No. of FBR staff<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2019<\/td>       <td>73<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2020<\/td>       <td>39<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2021<\/td>       <td>66<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2022<\/td>       <td>48<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500068#WRD06900","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":194,"content":"<p>Question No. 48 answered with Question No. 46.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":195,"content":"<p>Question No. 49 answered with Question No. 46.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":196,"content":"<p>Question No. 50 answered with Question No. 46.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":197,"content":"<p>Question No. 51 answered with Question No. 46.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":198,"content":"<p>Question No. 52 answered with Question No. 46.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":199,"content":"<p>Question No. 53 answered with Question No. 46.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":200,"content":"<p>Question No. 54 answered with Question No. 46.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":201,"content":"<p>Question No. 55 answered with Question No. 46.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":202,"content":"<p>Question No. 56 answered with Question No. 46.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":203,"content":"<p>Question No. 57 answered with Question No. 46.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":204,"content":"<p>Question No. 58 answered with Question No. 46.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":205,"content":"<p>Question No. 59 answered with Question No. 46.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":206,"content":"<p>Question No. 60 answered with Question No. 46.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":207,"content":"<p>Question No. 61 answered with Question No. 46.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":208,"content":"<p>Question No. 62 answered with Question No. 46.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":209,"content":"<p>Question No. 63 answered with Question No. 46.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":211,"content":"<p>Question No. 64 answered with Question No. 46.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Services","counter":212,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500069#WRE00300"},{"type":"question","counter":213,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[31120\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500069#WRE00400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the status of a passport application for a child (details supplied) given that the target issue date has been exceeded and the date of travel is imminent;

It is important that these witnesses are available to confirm their witnessing of consent forms when called by the Passport Service.\u00a0<\/p><p>The witnessing of these forms is a vital element of the identity verification process for the\u00a0Passport Service, as it provides initial assurance that the person in the photograph is the same person presenting to submit the passport application form.<\/p><p>In the case of an application for a minor the witnessing of this form provides evidence that guardians give consent for a passport to be issued to the child. In order to protect the integrity of the Irish passport and also the rights of parents or guardians and children, it is important that forms are correctly completed and verified by the\u00a0Passport Service\u00a0by calling the\u00a0Garda\u00a0station to confirm the\u00a0Garda's signature.<\/p><p>It is stated in a note to the witness on the identity and\u00a0consent forms\u00a0that they may be contacted to confirm the validity of their signature.

Passport applications from all citizens - whether from anywhere in Ireland, North or South, or abroad - are distributed for processing across the three Passport Offices on the basis of the type of application rather than the place of residence of the applicant.<\/p><p>Over 90% of all passport applications, including first time applications, are now being made through Passport Online which is available to 97% of all applicants across the world. 87% of applicants from Northern Ireland are submitted online. The Passport Service\u00a0is committed to continuing to offer a range of application channels, including an offline service for citizens who are not eligible or do not wish to use the Passport Online service.<\/p><p>Passport Online is the priority channel for applications as there are many efficiencies built into the system for both the applicant and the Passport Service. The Passport Online service offers Irish citizens the ability to apply online for their passport 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It is a user-friendly, efficient service that consistently offers processing times up to 4 times faster than paper-based passport renewal applications.<\/p><p>A paper-based, mail-in service is available at over 70 post office locations in Northern Ireland. With the availability of both Passport Online and the postal application channel, very few applicants are required to travel a significant distance in order to apply for their passport.<\/p><p>In the relatively small number of cases where citizens need to travel urgently and do not have a valid passport, the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork offer an Urgent Appointment service for passport renewal with a 4-day turnaround.\u00a0 The Dublin office also offers a 1 day turnaround which is possible due to the production capacity in that location. The Passport Service\u00a0offices in Dublin and Cork have processed over 7,600 Urgent Appointments to date in 2022. These Urgent Appointment applications represents just 1% of the total 720,000 applications received by the Passport Service\u00a0since January of this year.<\/p><p>Given the high percentage of applicants from Northern Ireland using Passport Online, I am confident that the range of service options available meets the current needs of passport applicants. Furthermore, recent service improvements allow the Passport Service\u00a0to provide this essential citizen service in an efficient and effective manner. While there are no plans to open additional passport offices, the Passport Service\u00a0will continue to consider ways in which to enhance customer experience for citizens.<\/p><p>The information requested by Deputy Brady is outlined below in tabular form.

No change in the level of care need identified (and no change in the resultant SNA allocation); <\/p>  <p>  ii. Increase in the level of care need identified (which if significant would see an increase in the SNA allocations to the schools) ; <\/p>  <p>  iii.

The classes are designed to provide a time-limited, targeted intervention for children with severe impairments in their skills of understanding and expressing themselves through spoken language. The special classes focus on a relatively narrow cohort of pupils whose language difficulty is not otherwise attributable to co-morbid factors such as general learning disability, deafness or behavioural challenges.

Schools should contact their local NCSE Special Education Needs Organiser (SENO) to commence the process. <\/p>  <p>  c) The exceptional review process undertaken by NCSE will remain in place throughout the 2022\/23 school year, where schools can seek a review of their SNA allocations which will result in one of the following outcomes: <\/p>  <p>  i. No change in the level of care need identified (and no change in the resultant SNA allocation); <\/p>  <p>  ii. Increase in the level of care need identified (which if significant would see an increase in the SNA allocations to the schools) ; <\/p>  <p>  iii. Decrease in level of care need identified in the school (which if significant would result in a reduction in SNA allocations as the care need could be managed with less resources than are currently allocated); In relation to outcome iii, the SNA allocation will be adjusted at the end of the relevant school term. <\/p>  <p>  It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030\/2014 circulars.gov.ie\/pdf\/circular\/education\/2014\/30.pdf. Following such a review and reprioritisation, it is expected that a small number of schools, e.g. developing schools, may not have a sufficient SNA allocation to meet the needs of their students. These schools can apply to the NCSE for an Exceptional Review of their allocation.<\/p>  <p>  Detailed information on the NCSE Exceptional Review process is published on the NCSE website. ncse.ie\/application-for-sna-exceptional-review.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE will endeavour to respond to all applications for Exceptional Review received as expediently as possible and in that regard, it will prioritise applications from schools with no current SNA allocation and developing schools. The Exceptional Review process for mainstream allocations will be available to schools throughout the 2022\/23 school year.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE has developed an appeal mechanism for schools who are not satisfied with the outcome of the Exceptional Review. Local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) will provide information and clarification to schools on the outcome where requested. Where schools wish to appeal the outcome of the review, they must do so using the prescribed form provided by the NCSE ncse.ie\/ncse-appeals-process<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE have published the SNA allocations for the 2022\/23 school year and they are available at ncse.ie\/set-hours-and-sna-allocations<\/p>  <p>  All schools have the contact details of their local SENO, and the SENO is available to offer assistance and advice to the school. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on\u00a0www.ncse.ie.<\/p>  <p>  The school should liaise with the NCSE directly in the event that additional supports are required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500073#WRJ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staff","counter":354,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500073#WRJ00800"},{"type":"question","counter":355,"qnumday":146,"qnumall":"[31259\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500073#WRJ00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason that access to an English as an additional language teacher for a school (details supplied) in County Tipperary was revoked; if her attention has been drawn to the fact  that a direct provision centre was established in the area in November 2019 and that the number of English as an additional language pupils attending this school is approximately 22% of the school&rsquo;s student population; the steps that will be taken to address the revocation of the post given that the school is continually increasing its number of English as an additional language  pupils; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1609","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":356,"content":"<p>Each primary school receives a Special Education Teaching allocation.\u00a0 The Special Education Teaching allocation provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile and also encompasses the Language Support\u00a0(EAL)\u00a0allocation that\u00a0schools were allocated in previous years.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Further temporary Language Support is also provided, as necessary, to schools that have high concentrations of pupils that require language (EAL) support.

The package of measures announced in Budget 2022, particularly the Transition Fund and Core Funding, are designed to ensure that fees to parents do not increase and that the full affordability benefits of the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) are felt without being absorbed in fee increases. <\/p><p>The introduction of fee management measures is one of the recommendations contained in the Expert Group report, '<i>Partnership for the Public Good: A New Funding Model for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare'<\/i>, as approved by Government. Fee management will start with the requirement for providers to maintain fees at or below September 2021 levels to access Core Funding in 2022. This will be developed further in future years.<\/p><p>From August 2020 to April 2022, ELC and SAC services could access the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) without having to demonstrate a reduction in turnover required by other employers. This significant level of funding to the sector has ensured that fees have remained largely static for the last two years and that providers have continued to be sustainable.<\/p><p>Following the tapering of EWSS and prior to the introduction of Core Funding, a Transition Fund is available to providers. The primary conditionality of the Transition Fund is an agreement not to increase fees from September 2021 levels. I am delighted to report that so far 94% of services have agreed to operate a freeze on parental fees by coming into contract for the Transition Fund. <\/p><p>Following the Transition Fund, Core Funding will become available from September 2022 and will be worth up to &euro;221 million in a full year. A central condition of Core Funding will be that providers agree not to increase fees above those which were charged last year. This will give parents greater certainty about what they will be charged and ensure that increases to National Childcare Scheme (NCS) subsidies are not absorbed by fee increases. <\/p><p>NCS provides income-assess and universal subsidies in respect of ELC and SAC.  Income-assessed subsidies are available to families with children aged between 24 weeks and 15 years. This subsidy is means-tested and calculated based on individual circumstances. Rates will vary depending on the level of family income, the child&rsquo;s age and educational stage, and the number of children in the family.<\/p><p>Parents who do not qualify for an income-assessed subsidy may qualify for a universal subsidy. The universal subsidy is currently available to all families with children under 3 years old and families with children over 3 who have not yet qualified for the free preschool programme (ECCE). This subsidy is not means tested and provides 50 cents per hour towards the cost of a registered childcare place for a maximum of 45 hours per week.<\/p><p>Two significant number developments to the Scheme were announced as part of Budget 2022. <\/p><p>The first development, which came into effect on 2 May, has removed the practice of deducting hours spent in pre-school, or school, from NCS awards. This means that parents may use their full awarded subsidised NCS hours &ndash; benefitting an estimated 5,000 children from low income families.<\/p><p>The second change will extend the NCS universal subsidy to all children under the age of 15 from September 2022 &ndash; benefitting up to 40,000 children.<\/p><p>Both of these changes will result in more families receiving additional subsidised hours for early learning and childcare.<\/p><p>Additionally, participation in NCS is a requirement for services to come into contract for Core Funding (unless they are a sessional pre school service only).<\/p><p>Ensuring no fee increase, in tandem with developments to the NCS will together deliver improved affordability for parents and I hope to build on these in future. <\/p><p>As you can see, I am committed to putting in place a strong foundation to improve affordability for parents and sustainability for services, as well as improved quality of provision, including pay and conditions for the workforce. This foundation will allow for further developments in future years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500073#WRJ04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":391,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[31032\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500073#WRJ04500","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the plans that he has in place to support the early childhood care sector given the significant costs that childcare businesses are experiencing and the difficulties in recruitment and retention due to low wages; the way he intends to create additional space in the sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1616","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":392,"content":"<p>I was pleased to have secured a Budget 2022 package of &euro;716 million for investment in Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School Age Childcare (SAC), a very significant advance on the previous year and designed to begin to introduce major changes to the model of funding the sector.<\/p>  <p>  The most substantial new development in Budget 2022 was the introduction of Core Funding. Core Funding is a new funding stream designed to facilitate a partnership between the State and ELC and SAC providers for the public good. Its primary purpose is to improve pay and conditions in the sector as a whole and to improve affordability for parents, as well as ensuring a stable income to providers. 2022 will see up to &euro;73m being made available for Core Funding, which equates to &euro;221m in full year costs. <\/p>  <p>   Core Funding will give providers a stable income source based on the nature of the service they deliver. A provider&rsquo;s income will now consist of Core Funding, NCS subsidies and ECCE capitation, as well as AIM funding for those services that participate in that model, in addition to parental fees. Structuring Core Funding primarily based on capacity means that services will have an allocation each year that will not fluctuate in line with children&rsquo;s attendance.  <\/p>  <p>  Core Funding makes a contribution to staff costs, which comprise approximately 70% of a service's operating costs. In this respect, Core Funding includes allocations for improvements in staff pay and conditions (&euro;138 million) and for administrative staff\/time (&euro;25 million). Employer costs are factored in to the staff costs allocation in Core Funding. A further &euro;38 million will be distributed in line with ELC graduate qualifications of ELC Lead Educators and Managers in ELC or combined ELC and SAC services. <\/p>  <p>  Core Funding also makes a contribution to non-staff overhead costs (for example, utilities, rent) that make up the remaining 30% of providers costs. In a full year, there is an allocation of &euro;20 million for a contribution to non-staff overhead costs through Core Funding. This includes an increase since the original allocation was announced in the budget.<\/p>  <p>  Extensive analysis of the income and costs of providers demonstrates that the combined funding model of ECCE, NCS and Core Funding offers a substantial and attractive package to providers to cover costs, including increased costs related to quality measures, while also committing to the key conditions of Core Funding such as the fee freeze.<\/p>  <p>  On the matter of capacity, the availability of high-quality ELC and SAC is a key Government priority. <\/p>  <p>   To ensure that the supply of ELC and SAC places meets demand, my Department has, since 2015, funded the creation of more than 27,000 new places through an Annual Capital Programme.<\/p>  <p>   Before the onset of Covid-19, national data indicated that, on the whole, supply of places was meeting demand, with evidence of undersupply for certain age groups including children under 3, and in certain areas. <\/p>  <p>  Data gathered throughout the Covid-19 pandemic revealed lower demand for ELC and SAC. Indeed, data captured in June 2021 found significant vacancy rates across the country &ndash; with the national vacancy rate averaging at 21%. My Department has continued to monitor capacity, with a particular focus on monitoring Covid-19 impacts as public health restrictions have been lifted and on responding to the unmet needs of families. In April of this year, City\/County Childcare Committee (CCC) undertook a nationwide survey of capacity in ELC and SAC services. This was followed in May by the Early Years Sector Profile Survey that is undertaken by Pobal annually on behalf of my Department.<\/p>  <p>  Capacity data captured through the recent CCC survey and the Early Years Sector Profile Survey has been extracted and will be made available in the coming weeks. An initial analysis of these data shows the national vacancy rate at 13.3%. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to these efforts to monitor capacity issues across the country, my Department is planning a range of steps to address any issue of under supply. Some &euro;70m has been allocated to my Department through the revised National Development Plan (NDP) &ndash; with the majority of this funding earmarked for new places. Under the National Action Plan for Childminding, I have committed to opening up access to the NCS to parents who use childminders following the extension of regulation to childminders, which is expected to happen within the first 2-3 years of the Plan.<\/p>  <p>  My Department, in partnership with the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government, is in the process of updating the 2001 Planning Guidelines for Local Authorities on Early Learning and Childcare Settings. In addition, City\/County Childcare Committees have been mobilised to engage proactively with services to identify vacant places and to explore possibilities for expansion among services, particularly where there is unmet need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500073#WRJ04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision System","counter":393,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500073#WRJ04700"},{"type":"question","counter":394,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[31143\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500073#WRJ04800","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the total number of adults and children that have received their leave to remain but continue to reside in direct provision and the number of the persons in this situation for 1 year or less, between 1 and 2 and more than 2 years.","asker":"1468","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":395,"content":"<p>Deputy, as at 31 May there are 2,387 adults and 891 children, a total of 3,278, who have received leave to remain and continue to reside in direct provision.

This number grew to 779 apprentices i.e. almost 3% of the apprentice population at that time when commercial and non-commercial semi-state organisations are included. A breakdown of the number of apprentices employed across the public sector at the end of 2021 is attached.<\/p><p>A key commitment of the <i>&lsquo;Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025&rsquo; <\/i>is to grow the number of apprenticeship registrations across the public service, including local authorities, to reach 750 annual registrations by 2025. This represents in excess of a seven-fold increase on 2020 registrations and will support a long-term goal of 7% of the apprentice population being employed by public service employers.<\/p><p>Whilst it is not yet determined where the apprenticeship roles are best located, the diversity of the public service provides a wide basis for involvement with the range of existing apprenticeships and those programmes in development. Apprenticeship provides an opportunity to target and widen the recruitment pool for both generalist and specialist roles within the public service.<\/p><p>My Department&rsquo;s officials have undertaken a number of actions in order to make progress towards achieving this commitment:<\/p><p>- Several general and sector-focused information sessions on apprenticeship were held late last year.<\/p><p>- A Working Group has been established, representing Government Departments and agencies and local authorities, to develop a Public Service Apprenticeship Recruitment Plan by summer 2022. The Group&rsquo;s work is based on surveying over 100 organisations in relation to their skills needs.<\/p><p>- There is also engagement with the HSE and Department of Health in relation to a commitment in the Action Plan to explore a healthcare assistant apprenticeship programme for the HSE and the options for how this might be piloted.  <\/p><p>The results of the survey of public service organisations have now been analysed and a Public Service Apprenticeship Recruitment Plan, informed by the survey results, is being drafted. It is intended to submit the draft for Cabinet approval before the summer recess. <table>    <tr>       <th>Public Sector Apprentices employed at end of 2021<\/th>       <th>number of apprentices\u00a0<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Civil service\u00a0<\/td>       <td>27<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Local Authoriies\u00a0<\/td>       <td>52<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Defence Forces\u00a0<\/td>       <td>176<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>commercial semi-state organisations\u00a0<\/td>       <td>513<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>non-commercial semi-state organisations\u00a0<\/td>       <td>11<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>TOTAL\u00a0<\/td>       <td>779<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500074#WRK02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":435,"content":"<p>Question No. 172 answered with Question No. 171.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":436,"content":"<p>Question No. 173 answered with Question No. 171.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes","counter":437,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500074#WRK03000"},{"type":"question","counter":438,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[31156\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500074#WRK03100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the estimated cost of opening the Student Access Fund to non-domestic students.","asker":"1698","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":439,"content":"<p>The Student Assistance Fund (SAF) provides financial assistance to students experiencing financial difficulties while attending higher education.\u00a0 Students can be assisted towards costs such as rent, childcare, transport and costs associated with the provision of books\/class materials.\u00a0<\/p><p>Students who are non-EU, including UK nationals, but who are eligible for free or reduced fees in line with the criteria for the\u00a0Free Fees Initiative, may be considered for the Student Assistance Fund subject to meeting other relevant criteria.<\/p><p>International\/non-EU fee paying students who pay the full international rate of fee are not eligible for funding under the Student Assistance Fund.

The Kildare Wicklow Education and Training Board (KWETB) and the HSE act as the channels of funding for these services. Of the above amount, KWETB administers in the region of &euro;573,860 to four frontline drug and alcohol projects. <\/p><p>Employees of drug and alcohol projects are in the majority of cases employed and contracted by voluntary drug and alcohol services and are subject to the relevant employment legislation\/regulations in force. The Department of Health has no role in relation to the pay and conditions and job security of the employees of projects funded through KWETB or the HSE.<\/p><p>It might be helpful to clarify the situation in relation to pay restoration for section 39 agencies, funded by the HSE. Under section 39 of the Health Act 2004, the HSE provides financial assistance to organisations by means of a grant.  Section 39 legally underpins the provision of services similar or supplementary to a service that the HSE may provide.  <\/p><p>It should be noted that staff in section 39 organisations were not subject to the provisions of FEMPI legislation and therefore did not receive the cuts that were applied to the pay of public servants. They were not and are not party to the Public Service Agreements and are therefore not covered by the pay restoration provided for in these Agreements.  <\/p><p>In October 2018, an agreement was reached by the parties at the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) in relation to a process of pay restoration for staff employed in Section 39 organisations who met certain criteria, rather than types of individual workers that are employed in them. Only organisations who received in excess of an agreed, specified amount from the HSE by way of the Service Level Agreement process were included.  <\/p><p>It must be acknowledged that Section 39 organisations are voluntary bodies and that their terms and conditions of employment, once in line with employment legislation, are strictly between the employer and the employee. Consequently, it would not be appropriate for the Department of Health or the Minister of Health to comment on terms and conditions of employment within the voluntary sector. <\/p><p>Pay restoration is absolutely limited and only applicable to those included in the initial WRC agreement.

Taking place within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms, this work encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme; the examination of the options for the financing model for the scheme; and the development of a reformed model of service-delivery.<\/p>  <p>  With the aim of ensuring that all service-users are provided with a standard, high-quality level of care which is safe, effective, and person-centred, it is envisaged that the regulatory framework will comprise: (i) primary legislation for the licensing of public and private home-support providers; (ii) minimum requirements (i.e., regulations); and (iii) HIQA National Standards for Home Support Services.<\/p>  <p>  In April 2021, Government gave approval to draft a General Scheme and Heads of a Bill to establish a licensing framework for home-support providers. This is being progressed by the Department with a view to bringing it through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity. It is expected that the primary legislation will give the Minister for Health the power to make regulations in respect of minimum requirements which will form the criteria against which a provider&rsquo;s eligibility to hold a licence will be determined. A regulatory impact analysis will be undertaken by the Department in 2022 to ensure effectiveness and mitigate risks.<\/p>  <p>  In collaboration with HIQA and in consultation with the Health Service Executive and other key informants, the Department developed draft regulations and a targeted stakeholder consultation was undertaken in January 2022. Evaluating the feedback of this consultation is informing amendments in the draft regulations in advance of a public consultation planned in Q2 2022.<\/p>  <p>  On 24th February, the ESRI published a report on the demand for and cost of home support. This is the final output from a programme of research that the ESRI has undertaken to support the Department of Health to progress the development of the new home support scheme.  This research will form an important part of the evidence base for the development of a sustainable funding model for home support services in the context of our ageing population.  Government approval will be sought in due course on any proposed legislation to provide for a financial support scheme, taking into consideration the cost associated with the various options.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, work is ongoing in relation to the development of a reformed model of service delivery for the new scheme. In 2021, funding was secured for the Health Service Executive to: (i) progress the roll-out of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs in the community; (ii) pilot a reformed model of service-delivery for home-support; and (iii) establish a National Office for Home Support Services.<\/p>  <p>  The Pilot for testing of a reformed model of service for the delivery for home-support is fully operational. It commenced in November in CHO 8, which is the first of the four pilot sites. The three other sites CHO2, CHO 4 and CHO 7 became operational in January 2022. Funding has been approved for 128 interRAI Care Needs Facilitators to progress the national rollout of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs.  The interRAI outputs and pilot site evaluation will be critical to the development of the new home-support scheme. A National Home Support Office is in the process of being established.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500075#WRL04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":512,"qnumday":199,"qnumall":"[31070\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500075#WRL04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the HSE&rsquo;s process of tendering for homecare support providers will be updated; if this will take into account the commitments in the Programme for Government towards a statutory entitlement to home care and the ongoing implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":513,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500075#WRL04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":515,"qnumday":200,"qnumall":"[31071\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500075#WRL05100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the Department of Health and the HSE have sufficient resources to meet an increased demand for home care alongside Sl&aacute;intecare; if plans are being put in place to address future need in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":516,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500075#WRL05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Abortion Services","counter":517,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500075#WRL05300"},{"type":"question","counter":518,"qnumday":201,"qnumall":"[31077\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500075#WRL05400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to a reply received by a person (details supplied) from the HSE on 20 May 2022 in which it was claimed that a majority of abortion providers within primary care agree that a blended approach of telemedicine is optimal, if he will identify the polling data upon which said claim is based; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1461","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":519,"content":"<p>As this question relates to a service area, I have referred this question to the HSE for direct response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500075#WRL05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":521,"qnumday":202,"qnumall":"[31078\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500075#WRL05550","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if external organisations have been contracted by the HSE to provide manual vacuum aspiration training for hospital staff involved in abortion provision; the organisations that were contracted; the details of the contracts including timeframes and sums payable; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1461","askee":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":522,"content":"<p>Awaiting reply from Department.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Healthcare Policy","counter":523,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500075#WRL05600"},{"type":"question","counter":524,"qnumday":203,"qnumall":"[31083\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500075#WRL05700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress that has been made on the implementation of a national genetics and genomics medicine network as promised in the Programme for Government; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1523","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":525,"content":"<p>The Department of Health is currently working with the HSE on a Steering Group for the development of a National Genetics and Genomic Strategy.

While the primary aim of this group is to set out a roadmap for the development of a high-performing genetics and genomics medical service, it provides an unprecedented opportunity to connect genomics healthcare services with the research and innovation community. Innovation in genomics is occurring across the globe and Ireland has a lot of international examples to draw from as we plot our path ahead. The FinnGen Project is one of these examples. It proves the valuable insights that can be gained from combining genome information with digital health care data. It is for this reason, we have sought input from international experts to inform our own Strategy.<\/p>  <p>  Excellent research can only be achieved so long as the patient whose genomic data is being investigated is being protected and they are the forefront of the benefit of this work. We must continue to foster confidence by ensuring that patients and the public are giving full and clear consent. There are three other key developments underway that will help to shape and realise a way forward for Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  1. The IPPOSI Citizens&rsquo; Jury on Future Use of  Genomics, which began its deliberations earlier this month, will examine such areas as how\u00a0genomic information can improve our health as individuals and as a society, to what extent we should support the  increased use of genomics in our health\u00a0care and health research, the challenges and opportunities that arise\u00a0from doing so, and the safeguards that are needed to maximise\u00a0progress while\u00a0containing  the risks. Its work is guided by an independent Oversight Panel, which  includes public and patient representatives, the Health Research Board,  clinicians, researchers, geneticists and regulatory experts. Genetic and genomic information belongs to people, and those people should have a say in how this information should be used in Ireland for health care and health research.<\/p>  <p>  2. The current Health Research Board Strategy explicitly identifies the advancement of genomics research as a priority objective. Earlier this year, the HRB played a lead role in securing Ireland&rsquo;s participation in a Digital Europe project to design, develop and  implement a federated Genomics Data Infrastructure across Europe with the  aim of ensuring that countries have the necessary data infrastructure in place to collect, store, manage, share, and analyse genomic datasets within and across EU Member states, in a secure, transparent and trusted manner. The project will allow authorised data users, such as clinicians and approved researchers, to advance our understanding of genomics for more precise and faster clinical decision-making, diagnostics, treatments and precision medicine. This project, which is co-funded by the HRB brings researchers, clinicians, patient representatives, clinical geneticists,  data analysts and others together to develop a roadmap for such a data  infrastructure in Ireland, with work on a roadmap beginning in earnest later this year. <\/p>  <p>  3. Another key element for advancing genomics is access to biobanking infrastructure and support services. Fuelled by the COVID crisis, my Department made funding available for the first time to establish and maintain a national biobanking infrastructure to advance covid-19 research and innovation. This initiative, led by the Health Research Board, involves universities and hospitals across the country working  together towards a common ambition, with an emphasis on international best practice, strong regulation and governance, and underpinned by principles of transparency and accessibility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500076#WRM01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Cards","counter":542,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500076#WRM01400"},{"type":"question","counter":543,"qnumday":209,"qnumall":"[31089\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500076#WRM01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a person (details supplied) will be reinstated on the dentist medical card scheme without having to proceed through the tedious application process again considering that they were on the GMS scheme from 1982 to 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1611","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":544,"content":"<p>I welcome the news that some dentists are seeking reinstatement on the Dental Treatment Services Scheme (DTSS), which provides dental treatment for medical card holders aged 16 and over.<\/p><p>The HSE have advised that they are doing everything they can to expedite the processing of applications from dentists who wish to be reinstated on the DTSS.

A &euro;15m fund was recently announced so that groups can apply for funding to make improvements to their facilities.  Details of how to apply are available on my Department's website.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of groups in society who can face additional barriers to equal participation in community and civic life, the LGBTI+ community being one of those groups.  Since 2019, my Department has provided funding through the Dormant Accounts Fund to support LGBTI+ community organisations across the country.  The 2022 Dormant Accounts Action Plan was announced last November and included &euro;200,000 for supporting LGBTI+ community organisations. The main purpose of this funding is to help the organisations make the existing community infrastructures inclusive and welcoming to the LGBTI+ community and to provide pop-up LGBTI+ services in areas not currently serviced.  <\/p>  <p>  Following an application process, the funding is allocated to Local Authorities who engage with LGBTI+ organisations at local level to agree actions and ensure that they are implemented.  I understand that some organisations have included actions to set up pop-up facilities to provide information relevant to the LGBTI+ community. I do not currently have the detailed information requested, however my Department will forward this information to the Deputy within the coming days.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, the Scheme to Support National Organisations (SSNO) provides multi-annual funding towards core costs of national, community and voluntary organisations.  Two organisations with a direct focus on LGBTQI+ supports are being funded under the new iteration of the SSNO, Belong to Youth Services and LGBT Support and Advocacy Network Ireland.  In addition, there are other organisations funded under the SSNO programme, while not having a specific focus on LGBTQI+ supports, may provide related supports and advocacy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500078#WRO00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1563"}]
