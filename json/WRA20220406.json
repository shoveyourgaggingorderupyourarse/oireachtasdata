From the start of January to the end of December 2021, some 27,666 applications were received, representing a 69% increase over the same period in 2020 (16,293) and a 47% increase on 2019 (18,811), which itself represented an 11 year high in applications.  <\/p><p>My Department issued 16,275 employment permits in 2021, and processed a total of 17,968 applications which represents a significant volume of activity.

This plan is currently being implemented to tackle the current backlog, with both human resource interventions and systemic changes identified. <\/p><p>One of the actions in this plan to alleviate the significant backlog was to focus on processing Trusted Partner applications for Critical Skills Employment Permits (CSEPs).

The Department plans to maintain processing times for all CSEP applications at approximately 6 weeks for all of Q2, on the assumption that demand remains at current levels. <\/p><p>All flexible resources have now been redeployed to other permit types to ensure that the Department will continue to make progress in reducing these processing times in Q2.  However, more rapid progress will be delivered after the completion of the c. 3,000 one-off applications we are currently processing for the meat and horticulture sector, which should take approximately six weeks to clear, in addition to normal processing workload.  The Department expects to see a consistent strong fall in waiting times from mid-May, with waiting times considerably reduced by end Q2. <\/p><p>Since the implementation of the Action Plan, the Employment Permits section has made positive progress to reduce the current backlog reducing the number of applications awaiting processing from 11,181 in January 2021 to 8,773 at the end of March this year.

I can confirm that the scheme will be open to operators holding a road haulage operator licence. The Department is currently working to make the scheme operative. Details of how to apply, as well as the scheme terms and conditions, will be communicated to all licensed hauliers using the email address held on file in the Road Transport Operator Licensing unit in Loughrea. <\/p>  <p>  In deciding on this targeted, temporary scheme, the Government considered that the licensed haulage sector is a specific case for several reasons, primarily that the sector is of national strategic importance as a critical enabler of a functioning supply chain, bringing essential supplies into and around the State, supporting key infrastructure and enabling the maintenance of economic and social activity. While this is true for certain other operators also, fuel represents a greater overall proportion of overhead cost for hauliers than would be the case for other businesses who self-provide transport as part of their wider business. <\/p>  <p>  Given the rapid increase in fuel prices linked to the crisis in Ukraine, the haulage sector reported to the Government a serious risk of cessation of business among haulage companies that would have had significant implications for supply chains into the State, including for essential goods. <\/p>  <p>  You will be aware that on 9 March 2022, in recognition of rising fuel costs for all citizens and businesses, the Government reduced Excise duty by 20 cent per litre of petrol, 15 cent per litre of diesel and 2 cent in the excise duty charged on marked gas oil in order to reduce the cost of fuels. <\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance has written to the European Commission to ask what flexibilities might be available on an emergency basis to reduce the tax on fuel. Currently, however, the EU Energy Tax Directive limits the possibility of further reducing the tax on fuel. Specifically, the Directive requires a minimum tax of &euro;0.33 per litre and the measures already decided have reduced the tax on diesel to the minimum. <\/p>  <p>  In general, however, it should be noted that the causes of these fuel price pressures are not within the control of Government and are being directly influenced by external factors, including the Ukraine crisis. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has limited resources but through the Excise measure announced on 09 March, as well as the Licenced Haulage Emergency Support Scheme approved on 15 March 2022, it has responded to help to ease the impact of these price increases. However, we must accept that it will not be possible to insulate citizens and businesses from the full impact of these fuel price increases. In support with these sudden increased costs, the Government is seeking to cushion the shock of the rapid spike in fuel prices. While it remains to be seen how fuel prices evolve it is imperative that haulage and other businesses engage with their customers on the need for the prices for their products or services to reflect the increasing costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600083#WRB03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Projects","counter":56,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600083#WRB03800"},{"type":"question","counter":57,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[18556\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600083#WRB03900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the position regarding the second bridge and southern relief route for Newbridge, County Kildare; the recent progress on same; his plans to bring the project to fruition; the target date for opening; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1588","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":58,"content":"<p>The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.

I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport, nor decisions on fares. <\/p>  <p>  It is the National Transport Authority (NTA) that has the statutory responsibility for the regulation of fares in relation to public passenger transport services and also has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public transport services by way of public transport services contracts in respect of services that are socially necessary but commercially unviable.  The funding of those services comprises both the fares paid by passengers and the subvention payments from the Exchequer.  The main purpose of the subvention payment is to meet the gap between income from fares and the cost of operating services.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of public transport services is heavily dependent on passenger fare revenue as it normally contributes about 65% of the operational cost.  The remaining 35% of cost is covered by the PSO grant and the Department of Social Protection grant under the free travel scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  Prior to COVID-19, &euro;287 million of Exchequer funding was provided for PSO services in Budget 2020; however, since 2020, additional funding has been required to continue to address the significant COVID impacts on public transport provision.<\/p>  <p>  In 2022, I secured &euro;538m to support PSO services including over &euro;200m to address COVID expenses (i.e. loss of fare revenue, cleaning costs). Up to &euro;12m will be provided as ongoing support for the licensed bus sector; while, over &euro;15m has also been allocated to support Local Link regular service provision in rural Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is strongly committed to helping combat the rising cost-of-living being experienced throughout the country. In this context, a suite of new measures is being introduced by Government to help with this issue, including a 20% average fare reduction on all PSO services until the end of 2022. These discounted fares will benefit the hundreds of thousands of people across the country who use PSO public transport every day. &euro;54m in Exchequer funding has been secured to allow for the introduction of these discounted fares.<\/p>  <p>  Also, in recognition of the importance of incentivising young people to use public transport, as part of Budget 2022 I secured &euro;25m of funding to provide for the introduction of a young adult card (YAC) which will allow any person nationwide who is between 19 and 23 years old, to avail of an entitlement for discounted travel costs, and to increase the level of discount over and above the current student discount to an average of discount of 50% across all services, including city, intercity and rural services. It is envisaged that the discount will initially be made available on PSO services, and then broadened to include commercial operators at a later date.

Officials in my Department and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications are evaluating the potential for such a proposal.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to tax generally, the trading profits of companies in Ireland are typically taxed at the standard Corporation Tax rate of 12.5%. Some of the main features of the current regime are its simplicity and that it applies to a broad base. Changing this rate (or imposing additional levies on certain sectors) could have unforeseen consequences. However, on a straightforward mathematical basis and on the assumption that the proposed tax would apply to the taxable profits of all energy companies, including companies that are not currently experiencing additional profits, the yield could be in the region of &euro;60 million. This is estimated based on taxable profit levels in 2020 (the most recent year for which tax returns have been filed) and does not provide for the impact of any potential behavioural changes.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to energy policy, which is the remit of my colleague Minister Ryan, a well-functioning EU-electricity market remains crucial for the integration of our Internal Energy Market and for providing investment signals for the integration of new renewables, which are essential to ultimately break our dependence on fossil fuels.  The best long-term approach for Ireland to insulate consumers from volatility on international wholesale energy markets is to invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy. Cutting our dependence on fossil fuels and generating power from our own renewable sources will ensure a cleaner, cheaper energy future in the long term. Electricity and gas retail markets in Ireland operate within a European regulatory regime wherein electricity and gas markets are commercial, liberalised, and competitive. Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is solely a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU).<\/p>  <p>  The Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) is Ireland&rsquo;s flagship policy to deliver on the Government&rsquo;s target of up to 80% renewable electricity by the end of the decade. Electricity technologies now compete through regular auctions under the RESS as well as through other routes to market such as corporate power purchase agreements. The RESS contains strong consumer protection measures with wholesale market revenues above the auction price returned to electricity consumers through the Public Service Obligation Levy. Renewable energy sources such as wind and solar generation reduce electricity consumer costs by lowering wholesale electricity prices during periods when they are generating power, highlighting the need to accelerate energy system decarbonisation to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.<\/p>  <p>  The war in Ukraine has dramatically concentrated EU efforts to address European dependence on Russian oil and gas through proposed new measures to diversify fossil fuel imports, enhance security of supply, and accelerate energy system decarbonisation to remove regional reliance on fossil fuels as set out in the recent RePowerEU communication. In this regard, the European Commission is working closely with Member States to protect the resilience of Europe&rsquo;s gas security of supply through solidarity measures.  Both the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the EU have stressed that the current situation further strengthens collective resolve to accelerate the clean energy transition, in line with the European Green Deal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600084#WRC05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment","counter":137,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600085#WRD00200"},{"type":"question","counter":138,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[18858\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600085#WRD00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the persons who were in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment in 2020 and 2021 may still have a tax liability pending; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":139,"content":"<p>The Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) was a social welfare payment for workers (employees and self-employed) who were out of work due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Correspondence on this issue has been received in my Department and I also met with the campaign in February of this year to discuss their work. <\/p>  <p>  In the context of the civil and public service, there are two main concerns in considering a move to a four day week - the cost to the taxpayer and ensuring the continuity of services to the public.<\/p>  <p>  There are potentially significant costs associated with a move to a four day week in the public service. Significant additional recruitment would be required in order to ensure the continued delivery of essential public services, in particular in terms of frontline and emergency public services that must be available on a seven day basis. <\/p>  <p>  A comprehensive analysis of the potential costs involved would involve a high degree of complexity, as it would encompass approximately 365,000 public servants in over 300 organisations. At a very high level, paying people for four days but providing services to the citizen over five and in some cases seven days would add at least a fifth to the current pay bill of approximately &euro;21.9bn. That equates to an extra &euro;4.4bn that would have to be found to deliver the same level of services. This is likely a conservative estimate, given the premiums associated with overtime and agency staffing, which would likely be required.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, maintaining the accessibility of services to citizens would be a huge challenge. For example, would there be sufficient time in four days to teach our children properly? What would happen to childcare costs if the public service moved but parts of the private sector did not? And how would the emergency services - hospitals, fire brigades, lifeguards and the Garda&iacute; - operate on a four day week? <\/p>  <p>  These are essential public services, the importance of which has been underlined by the Covid-19 pandemic. The wider implications of this proposal also need to be carefully considered for the entire labour force, not just the public service. Indeed any movement by the public service in isolation could have serious consequences for, in particular, small to medium businesses already struggling in the face of Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  I would also like to make the point that the State is already a good employer that offers considerable flexibility to staff through the availability of, amongst other things, work sharing, flexible working hours, shorter working years, career breaks and now remote working. As the Deputy will be aware, embedding a framework for 'blended working' is currently a key priority for my Department, the impact of which will not be known for some time. <\/p>  <p>  In my role as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform I have to ensure that quality public services are delivered to the Irish people in a manner that delivers value for money to the Irish taxpayer. <\/p>  <p>  With this in mind, and in light of the large potential costs and disruption to critical services I do not believe that it is the right time to consider a transition to a four day week.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600085#WRD01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Procurement Contracts","counter":155,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600085#WRD02000"},{"type":"question","counter":156,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[18859\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600085#WRD02100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":" if his attention has been drawn to procurement procedures at an organisation (details supplied); if any appropriate measures have been taken by the organisation to prevent, identify and remedy conflicts of interest in the conduct of a procurement procedure relating to the services provided to the board by another organisation; if assurances will be given that the formal process relating to tenders in the &euro;25,000 European Union thresholds have been complied with in respect of this organisation and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":157,"content":"<p>Responsibility for ensuring compliance with all national and EU procurement rules and procedures rests with contracting or purchasing Departments and public agencies.<\/p><p>Screen Ireland are a body under the remit of the Department of Tourism, Culture,  Arts, Gaeltacht , Sport and Media. <\/p><p>Accordingly my Department has no role in this matter. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600085#WRD02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"question","counter":159,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[18860\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600085#WRD02400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if his attention has been drawn to procurement procedures at an organisation (details supplied); if appropriate measures have been taken by the organisation to prevent, identify and remedy conflicts of interest in the conduct of a procurement procedure relating to the services provided by another organisation; if assurances will be given that the formal process relating to tenders in the &euro;25,000 European Union thresholds have been complied with in respect of this organisation and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":160,"content":"<p>Responsibility for ensuring compliance with all national and EU procurement rules and procedures rests with contracting or purchasing Departments and public agencies.<\/p><p>Screen Ireland are a body under the remit of the Department of Tourism, Culture,  Arts, Gaeltacht , Sport and Media. <\/p><p>Accordingly, my Department has no role in this matter. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600085#WRD02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Development Projects","counter":161,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600085#WRD02600"},{"type":"question","counter":162,"qnumday":54,"qnumall":"[18863\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600085#WRD02700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if a site (details supplied) will be handed over to a community enhancement group; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1500","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":163,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Commissioners of Public Works that the site in question is adjoining an operational Garda station and is not surplus to requirements.

The preferred approach is to focus on greater reuse of previously developed brownfield land and infill sites and the development of sites in locations that are better serviced by existing facilities and public transport. The NPF indicates that there is a need for increased densities in urban areas, while also acknowledging the need for a proportionate and tailored approach, especially in the context of regional cities and towns.  <\/p>  <p>   This means that it is necessary to adapt the scale, design and layout of new development according to the type of settlement in which it is located, and its proximity to centres and public transport services. Statutory &lsquo;Section 28&rsquo; ministerial guidelines for planning authorities on Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areas (the &lsquo;Sustainable Residential Development Guidelines&rsquo;) were last issued in 2009, having been first introduced in 1999.

Submissions made during the public consultation period will be reviewed and where appropriate and necessary, amendments will be made to the published Draft. Thereafter, the draft guidelines will be submitted to the Minister for approval and the final Guidelines will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended).  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600086#WRE01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"question","counter":204,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[18494\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600086#WRE01600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the status of the 40 new recruits approved by him for An Bord Plean&aacute;la; when he expects them to be in situ; the expected reduction in planning delays   anticipated arising from the recruitment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1510","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":205,"content":"<p>In October 2021, my Department approved the 2021-2022 An Bord Plean&aacute;la (the Board) Workforce Plan which provides for an additional 24 posts across a range of technical and administrative grades including the setting up  of a new Marine and Climate Unit to implement the role assigned to the Board under the Maritime Area Planning Act 2021 and  associated projects under the Climate Action Plan 2021.

Section 24(3) of the Education Act 1998 provides for the suspension and dismissal of teachers and principals by employers. The Minister for Education has no role in such matters.<\/p>  <p>  Circular 48\/2018 sets out agreed procedures between Employers and Unions to be used in the case of individual disciplinary cases but the Department is not involved in such procedures and is not a party to any individual process. The only role for the Minister of Education in the circular is in nominating people to the list of independent chairs for use in appeals under the procedures. Staff of my Department have no role in the operation of procedures under Circular 48\/2018 and so the question of training for them does not arise.<\/p>  <p>  While no procedures can be definitive about the range of circumstances which might give rise to the initiation of disciplinary procedures in general these are likely to be related to misconduct, a threat to the health and safety of students and\/or sustained failure to perform adequately the professional duties and responsibilities expected of a teacher. The procedures provide for two separate and independent strands which should be utilised in appropriate circumstances, namely (i) procedure relating to professional competence issues and (ii)  Procedure relating to work, conduct and matters other than professional competence.<\/p>  <p>  The procedures are designed to deal solely with issues of employment and supersede all prior existing disciplinary procedures in existence save for those provided in law. The actual operation of the procedures including any investigation is a matter for the employer. The circular does set out that individuals may be placed on administrative leave while an investigation is carried, where the circumstances warrant, and that any process should to comply with the general principles of natural justice.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of cases where some stages of the process may be bypassed, Circular 48\/2018 clearly sets out the circumstances and some examples of &ldquo;gross misconduct for which any or each of Stage 1 to 3 of the disciplinary procedure may not apply depending on the gravity of the alleged offence&rdquo;. It is entirely a matter for the employer in question to decide if such circumstances exist to warrant proceeding on that basis. Teachers maintain an option of appeal under the procedures, including, in the case of a sanction being imposed under stage 4 of the procedure to a disciplinary appeal panel chaired by an independent person from the list of nominated chairs.<\/p>  <p>  As outlined in Department Circular 48\/2018 all matters relating to the disciplinary procedure are strictly confidential to the parties and their representatives. These procedures are without prejudice to the right of a teacher to have recourse to the law to protect his\/her employment. In the circumstances and as my Department is not involved in individual cases, the number of times stages under the procedures have been invoked by employers is not known.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the matter of the internal audit for the ETB sector, the primary purpose of the Internal Audit Unit for the ETBs is to provide assurance to the Audit Committee of the ETB that the system of internal control as implemented by executive management is adequate and operates effectively.

It is also fair to employees and ensures that they receive an appropriate and predictable level of compensation if they are unable to work due to illness or injury.   <\/p>  <p>  The length of coverage is expected to increase over time, eventually providing for an entitlement to up to 10 working days or two weeks per year in the fourth year of the scheme&rsquo;s operation.  <\/p>  <p>  For businesses who genuinely cannot afford to pay, included in the sick pay proposals is an &lsquo;inability to pay&rsquo; provision. This would allow the Labour Court to grant an exemption to a business from their obligations under this legislation, for a period of not less than 3 months and not more than 12 months. There is a similar provision in the National Minimum Wage Act 2000. It would only be granted where there is a real risk to business sustainability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600090#WRJ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Children in Care","counter":424,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600090#WRJ00800"},{"type":"question","counter":425,"qnumday":149,"qnumall":"[18516\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600090#WRJ00900","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"if his attention has been drawn to a situation in Youghal, County Cork (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1452","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":426,"content":"<p>The company in question provides therapeutic and individualised residential care to young people in the care of the State and to adults with intellectual disabilities. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, remain engaged in a tendering process with the provider and as such, the Deputy will appreciate that Tusla is not in a position to share detailed information. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that Tusla communicated the initial results of the tender process to applicants on 24th March, following a careful evaluation against the specifications outlined in the pre-published tender criteria.

These reforms are on foot of a report from an Expert Group established in 2019, which comprised national and international experts, and was independently chaired by Michael Scanlan. Its report, Partnership for the Public Good, proposes a new approach to State funding of the sector in future. Its recommendations include a new additional funding stream for the sector, Core Funding, to support quality of provision, improved pay and conditions for staff, management of parental fees and sustainability of services<\/p><p>Under the new funding stream, in return for a commitment that fees to parents will not increase, providers will be supported in meeting their operating costs, including increased costs related to improved quality measures which includes staff costs. Core Funding will also contribute to cost increases related to non-staff costs (for example, utilities, rent).<\/p><p>Core Funding is equivalent to an increase of <i>at least <\/i>9.5% in funding for ECCE services not lead by a Graduate Lead Educator. At a minimum, for every ECCE child &euro;78.75 per week will be available from ECCE and Core Funding, compared to &euro;69 in ECCE standard capitation only. As Core Funding is paid in respect of places rather than children, effectively this could mean a greater &lsquo;per child&rsquo; marginal increase if the service has unfilled capacity. For example, with an ECCE occupancy of 9 children per staff member, Core Funding and ECCE together will be equivalent to weekly per child capitation of &euro;80.92.<\/p><p>Core Funding replaces the ECCE Higher Capitation payment which pays a higher capitation rate of &euro;80.25 for all children attending ECCE classes with a graduate ECCE room lead.  Core Funding includes a new a graduate premium which will be to be paid to services with graduate room leads for all early learning and care age groups.<\/p><p>The overwhelming majority of ECCE-services with graduate Lead Educators will benefit substantially.  While the approach of providing funding for graduate Lead Educators is different, the increased base rate funding plus payment based on capacity rather than attendance means that most services currently in receipt of higher capitation will see significant benefits from Core Funding.<\/p><p><i>No service will lose out with Core Funding<\/i><\/p><p>Core funding is largely contingent on an employment regulation order, ERO, being agreed by the joint labour committee, JLC, for the sector. If agreed, an ERO will establish minimum rates of pay and conditions for all workers and it is a matter for the JLC to determine whether different rates should apply for different roles and qualification levels of staff. A JLC was established this year and has been meeting regularly in recent months.<\/p><p>In addition, my Department will shortly appoint a consultant to undertake a 12 month review of ECCE which will consider any enhancements that can be made based on international evidence and experience to date.

The 2016 HEA National Review of Gender Equality in Irish Higher Education Institutions and the Gender Action Plan 2018-2020 have been developed by the Higher Education Authority to inform the implementation of a gender equality framework in Irish higher education. <\/p>  <p>  As part of this framework, the HEA Centre of Excellence for Gender Equality was established in June 2019, evolving into the HEA Centre of Excellence for Equality, Diversity &amp;amp; Inclusion in August 2020. In addition to the work in the broad area of EDI, the Centre oversees a number of initiatives in relation to gender equality in higher education, including the Senior Academic Leadership Initiative to award 45 professorships to address gender-underrepresentation, Gender Equality Enhancement Fund, the annual publication of staff data by gender, and the roll out of the Athena SWAN Charter. Certification under the latter Charter is now a funding requirement of the major research funders in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I have recently announced a review of gender equality in Irish higher education institutions. This Review will assess the progress made since the first review in 2016. The final report will include an overview of gender equality in Irish Higher Education, focusing on what has worked well, what has not, and what the next steps should be. It is expected to be published in late 2022.<\/p>  <p>  The new Research and Innovation Strategy will continue this progress and we will expand its remit to reflect the wider inclusion agenda, as articulated in the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science&rsquo;s 2021-2023 Statement of Strategy. My ambition is that over the course of the period covered by the strategy, we will bear witness to a more diverse research community that better reflects the society in which we live, in addition to greater integration of equality, diversity and inclusion issues into research activity itself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600090#WRJ03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":458,"content":"<p>Question No. 162 answered with Question No. 155.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education Policy","counter":459,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600090#WRJ04600"},{"type":"question","counter":460,"qnumday":163,"qnumall":"[18686\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600090#WRJ04700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the estimated increase in Exchequer spending that would be required to bring Ireland in line with the OECD average for spending on higher education as a share of GDP; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":461,"content":"<p>There are no officially published statistics for 2022 which provide the full information covering expenditure on higher education as a proportion of national income of the type requested by the Deputy.  It is therefore not possible to definitively calculate the costs sought.<\/p>  <p>  For International comparisons I can advise that the OECD, as part of its Education at a Glance publication, provides an assessment of expenditure on tertiary education as a proportion of GDP. In Ireland this includes further and higher education. Expenditure covers not just government expenditure but also expenditure by households; and expenditure from international and private sources. For Ireland, the most recent OECD report based on financial data for 2018 suggests tertiary education expenditure represented 0.9% of GDP, compared to an OECD average of 1.4%.  However, in reality this data does not provide a meaningful comparative analysis, given that GDP is not regarded as a good measure of the size of the domestic economy in Ireland.  This is borne out by the fact that average figures for expenditure per student at tertiary level were slightly above the OECD average.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of a more meaningful and recent comparison it is possible to give a general approximation of GDP, GNI and modified GNI proportions for the publicly funded Higher Education system, comprising funding investment by my Department towards grant funding and student support expenditure. Based on the Central Statistics Office's assessment of the size of the economy in 2020 and expenditure on higher education via my Department for that year, the proportion of national income on higher education and student support was in the order of:<\/p>  <p>  - Around 0.6% as a proportion of GDP;<\/p>  <p>  - Around 0.8% as a proportion of GNI.<\/p>  <p>  - Around 1.1% as a proportion of modified GNI, which is the measure which most accurately represents the size of the Irish economy.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to say that public investment in higher education through my Departments allocation is on an upward trend, and now stands at &euro;2.4 billion.

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na plays a vital role in enforcing road traffic law and in making our roads safer for all road users, including vulnerable road users.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner is responsible by law for the management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including personnel matters, deployment of resources and the provision of IT infrastructure. As Minister, I have no responsibility for these matters. <\/p>  <p>  As regards the establishment of a dedicated online portal for the submission of video evidence of potential violations of road traffic legislation, the Deputy may be aware that the current Traffic Watch facility allows for members of the public to report driver behaviour to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Matters reported via this facility are forwarded to the relevant District Office for investigation. Similarly, citizens may make complaints to any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or through the Garda website.<\/p>  <p>  Under Action 29 of the Road Safety Strategy, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will explore the potential of an online portal for road users to upload footage of road traffic offences which could assist in prosecution. This action is due to be completed by Q4 of this year.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, there are strict standards in legislation relating to photographic evidence obtained by Garda&iacute;. While An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has confirmed that private dash cam footage may be used during a prosecution, its use must be in accordance with best evidential practices and entails ensuring structures exist around continuity of evidence.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Transport has advised that any decision to allow film by members of the public to be used in evidence in road traffic cases would raise questions of reliability of, and possible tampering with, the apparatus used, as well as potential privacy issues. It might also raise questions about why Garda apparatus was held to a standard not required of private individuals, if both were ultimately to be treated as reliable evidence. <\/p>  <p>  Road traffic enforcement remains a core policing function of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Garda National Roads Policing Bureau ensures a consistent approach to road safety and enforcement of road traffic legislation across the country. This is achieved through coordination of enforcement measures and development of policy based on research and analysis of statistics and by engaging in campaigns in partnership with other State Agencies, notably the Road Safety Authority.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to emphasise that road traffic legislation is enforced as part of the day-to-day duties of all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in addition to the employment of specific enforcement operations.<\/p>  <p>  I would of course encourage any member of the public to report any incidents of dangerous driving directly to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600091#WRK05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":531,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600092#WRL00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospice Services","counter":530,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600092#WRL00200"},{"type":"question","counter":531,"qnumday":187,"qnumall":"[18536\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600092#WRL00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the estimated cost of delivering 30 new public palliative care beds; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1588","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":532,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, to date specialist palliative care inpatient units have been constructed with funding raised by local voluntary organisations, while the HSE provides fit-out costs.<\/p>  <p>  Capital costs for a specialist palliative care unit will vary dependent on a number of factors including location, number of beds and levels of additional services provided.

Ireland, through my Department and the Health Products Regulatory Authority, continues to contribute to these efforts at a European level to consider initiatives to minimise the risk and disruption to patient safety and care, and the impact on healthcare professionals, caused by medicine shortages.<\/p><p>In the case of medicines used most often in Ireland, there are typically multiple brands and\/or generic medicines available from a range of sources. In the event that supply issues arise for individual medicines, different options, including alternative brands or generic medicines, should be made available to ensure continuity of treatment. If the patient has concerns, they should discuss their treatment and alternative options with their doctor, pharmacist or other healthcare professional. It is important to note that the medical decision to prescribe or not prescribe any treatment for an individual patient is strictly a decision for the treating clinician, in consultation with their patient. I have no role in this clinical decision-making process. I do expect that pharmacies would ensure the equitable supply of medicines to their customers, within their available stock.<\/p><p>The Government recognises that menopause is a key health issue for women in Ireland today, and work is underway by the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce to drive progress in this area.
