Mr. Speaker, Taoiseach, dear Senators and Members of the Parliament, dear people of Ireland, this night our territory was again hit by Russian missiles.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">President Zelenskyy:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It was done cunningly and it hit civilian infrastructure.  The new fuel storage depot was hit.  This is viewed by Russia as a target.  This is their attribute.  They are destroying things that are sustaining livelihoods to people.  They are hitting places where we store fuel, food storage depots, agricultural equipment and fields.  They are putting mines into the fields.  They have also blocked all of our seaports, together with the vessels that already had agricultural cargos for export.  Why are they doing this?  Because for them, hunger is also a weapon &mdash; a weapon against us ordinary people as an instrument of domination.  Ukraine is one of the leading food-supplying countries in the world.  This is not just about the deficit and the threat of hunger for more than dozens of countries, Asia and Africa; it is about even more because there will be a shortage of food and the prices will go up.  This is reality for millions of people who are hungry.  It will be more difficult for them to feed their families, especially in north Africa.<\/p><p>They are undermining our seeding time, they are destroying our infrastructure and they are deliberately provoking the food crisis.  What will happen as the result of this crisis?  At the least, there will be political turbulence.  At a maximum, there will be binges of violence and new refugees looking to save their lives.  Russia is using this hunger weapon.<\/p><p>The worst thing is the city of Mariupol.  This city of 500,000 inhabitants was put under siege and Russia has blocked access from the soil and from the sea.  They are blocking the humanitarian cargo.  They are not allowing anything to come through, neither water nor medication.  While it was snowing, people could melt the snow to get water.  Now they do not have even that.<\/p><p>They are bombing 24-7.  There are air strikes and bombings in Mariupol.  There is no single house left intact in a city of half a million.  None.  The dead and killed were simply buried in the yards of the condominiums.  In many cases, they could not even do that: the bodies were just left there lying on the streets and in the remnants of the buildings and basements.  We do not know how many citizens of Mariupol have been killed by Russia, but we know for sure this was part of general occupation tactics.  They have done the same or they have attempted to do the same with the cities of Chernihiv, Sumy, Okhtyrka, Kharkiv, Izyum, Volnovakha and many other Ukrainian cities.  Maybe you have not heard those geographic names yet but this is about millions of people that Russia has been continually trying to destroy.<\/p><p>When you hear these things, it may seem that this is not possible.  It may seem that none in the present-day world would dare to do that, but these are real facts.  The fact is that Mariupol citizens were drawing the maps of how to find the bodies of the dead who were buried in their yards.  The fact is that Russian occupants were killing people on the roads when they were trying to escape.  They blocked cities.  Until today on the Ukrainian highways we have hundreds of shot in burned cars.  The fact is that Russian soldiers were not even trying to take these bodies out of the streets.  While Bucha and Irpin were under occupation, these dead bodies were simply lying on the streets, on the sideways, in the yards of the houses, anywhere.  The fact is that in the 42 days of the all-out Russian war, at least 167 children have been killed in Ukraine.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">President Zelenskyy:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We do not yet know all the atrocities of Mariupol and the victims in all the areas of Ukraine where the fighting is still going on.  The fact is that, as a result of Russian shelling, 927 educational institutions and 258 hospitals were damaged.  The Russians even shot at 78 ambulances.  They were targeting even churches and shelters where they knew for sure there was nobody but women and children.  This is a fact.<\/p><p>The country that is doing this does not deserve to be in the circle of civilised countries.  It should be held responsible for everything it has done on Ukrainian soil.  The Russians have come to Ukraine as a colonising army.  Their state protagonists and their politicians are not even concealing what they want.  In the 21st century, they are looking at their country as a colonial empire which allegedly has the right to subdue neighbouring people, destroy the foundations of their independent life and destroy their identity, everything that makes us Ukrainians.  Russian soldiers were deliberately looking for and killing teachers in the occupied districts.  They are abducting local government leaders and they are killing community leaders.  Together with the Russian army, there were special groups coming in who were trying to destroy any political opposition.<\/p><p>Now, when we are hearing new rhetoric about the sanctions against the Russian opposition, I cannot tolerate any indecisiveness after everything we have gone through in Ukraine and after everything that Russian troops have done.  Today, when the world knows about the crimes against our people, we still have to convince even some European companies to abandon the Russian market.  We still have to convince foreign politicians that we need to cut any ties of Russian banks with the global financial system.  We still have to convince Europe that Russian oil cannot feed the Russian military machine with new sources of funding.<\/p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, the people of Ireland have been supporting good and have been supporting Ukraine since the very first days.  This is a fact.  They did not doubt starting to help us; they began doing this right away.  Although Ireland is a neutral country, it has not remained neutral to the disaster and to the mishaps that Russia has brought to Ukraine.  I am grateful to every citizen of Ireland.  Thank you for supporting sanctions against Russia, thank you for the humanitarian and financial support extended to our country and thank you for your care of our Ukrainian people who found shelter on your land.  Think about the fact that, as of today, 10 million Ukrainians have been left without shelter by Russia.  They had to leave their native cities because of this war.  This is something we cannot come to grips with.  It means that Russia has not yet abandoned its plans.  It is still looking to subdue and occupy all the Ukrainian people.<\/p><p>We want you to help us to make sure that Russia will start looking for peace and leave us alone.  I ask you to show more leadership in our anti-war coalition.  I ask you to convince EU partners to introduce even more rigid sanctions against Russia that would really make sure that the Russian war machine will stop.  We have to put an end to trading with Russia.  We have to cut the ties of Russian banks to the global system and cut the sources of their income from oil that they use for their weapons and for killing.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">President Zelenskyy:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There are mechanisms through which this can be done.  The only thing we are lacking is a principled approach from some political and business leaders who still think war and war crimes are not as horrific as financial losses.  I am sure Ireland's leadership can make a difference and change this.  I am sure that the whole of Europe will be able to stop this war and bring peace and stability to the east of Europe.  We cannot delay any longer.  The longer Russia's aggression continues, the worse the consequences will be not only for our Continent, but for neighbouring regions.  <br\/><br\/>I say to Members and to the people of Ireland that our principled approach and courage have already turned a new page in the relationship between Ukraine and Ireland.  Our mutual understanding and mutual respect is already at a level whereby it is only a question of time before we can start living in a common European home.  Thank you for Ireland's support for the accelerated procedure to provide membership of the EU to Ukraine.  With your support, the process will be even faster and beneficial to both our nations.  We need to start thinking about the restoration of our country after the war.  We are inviting leading countries of the world to participate in rebuilding and restoring Ukraine.  Of course, Ireland is always welcome to participate, for example, in Kherson Oblast.  Ireland is known for its skill in valueing lives, its community development experience and its economic potential.  Let us bring our efforts together and show that, jointly, Ukraine and Ireland can do much more than the biggest country in the world was trying to destroy.  I am grateful to Ireland.  <i>Slava Ukraini<\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#B00200","nonspeaker":"H.E.

Last Tuesday at the Conference of Speakers of the European Union Parliaments in Ljubljana I called upon the 450 members of the Duma to shoulder their responsibility.  The law of averages suggests that among the 450 members of that Parliament there must be people who can see through the lies, fake news, propaganda and manipulation.  They must now find their courage - courage that the Ukrainian people demonstrate daily.  They must speak up, speak out, take their courage and reject the leadership they currently have.<\/p><p>There are 143 million Russian people populating that country.  Again, the law of averages tells us that many of those people must be fine, decent and honourable people who have a respect for human rights.  President Zelenskyy, your people are being asked to show courage that goes beyond the bounds of human endurance.  Please God, the people of Russia will now find their courage to also reject what is being done wrongly and devastatingly in their name.<\/p><p>In conclusion, Mr. President, thank you for honouring us and joining us today.

We thank President Zelenskyy for his heartfelt, honest, clear and, indeed, historic address to our Parliament this morning.  The strength of his commitment and that of the people of Ukraine to his country and to restoring its place as a free, safe, democratic and an independent country within the community of nations is both humbling and uplifting.<\/p> <p>We heard grave testimony from President Zelenskyy this morning and we have seen ourselves the most shocking and harrowing of images from Bucha, from Irpin, from Mariupol and from across Ukraine.  Russia will have to live with the shame and ignominy of what it has done in Ukraine for generations.  Those responsible will be held to account.   We are with Ukraine and I am certain that, in the end, Ukraine will prevail.<\/p> <p>We are a militarily neutral country.  However, we are not politically or morally neutral in the face of war crimes.  Quite the opposite.  Our position is informed by the principles that drive our foreign policy &ndash; support for international human rights, for humanitarian law and for a rules-based international order.  We are not neutral when Russia disregards all of these principles.  We are with Ukraine.<\/p> <p>Ukraine&rsquo;s political, economic and humanitarian needs are now manifold and pressing.  Our efforts, as a friend and as a partner of Ukraine, are aimed at using all the levers at our disposal to bring a just end to this war - applying international pressure on Russia, pursuing accountability for violations of international law and meeting the humanitarian needs of those caught now in the midst of this terrible and immoral war.<\/p> <p>Thousands of people have been killed.  Millions have been driven from their homes.  This is a humanitarian crisis the likes of which Europe has not seen since the dark years of the Second World War.   This war touches us all.  That is why Ireland is supporting further European Union sanctions at European level.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">The Taoiseach:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=693\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=693&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMartin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We need a sanctions regime that brings it home to Putin and his regime that he will not, he cannot, succeed.  We want the strongest possible sanctions against the Russian Federation and we will pursue those.<\/p><p>That is why we support the establishment of a solidarity trust fund for Ukraine, agreed by European Union leaders when we met in Brussels on 24 March, to support the Government of Ukraine now, and when the war is over to support reconstruction.<\/p><p>That is why I welcome and support Ukraine's application for EU membership.  I reiterate our support for that application this morning in this House.  It is the democratic right of Ukraine and the people of Ukraine to decide your political orientation.  You have chosen to apply for European Union membership.<\/p><p>We know that EU enlargement has been a force for stabilisation and democratisation in the European Union&rsquo;s neighbourhood.  It is in the European Union&rsquo;s strategic interest.  It is in Ukraine&rsquo;s interest.  As I said to you, President Zelenskyy, when we spoke on 16 March, I will continue to support Ukraine&rsquo;s case.  That is why also we have committed &euro;20 million in direct humanitarian funding, delivered through proven international agencies active on the ground and we will do more.  This is to meet the urgent needs of those in need in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries - including shelter, medical care, health, water and sanitation.<\/p><p>As well as financial support, through a collaborative effort, we are in the process of delivering medical equipment, including ambulances, ultrasound machines, mobile X-ray machines, ventilators, and incubators.  On 26 and 28 March, two despatches of urgently required medical equipment left Ireland and more will follow.  That is why Ireland has contributed our full share to the European peace facility&rsquo;s &euro;1 billion military assistance package for Ukraine.  We have also supplied provisions and body armour to the Ukrainian military.  We will also continue to support any avenue that can lead to an immediate ceasefire.<\/p><p>In light of what is being revealed in the areas from which Russian troops have withdrawn, that task will now be even more difficult.  I therefore especially commend your commitment, President Zelenskyy, to continuing to try, despite the enormous challenges you face.  Please know that we are with you in that task, and that we stand ready to contribute to and to support any initiative that can lead to a just peace for the people of Ukraine.<\/p><p>I know that the people of Mariupol cannot wait for talks to conclude.  Their needs are too urgent.  We need to see genuine humanitarian corridors opened and implemented.  Ireland, along with our partners, will continue to support any sincere efforts at the United Nations to ensure safe and unhindered access for humanitarian assistance.<\/p><p>Thousands of Ukrainians have arrived in Ireland since the start of the conflict.  A Cheann Comhairle, if I may, I address these words to them.  I know that the ambassador of Ukraine, H.E. Ms Larysa Gerasko, is here in the Gallery for today&rsquo;s debate.  To those who have arrived here from Ukraine, I hope you find in Ireland safe harbour and friendship for as long as you need it.  Most of you, I know, look forward to the day when you can return to a peaceful and free Ukraine, to the family and friends you have left behind.  That day will come.  In the meantime, our home is your home.<\/p><p>The war in Ukraine has sparked a crisis the likes of which we have not seen in Europe for decades.  It is no surprise to me that the Irish people have stood up to be counted in an unprecedented way in response.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">The Taoiseach:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=693\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=693&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMartin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Over 18,000 Ukrainian people have arrived in Ireland.

New arrivals are also being registered to ensure that they can access income supports as needed.  The heartfelt response of people across Ireland is clear in the whole range of initiatives at community level.  I would like to thank all of the people who have opened their hearts and, in some cases, their homes to people from Ukraine.  <br\/><br\/>President Zelenskyy, when you addressed the European Parliament you said, &quot;life will win over death, and light will win over darkness&quot;.

As a country, we are heartbroken watching the scenes we see on television every night.  We are heartbroken to see what the people of Ukraine have had to endure for 42 days.

The words he spoke then are just as relevant today.  He stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tAnd no nation, large or small, can be indifferent to the fate of others, near or far.

It is in that spirit that the Irish people have opened and will open their doors to provide sanctuary and shelter for women and children in particular fleeing conflict while their men stay at home.  It is going to be difficult and challenging beyond compare, which we all know, but we are committed to this work.<\/p> <p>I will quote one of the other leaders who has spoken here, former Chancellor Kohl of Germany.  In addressing this House he said we are \"European by conviction\" and that is true.  It is our conviction as a small State and nation that allows us to strengthen when we work in co-operation and collaboration with European colleagues.  It is appropriate today to quote two lines from the preamble of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which governs this relationship.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Eamon Ryan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2028\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2028&amp;amp;pid=EamonRyanGP&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It states that the signatories are:<\/p><blockquote>\tINTENDING to confirm the solidarity which binds Europe and the overseas countries and desiring to ensure the development of their prosperity, in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, [and]<br \/><br \/>RESOLVED by thus pooling their resources to preserve and strengthen peace and liberty, and calling upon the other peoples of Europe who share their ideal to join in their efforts... <\/blockquote><p>We heard today that just such a call has come from the people of a European nation to be part of those efforts.

It should not be constrained.  It will be stronger when we spread those democratic ideals.<br\/><br\/>I will quote one last person, Nelson Mandela, who spoke here so eloquently after he had reached and achieved his freedom.  He said: &quot;Nothing can stop the evolution of humanity towards the condition of greater and ever-expanding freedom&quot;.  He went on to say: &quot;We ask that you stay the course with us, we need your support for the democratic perspectives that we represent.&quot;  On that call for support for democratic systems, our European democratic system is absolutely founded in realising that it requires us to follow the rule of law, with all the conflicts, contradictions, complexities and compromises that sometimes involves.  That is what we are standing up here for today and what we need to do.  It may take time.  We have to answer what Nelson Mandela called for us to do - to be willing to stay the course in the face of other challenges that it will present, as we stop the use of those fossil fuels and provide our homes, schools, healthcare and other social services.  Staying the course will be difficult, but I expect this House and our people are up for that challenge, one of the greatest of our time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#J00700","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Uachtar&aacute;n Zelenskyy as ucht a &oacute;r&aacute;id ar maidin.

I want to pay them a particular commendation for their work in these very trying times.<\/p> <p>We have heard directly from President Zelenskyy, in the rawest, most harrowing and heartbreaking of terms, testimony of the vicious war crimes committed by the Russian military in Ukraine.  We have been set a challenge.  Innocent civilians have been executed with their arms tied behind their backs.  There have been horrific accounts of rape and torture and the brutalisation by the powerful of vulnerable ordinary citizens in their war-torn country.  These are crime against the Ukrainian people and these are crimes against humanity.  Russia must be held accountable for its barbarism, and justice must be done.  These human rights violations and grave breaches of the Geneva Convention demand investigation by the International Criminal Court and prosecutions to follow.  The truth is that Russia has turned its back on dialogue and peace.  For 42 days and nights, it has chosen war.  It has chosen brutality.  It has chosen the violation of international law.  Russia has closed the door on dialogue and through its criminal actions it has thus far rejected avenues for diplomacy.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Mary Lou McDonald:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2298\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2298&amp;amp;pid=MaryLouMcDonald&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Far from demonstrating a willingness to engage in peace negotiations, Russia has escalated its ferocious violence through the indiscriminate targeting of civilians.<\/p><p>All the while, however, the Russian Embassy in Ireland and Ambassador Yury Filatov have acted as unwavering and unapologetic propagandists for his country's illegal invasion of Ukraine.  Yesterday, in the face of evidence of Russian war crimes in Bucha and other areas surrounding Kyiv, the embassy and the ambassador claimed that this evidence was fabricated. They described it as another stage of the disinformation war against Russia.  This shameful response demonstrates the depths to which the Putin regime will stoop to justify the savagery of Russia's military aggression.  The Russian ambassador wants us to ignore the evidence before our very eyes.  Well, Mr. Filatov, we have heard the accounts of murders carried out by your soldiers reported by numerous credible sources.  We have seen the aerial photographs of human remains left scattered by the side of the road.  We have seen the cars carrying white flags, indicating civilian passengers, riddled with shrapnel.  The evidence of such atrocities condemns Russia before the world, and the world will not turn a blind eye.  It is long past time for Ambassador Filatov to be expelled from Ireland.

Yesterday Lithuania became the first EU member state to expel its Russian ambassador.  It did so as an action to uphold human rights and justice.  I commend Lithuania on that and believe our country should follow suit.  That would be a most powerful action for us to take as a militarily neutral, non-aligned State as we too stand for human rights and justice.  I call on the Taoiseach and the Government to act now.<\/p><p>Of course, we must do more.  The people of Ireland stand with Ukraine.  We strongly support Ukraine's stated desire to join the European Union.  We must respond to the humanitarian crisis by providing refuge to those fleeing for their lives.  As an elected member of the UN Security Council, we must use every available avenue to press for the de-escalation of conflict, for a ceasefire, for dialogue and for a Russian withdrawal and an end to this terrible war.<\/p><p>Ireland supports economic sanctions against Russia.  We must intensify those sanctions.  We should not have to convince anybody of the need to hit the Russian elites and oligarchs in every possible way.  The revelations of these war crimes and atrocities demand such an intensification of sanctions.  I welcome the announcement by the European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, of a new round of measures, including the ban on the import of Russian coal, the transaction ban on four Russian banks and the ban on Russian vessels from EU ports.  The impact of these sanctions creates a real economic challenge for Ireland and across the EU, but Russia and Vladimir Putin must feel the full weight and consequences of this invasion.  Russia should not doubt our resolve or our solidarity with the beleaguered people of Ukraine, a people who, as we speak, fight for their lives, fight for their freedom and fight for the survival of their nation.  They fight a war of liberation from tyranny and for the right to endure and to go on, and they will.  We know that a nation is a living, breathing thing.

Putin has not increased Russia's prestige or its power on the world stage.  His despotic leadership has sapped its influence, destroyed its economy and turned Russia into a pariah state.  It will remain a pariah state as long as Putin remains in power.<\/p> <p>Thursday, 24 February 2022, the day Russia launched its barbaric and illegal invasion of Ukraine, is the date that will live in infamy.  Since then, the Ukrainian people have faced a relentless barrage of bombs, bullets, missiles, mortars and rockets.  War crimes have been committed on a daily basis.  Maternity hospitals, schools, care homes and residential buildings have all been targeted.  They have tried to wipe whole cities, such as Mariupol, off the map.  The latest horrors revealed in Bucha, the torture and summary execution of hundreds of innocent civilians, are a gross affront to all of our collective humanity.<\/p> <p>Ireland stands united with Ukraine and the Ukrainian people against this callous barbarism and depravity.

While Russia is starved of economic support, financial support from the international community must flow into Ukraine.  What Putin has destroyed, Ukraine's allies must help to rebuild.

Putin is undoubtedly guilty of war crimes for his unjustified invasion of Ukraine, but so also is the United States, the UK and some of their allies for their unjustified wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, for which they have never been held accountable.  They are also guilty of supporting the Israeli state, which has been indicted recently for crimes against humanity for its treatment of the Palestinian people by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International.  They are also guilty of supporting the Saudi dictatorship in its brutal war in Yemen, arming that regime and blocking attempts to investigate their crimes against humanity.  <\/p><p>We have no credibility in condemning, as we must, the crimes against humanity in Ukraine if we do not simultaneously oppose, condemn and demand accountability for all crimes against humanity, whether they are in Ukraine, Georgia, Afghanistan, Palestine or Yemen.  We will not eliminate crimes against humanity, warmongering or imperialism by being selective in our opposition to it.

It has yet to be decided and it will be determined not just by fate but by decisions and actions of the people in this Chamber over the next few days.

For many hundreds of years geography was not our friend in Ireland; now it is, as we sit on the western flank of the EU, part of the greatest peace project ever.  In that context I strongly support EU membership for Ukraine.  As a former member of the European Parliament I met many Ukrainians who looked to the EU as a place where they belonged and I know Ireland supports that stance.  It would be beyond selfish of us to share in the benefits and security of EU membership, yet deny it to the Ukrainian people. <\/p><p>To all Ukrainians, I say we have an old tradition in Ireland of lighting a candle in the window of our homes to show hospitality and welcome to the stranger.  Metaphorically speaking, many tens of thousands of those candles have been lit and are burning in Irish homes and hearts as we welcome Ukrainians fleeing war and terror into our homes and our communities.  I am wearing a Sligo badge below my badge depicting the Irish and Ukrainian flags as a symbol of our common humanity and connectedness, as we welcome more than 130 Ukrainians to Sligo in these days.<\/p><p>The huge fundraising efforts and the massive mobilisation of medical and other supplies to Ukraine continue day after day.  Government assistance coupled with a massive voluntary effort has forged a chain between Ireland and Ukraine and I believe those strong links will hold.  I believe Ireland will not be found wanting in strongly promoting and supporting humanitarian and peace initiatives, because all wars must end and our focus must be with the Ukrainian people in finding a pathway to a lasting peace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#QQQQ00200","speaker":"1605"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":46,"content":"<p>Anois chun suimi&uacute; a thabhairt ar ghn&oacute; stairi&uacute;il na maidine, glaoim ar Chathaoirleach an tSeanaid, an Seanad&oacute;ir Mark Daly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#QQQQ00300","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":47,"content":"<p>On behalf of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, I ask colleagues to join me in welcoming five-year-old Anastasia to the Parliament of our Republic.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">An Cathaoirleach:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2246\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2246&amp;amp;pid=MarkDaly&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--><i>Laskavo prosymo do Irlandiyi<\/i>.

In a previous address in this Chamber nearly 60 years ago, another President also acknowledged Irish neutrality but also acknowledged that Ireland is not neutral between liberty and tyranny and never will be.  That is as true today as it was over half a century ago.  As an international community, we must never be neutral in the face of tyranny.  We work better when we work together.  We can and we must do more.  We must be relentless in our support for Ukraine, not just today, not just tomorrow, but until the war is won.

I pay compliment to our Cathaoirleach who attended and the Ceann Comhairle.  It was an emotional occasion that captured the Ireland&rsquo;s feeling about Ukrainians and their coming to Ireland and the need for us to do more.  As a society and a people, we need to do what we can to help Ukrainians in their hour of need.<\/p> <p>I compliment the President of Ukraine on his absolutely wonderful address.  It was powerful and emotional.  Given the pressure that man is under, it is simply amazing he found time to give such a wonderful performance of a speech.  He captured the hearts and souls of the Irish people with his performance.  If one listens to social media or anyone else, it was a wonderful display by a man under considerable pressure.  It is important this House acknowledges that and the wonderful contribution.  We are behind the Ukrainian people when it comes to the darkest day of their existence.<\/p> <p>With regard to other, more mundane matters, we need to broaden our debate about social media platforms and the control they have in our society.  We have considerable issues when it comes to Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms and how regulated or unregulated they are.<\/p> <p>I speak about young children in particular and the need for so-called time on the tablet.  It is becoming an epidemic in many places.  Many kids get up in the morning and the first thing they want is technology.  They want to know where the iPad or phone is.  We are all probably in that circle in our households but a debate is required about how we will make sure, going forward, our kids can interact with each other and with society rather than just interacting on social media platforms.  As children get older, there is the issue of how those social media platforms can be policed to make sure children are not being groomed and other unfortunate issues are not happening.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Tim Lombard:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2466\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is important we have a good, honest debate about how we are going to teach our children and society about the hazards of social media and the so-called technology.

The solidarity that was shown by the Members of both Houses reflects the solidarity of the people of this country.  The scenes we are seeing in Bucha and other parts of Ukraine are just horrific.  We need to continue to ensure that those who are responsible will be held to account.<\/p> <p>I raise the question of higher education funding again.  We are coming close to the anniversary of the publication of the Cassells report.  We have not yet seen the publication of the European Commission review which the Department commissioned.  It is not going to tell us anything we do not know.  It is going to tell us that our higher education funding system is in crisis and that institutions are struggling to provide the basic services for students and researchers.  It is essential this year that we address the question of core funding as well as the SUSI grant reform.  While I would favour a cut in student fees in an ideal world, there is a fear that if there was such a cut, the money lost to the institutions would not be made up by the Exchequer.  We have to ensure that the core funding grant issue is addressed.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, said that it would have been addressed in 2021.  That has not been the case.  I have called for a debate on higher education funding.  We have discussed the matter at the education committee.  Nearly every witness who has come before that committee has said that priority has to be given to investing in core funding and reform of the SUSI grant scheme.  A cut to student fees will not benefit the most disadvantaged students because about 42% of new entrants do not have to pay fees anyway as they are in receipt of a student grant.  We have to ensure that the student grant is adequate.  I ask that we have a debate on the future of higher education funding.<\/p> <p>I hope colleagues will join me in extending congratulations to four students from Gorey Community School, Caoimhe Crean, Caoimhe Horan, Eoin Kelly and P&aacute;draig Kinsella, who won the 2022 certified Irish Angus schools competition.  They explored the environmental, ethical and economic benefits of the certified Irish Angus breed.  The interesting thing is that none of those four students come from a farming background.  They have an understanding of the breed and a love of agriculture.  It would be appropriate for this House to extend our congratulations to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#O00200","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":56,"content":"<p>Indeed we will.

We stand with Ukraine.<\/p> <p>The HSE is once again in the public eye as a result of plans to return greater decision-making abilities to regionally based authorities rather than top-level managers.  The plan of the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, is to set up six regional health authorities.  If this sounds familiar, it might be because we had regional health authorities 17 years ago.  They were done away with and replaced by the HSE as per the design of the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  I hope that in another 17 years, centralisation is not tabled as a brand new solution to the systemic issue of bloat and bureaucracy which plagues our health system.<\/p> <p>More light needs to be shone on the HSE than perhaps the Department is willing to shed.  Monday saw coverage of an unreleased 2019 report which showed unsafe and unacceptable treatment in emergency care departments of nine separate HSE hospitals.  Some 50% or more of patients spent at least one night in the emergency department on a trolley before getting a bed or being discharged.  In at least one hospital they found patients spending up to ten nights on trolleys.  The report, Independent Review of Unscheduled Care Performance, was led by Professor Frank Keane, the former president of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.  It addressed issues of overcrowding, saying that the dignity, privacy and safety of patients on trolleys need attention.  Perhaps more worrying are the findings regarding leadership, staff and the communication between them as well as pervasive negative work practices.  Hospital staff did not always know who was in charge.  The adequacy of executive leadership and operational groups gave rise to concern and out-of-hours executive leadership commonly relied on tight rotas, often on a goodwill basis, which could promote burnout and become unsustainable.  Wards containing patients with a range of illnesses meant consultants and nurses were constantly moving around the building to find their patients.  The policy is any bed, anytime, anywhere, including mixed gender wards.<\/p> <p>Taken all together, it paints a stark picture of a healthcare service which has consistently fallen far below the standard expected of it, and whose senior management lacks any appetite for meaningful reform.  I understand that the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, has had enough on his plate during the Covid pandemic, but now is the time to be proactive rather than reactive, and to create lasting change.  I hope we do not stop short of seeing it through.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#O00500","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":59,"content":"<p>In light of this morning's historic, powerful and emotive address from President Zelenskyy and at a time of increasing pressure on homeowners, businesses and farmers, it is crystal clear we must do everything we can to starve Russia from its fossil fuel funds.  One way we can do that is by increasing our rates of renewable energy production in any way we can.  Each of us has a potential role to play in this.  It can start very locally, on the rooftops of our homes in towns and villages across Ireland.<\/p> <p>I have had a lot of inquiries from homeowners, many of whom are already benefiting from solar PV panels on their homes, asking when they will be able to avail of a payment for the excess energy produced.  The answer is from this summer.  The specific timing will depend on their billing cycle.  Since 15 February, those who are generating excess energy from renewable microgeneration could be accruing credit.  Depending on their contract and utility company, payment for excess is set to begin in the coming months.  The clean export guarantee will allow customers with registered microgeneration devices to sell any excess electricity back to Ireland's electricity grid in return for payment.  Energy companies are currently announcing the tariffs they will offer.  This is a win-win for homeowners and renewables.  It allows families to reduce utility bills while being paid for excess energy.<\/p> <p>People can also avail of the SEAI microgeneration support scheme for domestic users, which opened in February.  This offers grants to help to install solar PV panels on homes.  I encourage all homeowners to explore whether it might work for them.  One barrier which is proving difficult is the current need for planning permission for solar panels on roofs.  This is something my Green Party colleagues in the Seanad have worked hard to move along.  I hope the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage will move quickly to complete the legislative changes needed.  There is frustration which I share that similar schemes for non-domestic users such as schools and farms are taking longer.  I believe solar energy generated on farms in particular will play a very significant role in our transition away from fossil fuels.  I assure my colleagues in the Seanad that the Government is actively working on this issue.  The Commission for the Regulation of Utilities will consult on an implementation plan for the clean export premium tariff for larger non-domestic producers later this year.  A grant scheme for non-domestic users is due to commence this summer. <\/p> <p>In my own constituency, some public representatives have tried to claim the entire policy is failing miserably.  This is disappointing and untrue.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Pippa Hackett:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=0000\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=0000&amp;amp;pid=PippaHackett&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We will solve the issue.

I did not take the opportunity to welcome the new artists' income scheme that has been announced.  A thriving cultural economy is built on the work of people from all backgrounds in our society who have the talent and the means to create art.  How do we ensure diversity in that cultural production in the face of rapidly declining incomes and rising property prices and insurance costs?  Not only are our artists poor, but they are getting poorer even as the cultural sector becomes more valuable.  The harder it is to live as a working artist, the more voices will be excluded from our cultural sector, the more culture will become a playground for people who have money and privilege, and the more it will support the inequalities of our society.  The first step towards making our cultural economy thriving and diverse is to make a creative career sustainable.  That is why it is very welcome that the Minister and her officials in the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media have put in the work needed to deliver an income scheme.  It is something for which we have been calling for a number of years.  I commend the National Campaign for the Arts in particular on the work it has put in.  It is great to see this coming to fruition.  I commend the Minister on that.<\/p> <p>I note that Tourism Ireland invited Sacha Lord, the night-time economy adviser for greater Manchester, to be a member of a delegation as part of a link-up between Irish cities, Liverpool and Manchester.  It is good to see recognition of the importance of the night-time economy in our cities.  This is a step change in terms of Government policy and I again commend the Minister, Deputy Martin, on this.  We will all have seen reports at the weekend with regard to reform of opening hours and licensing laws.  Nightclubs need their own type of licence which is fit for purpose and workable and which will not involve the barriers to entry we see with regard to the pub industry.  There were 522 nightclubs in 2000.  There are now 85.  That shows the importance of the licensing law reform aspect of the work of the Minister, Deputy McEntee.  I would welcome a discussion in this House on those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#P00200","speaker":"1686"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I also compliment the Cathaoirleach and the Ceann Comhairle on this morning's joint sitting and on their statements in particular.  April is sexual assault awareness month.  As we know, rape and sexual assault are considered war crimes and breaches of international humanitarian law.  Women across Ukraine are grappling with the threat of rape as a weapon of war as growing evidence of sexual violence emerges from areas retaken from retreating Russian forces.  The world was horrified on Sunday by a picture taken by the photographer Mikhail Palinchak on a highway approximately 20 km outside of Kyiv in which the bodies of one man and three women were to be seen piled under a blanket.  The women were naked and their bodies had partially been burned.  These harrowing images add to a mounting body of evidence that summary executions, rape and torture have been used against civilians in areas under Russian control since the Kremlin launched its invasion on 24 February.  We heard at first hand from President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, about what is happening on the ground and the realities of the brutal Russian army.<\/p> <p>Particularly difficult for many of us to comprehend is the scale of the sexual violence.  As Russian troops have withdrawn from towns and suburbs around the capital to refocus their war efforts on the east, women and girls have come forward to tell the police, media and human rights organisations of atrocities they have suffered at the hands of Russian soldiers.  Gang rapes and assaults taking place at gunpoint and rapes committed in front of children are among the grim testimonies that have been collected by investigators.  The president of La Strada Ukraine, a charity that supports survivors of trafficking, domestic violence and sexual assault, has said the charity has received several calls to their emergency hotline from women and girls seeking assistance but that, in most cases, it has been impossible physically to get to them.  We know rape is an under-reported crime and stigmatised even in peaceful and normal times, so what we are hearing about now is likely to be merely the tip of the iceberg.  There are also reports from one woman, Antonina Medvedchuk, who said that when she woke up to the sound of bombing, her first thought was to get scissors, condoms and contraception.  In between the bombs, she would go looking for emergency contraception rather than an emergency first aid kit.  We also need to think of the situation of people fleeing to Poland, where reproductive health services are impossible to access.  This is coming at women and children in Ukraine from every direction.<\/p> <p>We know the trauma caused by the use of rape as a military tactic will lead to deep suffering across Ukrainian society for years to come.  Rape, sexual assault and violence never leave you.  I know this to be all too true.  While there may be remedies in the future via the justice system or international courts for the war crime of rape, this will do little to provide comfort to the women and girls currently facing the reality of rape and sexual violence upon their bodies.  Women and children always feel the worst brunt of war and those in Ukraine are no different.  During this sexual assault awareness month, I think of the women and girls in Ukraine who are facing the most horrific of circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#P00300","speaker":"1663"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for bringing that important topic to our attention.

Some Ukrainian people have arrived recently.  A man was making a delivery there yesterday morning and there was a little boy of seven crying uncontrollably in the corner.  Out of curiosity, this man asked some of the Ukrainian people in charge who could speak English what was wrong.  He was told that the little boy's dad had been killed in the war the night before.  That struck me and really went to my heart.  The particular guy who was doing the delivery was also really struck down by it.  It really brings it home to you.

The services that are being provided in Dublin are very organised.  When people arrive in Dublin Airport, there is a one-stop-shop where they get their personal public service, PPS, numbers and everything else.  However, this is not as well organised down the country.  This must be raised.  The hub I mentioned is being run by St. Munchin's Community Centre and the centre knew where to go to access the services, how to make an appointment for people to get their PPS numbers and how to get their mobile telephones.  In addition, the centre is starting English language classes on Thursday.  There are many similar hubs in the Limerick area and there should be somebody in place to co-ordinate this fully.  In the Radisson Hotel there are almost 200 Ukrainians and they have received many supports, but they wonder whether they will learn English and if somebody is going to look after them.  The same support must be given in hubs around the country as is given in Dublin, and that is something I wish to raise.<\/p><p>Finally, there was a good news story in Limerick yesterday when the council took back control of King John's Castle.  I thank Shannon Group and Shannon Heritage for minding it for the past 25 years, but it is now back in the rightful ownership of Limerick City and County Council.  We look forward to welcoming the many tourists who will visit the castle.

Your empathy with people was remarkable, a Chathaoirligh, and I compliment you personally on that.  It was wonderful to see.<\/p> <p>There have been many fine words about the situation in Ukraine and we have provided some support to the people there.  I must say that I agree with my colleague, Deputy Berry.  We need to provide what weapons we have to allow them to defend themselves.  We have to come to terms with that, and fairly soon.<\/p> <p>I cannot let today pass without talking about the United Nations Security Council.  We lauded the winning of the seat, which I totally disagree with anyway.  The United Nations Security Council is sitting on its hands while, as we were told this morning, 10 million people have been forced to leave their homes in Ukraine.  If the United Nations Security Council cannot provide peace and cannot bring about peace enforcement in Ukraine, it is time to scrap that useless waffle shop.  We have seen wars all over the world and all we hear are fine words on what needs to be done, but nothing is ever done.  We see it on our television screens every day.  The United Nations Security Council is a waste of time as long as the permanent members have a veto.<\/p> <p>Today, my colleague, Senator Malcolm Byrne, is bringing forward a Bill regarding the restriction of names with respect to the Defence Forces.  This is a test for all democrats in this House.  The use of the term &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann belongs to only one organisation in this country and I expect to see 100% cross-party support for that.  I compliment the Senator on bringing that Bill forward.<\/p> <p>Finally, I agree with what Senator Maria Byrne just said.  I have had telephone calls from around the country regarding people who have arrived here and, for example, only got a three-month visa.  One woman is absolutely petrified she will be gone in three months.  The Senator is 100% correct and I thank her for raising it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#Q00800","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":74,"content":"<p>Like other Members, I compliment you, a Chathaoirligh, and the Ceann Comhairle on the historic address by President Zelenskyy to the Houses this morning.  This all started six weeks ago and it has been horrific to imagine what has happened.  I got a 16-year-old into a school and I have somebody else who is getting extra hours for English as an additional language.  It is happening on the ground in Ireland.  The Irish people, the State and all of us are doing everything we can, but it is an awful pity that all this destruction and wanton viciousness is allowed.  We all stand with the people of Ukraine.<\/p> <p>I welcome the most senior member of the Colombian Government ever to visit Ireland, the Colombian Vice President, Marta Luc&iacute;a Ram&iacute;rez.  She is the country's first female vice president as well as its foreign affairs minister.  She has been here since Monday and I understand she is flying out tomorrow.  I met her yesterday evening.  We have an excellent relationship with Colombia and long may that continue and improve.  It is worthy of the House to acknowledge her presence in this country.<\/p> <p>I wish to make three brief points.  Members of the transport committee visited Dublin Airport on Monday to understand the challenges it is going through.  It has approximately 600 security staff and needs to increase that to approximately 900.  The biggest problem it is having is Garda vetting and what is called enhanced background checks, which involves referring back to another jurisdiction if people have lived out of the State for more than six months.  The challenge is the Garda vetting system appears to be quite slow.<\/p> <p>There is also an issue with tourism generally in respect of work permits.  People in the hospitality sector have told me it is taking them ten months to get people work permits to work in their industry.  They are effectively turning away guests because they do not have enough staff to cope with them.<\/p> <p>Finally, there is the passports issue.  I am still getting, and I am sure this is the case for all Members, endless numbers of passport queries.  Sometimes it is the applicants' fault, but a lot of the time it is clogged up in the system.  The office could have a screening process where the initial passport application is looked at immediately and, if there is something wrong, it is sent back that day, instead of it sitting in a pile for days or weeks and, when it is reached, it has to go back to the start of the process again.  It is very frustrating.  I know the office is doing its best but we need to improve it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#Q00900","speaker":"1696"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I commend you, a Chathaoirligh, on your speech this morning in the Lower House.<\/p> <p>It will come as no surprise that I am again raising the secondment of Dr. Tony Holohan, the Chief Medical Officer, to the public health professorship in Trinity College Dublin.  This morning, the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, said on \"Morning Ireland\" that he did not sign off on it.  Last night, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy McGrath, said he was not involved.  He said it was unusual.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach said he did not sign off on it.  Both he and the Minister for Health did not sign off on it, but the reality is somebody did sign off on it.  The question that needs to be answered is, why are we, the taxpayers, paying the salary of the outgoing CMO in Trinity College Dublin and paying the salary of the new Chief Medical Officer?  Why is Trinity College Dublin not paying the salary for the newly created position?<\/p> <p>This morning, the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, added to the confusion and muddied the waters by his intervention in the interview.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform have nothing to do with it, according to themselves.  As I said yesterday and in making my remarks again today, this is not personal.  I commend the role Dr. Holohan played.  I accept the points made by the Minister for Health this morning.  He said we are coming off the back of a pandemic and we must learn to deliver better outcomes in the delivery of healthcare in case of a future pandemic.  However, there is something not right when this situation is allowed to happen.  The three pertinent Ministers, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, had nothing to say or do with regard to signing off on the role.  The Cathaoirleach and the acting Leader will agree it is unusual that a person who is being seconded is being paid by the State and then the State is hiring a Chief Medical Officer.  I have another important question.  Is the position for one year, two years or five years, and will the new Chief Medical Officer be in place for one year, two years or five years?  In fairness to the House, we need answers, and that should happen as a matter of priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#Q01000","speaker":"1637"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I, too, pay tribute to your comments this morning, a Chathaoirligh.

A basic income is no substitute for addressing the bigger and more important issue of decent wages in the arts.  However, it is a very important step in terms of ensuring that there is a safety net for artists.  We have questions about how the scheme will work and will direct them at a later date.  <\/p><p>In welcoming the basic income for artists, I do so with mixed feelings because today 21 artists in Richmond Road Studios in Dublin 3 are facing the prospect of eviction from their studios as of tomorrow.  They have been in the studios for 20 years.  They are an amazing set of artists engaged in visual art, photography, painting, installation work and other art forms.  They received a letter two weeks ago to say that the building of which they are tenants is in receivership and they will be kicked out.  In fact, they are now currently trespassing.  I want to make a direct appeal to the receivers, Kroll, to engage with the tenants.  There are works that are valuable to the artists, if not necessarily financially valuable, and equipment in the building and we do not want an ugly situation to arise whereby the locks are changed.  To date, Kroll has failed to engage with the tenants despite our many pleas.  There is a bigger issue here with regard to how the Government is securing art space in Dublin and across the country.  We have seen a continual hollowing out of arts space.  The Government needs to put in place finance and other resources to ensure that arts groups can survive and thrive in this city and country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#Q01100","speaker":"1683","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":78,"content":"<p>I would also like to join with Members of the House in commending the Cathaoirleach on the speech he delivered at the historic joint session of the Houses this morning.

In light of that, I ask for a review of the protocols, practices and procedures around such invitations.  We should never afford additional privileges to people in such an unhelpful situation.  It could have sent out the wrong signal.  It took diplomacy too far and could have backfired.  Luckily, it did not and a diplomatic stand-off was averted at the last minute.

Thankfully, all's well that ends well.<\/p> <p>I have reliable information on the names of the companies in Ireland still trading in Russia.  I ask the Acting Leader to assist us in ascertaining the exact names of these large firms, which are publicly listed companies.  That would be the first step.  I would suggest the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs invites in the CEOs of those companies to explain themselves.  There are two sides to every story.  A lot of explaining has to be done in light of what we are witnessing and the carnage and barbaric acts carried out by Russia.

It is important that young children have a proper meal at least once a day, and this programme provides that.  There are a lot of questions to be answered in terms of how the scheme affects school attendance and whether it has helped that since it has been implemented.

What is happening is all being done in the best interests of the citizens of Ukraine and giving them some sort of opportunity to have a life and a roof over their heads while they are here.  As the Taoiseach said, this is their home for as long as they want to be here.  That rang true today in all contributions.<\/p> <p>After the Easter recess, I ask that we have a debate on mental health with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.  It seems as though we go from one crisis to the next quite quickly without reflecting on the previous crisis.  Over the past three years, as the Acting Leader knows, mental health has been very challenging and the demand on mental health services has dramatically increased on the back of Covid.  Given the increasing numbers coming to Ireland from Ukraine, people will need services.  There will be an influx of demand over the next period of time.  It is important that we in the Chamber have a debate on how we manage that in terms of mental health.  It has always been an area of the health service that we would all agree is underfunded.  It is very hard to fund it to the extent that is needed, but the challenges in that regard will increase more and more as the months go on.<\/p> <p>This is an issue in my country.  We do not have any acute psychiatric beds in Tipperary.  If someone in south Tipperary needs overnight care, he or she has to go to Kilkenny and those in north Tipperary have to go to Ennis.  We used to have acute psychiatric beds in St. Michael's in Clonmel.  There has been a lot of investment in health services in Tipperary.  A 40-bed modular unit was opened by the Taoiseach a number of months ago.  St. Michael's is being turned into a step-down unit, which is positive, but there has been no investment in long-term beds in Clonmel and Tipperary.  We need the Minister to support Tipperary.  It is not right and proper that people have to go as far as Kilkenny and Ennis to get services.  A lot of good volunteers work in mental health in Tipperary, but the Government needs to support us locally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#R00400","speaker":"1629"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I would like to raise the issue of animal welfare, and not for the first time, in this Chamber.

We cannot allow people who carry out such barbaric acts on defenceless animals to go unpunished.  That said, the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine will tonight have a third session on the completely unnecessary cruelty that is being inflicted on dogs daily, some of which is legal in this country.  <\/p><p>A couple of weeks, the committee heard from Mr. Tim Kirby of PetBond that surgical artificial insemination is on the increase in Ireland and in some cases is being carried out by non-vets.  Surgical artificial insemination is cruel and has rightly been banned in Britain.  While previously confined to the greyhound industry in this country, it is now happening right across the dog world to feed an insatiable desire for artificial breeds like pomskies.  Whether it is being done to a greyhound, a bulldog or a Pomeranian, surgical artificial insemination is a highly invasive procedure that cannot be justified.  To make matters worse, in 2021 there were 27 cases of dead dogs' semen being used in the greyhound industry.<\/p><p>The other practice of canine mutilation that is increasing in Ireland is ear-cropping.  It is fashionable among bulldog and doberman breeds and while it is illegal in Ireland, animal welfare organisations and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine have said the law needs to be strengthened as it is virtually impossible to prosecute anyone under the current legislation.  Ear-cropping is a mutilation that denies a dog its basic means of communication and can have lifelong impacts on the dog&rsquo;s welfare.  I ask that we have a long overdue debate in the House on the issue of animal welfare but, in particular, dog welfare.

Everyone commended the work the Cathaoirleach and the Ceann Comhairle did to ensure the joint sitting of the Houses took place this morning.  It was very moving to be in the D&aacute;il to listen to President Zelenskyy. What an inspirational, incredible person he is.  He has the weight of the world on his shoulders.  I was looking at him and thinking that while he was calm, compassionate and passionate when speaking, he must be surviving on very little, if any, sleep as he tries to give direction and leadership and engage with world leaders.  I know all Members will join me in saying <i>Slava Ukraini<\/i>.<\/p><p>On the points raised, Senator Lombard spoke about social media platforms and how they are regulated or, indeed, unregulated, particularly in respect of the amount of time children are spending on their tablets.  He sought a debate on that type of interaction, how we monitor it and the hazards of technology.Four Members of this House, Senators Malcolm Byrne, Cassells, Warfield and Carrigy, are active members of the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media.  The Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill will be in the Seanad for Committee Stage in the week after Easter.  This welcome, important and necessary legislation will regulate social media companies.<\/p><p>Senator Malcolm Byrne spoke about higher education funding, not for the first time, and noted it is the anniversary of the Cassells report.  He made the point that the EU report requested by the Minister at that time has still not been circulated, even though we believe the Government has received it.  As the Senator pointed out, we know the report will state that the sector is in crisis.  <\/p><p>Senator Malcolm Byrne also spoke of the need for reform of the SUSI grant and the need to address the whole issue of core funding for once and for all.  He also congratulated Eoin, the two Caoimhes and P&aacute;draig from Gorey who won first prize in the certified Irish Angus schools competition in Croke Park last week.  I am very happy to add my congratulations on behalf of the House.  I saw some of the images posted by the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, and Deputy Michael Moynihan, which were wonderful.  It is incredible that the four people mentioned by the Senator do not come from a farming background.  It just shows that it is very important that we encourage children in an urban environment to learn more about the rural environment.<\/p><p>Senator Keogan spoke about the HSE being in the public eye.  It is a good thing that the six regional authorities have been set up.  Basically, this measure is the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare, which was proposed in an all-party committee report.  Its main focus will be on primary care and the co-ordination of services.  That is very much to be welcomed.<\/p><p>The Minister of State, Senator Hackett, spoke about the role we have to play in the area of energy.  She made the very welcome announcement that homeowners who generate their own energy will be able to sell excess energy this summer.  That is a win-win situation for everybody and a very important policy which we welcome.  The Senator also mentioned that planning permission for solar panels, particularly on public buildings, is part of a Green Party Bill that has been slow in coming.  We support her on that issue.<\/p><p>Senator Warfield spoke about the pilot basic income for artists scheme which is a fantastic and revolutionary initiative.  He is right that we have to ensure diversity and equity in respect of those who will be able to access the scheme.  He also spoke about the merits of the night-time economy.  Again, it is good that we had announcements in that respect in the past week.<\/p><p>Senator Hoey spoke about the month of awareness of sexual assault and, in particular, the women of Ukraine who are grappling with rape.  We see absolutely harrowing images.  Sexual violence is taking place on a huge scale.  Sadly, that is always a feature of war.  The Senator is correct to make the point that Poland is a very restrictive country in respect of reproductive rights.  It is very important that an international organisation has the opportunity to go in to provide oversight.  I am very proud that Ireland has given &euro;1.5 million for reproductive and sexual rights for women from the Ukraine to help address this problem, which is one that has been recognised.  What does one say to a woman who has been raped by a Russian soldier, finds that she is pregnant in Poland and does not having access to termination services?  It is just completely wrong.<\/p><p>Senator Murphy spoke about the trauma that is visited on so many Ukrainians in this country when they hear of horrific events in their country, including murder, and suffering bereavement while they are here.  He also spoke about the work being carried out by local organisations in Roscommon.  The Senator also congratulated Denyse Campbell on becoming the new president of the Irish Hotels Federation and we certainly add our voices to those congratulations.<\/p><p>Senator Maria Byrne spoke about the Limerick emergency hub and called for more supports for communities outside Dublin.  That community approach is greatly needed on a co-ordinated level.  I am meeting a lady this afternoon, Angie Gough, who has set up a community group to roll out supports nationally in respect of that, which is very important.  While we need skills and supports, the hand of friendship, no matter how we extend it, is of great importance and I have no doubt that will happen right around the country.  Senator Byrne also spoke about the welcome acquisition by Limerick City and County Council of St. John&rsquo;s Castle.<\/p><p>Senator Craughwell spoke about the need to provide weapons to Ukraine.  He should note that while we are not politically neutral, we are still militarily neutral.  That is very precious to many of us in this country.  It is still very important.  There is no doubt that there will be a citizens&rsquo; assembly on neutrality and that is the right way to go.

It is wonderful that she has chosen to visit Ireland and she is certainly very welcome.  The Senator spoke about building at Dublin Airport and the challenges with Garda vetting and work permits.  He asked for the Army to be brought in to solve its problems.  It is simply not good enough in my view.  I believe 1.7 million passports will be processed this year which is an enormous number.  We need to get it right and many more measures need to be put in place.<\/p><p>Senator Buttimer spoke about the secondment of the Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Tony Holohan, to Trinity College.  We need collaboration between healthcare and academia; that is how we learn.  Dr. Holohan has incredible experience in the public health area.  It is very significant and welcome that he has the opportunity to share that with the students at Trinity College and hopefully beyond.  Open-ended secondments are a regular feature and are common across the Civil Service and public service to encourage interdepartmental and interagency co-operation.  Many political staff are seconded from the Civil Service and public service.  Tony Holohan has given the country wonderful service at a very difficult time for him personally.  While the Senator said that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health have not answered any questions, what about the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris?  Questions also need to be put to him.<\/p><p>Senator Sherlock spoke about the basic income for artists and spoke about 23 artists losing their building because it is going into receivership.  That is sad to hear.  I hope there is some engagement there.  I agree with her that we need to support artists to survive and thrive.<\/p><p>Senator Martin asked me to find a list of companies still trading in Russia.  I believe that is beyond my payscale.  He is right in saying that the Joint Committee on European Union affairs should look for that list and invite representatives in.  There are questions to be asked and that certainly should be done.<\/p><p>Senator Burke asked that we invite the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, to come to the House to debate the comprehensive evaluation of the school meals programme.  I support us doing that.  <\/p><p>Senator Ahearn called for a debate with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, on mental health.  We cannot just say mental health; we need to be more specific because it is such a complex area.  We can certainly look for a debate on how supports will be put in place for those from Ukraine.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has secured a far higher budget than ever before.  Every cent of that is needed.  It is also about outcomes and not just about money.<\/p><p>Senator Boylan spoke about animal welfare.  She spoke about two particular cases of mutilated animals in south County Dublin.  She also informed us about the surgical artificial insemination which is being used for artificial breeds of dog.  It would need to be very carefully monitored if not made illegal.  Ear cropping is illegal but the law needs to be strengthened as it is very difficult to enforce.  She said it is the subject of debate in the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and Marine.  I certainly hope that measures would come from that discussion.  I support having a debate on animal welfare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#S00300","speaker":"1689","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Leader and all the other Members for their remarks on the joint sitting.

This is actually a positive day.  I know the Minister of State will interpret my remarks as I intend them to be interpreted.  They concern community service and disability, in the context of which we are here today.  Everything we have been doing is under the framework contained in Disability Action Plan Framework: Review of Disability Social Care Demand and Capacity Requirements to 2032.  There are a couple of points I want to make.  I fully support the Minister of State and will work with her every step of the way on this.<\/p> <p>There are several anomalies concerning assessment and intervention.  In many cases, the delivery of a service or intervention never takes place.  It is particularly concerning when one comes from a mild intellectual disability background or platform.  Those in this category are excluded, which is a worry.  The action plan framework, which we should all be asked to examine and work from, refers to day-service places for school-leavers, personal assistance and home supports, respite services, including alternative respite services, and residential care in the community.  Let me start with the last of those, in respect of which I wish to make an appeal to the Minister and those charged with delivery at local level.  I am told those over 65 with an intellectual disability and without a bed in a residential service are being offered nursing home places only.  If that is correct, an ageist and ableist policy is being developed.  Those who have been in a care centre or the community are having traditional supports removed and are being put into nursing homes that do not have the ability to deliver the supports they require.<\/p> <p>Consider the point I made at the beginning, which was on the link between assessment and intervention.  The link is quite broken.  Assessment and intervention are separated and there is a time delay and an anomaly.  There is no continuity of experience for those who need it the most.  That needs to be addressed at local level on the ground.<\/p> <p>The priorities in the document we have, action on which will be enabled by the Bill, concern the key role of respite in supporting family carers in enhancing service.  While these are wonderful, aspirational words, I have some questions.  Is there a lowballing of the numbers being provided for?  Are they too low?  Are we missing out?  Have we a full and accurate picture?  Are we underestimating the number of people who require school places and respite?  I do not understand the delivery mechanism.<\/p> <p>Regarding respite care or respite services, it is stated an increase in capacity to provide an initial 12 respite houses and a further increase of nine-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#V00400","speaker":"1637"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":98,"content":"<p>I remind the Senator that we have three minutes left.

I am aware that the Minister of State is a very hard worker and really cares about people with disabilities.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters and absolutely love it and the idea of bringing about equality for people with a disability.  This legislation should not become another Act that is not implemented.

There is no denying that in the context of respite.  The whole focus has to be on having real and clear understanding and guidance to meet the needs and serve the rights of the individual.  It is about informing the person and his or her family of their rights and how to access services, and being open and transparent in that regard.  There is no point in the Government providing policy and Departments providing money and it going then to the HSE without following the money to see how the service is delivered to the end user, whether in a day service, respite or residential care.  It is also about meeting the needs of the individuals.  I am acutely aware of the importance of page 7 of the Bill.  To me, it is the gospel page in terms of ensuring delivery and holding people to account in that regard.<\/p><p>I look forward to being within the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth because I look at the matter with a rights-based lens.

As Members will be aware, all remaining mandatory public health measures were removed on 28 February.  As recommended by our medical advisers, we have transitioned from regulation and population-wide restrictions to a focus on public health advice, personal judgment and personal protective behaviours.<\/p> <p>The overall situation is improving.  The number of people receiving general hospital care has fallen.  However, we continue to have high levels of infection and a significant number of cases in hospitals.  The total number of Covid-19 cases in hospital increased from approximately 600 to approximately 1,600 through March.  The burden this has placed on patients and healthcare workers has been relentless.  I wish to acknowledge the ongoing efforts across the healthcare system during these times.  Thankfully, in line with a reduction in case numbers, there has been a reduction in the number of Covid patients in hospital.  The number has fallen from 1,600 to 1,333 this afternoon.<\/p> <p>Of those in hospital with Covid, approximately half are there because of Covid, with the other half categorised as asymptomatic infectious.  When it comes to the patients in intensive care with Covid, approximately one third of them are there because of Covid.  That number has fallen significantly in the past month.  Importantly, of those with Covid in hospital, only two in five have had a booster vaccine, while approximately half of those in ICU with Covid have had a booster vaccine.  To give a sense of how this works out, there were recently 1,600 Covid patients in hospital but the number of them who were in hospital on that day because of Covid and who had been boosted was a much lower figure of 370.  Similarly on a particular day there were approximately 50 patients in ICU with Covid, but only 18 of them were there because of Covid and only nine of those had been boosted.  That underlines how essential it still is that people get their booster vaccine.  It is one of the three main public health messages right now: first, get your vaccine or booster; second, if you have symptoms, stay at home for 48 hours until those symptoms have largely resolved or, if you have a positive test, stay home for seven days; and, third, wear a mask in the appropriate settings, including public transport, crowded spaces, healthcare settings, nursing homes or while visiting a person who is at higher risk for Covid.<\/p> <p>The current BA.2 sublineage is now the dominant variant in Ireland, accounting for approximately 95% of all cases.  There has been an overall reduction in PCR testing volumes and test positivity, which is an encouraging sign, while the total daily number of positive antigen tests has also decreased.<\/p> <p>As regards vaccination, more than 10.7 million doses have now been administered, including nearly 3 million booster doses.  We have a very high vaccine and booster rate which has obviously been essential in our national response.  However, there are still approximately 700,000 men and women aged 16 or older who have had their first two doses, so are very much in favour and supportive of boosters, but have not yet had their booster vaccine.  A large part of that is because so many people got Covid a few months back and there has to be a three-month wait between having had Covid and getting the booster.  It is really important that those 700,000 people get the booster as soon as they can.  The booster uptake rate remains too low in younger groups.  For example, a little over half of those aged 18 to 39 have had the booster.  There is a host of initiatives going on to target these groups, including a high level of public communication and advertising.<\/p> <p>As regards the paediatric vaccination programme, as of 27 March, approximately 120,000 first doses had been administered, with 101,000 fully vaccinated.  More than 133,000 children aged five to 11 have now registered for a vaccination.<\/p> <p>We are also working hard to address and support the health and other needs of Ukrainian refugees entering Ireland, including making sure they have full and rapid access to vaccinations.<\/p> <p>As regards new and emerging treatments for Covid-19, a new therapeutics advisory group was established to evaluate, advise and recommend on all the therapeutics that could be used here.  Therapeutics have been administered, though it is important to note that the treatments are not for widespread use.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Stephen Donnelly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2336\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2336&amp;amp;pid=StephenDonnelly&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The benefit is limited to particular cohorts of higher risk, more vulnerable patients.

As we move forward, the Government will continue to ensure that our response is agile and flexible, and that we can move quickly in response to any new emerging threat which obviously we are monitoring here and around the world very closely. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#W00500","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for taking time out of his schedule to update us.  Thankfully, Covid-19 has in one sense blended into the background of all the other political issues and is not the main political issue.  However, we all know that it is still a concern in our hospitals and communities.  While the case numbers are high, we are not seeing as many people get as sick.  That is a result of the success of the roll-out of the vaccination programme, which was overwhelmingly successful in this country.  People bought into it.  They trusted what the Minister, the officials in his Department and the people in the HSE were doing.  That is very good.<\/p> <p>I am quite concerned at the low booster uptake.   Many people who are in hospital are not vaccinated or, if they are primarily vaccinated, are not boosted.  As the Minister pointed out, some of that is to do with the very high rate of Covid-19 infection over the past couple of months.  People are waiting for that to wash through.  It would be no harm to have another public awareness campaign in regard to the necessity of the booster because in many people&rsquo;s minds, this is over and life is back to relative normality.  As we know people are still getting infected and are getting quite sick.  We all know people who got quite sick over the past couple of months even though they were vaccinated.  The public awareness campaign needs to be ramped up a little for the next couple of weeks.<\/p> <p>I wish to make reference to the very low mortality rates we have had in Ireland.  If we compare that internationally, we will see that it is a really good statistic.  We did not throw older people or more vulnerable members of our communities to the wolves.  We actually looked after them.  When we are assessing this in years to come, the main metric to come out of this will be that we protected the vulnerable people in our communities.  That is something we all played our part in.  We should all be very proud of that.<\/p> <p>I am fascinated with the way other countries, especially in the Far East, are dealing with the pandemic at the moment.  I am thinking of China and Hong Kong in particular.  They pursued a zero-Covid strategy but are having serious issues at the moment as they seek to handle the pandemic.  They are locking down communities again.  It is worth noting that when we were debating various Covid legislation, regulations and statements over the past two years, the Minister always pointed out that we could not put a zero-Covid strategy in place, regardless of how attractive that was.  We were confident in our plan and our own medical advice.  Based on that, we have seen the country through this very difficult period.  We are not back to square one as other parts of the world are.  Absolutely everybody involved in that effort - the Minister and his officials, Paul Reid and his colleagues in the HSE, the vaccinators, the primary care centre staff and all the front-line workers - is to be commended.  It is good that we are in a good place.  While the threat is still there, we are in a good place.  As the pandemic goes on and we emerge from it, I look forward to discussing the various measures we are going to have to put in place coming into autumn and winter.  We are in a dramatically different place from this time last year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#X00200","speaker":"1643"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, who is a regular visitor, although probably not as regular as he used to be.  The pandemic is now something we are living with as opposed to trying to deal with on an emergency basis.<\/p> <p>I would like to mention a funny thing that I have noticed from my empirical engagement with people.  There is no scientific basis for this.  People who are getting Covid-19 now are getting quite sick.  I note the Minister's predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Harris, was quite sick with it.  Quite a number of people I have engaged with have been quite sick with it.  Many Members of the Oireachtas who got it, like the Minister, Deputy Harris, were quite sick with it.  It has most definitely not gone away.  Certainly, the public awareness in terms of following public health guidelines has dramatically reduced.  Empirical evidence is that hand sanitiser dispensers at supermarkets and other public areas are more often empty than they are full.  I agree with the principle of continuing public health and public awareness campaigns.  They will have to continue.<\/p> <p>The announcement by the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, this morning of a fourth booster dose for vulnerable adults is long overdue.  To be frank, it should have happened sooner than this.  I cannot understand why NIAC is so slow in making its recommendations.  We all knew that people had to get a booster vaccine six, eight or ten months ago.  Yet, it took NIAC longer than it should have to come with a recommendation on that.  We are going to have a conversation about how this kind of advice is coming.  NIAC is independent, but vaccinations are happening in other countries.  We are not unique.  It is going to come to us as well.<\/p> <p>I do not know how we are going to manage or deal with this as we go forward.  Perhaps we can reconstitute NIAC or join NIAC with a newly defined NPHET.  We need to have a debate and conversation on public health and pandemic planning going forward.  That can only really be done against the backdrop of a public inquiry into this country&rsquo;s handling of the pandemic.  I believe such an inquiry will endorse the work done by this Government and its predecessor.  Per head of population, the number of fatalities - the number of people who tragically lost their lives to Covid-19 - in this country is among the lowest in the European Union.  We actually fare pretty well in terms of an international comparison worldwide.  It is down to the people.  Our handling of this has been about saving lives.<\/p> <p>Two years ago, when Covid-19 was raging, people followed the social distancing guidelines and stayed at home.  I think it was this week two years ago that the 2 km requirement was introduced.  That was done to save lives.  People bought into it to save lives, and it worked.  That said, we must remember the 5,000 or 6,000 people in this country who lost their lives to Covid-19.  That cannot be forgotten.  The memorial that took place a couple of weeks ago, on the Sunday after St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, was very poignant, appropriate and dignified.<\/p> <p>I was at the Joint Committee on Health this morning.  I think it was the first time we had Paul Reid and Robert Watt in that we were not actually talking about Covid-19.  We were talking about other issues, but Covid-19 needs to be continuously on the agenda.  It cannot be off the agenda.  Thankfully this fourth wave has now subsided but we need periodically to recalibrate the public mindset to remind people we are living with what is the residue of a pandemic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#X00300","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.

It is important to note that the virus is still very dangerous for immunocompromised people.  Speaking as one of those people, I have no doubt that the vaccines and boosters I received saved me from serious illness a few weeks ago.

The importance of vaccination and getting boosters should also continue to be highlighted, particularly in light of the point the Minister has made about the relatively poor take-up of boosters.<\/p><p>Given that NPHET has been stood down, there is now an issue with transparency as to what advice is given to the Minister or the Government.  Any public health advice given should be fully published whenever the Minister is given an update.<\/p><p>The underlying problems in the health system have been put on full display again since \"normal\" services, if we can call them normal, have been resumed.  It will not surprise the Minister to hear that I will have to mention the situation at University Hospital Limerick, where there are serious issues of overcrowding and cancelled appointments, and recent reports of rows of ambulances parked outside the hospital, unable to offload patients.  Then there are the trolley numbers.  The number of patients on trolleys in Limerick was at an all-time high of 1,059 in March of last year.  In March of this year, the figure was at its highest ever at 1,671, more than 500 more than last year's record.  It is nothing short of scandalous.  No doubt the situation is exacerbated by Covid-19, but the problems in accident and emergency departments have been there for years.  Now, unfortunately, they are becoming a disaster at University Hospital Limerick.  We need to see a plan that allows hospitals to maintain services while still being able to cope with Covid cases.  The Government needs to do everything possible to ease the burden on front-line healthcare workers.<\/p><p>I wish to mention those healthcare workers and carers who have worked tirelessly and heroically over the past two years.  The Government has given very little recognition to carers, which is regrettable.  Carers got no respite and little or no help as services closed down.  They were forgotten about and continue to be left behind as they will not be included in the bonus payment for healthcare workers, of which we really need to see the details.  The Covid-19 recognition payment for front-line public sector healthcare workers was announced months ago but the detail does not seem to have been worked out yet, which is a little baffling.<\/p><p>In the few seconds left to me I will raise one final issue.  As the Minister will know, tomorrow we will deal with the safe access zones Bill and there has been a cross-party coalition of the willing to support the Together for Safety Bill.  He will also know that, unfortunately, there has been no Government Bill on the matter to date.  I gave the Minister a commitment that we would work with such a Government Bill if it were to arrive.  Not only is there no such Bill, however, but the Minister will know that the Department confirmed just two weeks ago to the health committee that there is no timeline as to when the Bill will arrive.  The only Bill to deal with safe access zones is the Bill we will debate tomorrow.  I ask for an indication that the Minister will continue to facilitate the passage of that Bill.  I am sure he and I agree that women and pregnant people should not have to wait one second longer.  We have protests daily in Limerick and Dublin at present, during Lent.  It is intolerable.  Activists from the campaign have been called at work and targeted in the most vicious of ways.  I hope for a positive indication from the Minister on that point ahead of tomorrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#X00400","speaker":"1660","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":113,"content":"<p>The Minister is very welcome to the House.  It has been over two years since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Globally, it has taken more than 6 million lives.  On the island of Ireland more than 10,000 people have died.  Thankfully, however, because of the Minister's and the Department's work and the miraculously swift vaccine roll-out, many lives have been saved and we have been able to return to some kind of normality.  I must mention, however, that these miracle vaccines remain inaccessible in much of the world, a fact that reflects rather poorly on us in the developed world.  To vaccinated people, Covid-19 poses much less of a threat than it once did.  That is an immense relief, and policymaking has rightly changed to reflect that development.  However, we cannot forget the large number of people who remain vulnerable and those who suffer persistent illness after contracting Covid-19.  This House voted to support a full TRIPS waiver in December.  Unfortunately, when it appeared there was hope for a waiver, it quickly became apparent that a full TRIPS waiver was still being blocked.  The global south is still not being given equitable access to vaccination.  If we are serious about ending the public health emergency, we need a full TRIPS waiver and no more evasions or delays to equitable global access to vaccination.<\/p> <p>The removal of mask mandates on public transport was, I believe, premature and put at risk those who provide and rely on public transport, as my colleagues, Senators Higgins and Flynn, raised in the House last February.  We need to consider the reintroduction of mask mandates in enclosed indoor public settings.  It has overwhelming public support.  A recent Am&aacute;rach Research poll found that 65% of respondents favoured mask mandates in public indoor spaces.  Mandating masks in certain public spaces such as public transportation and supermarkets means that those individuals trying to reduce their risk of exposure are supported.  We should acknowledge that sections of the trade union movement representing some of the most at-risk workers, such as the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, and the National Bus and Rail Union, NBRU, have called for the reintroduction of a mask mandate in certain settings.  The pandemic has been a lesson in just how much we rely on the labour of healthcare and public transportation workers.  When they ask us to reintroduce measures that protect their health and safety while at work, we should demonstrate real gratitude by taking action on their behalf.  A poll by AA Ireland found that 41% of people indicated that they were less likely to use public transportation after the end of the requirement for mask wearing.  Just 4% said they were more likely to use public transport services.  The lapse of this measure has therefore made our public services less accessible to the public.  I have heard from people who are older or otherwise medically vulnerable whose mobility has been limited by their feeling unsafe on public transportation.  That is a really worrying situation.  Public spaces should feel safe and accessible to everyone.<\/p> <p>I wish to touch on a publication produced by the Joint Committee on Health about vitamin D deficiency in Ireland and its relation to Covid-19 outcomes.  The report looked at studies done around the world that found that increased levels of vitamin D produced better public health outcomes when dealing with the pandemic.  Finland, for example, a country that mandated that certain food products be enriched with high levels of vitamin D, has the lowest number of Covid cases and deaths in the EU.  The report recommended that vitamin D supplements be given to healthcare workers, care home residents and medically vulnerable individuals.  It also suggested that the supplements be available at Covid testing locations.  These recommendations should be revisited.<\/p> <p>Finally, I wish to highlight comments made by John Wenger, chair of the Expert Group on the Role of Ventilation in Reducing Transmission of Covid-19.  He expressed disappointment with the lack of Government action to support the delivery of ventilation upgrades, despite the delivery of two reports in 2021 that showed that ventilation is an essential element of an effective public health response.  Ventilation is essential to creating a long-term strategy of dealing with Covid.  We all want to limit the spread of this disease while imposing on people's lives as minimally as possible.  It is a significant challenge, but that does not excuse the stalled progress in this area.  These are ways in which we can reduce the impact of Covid on many people's lives.  We cannot ignore this Covid wave, so let us take common-sense action and keep people safe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#Y00200","speaker":"1632"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I have asked Senator McGahon to take the Chair in a few minutes to allow me to make a short contribution.

I am very grateful and thrilled that we are here today and those regulations are no more.  There is, however, still a need for caution and care when it comes to the protocols of mask wearing and washing our hands and, most of all, the booster.  One would be forgiven for thinking Covid had gone away.  I noted last night that we got through a whole news bulletin without Covid being mentioned, which was extraordinary.  This time two years ago I had fears about my family members making it to the summer alive, so to make it through a whole news bulletin in that way was really good.  There is a danger in that, and everything is relative.  Naturally, we are horrified by what we see in Ukraine, so it is easy to forget about Covid, unless you work in healthcare.  The people who work in healthcare are to be congratulated, lauded and empathised with for just how difficult it is.  We need a new booster campaign to tell the people who were unable to avail of the booster in the first round at Christmas and in December that they are now eligible.  We should get out that information.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Although we have lifted all restrictions, it is necessary for us to ask what other protocols should be recommended.

I thank all involved in the Covid-19 response.  There are key points that I wish to make on Covid-19 today.  We were premature in getting rid of the mask mandate.  Our vaccination programme worked without it being mandatory so we must have a real incentive for the vaccine booster programme.  It is important that the replacement for the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, can be put in place as a matter of urgency to give the Minister and the Government the best advice so we can continue to be careful around Covid-19.  The WHO speaks about mitigation and mask-wearing is a help in such mitigation.  It is important that we reissue a call to people to wear masks.<\/p> <p>I have a worry about the leaving certificate and we should come back to it.<\/p> <p>My final point is about the Chief Medical Officer, CMO.  I wish him well in his new position at Trinity College but it is wrong that the State would second him and pay him in tandem with the appointment of a new CMO who the State would also have to pay.  I heard the Minister this morning on \"Morning Ireland\" and I watched the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, speak last night.  I heard the Taoiseach speaking about this in the D&aacute;il yesterday.  Somebody signed off on this and it is not good enough.  I take issue with it and I do not normally do so.  It is wrong in any language.  The Minister of State was correct in saying on this morning's \"Morning Ireland\" that we can learn from the pandemic and we should be prepared for future pandemics.  I agree with the Minister in that respect and would walk to the end of the Earth to support him on it.  What is happening with the secondment, however, is wrong and it should not be allowed.  I thank the Minister for his work nonetheless, along with all the front-line staff and everybody who is involved with the fight against Covid-19.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#Z00200","speaker":"1637"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I usually do not disagree with Senator Buttimer but I do not agree with that point.  My understanding of such secondments is that Ministers do not sign off on them.  I thought the Minister did quite well in this morning's two interviews in the media that I heard.  We will differ on the matter and I am sure the Minister will clarify it further.  Dr. Holohan has made a major contribution over a period, which we all acknowledge.  He took much abuse as well.<\/p> <p>It is really great to see the Minister here again.  Like others, I commend him on always coming here to deal with the matter head-on.  It is great to see the senior Minister coming before us.  I know I often say \"well done\" on the work that has been done and the Minister is always anxious to say that people on the front line, including doctors, nurses, porters and everybody else, have helped out in society to deal with Covid-19.  I acknowledge that today.<\/p> <p>It strikes me that a number of young people have not taken the booster.  When this is said to them, they say they will not take it.  I agree with others who have said we must think about how to target such people and incentivise them to take the booster.  Even in some of my family circle, people have said they will not take the booster even when we say that Covid-19 is still around and ask would it not be a wise course of action.  We need to target such people again.<\/p> <p>I wear a mask in any crowded area and I will continue to do that.  Some people have come up to me and told me I could stop wearing a mask.  It is a question of speaking with people.  Every time I hear the Minister speak he mentions masks and the booster vaccine.  Having watched this over the past couple of days, it seems 50% or 60% of people are wearing masks.  Some people will never do it, even if it had a legal basis.  We must pump out the message continuously and this will lead to more people wearing a mask.<\/p> <p>Senator Conway mentioned how people have got very sick and they have become sick with Covid-19 recently.  How many of those people would have survived if they had not received a vaccination?  Many more people would be deceased at this point if it had not been administered.  It is regrettable that between 5,000 and 6,000 people have lost their lives but it is true to say that in a European or world context, we have done very well in fighting this pandemic.<\/p> <p>Caution is important and we must keep putting out that message.  I agree with the Minister that we must allow society get back to functioning again.  The economy, families and communities have suffered terribly.  People's well-being also suffered because sport was affected and the usual way we live our lives was completely disrupted.  It was a shock to us all and a shock to the world.  We must use the phrase \"live with Covid\" time and again.  I only speak as a layperson but I believe we will have to deal with Covid-19 for a long time to come.  It is important we are able to manage it and be aware of what is happening.  We must be able to watch out for any difficulties that arise.<\/p> <p>All in all, the Government has done a good job and the Minister has given good leadership.  Again, I say \"well done\" to all the people on the front lines, including the carers who have done much good work.  There are also people in the community, such as postal workers and others who did much work to help people during the period of Covid-19.  I say \"well done\" to the Minister but we must be cautious and careful as we move along.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#Z00300","speaker":"1674"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":119,"content":"<p>I have followed regulations at each point but I am against the concept of reintroducing the mandatory wearing of masks in certain settings.  It is not about being anti-mask but rather about acknowledging or realising what stage of the pandemic we are in now compared with before.  I am more than happy to wear a mask on a train or bus or if I feel I am in a crowded place.  I am happy to do that because I am an adult and I can take personal responsibility for that.  At this stage we should not be turning around to say we should reintroduce mandatory mask-wearing in certain settings etc.  We are past that stage of the pandemic, to be frank.  We can see what is happening in Italy and Germany, where it is mandatory to wear the highest grade of mask, yet case numbers are still going the same way they are here.  There is no definitive proof that masks are a great help, although it is fair to say they are a mitigation measure.  When case numbers go up, it may be the case that we should be seen to do something so the idea is that we should start wearing masks again as a result.  I have seen it here in the Houses of the Oireachtas over the past two weeks.  It is a level of performance and a case of being seen to do something rather than listening to the science.  We have listened to and trusted science for the past two and a half years.  We do not have the CMO, NPHET or anybody else at a scientific level saying we should reintroduce mandatory mask-wearing.  That is my view.  It is not about being anti-mask but we should have that debate.  We are now at a different stage of the debate and I trust in the personal responsibility of people.  I will wear a mask in places I do not feel comfortable or where there are too many people.  That is no problem but let us leave it to the personal responsibility of people.  That is my view because we are at a different stage of the pandemic than before.<\/p> <p>It took Vladimir Putin and war on the European Continent to end Covid-19 because for the past three months nobody has been talking about it in the media.  I have said for the past two years that the media hyped up anxiety and tensions and we can see people are much more relaxed and at ease now.

Simple operations and everyday procedures have been cancelled.  It is really not acceptable.  It is going to have to be looked at again.  Many people wear masks in certain circumstances, but I think a clear message needs to be sent out that Covid has not gone away.  Perhaps we are failing to get that message out.  Some people are being very blas&eacute; and think that because they have had Covid, they will not get it again.  We all know that is misinformation and people can get Covid again.  While I do not believe it should be compulsory, I believe people should be advised to wear a mask in certain circumstances, for example, if they are going indoors or into a crowd.  I am aware the Government is doing something in that regard.  We are all adults, and need to take personal responsibility.

I would like to start by echoing the sentiments of Senator Murphy.  This has been a brutal time.  Thousands of people living in Ireland have died and many thousands more have been very sick.  It has been the most difficult of times.  Relative to most other countries in the world, Ireland has done well in protecting people and keeping them safe.  The credit for that goes to the national effort.  It is not about Government or all of us in the Oireachtas.  Obviously, all of us here have a role to play, but what has characterised Ireland's response to Covid is solidarity and a national effort, where people have stepped up, taken care of each other, looked after each other and kept each other safe throughout the country.  When we look back on it in years to come, it is something Ireland will rightly be proud of, while obviously being cognisant of the horrific toll it has taken on life, health and so many aspects of our country.<\/p> <p>The advice at the moment is to get vaccinated or boosted, to wear a mask in the appropriate settings, and to stay at home if you are symptomatic.  It is very important we continue to get that message out.  I acknowledge the comments from several colleagues who have asked that we push further on communications.  We can, and we are doing so.  We have been communicating the whole time, but as one Senator pointed out, the war in Ukraine has dominated news coverage for very understandable reasons.  It has been quite difficult to get the same level of messaging out there, but we will continue and redouble our efforts to do that.  We have to reach the 700,000 people who are clearly supportive of vaccines and are protected by them, who have had their two doses and have protected their country, friends and families in doing so, and tell them it is equally important they get their third dose.  At the same time, I received advice from the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, late last night on a second booster for those aged 65 and over and the immunocompromised.  There is more subtlety and nuance to it, but that is the main message.  In its letter to me, NIAC emphasised how important it is for people to get the booster and for pregnant women to get the vaccine.<\/p> <p>There has been a lot of very useful talk and contributions made on the future and what we are doing to prepare for the future.  There are multiple things going on at the moment.  The first is the day-to-day surveillance of the epidemiological situation.  That is being led by the Department and the Chief Medical Officer and his team.  They are pulling in experts as required.  I assure Senators there is an ongoing daily surveillance of what is happening in Ireland and around the world, and what is happening in our hospitals, nursing homes, communities and so forth.  I am getting ongoing advice.  As I said earlier, we need to publish that advice.  Some of it has been put up online in recent days.  The advice is coming in regularly.  Absolutely, Members of the Oireachtas and members of the public and the media have a right to see it.  We will ensure it is made available.<\/p> <p>The second thing that is happening, as colleagues will be aware, is that Professor Brady is leading a piece of work at the moment that is looking back at Ireland's performance in Covid, including lessons learned, what we did well and what we did not do so well, and decisions we got right and decisions we did not get right, with a view to informing the future of public health and what we can learn from that.  It is a very important piece of work.  I am expecting a report from that group in the summer.<\/p> <p>The third thing that is happening is that I am establishing a new Covid advisory group.  There is a team looking at the day-to-day epidemiology and another team looking backwards to review what went well and did not go well and what we can learn.  The advisory group will look at the medium to long term in respect of Covid.  It will focus on issues such as technologies we should be deploying, the advances made in testing and tracing, ventilation, diagnosis and treatment, and advances made in the deployment of resources nationally to help fight Covid.  Obviously, we do not want to see another variant of concern but we have to plan on the basis that one could emerge.  I am putting together an expert multidisciplinary group to look at that.  I have spoken to many members over the past week or so who have agreed to take part in it.  We will be announcing more details on the group shortly.<\/p> <p>Finally, research is ongoing.  I have the greatest of respect for Senator Buttimer but I am afraid I will have to disagree with him on this issue.  It is essential that we have world-class research teams looking at future pandemic preparedness.  It is something many Asian countries did when it came to SARS.  They learnt from the SARS outbreak and invested a lot of money in looking to the future.  They determined that if another pandemic were to arrive, they would be prepared.  Dr. Holohan is going to be leading a lot of that thinking and research in Trinity College Dublin.  There will be a broad collaboration across academic institutions and the healthcare system.  There will be links with the WHO, Europe and the HERA Institute, which is looking at the pandemic.  It is essential we undertake world-class research and have teams of researchers who are going to ensure Ireland is as prepared as we possibly can be in the years to come for a future pandemic.  There is a lot of work going on in terms of the current situation, what has happened, the medium term and the long term.<\/p> <p>This debate was originally supposed to be on mask wearing, so I will finish on that issue, because various people have raised it.  The advice is very clear that masks still have an important role to play.  People on public transport should be wearing masks.  It is particularly important to wear a mask in crowded indoor settings.  It is essential that visitors to nursing homes or healthcare settings also wear masks.  That advice is the same.  The question is whether we want to have it on a regulatory basis and whether we want to be fining people and potentially arresting them for non-compliance.  My view and that of the Government and, indeed, the advice of public health is that we do not.  We are transitioning from an emergency phase of Covid to a living with Covid phase.  It is fair to say we do not have the level of compliance, for example, on public transport, that we would like.  We need to do more and we will continue to communicate that.  Obviously, we all have a role in that.  Notwithstanding some variant of concern that may arise, going forward, we want to operate on the basis of responsibility, personal choice and solidarity, which I think has worked very well in Ireland right through the pandemic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#AA00300","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":124,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his contribution and wish him well.

The Government yesterday approved my Department's request to seek the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas to opt in to this European Commission proposal.  The Minister of State, Deputy Browne, also yesterday presented the motion to the D&aacute;il, which was approved.  The proposal seeks to establish a collaboration platform to facilitate exchanges and co-operation within the joint investigation team framework.  Joint investigation teams have proven to be one of the most successful tools for cross-border investigations and prosecutions, so I am delighted to have the opportunity to present this motion to this House today.<\/p><p>By way of background, joint investigation teams, JITs, are set up by two or more states for the purpose of specific criminal investigations with a cross-border impact and for a limited period of time.  This framework allows the competent judicial and law enforcement authorities involved to organise and co-ordinate their actions jointly and to investigate efficiently, even in very complex cases such as organised crime activities. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na currently participates in JITs and supports this initiative.<\/p><p>Although JITs have proven to be one of the most successful tools for cross-border investigations and prosecutions in the EU, practice shows that they have been facing several technical difficulties preventing them from gaining the highest possible efficiency.  The JITs collaboration platform proposed in this regulation aims to solve these problems and deliver the technical support that has been missing thus far.<\/p><p>The proposal will establish a highly secure collaboration platform, provide technological support for participants and ensure that information and evidence can be shared more effectively and safely.  The main objective of the proposal is to provide technological support to those involved in JITs to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their cross-border investigations and prosecutions.  To meet these objectives and to tackle the underlying difficulties, a dedicated IT platform is proposed.  The platform will be accessible to all actors involved in JIT proceedings, including specific member states' representatives, representatives of third countries invited to co-operate in the context of a given investigation team, and the competent European Union bodies, offices and agencies such as Eurojust, Europol and the European Public Prosecutor's Office. The proposed collaboration platform will solve the technical problems and provide the technical support that has been missing from joint investigations to date.<\/p><p>The regulation itself is more technical than legal in nature and applies to the processing of information, including personal data, within the context of a JIT.  That includes the exchange and storage of operational information and evidence as well as non-operational information.  This regulation applies to the operational and post-operational phases of a JIT, starting from the moment the relevant joint investigation agreement is signed by its members. This regulation does not amend or otherwise affect the existing legal provisions on the establishment, conduct or evaluation of JITs.<\/p><p>The legal basis for setting up a JIT is Article 13 of the European Union Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, and a Council framework decision of 13 June 2002 on JITs.<\/p><p>The Criminal Justice (Joint Investigation Teams) Act 2004 provides for the measures necessary to give effect to European Council decision on JITs and provides for the terms under which the teams can be established.  The Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act 2019 made further provisions in this regard to better facilitate the participation of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in JITs.<\/p><p>To provide broader context, this proposal is one of a package of measures announced by the Commission on the digitalisation of justice in the EU as part of a larger initiative to enable the secure electronic communication and exchange of information and documents between courts, national authorities, and justice and home affairs agencies.  This is a stand-alone proposal to the other measures in the digitalisation pack.  Ireland intends to opt in at a later date to other such proposals when the preparatory work is undertaken.<\/p><p>For member states, no technical costs are considered because the platform will be developed and hosted by the EU centrally and accessed remotely using a browser-based system.  There will be a one-off EU development cost incurred centrally of around &euro;10 million.  There will also be an EU centrally recurring cost for technical matters, maintenance and operation of the platform of approximately &euro;3 million per year.  For member states, the platform will not require any adaptions of the national technical infrastructure and access will be web-based, resulting in minimal costs.  It will simply require a PC with a browser and an authorised account which will include relevant security features.<\/p><p>The JIT framework has been pivotal in recent years to tackling serious, organised and transnational crime.  Ireland currently participates in JITs and we certainly see the value in continuing to do so and in supporting this proposal.<\/p><p>By way of an example, following the discovery of 39 individuals in Essex in the United Kingdom in October 2019, the UK, Irish, Belgian and French authorities carried out initial actions and subsequently conducted investigations and searches in regard to these tragic events, which led to the formation of a JIT.  The effective liaison by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the other participating forces in this JIT, with colleagues in the PSNI and various other police agencies, meant a number of suspects were apprehended and sentenced to significant periods of detention following conviction by various courts in several jurisdictions.<\/p><p>This is a practical example of a JIT in action.  The experience gained in respect of multijurisdictional operations and the available support from various European statutory agencies such as Eurojust and Europol cannot be underestimated from an operational and learning perspective and will be built on and utilised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>Indeed only on Monday, the EU announced that it is setting up a JIT with Ukraine to collect evidence and investigate war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine.  In a statement following a phone call with President Zelenskyy regarding the atrocities in Bucha, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe EU is ready to reinforce this effort by sending investigation teams on the ground to support the Ukrainian Prosecution Services.  Eurojust and Europol are ready to assist. <\/blockquote> <p><!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Helen McEntee:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2394\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->President von der Leyen went on to state:<\/p><blockquote>\tA global response is necessary.

The current proposal will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of such investigations.  Therefore, the Government has no hesitation in commending to the House the motion that we opt in to this proposal.  The Office of the Attorney General has advised that opting in to the proposed decision does not create any constitutional or legal issues for the State.  Doing so now under the Article 3 opt-in will ensure we are at the table with our European partners and involved fully in the detailed discussions on the negotiation of the regulation.  It will also indicate our continuing commitment to tackling serious cross-border and transnational crime.<br\/><br\/>I commend the motion to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#JJ00400","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":202,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  The motion is an extremely important one.  Joint investigation teams are extremely important and have been recommended and proposed for some time.  I have spent several years on the Joint Committee on Justice.  As part of that brief, I represented the justice committee on the Europol scrutiny committee.  The latter committee is the first time there was political oversight of Europol.  It comprises two representatives from each of the 27 member states, along with representatives of the European Parliament.  It was extremely important because although the judicial system has oversight in this country, Europol did not have any political oversight.  In my time on that committee I learned a significant amount about the importance of co-operation and working together to set up joint understandings.  That is what is needed because, as the Minister and everyone else present are aware, criminals do not recognise borders and nor does crime.  Unfortunately, there is a well-established criminal network operating throughout Europe.  This proposal is another very important incremental step in addressing, dealing with, catching up with and, it is to be hoped, getting ahead of international organised crime.<\/p> <p>I am glad there is no opposition to the proposal from the Minister.  I was Fine Gael Seanad spokesperson on justice for nine years.  Much of the legislation is technical but extremely important.  Although it may be technical, what it is trying to achieve is fundamental.  The collaboration between agencies and the establishment of the joint committees are key to facing down the criminal elements that, unfortunately, operate not just within Europe but internationally throughout the world.  The more understandings and structures we have, the more determined we will be.  The more we work together, the more likely it is that we can address and reduce - we will never eliminate it - international organised crime to such a degree that society and the world can live in harmony in a way that is safe.  As a small country, we can lead the way in that regard.<\/p> <p>In my time in Europol and working within its structures, I and the other Irish representative from the justice committee, along with our MEPs who were on the Europol scrutiny committee, punched above our weight in ensuring that Europol was held accountable and did its job in a very focused way.  I commend the motion to the House.  I hope it will pass unanimously, as I think it will.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#KK00200","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her comprehensive opening statement on the motion regarding proposed approval of a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council in respect of joint investigation teams.  Of course, such teams have been around for quite a while.  The regulation, in essence, proposes allowing them to set up a collaboration platform.  The platform will be a highly secure online collaboration tool aimed at facilitating exchanges and co-operation within JITs through the duration to provide them with technological support to increase their efficiency and effectiveness in cross-border investigations and prosecutions.  It will ensure those involved in JITs can more easily share information and the evidence collected in the course of their activities safely and securely with each other.<\/p> <p>The Minister gave a concrete example of the importance of this, referring to the awful tragedy in Essex involving the discovery of 39 individuals.  That investigation involved the jurisdictions of the United Kingdom, Ireland, Belgium and France.  They were all able to work together in that case but it is clear the Minister wants them to be able to do so in the most efficient way possible, with access to each other's information and shared data.  That is really what the motion is doing.  It is not setting up investigation teams; it is just allowing them to work much more efficiently than they did previously.<\/p> <p>Clearly, if this involves Ukraine, it is not just for EU members.  The platform will be run and administered by the EU but it is not exclusive to EU countries.  Based on my understanding of the Minister's remarks, other countries that are involved in the context of these criminal gangs or organised crime will be able to participate in this process.  What is happening in Ukraine is horrific.  Every day, the news is worse and worse.  We should be doing anything and everything we can as a European Union to help the Ukrainians pursue every single one of the perpetrators of these crimes.  That is what we are doing through this motion.  I will not delay the House.  It is a very positive motion.  I hope the other Senators who are present will speak in the same vein and light.<\/p> <p>It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge for the first time the presence of Senator Clonan, our newest Senator.  He is very welcome.  It may be the first time he has been in the Chamber with this particular Minister but I am sure it will not be the last.  He is very welcome.  I hope he will be as supportive of the legislation as everybody who has spoken so far has been.  It is a positive thing.<\/p> <p>The Bill is quite technical.  As Senator Conway outlined, it is much more about the IT backup to the joint investigations teams.   The teams have already been doing their work.  The motion aims to make it easier for them to work together and faster to take those involved in organised crime and criminality generally out of the loop and the system, and to protect the rest of us.  I commend the motion on my behalf and that of Fianna F&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#KK00300","speaker":"1696"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":204,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  I apologise for missing her opening contribution.  I was at a private briefing of the foreign affairs committee.  Oireachtas Members have spoken often on the challenges faced by society here in Ireland, South and North, and across the EU as criminal organisations develop organisationally and technologically in pursuit of their criminal behaviour across EU borders.  Unfortunately, technological know-how and skills are not solely the preserve of law-abiding people.<\/p> <p>The objectives of this proposal are primarily twofold - the recognition of the importance of setting up joint investigation teams for specific criminal investigations and for a limited period of time, and the upgrading of the IT system across the EU to support the JITs in their investigations.  Where appropriate, and shaped to meet the specific nature of the criminal investigation, JITs have the capacity to create no-go zones for criminals across the land and sea borders of the EU.  In those circumstances, it will blend fluently the exchange of information and documents between courts, national authorities and justice and home affairs agencies.  The motion allows for two or more member states of the EU to collaborate and, where legally permissible, non-EU states as well.<\/p> <p>JITs are one of the most successful tools for cross-border investigations and prosecutions in the European Union.  They enable direct co-operation and communication between judicial and law enforcement authorities in various states to organise their actions and investigations to efficiently investigate cross-border cases.  However, they have been facing several difficulties, particularly on the technological front.  These difficulties are IT-related in the electronic exchange of information and evidence, including large files, secure electronic communication with other JIT members and bodies such as Eurojust, Europol and the anti-fraud office, as well as the joint daily management of JITs.  On examination of the effectiveness of the JITs by a relevant authority, it was proposed they be supported by a dedicated IT platform.  The IT platform will enable its members to securely communicate among themselves.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The platform would be available to all JIT members, member states' representatives, third country representatives and the Union's competent bodies in the security field.  The platform would be of a voluntary nature and complementary to other security measures employed by the relevant state.  It would be available in all EU languages and accessible through computers and mobile devices.<\/p><p>The platform would have two distinctive elements - a centralised information system and a communication software.  Particular attention should be given to the platform's access rights.  Granting access to information stored in the platform would be the strict preserve of the JIT space administrators from the JIT participating states.  At least, that is how it should be.  Given the highly sensitive nature of the information exchanged, it is essential that the safeguards are impenetrable and in keeping with strong cyber security standards.  Although it is a complex and complicated process, the platform's success will also depend on it being as simple to access as possible.<\/p><p>It is also important to acknowledge that the platform proposal, in all its dimensions, is compatible with fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the European Convention on Human Rights and the other human rights obligations under international law.  It is my belief that the proposal is credible in its intent and, if well managed, it should assist the people of Ireland and the rest of the EU to live safer lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#KK00400","speaker":"1688","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I welcome Senator Clonan and invite him to speak if he wishes.

I will be brief.  I thank the Minister for the clear opening statement.  My understanding is that, notwithstanding events in Ukraine, the greatest threat to the security of the State is the proliferation of organised crime gangs and the terrorist networks with which they operate hand-in-hand.

I look forward to working with him in this term and, it is hoped, in the coming years.<\/p> <p>I thank the Senators for facilitating the motion so quickly.  Everybody has alluded to the fact that crime knows no borders, and the only way we can tackle crime nowadays is by working collaboratively.  The joint investigation teams have proven to be one of the most successful methods of bringing forward investigations and prosecutions.  Tools such as the collaborative platform proposed in this regulation will continue to support that, but also improve the mechanism and way in which that is done.  As the Senator pointed out, this proposal is about highlighting the importance, significance and effectiveness of the teams to date, but also strengthening that and ensuring that the way in which we are sharing information is safe.  I assure all Senators that the new security platform aims to mitigate the risks that potentially exist for the security of individual data.  There will be strong mechanisms and measures in place.<\/p> <p>I thank Senators for their support on this and commend the motion to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#LL00400","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649235000,"counter":209,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649235000,"counter":210,"content":"<p>Cuireadh an Seanad ar fionra&iacute; ar 3.53 p.m. agus cuireadh t&uacute;s leis ar&iacute;s ar 4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\nSitting suspended at 3.53 p.m. and resumed at 4.30 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
